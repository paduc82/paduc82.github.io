    <title>Cannot connect Xperia Z3 to PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codenamee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect Xperia Z3 to PC</h2>
                    <p>I've been experiencing a very weird phenomenon the last couple of days. Whenever I connect my Xperia Z3 to my PC, it won't show it connects at all and the device manager will show the small yellow sign right next to the D6603 device. I cannot install the
 drivers nor can I update them. More specifically, it shows this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic driver installation upon connection always gets stuck until it pretty much ends on its own and fails. I use the phone options to connect as MTP and I attempt to reinstall the drivers as it is shown in the Device manager, but it just shows me
 this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A service installation section in this INF is invalid."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which promptly transforms my device to "Unknown device" in the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using the Developer options on my phone, I turned on the USB debugging option which does help with the connection a bit (it can charge, it recognizes it as an MTP device when I choose so), but still can't install the drivers nor can I see my device in
 "This PC" to transfer data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting the device and USB ports, searched similar cases for other people in the registry to delete UpperFilters and LowerFilters values, but none of the mentioned ones ever match my own (none of the mentioned directories have those
 values in my registry). I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers and Xperia companion and I even did a couple of system restores to a point prior to me finding this problem. Yet none of these methods have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before someone actually suggests that, yes, I have checked suggested actions on both Microsoft and Sony websites and yes, I have restarted both devices multiple times and yes, my USB cable is fully functional other than this case (plus this problem persists
 with other USB cables).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm kind of desperate at this point.</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the first one, I have also tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers (as it has been mentioned in my post). I haven't tried booting with the "Last known good configuration" option, but I can't find it anywhere in the Advanced startup options. I tried

            <p>No, I don't get an error message on-screen upon connecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configurations in terms of my phone, no. On the PC, I had a recent Windows update (there was a second one a few days later). It's probably of interest to note that the restart for the updates happened mid-installation of the drivers when my phone was connected
 (they were installed before, but it occasionally reinstalls them after an update).</p>

            <p>No problem, I understand.&nbsp; My use is personal so I use the freebie version.&nbsp; But for the remote desktop, it's not too difficult, just takes several steps to setup the first time, although it has a little caveat that your internet provider could change your
 external IP address and you wouldn't be able to connect until you find out what the new one is.&nbsp; That's probably rare.&nbsp; Even on my residential connection, Cox Cable here almost never changes my IP address.&nbsp; And with most business Internet accounts, the provider
 flat out agrees not to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the process.&nbsp; It varies based on your router (I'm using a cheap home Linksys router, but it's very similar).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First, give the computer you're connecting to (the office PC) a static IP address.<br />
</strong><a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-win7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This page explains how in probably more detail than you would want :)</a><br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Tell your router to forward the incoming remote desktop connections to that internal IP.</strong><br />
Login to your router settings and look for Port Forwarding or Port Range Forwarding.&nbsp; It's usually easy to spot.&nbsp;Mine is below, and you can see it incoming 3389 connections (you can specify a range but for RDP you only need one, so my range is just that one
 port) and forwards them to my .104 internal address.&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/380c381d-5a7e-45ca-96c6-52ef796fdfcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/380c381d-5a7e-45ca-96c6-52ef796fdfcd" /><br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Find out what your office's external IP address is.<br />
</strong>You can dig around in your router's settings, or just <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=what's+my+ip+address&amp;src=IE-TopResult&amp;FORM=IE11TR&amp;conversationid=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ask Bing "what is my IP address?"</a>&nbsp;from your office computer.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; Later when you want to connect to your office computer, you'll use the external IP address of your office's internet connection, and the router will forward that request over to the computer you want to reach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be able to connect to more than one PC, you can set another computer to use a different port number instead of 3389 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">official Microsoft instructions here</a>) and do the same
 steps to forward 3390 to the other computer.&nbsp; Later when you want to connect to the other computer, type your IP address as IP:Port, such as 11.11.11.11:3390 and it will connect to that other computer.</p>

    <title>Automatic Repair Blue Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hann_1818  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Repair Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>So, recently the blue screen error (Automatics Repair) has shown up. I've looked at many YouTube videos and searched up for similar problems on this website, but nothing currently works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Shutting down</strong>&nbsp;just loads me back to the blue automatic repair screen when the power button was pressed</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>ADVANCED OPTIONS</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Continue (Exit and continue to Windows 10)</strong> just loads into the automatic repair screen</p>
<p>- <strong>Turn off your PC&nbsp;</strong>just loads me back into the blue automatic repair screen when the power button was pressed</p>
<p>- <strong>Using a device</strong>, clicking all options loads me back into the automatic repair screen (USB Floppy/CD, USB Hard Drive, Fake Legacy Option, Realtek Family Controller, and another Realtek Family Controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">TROUBLESHOOT</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Reset this PC (Keep my files)</strong> loads for a little then says, "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made.". Leading me to press cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>-</strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RECOVERY MANAGER (</span>In troubleshoot)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>!Help (System Recovery, backing up files first, auto selection)</strong>, loads slowly up to 100%, but when at 100% it would still appear as if files were loading, not allowing me to click next.</p>
<p>- <strong>Maintenance</strong> <strong>(Run Computer Checkup)</strong>, typing is required in all options and I did not try them, but I tried the command prompt in the troubleshoot folder.</p>
<p>- <strong>Precautions (File Backup, auto selection)</strong>, would load up to 100% but like the System recovery, it would be at 100% with the next button not activated, forcing me to cancel once again.</p>
<p>-<strong> Support</strong>, here I am! :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted and tried the other option, shutting down, its would go back to the automatic repair screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-</strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ADVANCED OPTIONS
</span>(In troubleshoot)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>System&nbsp;</strong><strong>Restore</strong>, I do not have a "restore point", so it won't work.</p>
<p>- <strong>Startup&nbsp;</strong><strong>Repair</strong>, would go to the black loading screen, which eventually loads to a blue Startup Repair screen, notifying me that it couldn't repair my PC.-
<strong>Go back to the previous version</strong>, says that they ran into a problem and won't be able to take me back to the previous version of Windows, telling me to reset my PC.</p>
<p>- <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, tried a whole bunch of commands from youtube, and on this website. Did everything with turning it off after and nothing happened. The blue screen appears.</p>
<p>- <strong>System Image Recovery</strong>, It says that Windows cannot find a system image on this computer. Don't know what to do with that.</p>
<p>- <strong>UEFI Firmware Settings</strong>, tells me to restart. When Restart was clicked, it would just load into a blue startup menu in front of a black screen. I have no clue which F's to press, so I just press enter to continue the startup. This brings
 me back to the blue automatic repair screen.</p>
<p>- <strong>Startup Settings</strong>, when I pressed Restart, it would just load into a set of F functions, but I press enter; back into the automatic repair screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think I should do?</p>
<p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>Should I just press restart and have everything deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows XP Mode</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I have downloaded the Windows XP Mode program and tried to install it on the computer.&nbsp; The install goes well until the end, then it says that it is unable to install the program.&nbsp; I tried twice but got the same message.&nbsp;
 I ran the install after closing all programs except Firefox which I had to keep open to run the download as that is where the download was.&nbsp; All help appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>To install XP Mode in Windows 7 Pro, you need to also install Windows Virtual PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the age of Windows 7 and XP Mode, the download links in most of the online XP Mode installation guides are no longer valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the Windows Virtual PC here, being sure to select 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate for your installation of Windows 7 Pro:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For completeness, the download for XP Mode is here (you almost certainly do NOT want the "N" version):&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do NOT need to keep Firefox open.&nbsp; In fact, unlike Internet Explorer, Firefox should just save downloaded files and not ask if you want to "run" the files as they are downloaded.&nbsp; If you are not sure where Firefox saves the files it downloads, click
 the menu icon (the 3 horizontal bars at the top right corner of the Firefox window) and select Library &gt; Downloads &gt; Show Downloads Folder.&nbsp; This will open a Windows Explorer window showing the folder where your downloads are saved.&nbsp; You can now close Firefox
 (although leaving it open won't harm the installation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have downloaded both installation files, follow the directions here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that connecting XP Mode to the Internet is just as dangerous as connect a non-virtual installation of Windows XP to the Internet.&nbsp; Neither will update beyond the security patches available as of April 8, 2014,&nbsp; Most, if not all, current antivirus programs
 will not run on XP.</p>

<p>About 4 or 5 years ago, I downloaded the same files 4 times for a total of 25 files that are connect to running Windows XP Mode, duplicates for sure.&nbsp; I am thinking that I need to delete these files and start fresh with the downloads you gave me.&nbsp; Problem
 that comes up often, which is driving me crazy.&nbsp; Don't know if you can help me with this problem.&nbsp; I need administration permission to delete these files.&nbsp; If you can, how do I set the computer so that I have administration privileges?&nbsp; I don't remember when
 I installed Windows 7 of coming across anything asking if I wanted the administration privileges or asking for a password.&nbsp; This part of any of the OS's has cost me years of data on my WinXP computer because I could not get any info that helped me find a password,
 if I put one in when I installed the OS.&nbsp; Could not do a repair of the OS because I didn't have a password. &nbsp; And thanks for the info and instructions previously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS&nbsp; Here we go again.&nbsp; Tried to delete the files I was talking about.&nbsp; Guess what, Have to have administration privileges.&nbsp; Found a message on how to get those privileges.&nbsp; If it's not one thing it's another.&nbsp; After following the directions, when the computer
 was doing the change, message came up saying that it couldn't do some changes because the files were being used.&nbsp; I closed everything that was open except what I was working with at the time.&nbsp; Still would not make the changes needed to delete the files, for
 the same reason. &nbsp; </p>

<p>What are the files you're trying to delete?&nbsp; If they are just copies of the installer files for XP Mode and the Virtual Machine, you need not delete them.&nbsp; A more important question is do you have XP Mode and the Windows Virtual PC installed or not?&nbsp; Click
 Start and then All Programs.&nbsp; Scroll to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; Do you have any of these entries:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a12f6c3-f1d5-489a-b83c-b4627e840ea1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a12f6c3-f1d5-489a-b83c-b4627e840ea1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the complete message you get when you try to delete the files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type user accounts in the Search box, and press Enter.&nbsp; Under your user name, does it say "Administrator" or "Standard user"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are a "Standard user" please do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a Command Prompt (click Start, type cmd in the Search box, press Enter)</p>
<p>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other members of this group OTHER THAN "Administrator"?</p>
<p>If "Administrator" is the only member of the administrators group, type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user adminstrator</p>

<p><em>* Merged *</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To the gentleman who has been helping me install Windows XP Mode.&nbsp; You had ask me why I was trying to delete the old files from Windows XP Mode &amp; Windows Virtual PC.&nbsp; You had stated in one of your replies that the download links in most of the online XP
 Mode installation guides are no longer valid.&nbsp; It was 2009 &amp; 2010 when I downloaded the programs.&nbsp; So with your statement, I figured I need to delete the old files.&nbsp; Yes I had downloaded the programs twice and they are on different HDD's&nbsp; Each time I was unable
 to get XP Mode to work.&nbsp; I gave up on trying.&nbsp; Now I really need to install and have working Windows XP Mode.&nbsp; The problem I have now with trying to delete the old files is that I keep getting a message saying that I need permission from Trusted Installer
 to be able to delete the files.&nbsp; It's a never ending problem.&nbsp; I get one thing fixed then another one comes up.&nbsp; Get that one fixed and another one comes up.&nbsp; Again another problem comes up and here I am with no solution.&nbsp; Once again I need to ask for your
 help with this ongoing problem.&nbsp; Many thanks for the help.</p>

<p>As I wrote before, if the files in question are just the installer files you download, you don't need to delete them other than to reclaim the space on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not usual for downloaded files to have TrustedInstaller as the "owner" of the files.&nbsp; In general, you should be wary of deleting files that belong to TrustedInstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are certain that these files are not needed, you can "Take Ownership" of them and delete them by following "Option Two" (or "Options Three") here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/take-ownership-of-file.67717/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.vistax64.com/threads/take-ownership-of-file.67717/</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Read the Information, Note, Tip, and Warning at the top of the page before you do anything.&nbsp; Although written for Vista, the instructions will work for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; The "code" used in the example for Step 4 in Option Two, is confusing because the HTML for the page is messed up.&nbsp; The example should look like this:</p>

<h2>            All installed Certificates are broken&#59; cannot update Windows or validate Genuine Advantage</h2>
                    <p>This is a bit complicated and I've been working on it for a while (really, really don't want to reset the installation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly after recovering from a BSOD, I noticed my computer was working strangely.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
<p>-Cannot update Windows.</p>
<p>-Cannot install Windows software, including the Windows Update Readiness Tool and .NET 4.</p>
<p>-Windows claims it is "not genuine." Attempting to resolve the issue with the Windows Activation Update gives an error during installation: 0x800B0100. This is the same error I get when I tried to update.</p>
<p>-Viewing the certificate for these programs claims that "No signature was present in the subject."</p>
<p>-Cannot load general information on any certificate (using the Certificate Manager). Trying gives the error "An internal error occurred when processing this certificate." The certificate path is also blank. Some details are still available.</p>
<p>-I've tried running sfc /scannow. It finds corrupted files but can't repair them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Messages and Logs:</b></p>

            <p>Looking at your CBS.log data, SFC actually found nothing to do - however, there are a large number of errors in the log (8754 instances of the word 'failed'), most associated with either 0x800f0805 or 0x80070490 errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've been able to find out, it looks as if a repair install is going to be the only option - judging from your BIOS date and the fact that you're using an OEM_SLP Key, you won't have a Win7 disk with SP1 embedded, and you'll need t to be able to
 do the repair install.</p>
<p>Download the SP1 Refresh ISO for your chosen language and edition from the links on these pages...</p>

 account? And will others (namely my two children) still be able to play them as well? This possibly sounds like a stupid question - i know this was never an issue on the 360, but I'm still a bit of a novice with Gold at Home on Xbox One. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any new content you purchase on the Xbox One console will be available for all to play as well. &nbsp;This is, of course, so long as the new tag is set as Home on the console or, if not, if your gamertag is signed in at the same time.</p>

            Look dude...My Laptop does not have the ability to produce a Mobile Hotspot. The option is NOT there. Plain and simple. If there were an aption here to post a screen shot I would do so. Although it would only show the exact same thing I'm saying. That
 there is NO option for Mobile Hotspot! I'm walking around with my phone right now using up data. So Don't worry about weather or not I'm Mobile. My question resides on my hard wired, ethernet internet accessed laptop.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>consider following picture as an lecacy desktop app ( im not sure if i call it legacy is correct or not ),&nbsp; Desktop UI for managing files and other things aka explorer.exe which integrated with control panel as well )</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/570611ae-7e4f-4a8b-8886-ea6d50501493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/570611ae-7e4f-4a8b-8886-ea6d50501493" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>also consider &nbsp;following picture as a store app ( windows 10 setiiings )</p>
<p>and i marked the option to changing background color</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08fb7900-0c89-4566-822a-9770821e137d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08fb7900-0c89-4566-822a-9770821e137d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>so my question is</p>
<p>"is there any way to change background color of all legacy desktop app like 'this computer' and control panel ans also default dialog based application all togather with a simple button like 'default color app mode' or not?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>also im aware of high contrast feature that let you do such a thing but that is not cool way to do this</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Trouble installing software under administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble installing software under administrator account</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to install TurboTax but it is not letting me. It tells me that basically I don't have rights to install the software. I went to TurboTax' site and it said the following:</p>
Windows 7 or Vista
<ol>
<li>On the Windows taskbar, click <strong>Start</strong>, then <strong>All Programs</strong>, then
<strong>Accessories</strong>, and then <strong>Run</strong>. </li><li>On the Run window, type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.
</li><li>On the Local Group Policy window, navigate to <strong>Local Computer Policy</strong>, then
<strong>Computer Configuration</strong>, then <strong>Administrative Templates</strong>, then
<strong>Windows Components</strong>, and then<strong> Windows Installer</strong>.
</li><li>Double-click <strong>Prohibit non-administrators from </strong><span>applying</span><strong> vendor signed updates</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Disabled</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>When I try to do this, it won't run because it says it can't find the file. Can I do this manually?</p>

<p><span><span>Hello vanfel,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is the exact error message you get when trying to install the Turbo Tax?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you have this issue only when trying to install Turbo Tax or all the Softwares?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The above steps that you have followed from the Turbo Tax website are the computers that are on a domain and are set with Administrator restrictions
 to install programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are logged in as a Administrator on your computer, I suggest that you run Turbo Tax installation file and Run as Administrator:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Go to the location where you have the Turbo tax installation file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on the File and select the option ‘Run as Administrator’.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, can you help me confirm if the issue is no one can hear you when you are using Skype or Skype for Business? And who are you unable to hear? Skype users or Skype for Business users?</span></p>

    <title>When I lock the laptop it stops all the calculations in background - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hamidrezamirkhani  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I lock the laptop it stops all the calculations in background</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange problem with my Win 10 Pro and newly purchased Dell Inspiron. When the screen is locked - either manually or auto - all the calculations I have in the background go to sleep mode, i.e. the laptop goes to a semi-sleep mode, just waiting for
 any mouse or keyboard command to wake up. Once I login again, all programs - and my computing program - will resume to work again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had this problem on my other two laptops as I have developed a program that I need it to run in the background even if I lock the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already changed the power plans several times to ensure that it does not go sleep mode, but I am frustrated with this locking screen issue. Please advise how I can resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            There can be several causes but to start with, you can try following. Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<p>Thanks for your advice, it seems that none of them would solve the problem and it is part of hidden settings. I found a solution that seems to solve the issue from&nbsp;<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1019043/windows-10-sleeps-before-set-time/1023836#1023836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>
 &nbsp; (was referred from <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1153162/how-do-i-stop-windows-10-going-to-sleep-after-locking-with-winl-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow windows 10 has a lot of such hidden settings in the registry, impacting the performance significantly. Here is one of them that is not shown by default, but it has to be enabled from the registry. Hope Microsoft can resolve these issues in the next
 updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still monitoring my laptop, but it seems that it works well now.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Bluetooth problems Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasrjones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth problems Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Since updating the Bluetooth drivers automatically earlier this month, my PC (Packard Bell EasyNote TE) can't seem to find Bluetooth devices I know are working. The problem has only started since the drivers were updated, but there is no option to roll
 back the drivers to see if this corrects the issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click though CHARMS - SETTINGS - PC SETTINGS - PC AND DEVICES - BLUETOOTH, it just gets stuck saying "Your PC is searching for and can be discovered by Bluetooth devices" and never actually finds anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooting Tool, the services.msc trick and rolling back the drivers through CONTROL PANEL - HARDWARE AND SOUND - DEVICES AND PRINTERS, and right clicking on the Bluetooth Icon.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any other suggestions would be helpful, would doing a Refresh help?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>From what you have described, it appears that the issue is caused due to the new driver update. Sometimes a new driver could be incompatible with other
 services and can cause such issues. You have mentioned that you have already tried rolling back the driver from the device properties but the issue persists. In this case, I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</font></font></font></p>

</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First, I would suggest you to check the device status of the Bluetooth adapter in the device manager. If the hardware is not functioning normally or
 if there is a driver issue, windows will report it in the device status. Refer to these steps to check the device status of the Bluetooth adapter:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you couldn’t find any error in the device manager, then I would suggest you to reinstall the Bluetooth driver and check. First, visit the computer

<p>Skyrim is riddled with bugs and glitches and the fact the 360 has only 512mb of cache memory doesnt help. I dont think its your console.I think the fact its a Besthesda game is your problem.Not saying its not an awesome game.But the persisent bugs that are
 pervasive in Fallout and Skyrim render them unplayable at times.I think they use too much ram.</p>

<p>Is it only happening in Skyrim? My brother ran into a similar issue and needed to start a new character. You're probably having the same problem.</p>

<p>Yep the game is probably the culprit. My console also randomly freezes sometimes when playing skyrim as well as playing Fallout New vegas. Although New Vegas has locked up my Xbox more. I usually wipe my system cache to fix the problem but it only works
 for a short time till it plays up again. I don't own Battlefield 4 nor played it but from what I have heard about it around the web it is also prone to freeze and crash your console. With Bethesda games just be sure to save constantly and don't have to many
 saves saved to your console as even that can cause problems.</p>

<p>I have used a lens cleaner and it helps ,but you have to do it every month or so.Now if it gets really dusty it will also cause it to happen as well,the reason is the laser reads the disc and send the information to brain of the Xbox to remember now if it
 dusty last fame segment will be displayed &nbsp;causing to stop at that point. Its causing the signal to be block and not reach the output correctly causing 1. freeze and move display,2.complete freeze of display or in many cases a black or green screen. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>^You do realize the 360 has a dvd drive and plays dvd and that the games are on dvd? I dont think disc read issues cause freezes and console crashes.Just a message telling you to clean your disc.I have Skyrim digital download that freezes my console constantly.On
 one part of the map the framerate drops to about 3 of 4 frames/second which renders the game unplayable.Fallout 3 as well.</p>

<p>Yes but the workings of the drive are different to the workings of a dvd players drive. A friend of mine used one on his console once and it completely wrecked his Xboxes dvd drive. Whether it scratched the laser lens or put the &nbsp;mechanism out of alignment
 we don't know the console no longer could play games or dvd movies. &nbsp;It is not always dust or scratches that cause problems it can be buggy game code.</p>

<h2>            Download games to my PC for transfer to Xbox</h2>
                    Download games to my PC for transfer to Xbox
<div>
<p>Well I have searched the forums and Google, and all I find are illegal ways to get xbox games. I simply want to be able to download Xbox games on my PC while at work. At home I have capped internet so I am unable to download game without using all
 of the cap since most games is more then 40Gb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when at work is there anyway to download Xbox games to my PC&nbsp; to copy it over to a USB drive, for transfer to my Xbox?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since they will still have to check to see if you have purchased the game or not when you try to play it one will think that it is not to much to ask to be able to download the game files on a pc and just install it on your xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>The only way you would be able to download your games at work would be to bring you xbox to work with you.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry no, can't be done.&nbsp; Its not going to happen in the future either for two main reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; It could potentially make it easier for hardware hackers to find away around Xbox One software security to pirate downloaded games if they could be downloaded on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The Xbox One uses a different type of hard drive formatting system for their hard drives than on a PC.&nbsp; The very reason why you have to format external hard drives for Xbox Storage is to help prevent software piracy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid the only way you'll be able to bypass your limit would be to either take your console to work, buy more of your games on disc or change your ISP.</p>

<p>While you have already the cause for the limitation to only allow direct Xbox Download, it's not as easy to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the ability of the Xbox consoles "sharing" your games to other people on the console (so your family can also play your games without you being signed in), the Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles have to inform the Live service which console has downloaded
 the game to get the appropriate license to unlock the game for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution to use your work internet for downloading, is to take your console with you to work, and hook it up to the work network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no other technical way to download and transfer games from your PC (or external storage) to your console at home.</p>

<p>Sorry you can't do that. You've two options though:</p>
<p>1. Play Xbox Play Anywhere games which can be played both on Xbox and PC with progress being synced.</p>
<p>2. Or, have a static IP, and enable few ports on your Xbox, and then stream from your PC at work. Please note that upload speed of your home PC should be very fast for this.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are two problems with that:</p>
<p>1: They also need to download a Play Anywhere title to the PC, as you can't transfer the game from one PC to the other. So malmanjako would also have to use up their data capped internet for the download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Streaming only really works inside your local home network. And if they managed to stream externally, they would also use up their internet data, and since a 1080p video stream is transmitted, this will also eat up their data capped internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please do NOT use these methods, as they don't resolve your issue of game downloads eating up your bandwith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your only option to get games without large downloads (aside from mandatory updates and DLC) would be to buy the game on physical disc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right now the only option ita downloading the game on your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing you can do, if a friend have that game installed in his console (Digital Or Physical) that you want to download, you can take a External HDD (USB 3.0 over 256 GB) and copy the game to the HDD, the connect to your console and transfer the
 game or used from the HDD.</p>

            That's not possible - if a game offers play anywhere however you get digital copies on both systems.

            Sadly, games cannot be transferred between PC and Xbox, there are differences in the filesystems and even if it could be done, would probably not run the game correctly. The only other suggestion would be to wait past you cap to download the games.

<p>Are you refering to fake calls that claim to be from Microsoft and help you?</p>
<p>YES, They are FAKE for sure.</p>
<p>We are NOT sure what they have done to your PC and what they ask you to do. If you remember them please let us know. But to do quick check go to Control Panel and Security Center and make sure everything is fine.</p>

<p>Two more places to check (the second is obviously only relevant if you're using Windows Firewall; if you're using a third-party firewall instead, see your user guide or the application's help system to find out how to manage exceptions to the firewall's
 blocking rules):</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Remote tab</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure that neither</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allow Remote Assistance invitations to be sent from this computer"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allow users to connect remotely to this computer"</p>
<p>are checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; exceptions tab</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; review the list of items under "Programs and services" and ensure that the only items that are there AND checked are application that you WANT to have the ability to pass through the Windows firewall</p>

                    I have an iMac with Parallels. Windows XP is installed in Parallels. I opened Windows the other day and it said that I need to update Avast. I did so. It then said that I needed to restart the computer. I did so, but instead of Windows opening up I get
 a blue window that states "A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:
 Check to be sure you have adequate disk space. If a driver is identified in the stop message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS
 memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select safe mode. Technical Information: *** STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005,
