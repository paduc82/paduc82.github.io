<h2>            &#42;SPOILERS&#42; Does anyone else find Skyrim easy to be evil&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Normally in RPGs, I always play as a good character that never does anything evil. E.G: In Fable 2 I played through it&nbsp;so many times always being good, the worst I could do was go neutral just to experience it differently. So far in Skyrim the only things
 I have hated doing or have not done are *SPOILERS*<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"> The Dark Brotherhood Quest where you have to kill the Wife at her Wedding (I hated doing this),&nbsp;and the Taste of Death Daedric Quest (I will not do this)</span>
 *END SPOILERS*.&nbsp;But apart from that I find it very easy to do evil deeds when asked. Such as the quest where you must sacrifice a follower at the Shrine of Boethiah. I am&nbsp;very immersed in&nbsp;the game with nearly 100 hours of&nbsp;game time; I don't really mind about
 the&nbsp;evil stuff&nbsp;as it broadens the games play time, and the&nbsp;overall playability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I the only one that thinks this or are there others who don't like being evil/finding it easier than in other games?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bit in the *SPOILERS* section needs to be highlighted.</p>

<p>I'm finding Skyrim hard in some ways because of that. There are no options. This Elder Scrolls is much darker than others. I'm a neutral sort usually. I prefer to form my own opinions and usually hate the black or white decisions games like Fable want. In
 fact I couldn't get into the first Fable because of that very issue. There are too many quests I won't do because the requirements are repulsive. I only did about half of the daedric quests in Oblivion but only 3 in Skyrim and I resent being pulled into The
 House of Horrors and unable to get out without doing what the double damned Daedra wanted me to do. It may be "only a game" but I don't have to lose who I am in it.</p>

Just so you know, during the House of Horrors, once you're sealed into the room, simply ignore Molag Bal's command to kill Tyranus. If you refuse, Tyranus eventually succumbs to Molag's command and will attack you, forcing you to kill him, but only in self-defense.</p>

<p>***Spoilers***</p>
<p>I'm probably missing out on a good bit of the game because of this. &nbsp;I play this game more chaotic good/chaotic neutral than in other games. &nbsp;I'm ok with lifting things here and there but will likely tell a Daedra to get lost if they're obvious or blatant.
 &nbsp;If it's meant to be a ruse or a trick, I'll play along....like the one with the dog or the wabbajack. &nbsp;If anyone flat out tells me to kill someone that I don't think deserves it, I won't. &nbsp;I won't really mess with the Dark Brotherhood or Thieves guilds for
 these reasons. &nbsp;Hell, I'm at a crossroads with the Blades and Paarthurnax right now and not sure how long I'll take to mull that one over.....I honestly have no idea what will happen either way.

<p>That's why I only did Azura, Meridia and Vaermina (and there I lost the skull). Yes, Wolf, i did kill Tyranus but it made me mad. Too many of the people the DB and Thieves want you to hurt are arbitrary to my mind. I'm always chaotic, that's my nature and
 I embrace it. I'm glad to know I'm not alone. I didn't look at Skyrim last night, I watched anime. I'll go back to it because I do enjoy just exploring and if I'm not concerned about spoiling a quest then it doesn't matter where I go or what I do. I read ahead
 and know about Parthurnax. If I ever get that far the Blades are going to be unhappy with me.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a shame that a lot of content in Skyrim requires you to kill fairly innocent people etc, but then in fairness there's also a lot of quests that don't, so I guess it all balances out.&nbsp;</p>

<div>True, it doesn't feel game breaking to me.&nbsp; It's obvious you can get more story if you have no moral compass in games like this but there's still a ton of stuff to do.&nbsp; Besides, I can always go back and make an evil character to do all
 the bad stuff.</div>

<p>It can be tough to be good in this game.. for sure. The character I'm playing now is a Paladin type character.. doesn't steal, doesn't kill non evil, doesn't do evil deeds.. etc. I have turned down a pretty fair number of quests. The only Daedric Quests
 I did was the one for her 'Holy Sword'&nbsp; (Dawnbreaker.) I'll probably do the Azura's star quest and maybe get the Spellbreaker Shield.. but things like the House of Horrors or Boethia's calling are out for sure. All my other characters started out Neutral and
 ended up more evil then anything else.</p>

<p>At least Vaermina gives you a choice between doing her will and doing the right thing. You get a follower out of it if you do good and he, at least, knows how to sneak and is a pretty useful mage.</p>

<h2>            Gt740m gpu not working &#40;code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Please help, my laptop is a dell vostro 5470 running windows 8.1. My graphics card for this laptop is a gt740m and it says it is not working. This first started when i played space engineers. i have tried removing and re-installing it however it still says
 that it is not working (code 43). i also troubleshooted with "DeviceWin8.meta" and it did the same thing. I also tried using nvidia experience to update but it ended up going in an infinite loop. Finally i tried to install it manual using the nvidia website
 but it still came up with the same problem. Thanks in advanced.</p>

<h2>            Win 7 Error Message 802400B on failed install of KB3079757</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with error 802400B which I get with a failed attempt to install KB 3079757 through Windows Update. Now I can't get any other updates - it simply keeps saying that it is downloading updates, but never does. I had about 20 important updates
 - it installed about 5 and then hung at this one. I had just finished updating IE to V11 and that worked fine, then 3 updates were installed along with the failed error message. After that I got 2 others to install - they seemed to be already downloaded and
 just needed to be installed. After that - none will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the Update Recovery/Repair tool(?) - that also wouldn't finish. It went through its checking process and then was "solving" the problem but didn't complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Win 7 on a 64 bit computer. Plenty of HD space, RAM etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would downloading the updates manually and installing them and then rebooting solve this? Or another idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>LH</p>

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />

            Hi Susan, this is widely reported at the moment!
<br />
<br />The Fix: your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty simple to do. With the character map open select the specific character you want and click the highlighted "select" button (or press enter on your keyboard).&nbsp; Then click "copy" to the right of the "select" button to copy it into your clipboard.
 You can now just paste this into your document. Some&nbsp;programs may not support all the characters from the character map. If there is a character you use a lot just use the keyboard shortcut which is noted in the bottom right-hand corner of the window. Please
 note that some characters don't have a shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I helped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sam.</p>

            Try uninstalling the game, Then clearing local saved games and the MAC address before installing again, It sounds like a corrupted download.

            Hi NoelTenjiku.
<div><br />
<div>Because we are dealing with virtual machines, there are many different variables to check. I assume that the network you are connecting your virtual machine to is assigning IP addresses via DHCP. When I say this, I mean that there are no static IP addresses
 configured inside the virtual machine, and there are no static IP addresses assigned to your NIC on the host computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check the Networking configuration of your Windows XP Mode virtual machine. Make sure there is only ONE network adapter, and that the single network adapter is set for "Shared Networking (NAT)". To do this,&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Virtual PC from the Start Menu.</li><li>Right click on "Windows XP Mode". Choose Settings.</li><li>Click on the Networking setting.</li><li>Make sure there is only 1 number of network adapters, and that Adapter #1 is set for "Shared Networking (NAT)".</li><li>Start the Windows XP Mode virtual machine.</li><li>Click Start &gt; Control Panel. (Change to Classic View.)</li><li>Double-click Network Connections.</li><li>Right-click on the single NIC, choose Properties.</li><li>Highlight "Internet Protocol (TCP\IP), then click the Properties button.</li><li>Ensure both "Obtain an IP Address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically" are selected.&nbsp;</li><li>Click OK, then OK to close the LAN Properties. Close the Control Panel window.&nbsp;</li><li>Try to access the internet again.</li></ol>
<div>If you are still having issues, you will need to double-check the NIC settings on your host PC (host PC = the computer
<u>running</u>&nbsp;Windows XP Mode). To do this,</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Minimize Windows XP Mode if it is currently displayed.</li><li>Open the Network and Sharing Center from the Control Panel.</li><li>Click "Change Adapter Settings" on the left pane.</li><li>If you are running a laptop, there will be at least two NICs listed. Right-click on the NIC, choose Properties.</li><li>Highlight "Internet Protocol (TCP\IP), then click the Properties button.</li><li>Ensure both "Obtain an IP Address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically" are selected.&nbsp;</li><li>Repeat steps 4 through 6 for the remaining NICs in the Adapter Settings window.</li><li>Restart the Windows XP Mode virtual machine and try to access the internet again.</li></ol>
<div>Did this help?</div>

</div>
<div>I am going nuts trying to troubleshoot a problem for my SONY laptop VGN-FZ21M now with Windows 7</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem: &nbsp;The cursor is moving in the wrong direction, and behaving erratically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sony Support Site refers to solution on</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>Section 3: &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For Windows 7:</div>
<div>Click on Start button</div>
<div>Select VAIO Control Center from the All Programs list</div>
<div>Expand Keyboard and Mouse&nbsp;</div>
<div>Select Pointing Device&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click on Advanced</div>
<div>In the tab Pointer Options, tick the option 'Hide pointer while typing'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But they only provide this "VAIO Control Center" &nbsp;on their &nbsp;VGN-FZ21M Vista Support / Download page.</div>

</div>
<div>Two &nbsp;questions: &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>Is there a Windows 7 version of the software&nbsp;elsewhere? &nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Uninstall and re-install drivers for the touch pad.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</span><span>‌</span><span>
 If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, locate the device, and then right-click the device name.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select uninstall and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Let Windows 7 detect the device and install the drivers by itself.</span></p>

<p><span>Step 2: You may contact
<a href="http://support.sony-europe.com/index.aspx?site=odw_en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">their support</a> to get more information about the driver. However, you can try installing Vista drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps on how to install the drivers in the compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place the driver installation file on the Desktop.</span></p>

<h2>            This copy of windows not genuine - 0xC004F063 computer bios is missing required license</h2>
                    I had a friend of mine install an SSD into my laptop a month ago, and my Windows 7 installation worked fine. But yesterday I suddenly got this error message saying my windows copy is not genuine. Can anyone help me with this?<br />

<p>The problem is that your system cannot properly read your&nbsp;BIOS SLIC table&nbsp;- this may be a minor glitch, or it could be that you have a counterfeit install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please first try recreating Licensing Store.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Recreate the Licensing Store</span></p>
<p>Go to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</p>
<p>Right-Click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator - accept the UAC prompt</p>
<p>Run the following commands in the Command Prompt window, using the Enter key at the end of each</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hey Tim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Easiest is to sort your files into your User Folders under your User name.  Then copy or drag them to USB flash or external.  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many...</a>
<br />
<br />Move the transfer media to new PC, open the media device, open each User folder, from Home tab choose Select All, right click on group to Copy.  
<br />
<br />Now open the new corresponding User folder, in empty area right click to Paste.  
<br />
<br />Backup Suggestions:
<br /> 
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:

<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What you need to start this project?
<br />
<br />The first thing I recommend you do is invest in an external hard disk. I can't exhaust this enough; they are affordable and can store lots of data. You can probably get a 4TB drive for around $100.
<br />
<br />USB External hard disk
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, if you have a complex configuration, this article does not delve into the nuances of multiple partitions or drives with data scattered across them although the same rules can apply in regards to backup. If you do have folders for data such as documents, music, pictures and videos stored on other partitions or drives, then I would recommend you disconnect these data drives and upgrade only the system partition. You can always reattach your data drives after setup is complete.
<br />
<br />Turn on Show Hidden Files &amp; Folders
<br />
<br />You want your backup to be as thorough as possible. Within your User folder is a hidden directory called AppData. This folder stores important settings for the apps you use, such as custom directionaries for Microsoft Word, passwords for apps like Chrome, Outlook data files and mail folders for apps like Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />To turn on Hidden Files and folders, start by opening your user folder. Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Enabling Show hidden files and Folders
<br />
<br />Windows 8/8.1/10 - Click the View tab then click Options then click the View tab. Under Advanced settings &gt; Hidden files and folders select the radio box Show hidden files and folders.
<br />
<br />Windows Vista/7 - Click Organize &gt; Search and Folder Options
<br />Windows XP - Click Tools &gt; Folder Options
<br />
<br />AppData folder is now visible.
<br />
<br />After completing the above steps, you should now see the AppData folder appear in your user folder.
<br />
<br />Next step is to simply select all the folder. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + A or
<br />
<br />Click Organize &gt; Select All (Windows 7), 
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10), 
<br />Edit &gt; Select All (Windows XP).
<br />
<br />Selected folders
<br />
<br />Open your External hard disk then create a new folder and call it backup or a unique name. Open it then press Ctrl + V or
<br />
<br />Click Organize &gt; Paste (Windows 7),
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10), 
<br />Click Edit &gt; Paste (Windows XP).
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have multiple accounts
<br />
<br />If you have more than one account on your computer, log into each account and repeat the same steps. Make sure a unique folder is created for each account you backup manually.
<br />
<br />Remember other folders you might have
<br />
<br />If you store data in folders such as Public, remember to look in there too. The Public folder is located in C:\Users\Public
<br />
<br />In Windows XP it is called Shared Documents located under C:\Documents and Settings
<br />
<br />NOTE: Some apps will keep their own data stores within their application folders, so make sure you browse and copy those over if necessary. Some users have a tendency to store files at the root of the hard disk, normally where the operating system is installed (Local Disk c:\). Also check there for any important files and move them to Documents folder.
<br />
<br />Restoration
<br />
<br />Once your backup is complete and you have your new computer setup and Windows is installed and running, the next step is to copy over your files and folders from the external hard disk. You can do this two ways, you can individually copy the contents of each folder into the respective folder on the new computer from the external drive. Here is what you can easily do.
<br />
<br />Connect and turn on your external hard disk.
<br />
<br />Browse the backup folder with your backed up folders.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + A or Click Organize &gt; Select All (Windows 7), Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10), Edit &gt; Select All (Windows XP).
<br />
<br />Open your User folder on the computer
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + V or Click Organize &gt; Paste (Windows 7), Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10), Edit &gt; Paste (Windows XP).
<br />
<br />You will be prompted if you want to replace the folders, click Yes.
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have other accounts, make sure the respective accounts have been created and logged into then repeat the same steps.

<h3> jfanton  say:</h3>
<h2>            wav file too big for CD-R what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    I had an interview from a cassette tape converted to a digital audio file.&nbsp; It is on a CD-R and the wav file size is 588.804 MB.&nbsp; I would like to convert to a cda file so that my father who does not have a computer&nbsp;can play it on a cd player.&nbsp; I copied
 the file to my hard drive, but when I try to burn the audio file&nbsp;to an&nbsp;new CD-R disk using windows media player (selecting the "make an audio cd" option) it says the file is too big and not enough room on the disk.&nbsp; The interview is 1 hour and 54 minutes long.&nbsp;
 Is there anything I can do to make this work?&nbsp;I'm not too savvy on&nbsp;media conversion myself, as you can tell.

            <p>CD's can only hold 80 minutes of audio.&nbsp; So you will need to burn it as a data disc (not an audio disc) and then let him listen to it using a computer (not a CD player).</p>

<h2>            Pre order Cancelled</h2>
                    <p>So around 6 months ago I pre ordered Destiny 2 the $150 version on the microsoft store, I was happy and excited until I received a message saying 'Your preorder has been refunded or cancelled'. So I went to my bank account and I&nbsp;had not received&nbsp;a refund but i have already paid $150. Destiny 2 was even installed on my xbox but every time I click on the game it says that I need to buy the game to play it. I have no idea what to do and I feel like i just lost $150.&nbsp;If I do not get to play this game on&nbsp;midnight Au time then&nbsp;I will probably cry.</p>

                    I am having problems installing programs on my computer.&nbsp; I have to reinstall Spybot S&amp;D but it cannot see the server to complete the instillation (it was removed through add/remove programs).<br />
<br />
The same thing occurs for 2 other recreational programs that need to see their host server to install/work properly.<br />
<br />
I have Vista home premium and Symantec anti virus.<br />
<br />
Tried disableing my firewall and Symantec but there was no change.<br />
<br />
All of the above has been installed in the past with no problem and uninstalled for various reasons.&nbsp; Now they will not reinstall.

<p><br />
Here is two&nbsp;suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Format the HDD then do another clean install of Windows. Get an anti-virus application installed BEFORE you (attempt to) install any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This is a Consumer-specific forum. You will find support for Windows Server in these forums:

    <title>Fast Startup Setting in Windows 10 will not stay enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beasley104  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fast Startup Setting in Windows 10 will not stay enabled</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and my system (desktop) has now gone from booting into Windows &nbsp;in several seconds (on a 250 GB SSD) to 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried enabling fast startup through Control Panel/Power Options etc., put a check in the Fast Startup (Recommended) box and clicked on save settings, however if I shut down completely then do a cold boot, go into Control Panel/Power Options, the Fast
 Startup box is unchecked and fast startup is not enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else out there having this problem? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have found an answer to the problem, PLEASE share it with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!!&nbsp;</p>

 my problem of not being able save the "fast startup setting" in Power Options, since upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I had recently learned that TI2016 was the culprit.&nbsp; I have just installed the new version and so far so good!&nbsp; The setting box in now staying checked,
 thank God!!&nbsp; Thank you for your time and assistance in this very pesky matter.&nbsp; I am tired of trying to remember to run the batch file to turn on fast startup every time I get ready to shut my system down. GRRRR! &nbsp; Please mark this case as closed.</span><br />

<h2>            I have up to 4 instances of  MpCmdRun.exe running that are all eating up most of my 12 gigs of Ram over 4 processors.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use System Mechanic anti-virus, not MSE or windows defender, and for no apparent reason, I find I have up to 4 instances of &nbsp;MpCmdRun.exe running that are all eating up most of my 12 gigs of Ram over 4 processors. I have been unable to find any measure
 to stop this from happening each time I boot up (I can mitigate it to around 20-25% of resources by running these instances on only one of the 4 cpus).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run anti-virus, and other malware removers. I did a system restore back a week before the last major Windows updates. Ran sfc /scannow and ran DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth &nbsp;and all with negative results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I stop these rogue occurrences of a command line exe for windows defender, a program I never use, from intruding without going all the way back to the hopeless windows 8.1 restore?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I just turned on windows defender and firewall. I deactivated the system shield. I hope that IOLO can fix the problem soon and then I will reinstall System Mechanics.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thijs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reapplied system mechanic <strong>without</strong> system shield, and so far the system is running OK using windows defender, but I have not yet heard back from IOLO. &nbsp;They are a bit slow with customer service and problem resolution, and except for
 the issues with system shield (I've had them before on an earlier version), I still like the product overall. &nbsp;</p>
