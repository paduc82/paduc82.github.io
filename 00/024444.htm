    <title>How can I upgrade the technical preview to Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2noob2btrue  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I upgrade the technical preview to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can't believe MS made this so hard, I installed the technical preview for windows 10 on a new build fully intending to upgrade to full Windows 10 when it was released. Only problem is I can't, there is no option to upgrade the OS from within the control
 panel. I was never promoted to buy full Windows 10 MS simple booted me out the door and slammed it behind me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I've searched the threads. Nobody ever addresses my problem, how can I upgrade the technical preview to full windows without reinstalling the damn thing?! Yes, I understand it's not going to be free for me, yes, I'm willing to pay for a home license.
 Now stop wasting my time, take my money, and let me upgrade the technical preview!</p>

<p>1. A custom built gaming PC, believe me when I say, it's more than capable of running windows 10 because I just got finished using the technical preview on it.
</p>
<p>2. Maybe you didn't read my OP but I've stated multiple times that I was using the Windows 10 Technical preview. I don't care about getting it for free either but you felt the need to reiterate the same useless information I've read already on multiple other
 threads. None of it pertains to my situation, but I guess people at MS don't have to time to read.
</p>
<p>3. I honestly don't know anymore (because I did a clean install and upgraded to 10 Home) but I installed it back in May 2015 and it had stopped receiving updates maybe 4-6 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>4. Yes I installed any and all udates offered me but after the windows update service stopped working a few weeks ago so I couldn't have even if I wanted to (which I did).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you could link me to this wealth of information because I've read it and it never addresses users wanting to upgrade the technical preview of windows 10 to full windows 10 ( in my case 'home') And yes, I am aware that it's not free and I was willing
 (and did) pay for a 10 home license. Problem is, despite the windows 10 technical preview having the "10" brand on it it's not possible to upgrade it to full windows 10 unless you wipe all your programs and start again. Since this was my daily driver that
 was a complete hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for anyone else stumbling across these threads, my solution was just to wipe the entire system and start over. There is no easy way to upgrade the technical preview I installed back in May and it stopped receiving updates a few weeks ago already which
 meant that even if I wanted to continue to use the technical preview I'd have to do a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the home version of Windows 10 ($120) and therefore couldn't simply upgrade the technical preview because it appears locked to a Windows Pro license upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever, good job MS. I won't be beta testing jack for you anymore and to add insult to injury you charge full price for all versions of windows 10 whereas I could buy a copy of Windows 8.1 for 40 dollars cheaper and upgrade it to 10 for free and pocket
 the money. I didn't because I'm just so sick of this whole debacle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also MS support is all copy/paste. I hate to sound entitled but I did buy a consumer version of Windows 10 Home which supposedly provides support. Again whatever, Apple looks better by the day, with them you can actually get on the early release train without
 having to fully reinstall you OS every two months. </p>

            <p>Same problem.&nbsp; Installed technical preview, want to move to Win 10.&nbsp; I've just spent a frustrating couple of hours with Microsoft, trying to achieve what I thought should be fairly straight forward.&nbsp; Support, in frustration, generated a new WIN 10 pro product
 key because my original WIN 7 product key wouldn't work.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the freshly minted WIN 10 pro key wouldn't work either.&nbsp; I hope somewhere there is a key server logging messages about why this process doesn't work.&nbsp; Eventually somebody will see the
 log file and have a Ha-Ha moment.<br />
Meanwhile, I'm stuck on technical preview.</p>

            <p>Is your Windows 7 SP1 activated?</p>
<p>If so you need to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>There are no keys for Windows 10 unless you buy Windows 10.</p>
<p>Read the posts on this forum about activation.</p>

            <p>After reading your posting, 1, the Preview was for testing and not to be used as your main system posted many times that it may crash and delete files in so don't install something that you "love" and&nbsp;don't &nbsp;have a backup of it, 2, you&nbsp;can't&nbsp; down "grade"
 from pro to home ( I don't understand why anyone would want to but that's my opinion ).</p>
<p>3, as for Apple and updates which I have two Apple has have problems also doing updates, and that is with systems that are Apple built, as for MS making and OS that works across many different platforms I would like to see Apple do the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New on here so please take it easy on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I brought a Nokia N97 Mini at the beggining of December and so far it has been great, until today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switched it on and the white background with Nokia in blue writing came on as per usual. Trouble is, nothing happened after that, it just stayed on that screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried battery in and out loads of times and&nbsp;starting without the sim card in but no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to clear this or is it a send it back problem???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experienced this problem, 4 times in 5 weeks....... I managed to resolve it by carrying out a 4 finger reset details of which can be found at:
<a href="http://www.mobile-users.net/2009/11/19/four-finger-hard-reset-for-the-n97-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mobile-users.net/2009/11/19/four-finger-hard-reset-for-the-n97-mini/</a>. however as you can guess this wasnt a permanent fix, and I have sent my phone off for repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very disappointed by the standard of this phone from Nokia and they even had the cheek to send me a survery about my experience with the n97 mini, and I responded with a unacceptable they said someone will ring me to talk about it - did they ring? -
 of course not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great job Nokia on losing a loayl customer.</p>

<strong>Instructions to bypass WSOD:</strong><br />
All you need is:

<br />
Follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Turn off your phone.</li><li>Insert charger.</li><li>Remove charger right after screen lights up.</li><li>Wait a couple of seconds till screen turns off and just after that press <a href="http://www.ipmart-forum.com/showthread.php?p=2965100&amp;posted=1#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Mine locked up yesterday, was running ok, &nbsp;went into a building where mobiles had to be switched off came out switched back on to record a appointment and...... WSoD...</p>
<p>One hard reset and much swearing later I now have my phone back roughly how I want it, although I used ovi.com to restore some of my calender data I lost alot of appointments, allso not sure if it was ovi.com or not but &nbsp;some of my contacts got corrupted.</p>
<p>Why doesn't &nbsp;ovi suite come with a callanderr appnn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway one advantage is my phone been cleared of half the **bleep** loaded onto it by Vodafone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Still not sure if i am keeping it to be honest i love the form factor but the clunky &nbsp;os and bugs have me thinking of going to a android or even .... winmo phone.</p>

<p>I also had this problem when I started my usual heavy use of my new Nokia N97 mini which i purchased in december.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup was only possible when playing around with the charger, and removing the battery and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also performed the four-finger hard reset, which did solve the problem for a while, but after restoring everything ..the same story all over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved this problem when I disabled Garmin Mobile XTs (v5.00.50) background process
<em>TSRAutoStart.exe.</em> (Primarily i did this because it was eating away the battery life, which has also improved afterwards.)</p>
<p>In this version it is possible to disable the process by having the process enabled in Garmin settings, restarting Garmin, disabling the process and restarting it again. (Use of an application that displays running processes to check if it is really off
 is advised).</p>
<p>For older versions use google :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now i have been able to restart the phone without any problems (3/3 restarts successful so far)</p>

<p>I experienced the same with my 5800XM upon inserting the SIM, after the Phone worked well a couple of days in my WLAN. While you could switch it on shortly after powering off, it would never work the next day w/o removing battery first.</p>
<p>As all was well w/o SIM card, and it began to idle right before the numpad for PIN entry should come up (it would beep when pressing the media button above the display, indicating there was no freeze), i assumed some incompatibility with some SIMs(mine).</p>
<p>Well, i deactivated PIN code entry (and also WLAN scan and internet connectivity check, seeing no difference in going online via WLAN), and that did it for me !</p>
<p>Not a single issue since, only once the phone restarted a couple of times before finally going thru.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 not syncing with outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>After&nbsp;years of my Outlook 2007 syncing perfectly with Outlook.com through "Outlook Connector", today email syncing stopped. Apparently Microsoft updated Outlook.com, and the user has to pay for it as&nbsp;a result. Calendar and Contacts are syncing, but email
 no longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting&nbsp;these error codes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Send/Receive error</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Error syncing folder hierarchy. Error : 80041004</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Error syncing email account</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Error : 3219</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft fix that crucial issue, I often need to access my emails off-line, an impossible cenário now that emails in Outlook 2007 are no longer in sync.</p>

<p>The value of <strong>path </strong>is a fully qualified path to the file.&nbsp; If the file being imported is ppt it works.&nbsp; If it is pptx I get the error.&nbsp; I guess my real question is can I merge old files with the newer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is currently for my own use and possibly a few others at some point.&nbsp; I am trying to find a way to not have to purchase a 3rd party component.</p>

<p>I may have found it but I am not sure.&nbsp; I have just merged PPT with PPTX, PPTX with PPTX, and PPT with PPT.&nbsp; The PPTX files that are failing are ones I converted programatically.&nbsp; I have a directory full of PPT files.&nbsp; I looped through that and opened then

<p>They do open by themselves.&nbsp; After seeing that a manually saved file converting from ppt to pptx worked I did some digging.&nbsp; Rather than specifying a SaveAs type I just did this in my conversion:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">file.SaveCopyAs(destPath + ".pptx");</p>

<h2>            Multi-Part message arriving in multiple parts.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have a 6500 Classic and lately whenever i get messages that span over more than 1 message the following happens:<br />
<br />
1 Message recieved<br />
--&gt; Read<br />
<br />
Message Reads:<br />
*some text missing*<br />
...<br />
(End of message)<br />
<br />
Message envelope doesnt go away up the top.<br />
Go back to inbox, And there is the first part of the message + the very end of the message (ie the bit in the middle is the bit in the *some text missing* message)<br />
<br />
Its been happening repeatedly and its getting rather frustrating.<br />
Stranger still, sometimes if i've had more than one multipart on one day, the break in the message is not from the same message but from the previous one...<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Should I update my firmware?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            Receiving multi-part(multi-page of 160 characters each page) message &amp; having an error of "some text missing" indicate that there is not enough memory space left in the main memory of the phone to get the full message. You can either delete some of the
 messages in the inbox or move it to your memory card.<br />
<br />
Updating your firmware will surely rectify it for the update will erase most of your files, &amp; put your phone in factory default conditions. Formating it will do the same.<br />

<p>I started to get this message when I updated to the latest version of software for the phone. Even if I delete all my messages and free up lots of memory this still happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks to me as though Nokia have introduced a bug, and I wish I could revert to the older version of&nbsp;software where multi-part messages worked fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10532 will not start  task bar or Start. It allows login but nothing works from there eventually main screen starts to flash on and off</h2>
                    <p>I could not get the update to 10532 to down load just kept asking to do a restart. Finally using Task Manager was able to stop update. From there I was finally able to complete the update to 532. When it finally finished it booted to the lock screen and
 allowed me to access the main screen with task bar and Start but nothing loaded and then that screen started to flash on and off. How do I delete that upgrade and return to 525. This update was a complete disaster. I am using another computer as my ASUS X54E
 no longer works. Using ctrl- alt- del &nbsp;will get me to task mngr and shut down but little else. &nbsp;HELP!!!!</p>

<p>I am trying your suggestion doing a reset now. I hope this works so thank-you very much for your help. What other tricks can be used from the shut down options?</p>

            <p>Well I do not know anymore tricks involving the shutdown. Gives you all the normal recovery options same as booting from a DVD, just easier to get I feel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the reset works out for you. That would have been my guess as to what was required. Hopefully it is an 'Insider' PC so not your day to day or with any important data on it that you do not have elsewhere.</p>

<h2>            Didn&#39;t receive Updates in the Store for Lumia 950XL</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
i Have a Lumia 950XL with Build 10586.107 (no Insider!) and last Firmware.<br />
At this day, Microsoft has published Updates for any Apps:<br />
<br />
Outlook<br />
One-Drive<br />
Messages+Skype<br />
<br />
But my Phone didn't receive any update.<br />
If i search one of this App's in the Store, all Apps Have the Status "installed"<br />
<br />
<br />
On my Lumia 1520 with Build 10586.107 (Insider) i receive all App Updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>C'est simple :</p>
<p>1) Ouvrir Excel</p>
<p>2) Nouveau classeur Excel</p>
<p>3) Onglet "Affichage"</p>
<p>4) Sélectionner une valeur de zoom en cliquant sur la petite flèche : 150% par exemple</p>
<p>5) Le zoom reste à 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cela ne fonctionne pas.</p>
<p>Cordialement.</p>

            <p>Hi Cherokee,</p>
<p><br />
Which email account are you using to check emails?</p>
<p><br />
Photos received in emails are usually uploaded by the sender as attachments, so they can be downloaded and saved to your computer's hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to your email "<strong>Inbox</strong>," once you have been granted access to your email information.<br />
b. Open the email with the file attachment symbol to view the pictures in your email Inbox. (The file attachment symbol usually looks like a paper click, and it can be found on the left side of the email message within the Inbox.)<br />
c. Click on the attachment link, and select the "<strong>Download</strong>" action that will appear in a pop-up window for the photo files.<br />
d. Select the "<strong>Save</strong>" action to store the pictures to your computer once the downloading process is complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you need further assistance. We’ll be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>

<p>All the answer are on this thread that you've posted on. I suggest you read them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's highly likely that only a care point can help you now. If no care points are available to you then contact the retailer that you bought the phone from for help.</p>

<p><span>I downloaded the "OVI SUITE" and came close to disaster also. Fortunately, I made a back-up and was able to recover from the effects of my "up-date". This software sucks !! and it is being<strong> pushed
</strong>at us at every opportunity. I am back to PC SUITE and would prefer to continue with same but, Iwould like full functionality. Every time I have done an update on my E71 , I have lost some app.

                    <p>Updated Nokia Lumia 710 to Windows Phone 7.8 few weeks back.<br />
Marketplace is not working and showing the Refresh Marketplace error.<br />
Have installed the RefreshMarketplace App innumerable times, without any effect.</p>
<p>Also Games Hub is giving error when trying to update.</p>
<p>Thought the issue will resolve itself, but its been weeks.</p>

            <p>Hi vic2msn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have some additional steps that can be gone through to try to resolve issues related to the Refresh Marketplace app. You can find the steps at the bottom of the
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/apps/download-apps-and-games-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps and Games FAQ page</a>, but for your convenience I'll also post them below: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are one of the small number of users who needs to install and run the Refresh Marketplace App to continue using Marketplace, you will receive a<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">You must install the Refresh Marketplace App<span>&nbsp;</span></span>notice
 and will see this app as the only one featured within the Marketplace Hub on your phone. Follow the instructions below to download and install the Refresh Marketplace App:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure your Windows Phone is connected to a cellular data connection or Wi-Fi.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Open the Marketplace Hub.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap the Refresh Marketplace App icon or name to go to the app details page, and then tap
</li><li>
<p>Find and tap the Refresh Marketplace App in the Games Hub, then follow the on-screen instructions to complete reconfiguring your phone to access the updated online Marketplace infrastructure.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Re-open the Marketplace Hub. You should no longer see the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">You must install the Refresh Marketplace App</span><span>&nbsp;</span>notice, and you should be able to see various featured apps and games. You can now continue
 to use Marketplace on your Windows Phone—enjoy! If you choose, you can<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/apps/delete-apps-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the Refresh Marketplace App at this time.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, after following the previous steps, you continue to receive the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">You must install the Refresh Marketplace App</span><span>&nbsp;</span>notice or are unable to install apps from the Marketplace Hub on your phone,
 do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Turn off your Windows Phone by holding down the power button and following the on-screen instruction to<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Slide down to power off</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After a few seconds, push the power button to restart your phone.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ensure your Windows Phone is connected to a cellular data connection or Wi-Fi, then plug it in using the wall charger that came with your phone. Leave your phone plugged in for at least 10 minutes, then try again to access Marketplace.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Re-open the Marketplace Hub. You should no longer see the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">You must install the Refresh Marketplace App<span>&nbsp;</span></span>notice, and you should be able to see various featured apps and games. You can now continue
 to download apps from Marketplace—enjoy!</p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to have problems, see the following Advanced steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>&nbsp;</span>screen on your Windows Phone, flick left to the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">App List</span>. Go to the Games Hub and note whether the Games Hub icon says Xbox
 LIVE or not. If yes, continue with Step 2. If not, skip to Step 5.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Xbox LIVE Games</span><span>&nbsp;</span>icon to open the Games Hub.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">More</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmsresources.windowsphone.com%2fwindowsphone%2fen-us%2fHow-to%2fwp7%2finline%2fbasic-icon-ellipses.png" />, then tap<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Refresh</span>. You should see<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Updating...</span><span>&nbsp;</span>on
 the top-left of the screen. When this goes away, continue to Step 4.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Re-open the Marketplace Hub. You should no longer see the<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">You must install the Refresh Marketplace App<span>&nbsp;</span></span>notice, and you should be able to see various featured apps and games. You can now continue
 to use Marketplace—enjoy!</p>
<p>If you continue to have problems, do the following:</p>
</li><li>
<p>If your Games Hub icon doesn't say<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Xbox LIVE</span><span>&nbsp;</span>(or if Steps 1-4 don't restore the full Marketplace experience), plug in your Windows Phone using it's wall charger, ensure your phone is connected
 to a cellular data connection or Wi-Fi, and charge your phone for at least 24 hours. During this time, your phone will automatically attempt to connect to the updated online Windows Phone Marketplace infrastructure, after which you should be able to continue
 using Marketplace.</p>
<p>If after following all of the steps above you continue to have problems, contact<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=261801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support.</a></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Please let me know if these steps are able to help you restore the&nbsp;marketplace. Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community!</p>

<strong><span>Online chat</span></strong><strong><span>support:</span></strong>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/4/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel: .
</p>
<p><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>·<span> </span></span><span>No ESL accent issues</span></p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Provides you with an instant time stamped transcript</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If they don’t read the history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” when they are off line</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You have 2 hands free to surf the web when they are not talking to you.
</p>
<p>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>For some reason, I found that waiting for online chat responses intrinsically
<strong>LESS</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>frustrating than listening to elevator muzak.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Make sure to copy the text from the chat window and save it before closing the chat window. It is handy to have a timestamped copy of the conversation, if only to publish it on the internet ... &lt;evil grin&gt;</p>

<strong><span>Activation Phone Support - phone activate</span></strong>
<p>If you have an activation specific error, ie things like “invalid” or “blocked” product key, you specifically have to contact the “phone activation” support reps.&nbsp; Apparently “normal” support has no way of transferring you to them … &lt;sigh&gt;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process you need to follow is rather round about:</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start normal activation, </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>select phone activation option, </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>this will display appropriate phone number for your geographic location.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Phone them</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>do <strong>NOT</strong> reply to initial prompts</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a “service” rep</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>explain problem to them</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>ask to be transferred to a supervisor when front line support can’t help you

</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the <strong>Reindex Site </strong>section, click <strong>Reindex Site</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When a warning appears, click <strong>Reindex Site </strong>again to confirm. The content will be re-indexed the next scheduled time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. After re-indexing your OneDrive for Business site, click the <strong>ellipses (...)

    <title>Outlook 365 and Comcast Email account issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gses95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 and Comcast Email account issues</h2>
                    I purchased a new laptop that came with Office 365.&nbsp; I use Outlook on my Laptop but use my Comcast app on my phone to get my emails during the day.&nbsp; When I set up the Office 365 Outlook I allowed the application to set up my Comcast account.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp;
 Then I imported my outlook.pst file from my old computer.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; Then I noticed that all my emails, folders, sent items, etc have now showed up on my phone which I do not want.&nbsp; In Office 2007, once I opened outlook everything in my inbox from my phone
 was MOVED to my actual laptop and cleaned from my phone.&nbsp; Now that is not happening.&nbsp; I would like to set Outlook 365 to work the same as Outlook 2007 for my email but the option I have been seeing on the google search is not available in Outlook 365.&nbsp; Outlook
 365 did set my Comcast email account up as an IMAP account.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to fix this.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>An IMAP account is a copy of mail on the server, it will sync/be the same on any other device that that IMAP a/c is set up on.</p>
<p>A pop mail account, which uses a pst data file, downloads all mail to the local PC, unless you set the option to keep a copy on the server. A pop mail account will not therefore sync with any other device (Other than show received mail if you set the option
 to keep a copy)</p>
<p>I cannot imagine how you had mail set up previously, under 2007/phone, unless you were accessing via web access your mail server on the phone</p>

 pop account so I can go back to the way things were.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Cannot open a portable file from Quickbooks &#40;.QBM&#41; on Hotmail. I can open other attachments</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: &nbsp;<strong>I am on hotmail and I cannot open an attachment Portable File from Quickbooks which has a .QBM identity. &nbsp;I can open all other attachments.</strong></p>
<p>I get a yellow box at the top of my e-mail after clicking on the attachment anywhere from 10 to 50 times which states that the attachment .QBM could not be checked for virus's due to an internal error.&nbsp; I have already contacted Norton and Quickbooks and
 there is no problem there.</p>
