<h2>            My account is blocked. I feel like I&#39;m going round in circles.</h2>
                    I turned on the 2 step verification for an email account using a mobile, requiring a text message and the Microsoft app before access. I lost the phone and the password required to access my app account. So every time I try to access my email via my new
 mobile it asks for the code from the app which tells me to go to the website to recover my password, and the website tells me to go to the app in order to access my account. So therefore I'm going round in circles. I've tried filling in a questionnaire which
 tells me I'll be contacted in 24 hours. I've filled this in 3 times in the past month with no contact. I have really important information on this account that I need to retrieve, such as phone contract paperwork, a link to a refund for a cancelled festival,
 etc. please help!

<h2>            MSE Log files&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does MSE create any log files?</p>
<p>I double clicked on the MSE icon on my task bar yesterday to bring up the MSE GUI.&nbsp; When the GUI came up it was blank, and never responded.&nbsp; Once I rebooted my machine everything was okay, but I still would like to see what was going on, to make sure that
 MSE is indeed okay and working properly.&nbsp; I clicked the History tab on MSE and saw nothing.</p>
<p>I am on Vista SP2, MSE v 1.0.1963.0.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>There is no reason to undo the rights for the folder. Basically, you acquired rights to view the contents.</p>
<p>As for reviewing logs, I believe that your issue was a simple fluke, perhaps memory related. Once you rebooted, all was well again.</p>

    <title>How can i create a link in text within a document in wordpar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.e.c 3000  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i create a link in text within a document in wordpar</h2>
                    <p>I would like to ask if anyone could be so kind as to show me how to create a text&nbsp;link inside wordpad for a document. For Example let us say the document is about Elephants and you want to create an index with text link within the document that once click
 it, &nbsp;will lead you the section you want. To further the example for clarification, the index would include types of Elephants, size, height, habitat, etc.,&nbsp;let us say I click height, this will then automatically scroll down to the section in the document for&nbsp;habitat.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second step would be that one could add another link that will access similar information in a second document and open to that particular section as you would with a web page only here it would be for a document. I imagine this would require special
 directives to access the file name etc. Any suggestions, if you need clarification please let me know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</p>

            <p>The nearest that you can come to that in WordPad is to use the Insert object facility, selecting the Create from File option and then checking the Link and display as icon options,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the response given, this answers one part of the second part of the question, thank you. What I am asking is can there be a marker of sorts or link so that for example use an index at the top of the document like so:</p>
<p><strong>Elephants&nbsp;Index:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Types&nbsp; Habitat &nbsp;Size&nbsp; </strong><strong>Weight</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>then upon clicking one of these options it would scroll down within the document itself precisely to the section discussing the clicked option, so let us say it was Habitat, it would go down and read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Habitat: </strong>Elephants prefer areas of dense vegetation and large bodies of water or nearby streams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this cannot be done in wordpad (and I hope it can, I feel there has to be some way) therefore please point me in the right direction. I imagine Microsoft word has the ability to do this, if so how do I go about setting up&nbsp;the document and placing these
 links (or markers/place holders,&nbsp; I think that&nbsp; would be a more accurate description of what I am looking for) to look for and scroll down automatically to&nbsp;the particular section&nbsp;in-document. This would be very useful&nbsp;as I have not been able to figure this
 out for some time now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for any suggestions, anyone out there want to take another shot at this? Appreciate any and all assistance.</p>

 and I cannot find a way to do it as of yet.

            You insert a Heading at the start of each of the sections of text and then at the top of the document, insert cross references to the Heading text, making sure that the "Insert as Hyperlink" box is checked.&nbsp;

            <p>If you would be so gracious kind sir, please provide a step by step illustration as above, this would be most welcomed and really cement the answer for me. I imagine that this&nbsp;will&nbsp;work on Microsoft's Word Online without a hitch,&nbsp;I will be using this for
 the aforementioned. I will also&nbsp;use&nbsp;a very early issue of word which is outdated but still&nbsp;highly useful and does everything I need which is basically to write letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your time is greatly appreciated and I am sure there will many others who will access and use this information as it is quite useful. Hope to hear your response soon, have a pleasant day.</p>

            <p>Microsoft office for&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;95, featured Word, yes I am embarrassed to admit, but look I mean it does everything I want it to do, basically write term papers, letters, notes, documents etc., for these types of uses it works fine. While the new Word does
 have really excellent features and yes eventually I may get around to buying it but for now Word 95 will have to do. However there is a Word version I have that came pre-installed with a Microsoft Vista, hopefully t&nbsp;hat will allow me to do what you may suggest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apologize for the delayed response but was sidetracked working on something else. Any assistance on this matter is big help. Thanks hope to hear from you soon.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I do not remember precisely what features were available in Word 6.0\95. &nbsp;I am pretty sure however that it did support the creation of a Table of Contents. &nbsp;It may have been under Insert&gt;Reference&gt;Index and Tables&gt;Tables of Contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it has that facility, and you use the Heading 1 style for the text at the top of each section, the Table of Contents will list each of those items of text, (with the number of the page on which they appear) and if you use CTRL+Left click on one in the
 Table of Contents, it will take you to that part of the document.</p>

<h2>            MS Access 2007 - problems &#40;crashes&#41; when typing in big text in memofields</h2>
                    <span><strong>
                    <span><strong>
<p>I have MS-Access as a frontend to an sql-server database. i have a table including one ntext field (which is linked as a memo&nbsp;field to my frontend). The application is running under Terminal-Server (Multiuser). Dynamically, when entering bigger text into
 the memo-field, Access is crashing. In any error-situation the user is only typing in text - suddenly crash. User calls me - we try together again,&nbsp; after starting the program anew - no problem&nbsp;in entering the complete text.&nbsp;The problem is not directly reproducable.&nbsp;
 About three month ago i read about an expirience by a programmer in the web: when deactivating the statusline in the access-options this problem is solved. I tried this and it worked well till now (one week ago). I don't know what impact the statusline should
 have to the memo-field, but it worked well till now. Since about one week the problem arises again. Dynamically crashes when entering big text. There was one change till the successful period (over 2month). Change from SQL-Server 2005 to SQL-Server 2008. Could
 this be the reason? Is there generally a bug in the enter routine of the memo fields. Has it a problem only with terminalserver?</p>
<p>ps: i have tried the memofield with direct binding to the record and also with filling and reading an unbound field - same result!</p>
<p>hoping to get some ideas - thanks</p>

<p>Hi Werner,</p>
<p>When you say "Bigger Text" what exactly are you referring to? Are you referring to the size of the font? Amount of data?</p>
<p>One possible suggestion is to turn off the AutoCorrect feature to see if this has any impact on the issue (Access Options/Current Database).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I continue to have the same problem - turning off the status bar and autocorrect did not help.&nbsp; Under A2007, Windows XP.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be worse when the memo field is embedded in a tab pane.&nbsp; Also, it occurs even with an unbound field in a form having no macros and no code:&nbsp; Just a simple form, tab pane, and memo field - nothing else!!</p>
<p>This is causing considerable problems for the users here.&nbsp; Any fixes?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I can verify this bug.&nbsp; Textboxes will crash unpredictably when editing moderate amounts of text (5000 characters), even when the textbox is UNBOUND (as tested under Windows XP).<br />
<br />
My users are having serious problems with this, and so am I.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a work-around or a suggestion, I would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know if this is fixed in Access 2010?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I can confirm that this bug <span style="font-weight: bold">persists</span> in Access 2010.<br />
<br />
I am running Microsoft Access 2010 14.0.6112.5000 (32-bit) which Microsoft Update says is up-to-date. I get non-reproducible crashes when editing memo fields in a form. The database in question is a simple, flat, local, single-user .accdb file with tables and
 forms, no VBA code.<br />
<br />
According to the event viewer, the crash happens in the MSVCR90.DLL library (the Microsoft C runtime library 9). I get exception code 0xc0000417 and offset 0x0006ccd5, but don't have the time right now to investigate this. Interestingly, the crash report in
 Event Viewer also reports the version of MSACCESS.EXE to be 14.0.6024.1000 which is in conflict with the application's info screen.<br />

            I would check the limitations of the ODBC driver used to connect to your SQL Server.&nbsp; Try using the latest version of the SQL Native Client to make your ODBC connection.

<br />
I don't think that the problem is with SQL Server, since by now several people (including me) have reported the exact same crash working with just a local ACCDB file. This is a major runtime crash bug that happens somewhere in Access itself, when working on
 forms, regardless of data source.<br />

            I can confirm that this issue is occurring as far back as MS Access 2003 and I am able to reproduce it against an SQL Server 2000 or 2008 R2 database.&nbsp; The crash happens completely randomly and drives my end user's completely "NUTS".<br />
<br />
From what I am reading, I would agree with "Anamon" and say that this appears to be more an "MS Access" issue (as opposed to SQL Server), with accessing general long (and or wide) variable character (e.g:. Memo, text, ntext) fields regardless of the underlying
 DBMS (i.e. Access, SQL Server (and maybe) ODBC Linked server).<br />
<br />
In my scenario (currently using MS Access 2003 against SQL Server 2008 R2), I have today changed all existing (offending) "NText" fields to NVarchar(512) and/or NVarchar(Max) where appropriate.<br />
<br />
I will now wait to hear back from my clients and:<br />
<ol>
<li>Will report back here on the results <span style="font-style: italic">and;</span></li><li>Open an MS Connect case, in the event that the above solution solves the problem<span style="font-style: italic"><br />
</span></li></ol>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have the same problem here (crash in memo field edit), with multi-user database on network.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like "modao" said, the bug is there since MS Access 2003. Do you think if Microsoft will make a patch to correct this. It's really annoying for the users...</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks !</div>

<p>If the replaced photo or graphic is only used on one slide, then the embedded file is deleted when it's replaced by the new graphic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GIF is limited to 256 colors, so it's not the best choice for photos. BMPs are a bulky format, I never use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best format for photos is JPEG. A medium quality JPEG is often indistinguishable from a high-quality version in PowerPoint, because PowerPoint automatically blurs placed photos. Medium quality has a much smaller file size than high quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Line art, like logos, is best in EMF vector format, as that can't get downsampled by picture compression. Second-best are indexed-color PNGs for logos. While PNGs can have a smaller file size than complex EMFs, the picture compression issue over-rides that
 concern, at least for me.</p>

<h2>            Word - Option Button Control Does Not Work for the end user&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am working in Word 2007 and have inserted several controls (option, drop-down, text). After protecting the document, all 3 controls work for me. However, when another user attempts to fill out the form. The only controls that work are drop-down &amp; text.
 The option button does not allow for them to select. After attempting to problem solve, the only thing that I can see as being different is that the option control was inserted using ActiveX control while the other two (drop-down &amp; text) were inserted by using
 Legacy form. There doesn't seem to be an option control choice through Legacy Forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get the Option control to work for the other users?</p>

    <title>W10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amitd1005  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    I recently ran the W10 mobile anniversary update on my Lumia 830. I had to hard reset my phone for a problem related to Edge browser. Post hard reset I noticed that the app screens after long press of back arrow are scrolling horizontally as in past. Right
 after the anniv. update, before the hard reset, I remember seeing them 'swing by' when trying to close one by one. The update version shows 14393.67. Just a visual change I observed. Why it could be?

            <p>Hi YRUhere4me,<br />
<br />
To answer the question in PM:<br />
The ability to integrate Cortana with Office 365 is available in any Windows 10 desktops.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cortana integration with Office 365 will help employees to prepare for meetings, learn about co-workers, and receive reminders. The search function for Cortana is still under development and it does not retrieve all results in Office 365/SharePoint
 currently. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, she provides Office 365 users with the following:<br />
- Documents related to upcoming events.<br />
- Search SharePoint Online for documents related to files relates to upcoming meetings. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please check if it is the case.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<h2>            Nokia Asha 200 echo problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I bought the brand new Asha 200 Nokia (Graphite) and so far im happy with the phone. Nontheless, during calls there is a really anoying echo. I have gone back to the store and replaced the first phone only to find that the problem remains the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whats is the position of Nokia about this? I would like to keep the phone but this echo during calls is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should request my cash back or should I go to a Nokia Care point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hello....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have&nbsp;also&nbsp;recently&nbsp;bought&nbsp;"<strong><u>nokia&nbsp;asha&nbsp;200</u></strong>"&nbsp;but&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;very&nbsp;first&nbsp;day&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;use,&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;also experiencing&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;echo&nbsp;problem.&nbsp;All&nbsp;those&nbsp;echoing&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;is&nbsp;irritating&nbsp;me&nbsp;so&nbsp;much...</p>
<p>You&nbsp;can't&nbsp;even&nbsp;use&nbsp;your&nbsp;cell&nbsp;phone&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;basic&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;of&nbsp;making&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all asha handset has this problem,, they are not going to cash back your money,, just be careful the next time you are going to buy nokia products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I don't think&nbsp;<em><strong>Nokia</strong></em>&nbsp;has any words to say for such defective products and the malfunction of its newly launched&nbsp;<em><strong>asha</strong></em>&nbsp;handset &nbsp;which clearly indicates its manufacturing standards and thereby cheating consumers
 . I have never expected such a fraud from such a branded company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;sure,&nbsp;from&nbsp;now&nbsp;onwards,&nbsp;nokia&nbsp;will&nbsp;loose&nbsp;its&nbsp;middle&nbsp;age&nbsp;segment&nbsp;profit&nbsp;for&nbsp;making such&nbsp;frauds/defective&nbsp;model.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span>Just gave the phone at the Nokia Care . the person over there also found tht echoing is a fault. he said its probably Software problem. So they will reload the software n keep it under observation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The nokia care person said only they have the tool to reinstall its Software from the CORE. Customers cannot upgrage there phone by "Nokia Sotware Updater" as they Do. &nbsp;There thing is different from what we usually do at home to upgrade our phne
 Versions n install them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;i think Nokia care allrady have the new software update, may be soon they relese it for all.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Syarifnurjaman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear about the lost data. Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 insider preview is still in development stage and so it is advised not to test the insider preview for your important works.&nbsp;I would suggest you to contact the WD support for any data recovery software (if any) to get your data recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as&nbsp;the insider preview is concerned, many issues and bugs have been fixed with the release of the latest build 10130. So, I would suggest you to upgrade from the older preview version. You can refer to the following to create installation media using
 an ISO image.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-create-an-installation-dvd-or-usb-for-build/94ed9bb0-e638-4d7e-9678-7f45c8666013%20?OCID=WIP_r_Apr_Body_Wiki">How to create an Installation DVD or USB

            <p>Do you always eject for safe removal before you unplug it, both on the laptop &amp; the home PC? If not, eventually it will be damaged and data will be lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is helpful to have file indexing for it turned off in both computers, and set a drive letter for it in both computers that will always be available even when you might have plugged in another USB drive. Then, you can set it to not send any files
 that you delete to the recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my purposes, as soon as a USB drive first triggers the notice that it needs to be scanned for errors, I copy all the data off of it, and then wipe it, and destroy it.</p>

            <p>I think you will find that "Eject" is not available for mechanical hard drives. It is expected that you will finishing any write tasks before removing. I could possibly see a problem creeping in because Win 8/8.1/10 saves to RAM to implement fast boot, so
 if you waited for shutdown to complete before removing there could possibly be unwritten data in the cache. But surely any issues of that sort were sorted in Win 8?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;edit&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive just discovered that it was never sorted under W8. So there you go!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>That is correct for mechanical hard drives ... sorry, I lost track of what he said it was. On the WD Elements, the power switch is all that's needed, but if it's unplugged without turning it off, and if indexing were left activated, it might cause a problem
 related to newly added data that could cause home PC to see it as file system errors and call for the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast boot saves system info, but not data files, to hiberfil.sys, so that shouldn't impact his drive.</p>

            No, that discussion is about the system files confusion caused by booting back and forth from 10, with fast boot enabled, and 7, which doesn't support fast boot. It's not about data files, it's about system files.

            You may be right, although surely the scan/chk disk function is called because of FS discrepancies, irrespective if they stem from system or data files. I do not pretend to know the details of Windows hibernation mode and what files will remain unwritten,
 but I cannot see that assigning a drive letter or disabling indexing will cure these issues. (I tried the drive letter wheeze half and hour ago - it doesn't work)&nbsp;

<h2>            Connecting To An Existing Account...</h2>
                    I received a laptop from my wife. I purchased the Office 2010 package from M/S and installed everything. However, when I try to connect the Outlook to my existing&nbsp;email account it tells me that the name is already taken. I accept it that I am doing something
 wrong. So, how do I connect this to my email address? As you may have guessed, I don't speak computer-a-nese. Help? And in case it helps, my laptop is Windows 7, my desktop is Vista. At first I tried to just overlook it but find that I DO need my Outlook on
 both.

 my desktop or am I SOL? &nbsp;Oh and I am switching from Windows 7 to Windows 8 if that makes any difference.

<p>Hello Slug Appleby,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to change the folder where to sync files from your phone to.</p>
<p>If you click on "add/remove folder" in the Windows Desktop App you can add&nbsp;additional destinations to sync to.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Call Forwarding Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amynicholson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Call Forwarding Not Working</h2>
                    I have a Skype phone number on subscription. I want calls to forward to my Mexican cell phone, as instructions say it can. I have entered the number. Calls do not come through. A friend tested it and said he got "number not available" message. I purchased
 a Mexican subscription, in addition to my Skype number subscription, thinking that was probably why - that I needed money or a sub. for calls to forward, even though it does not say that explicitly. Still does not work.&nbsp;

            Hello 
<br />I'm Peter F  independent  Advisor 
<br />It’s free to forward incoming Skype calls to another Skype contact. You just need to have that contact in your contact list.
<br />
<br />To forward your incoming calls to a mobile or landline, you’ll need a little Skype Credit or a calling subscription that covers the country you want to receive the forwarded calls in. If you use Skype Credit, forwarded calls are charged at Skype’s low per-minute rates.
<br />
<br />The person who is calling you on Skype doesn’t pay anything.
<br />
<br />You can see the information in how much does the skype forwarding cost in this link below

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you sure these 'dates' that don't format correctly are really dates or are they text that looks like dates. to check lets say we have a rogue date in a1, try this</p>
<p>=isnumber(a1)</p>
<p>does that evaluate as TRUE?</p>
<p>If it evaluates as false then it isn't a date.</p>

<p>Since the cells are probably text you can solve the problem as follows:</p>
<p>1. Select an empty cell and press Ctrl+C (copy)</p>
<p>2. Select the column of dates and choose Home, Paste, Paste Special, Add, OK</p>
<p>3. Format the column to the desired format 28-Mar-10</p>

In addition to the suggestions you have already received about the cells containing text, the other possibility is that Excel doesn't recognize the values as dates.&nbsp; If you are using the US date setting, then&nbsp;28/03/2006 is not a legitimate date.&nbsp; So, Shane's
 copy + paste-special suggestion will not do anything.</p>
<p>Do the cells that got formatted show the correct dates?&nbsp; Does 2/3/2006 show as 3 Feb 2006 or 2 Mar 2006...and which one did you expect?</p>

<p>I don't know if these suggestions helped the original poster, but I have a similar problem and they didn't work for me. I have multiple spreadsheets prior to 2007 with dates I formatted using forward slashes which Excel 2007 now doesn't see as dates. Any
 suggestion as to how I could turn them into dates without retyping? To see what I mean for yourself:</p>
<p>1. In Excel 2007 type these exact characters in A1...9/16/2010</p>
<p>2. Press ENTER.</p>
<p>3. Select cell A1 and note that its <em>number format</em> is GENERAL!</p>
<p>4. Choose DATE <em>number format</em> (since Excel 2007 doesn't do it with slash delimiters automatically anymore).</p>
<p>5. Now try to do date arithmetic using A1 and it will not work.</p>
<p>6. Now try to pull down any other DATE <em>number format</em>, it will not reformat that cell to match any new or custom<em>number format</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, although it says it is a date, it is not acting like one. If you can help me make the entry in Step 1 pass the tests in Steps 5 and 6, I think I can figure out how I can change many, many columns of data from past spreadsheets all entered
 with the forward slash which seems to have been abandoned as a date delimiter in Excel 2007?</p>

When I type 9/16/2010 in A1, Excel recognizes it as a date.</p>
<p>So, there is something else going on with your computer.&nbsp; For starters check your Windows Regional Settings.&nbsp; Maybe, the date separator is something other than /</p>

<p>Thank you so much for trying Step 1 and Step 2 in my example <em><strong>(within Excel 2007, right?)</strong></em></p>
<p>My <strong>Window Regional and Language Options</strong> <em>Control Panel</em> setting is correctly set to ENGLISH (United States). The date examples at the bottom on that setting screen<em>does</em> show dashes as date delimiters but&nbsp;these delimiters cannot
 be changed independently. So I made no changes here and still&nbsp;have the same problem. May I ask if you have Excel 2007 and if you do steps 1-3 above is your entry still GENERAL? If you then do step 4 does it fail the tests in steps 5 &amp; 6?&nbsp;</p>

<p>TUSHAR,<br />
Thanks again for your help! Sorry I missed the fact you actually tried my Step 1, thanks for that too.</p>
<p>If I enter a number exactly as in my regional settings, it right justifies, calls it a DATE format and passes tests in Step 5 &amp; 6! Yeah!<em><strong>BUT</strong></em>&nbsp;does that imply I must always enter dates like that? If so&nbsp;perhaps I can change my habits
 and live with that going forward...</p>
<p><strong><em>...however</em></strong> I have all those <em>existing</em> spreadsheets from Excel 2003 with forward slashes and also, more importantly, thought I remembered<em>Excel 2003 as capable of recognizing several standard date delimiters</em> and am
 suprised Microsoft's Product Manager would have allowed that feature to be removed, so think, like you do, there is some universal set somewhere but for the life of me I cannot figure out where.</p>
<p>In any event, I tried your test, results above, does that spur any further ideas?</p>

In my version of Excel 2007, 9/1/2010 is a date.&nbsp; Entering 9-1-2010 results in Excel recognizing it as a date and changing the displayed value to 9/1/2010.&nbsp; Entering '9 sep 2010' (w/o the quotes)&nbsp;shows 9-Sep-2010 with the format showing Custom.&nbsp; It too is recognized
 as a Date.</p>
<p>You may want to check if you have the latest updates for 2007.&nbsp; What you are seeing might be a problem that was fixed with one of the service packs.</p>

<p>Tushar,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. It looks like your Excel 2007 functions differently than mine. I tried updating, as you suggested but that didn't fix it. I assume there is an environmental variable set somewhere and will probably repost this issue, trying to
 reset it, as:</p>
<p>When I type either of these entries (character by character) neither one of them results in Excel 2007 recognizing them as dates: 10/7/2010 or 10-7-2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's really odd is both 10/7 and 10-7 become dates, with Excel filling in this year. Strange, but true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            All Office 2010 applications Crash while trying to print</h2>
                    <p>I am having a similar problem with my MS Office 2010 programs (PPT, Excel, Word) not being able to print.&nbsp; I can print from other applications.<br />
<br />
I have tried the suggested fix of changing the default printer to MSFT XPS, but whenever I try to print from Office, the program goes to (Not Responding) and stays that way forever, until it kill it.<br />
<br />
The process I'm trying to use is File &gt; Print (button) but no dialog box ever shows up to allow choice of printer.</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
Let's start Word in safe mode following steps mentioned below and then try printing&nbsp;and verify the result.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>Winword /safe </strong><br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between Winword and '/'. Replace <strong>WinWord</strong> with
<strong>Excel </strong>to start <strong>Excel</strong> in safe mode.<br />
<br />
If Word works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Enable each add-in one at a time, restart the Word, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
You may also repair the Office suite following instruction mentioned in the article below and see if it helps.<br />

                    Recently I tried to link my twitch with my EA account to receive twitch prime awards for some EA games. I wasn't able to sign into my EA account because I forgot my password that I made 6 years ago when I first played an EA game that required my to create
 an origin account. That account used my default Microsoft account that I got when my account was first created. I have it linked to my outlook. I tried to reset my password for my origin account using my Microsoft email but I haven't received any email on
 my outlook. My account is part of a family account so I don't if that affects it at all. my account ends with @xboxlivefamily.com so I don't know if that changes anything but I have 0 emails. I've checked my junk email and there's nothing. I was able to send
 an email from the account but when I tried to send an email to it I got an error message stating "<span>No mx record found for domain=xboxlivefamily.com"
<span>So I don't know what to do or even where to start. any help would be appreciated&nbsp;</span></span>

<p>Thank you for patiently waiting for our response. Upon communicating with our Internal support team, the domain of the Microsoft account that you provided is not valid. We suspect that the email account that you provided is your Xbox username and not your
 Xbox email account. Make sure to provide the correct Microsoft account via private message for us to perform further investigation.</p>
