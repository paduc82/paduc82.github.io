<h2>            Outlook security issues</h2>
                    <p>When I log on to outlook email it is asking to update security. It says it will text me a code but the number is missing a digit and therefore I am not receiving the code to continue. It has let me use my email for 30days now but I can not access billing
 or security&nbsp;info until they ask me again but I am still going to have the issue. how do I change the text number so I can receive the text outlook are sending?</p>

    <title>What happened to my SENT folder on my iPhone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisagerman  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happened to my SENT folder on my iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was in the middle of typing an email using hotmail on my iPhone when my entire SENT folder disappeared? The emails contained in that folder were extremely important as I am involved in a court case &amp; all contact between myself &amp; the other party were kept
 stored on my phone as evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I use hotmail/outlook on both my iPhone &amp; my tablet, the emails that were written on my phone are not showing in my SENT folder on my tablet. I appear to have lost all the emails that were constructed using only my iphone device?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I desperately need to recover the emails that disappeared from my phone's hotmail folders to be used as evidence in the court case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I please get help with recovering the missing SENT &nbsp;folder and its &nbsp;contents? Surely since my phone was linked only to hotmail the messages must still be somewhere &amp; retrievable?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might happen due to incorrect settings in your phone. Help me with the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you experience the same issue when you log in using the outlook.com web interface using a web browser?</li><li>Are you using the default mail client of your phone or you are using Outlook.com app?</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Annanya,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. Apologies for the delay in responding but I've been away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your question's, no it hasn't happened when I use Outlook.com &nbsp;on my laptop. &nbsp;I simply switched on my iPhone &amp; the display flickered a few times and when I went into my my hotmail folders both my SENT &amp; DRAFT folders were no longer available
 or showing up &amp; the entire content had disappeared?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the default mail client of my phone &nbsp;&amp; not the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, even though it's still hotmail I'm using on both my phone &amp; my laptop, none of the emails I constructed on my phone are in the SENT or DRAFT folders in my laptop hotmail account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I desperately need to retrieve the emails from my iPhone account as they're evidence in a case. I was initially worried &amp; still am that maybe my account had been hacked to remove that evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of retrieving the missing folders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Lisa&nbsp;</p>

<h3> renee culver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Password Length</h2>
                    <p>I an so tired of Windows being made for dummies who know little to nothing about computers. MS has adopted a security policy that is both secure and simple BUT it removes humans from decision making and responsibility especially in the regions knowledge
 of the OS effects security. An example is minimum &nbsp;password length which was settable in group policies. Let me first admit that it is indeed a minor security risk. BUT let's discuss that. MS has changed the minimal password length from a settable parameter
 to an invisible fixed length of eight. How does that effect me the customer? Since the seventies I have had the same password which has a length of 6 which exactly matched the Windows minimum password length. Now the new minimum password length is costing
 me time in my life? What??? You read correctly[ it's costing me time in my life AND I've never had any security problems. I've been hit and run by an illegal alien and am an an invalid. I dont have fine muscular control on the right side of my body and where
 I was right handed I am now a clumsy left handed person. I have three systems of which I log onto systems many times per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that ms has A.) Removed a settable minimum password length and 2.) Made it a fixed 8 characters admittedly makes the system more secure BUT costs me time in my life. &nbsp;Lets say that I have three systems (I do) and that I logon many times per day
 (I do). That is a cost of one minute per day (but my system is more secure which totally worthless to me personally,</p>

Renee it's not just MS it is called dumbing down of America, it seems that big corps' and the Government don't think some of us are smart enough to take care of OUR life and things in OUR life, just like the simple pin&nbsp;number&nbsp; which hasn't worked in the last
 3 builds, yes I've tried it and it tells me to try later...well MS when is later?&nbsp;

<p>One way is to set up a table on another sheet "Variables" with a header row and column of labels - let's say, 10 headers in B1:K1 - for values that will be loaded into cell A1 of the sheet named "Calc", and 10 labels in A2:A11, for values that will be loaded
 into cell A2 of "Calc", with the final result appearing in cell Z100 of "Calc".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could use a macro like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CreateTable()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim r As Range</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim c As Range</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim shC As Worksheet</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim shV As Worksheet</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set shC = Worksheets("Calc")</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set shV = Worksheets("Variables")</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each r In shV.Range("B1:K1")</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shC.Range("A1").Value = r.Value</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each c In shV.Range("A2:A11")</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shC.Range("A2").Value = c.Value</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.CalculateFull</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intersect(r.EntireColumn, c.EntireRow).Value = shC.Range("Z100").Value</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next c</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next r</p>

    <title>How to Count a &#47;unique Series Name in Excel Pivot Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthur orville  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Count a &#47;unique Series Name in Excel Pivot Table</h2>
                    <p>I have a Pivot Table in 2016 Excel where I am tracking the amount of purchases by CustomerAccount and as a subcategory I have the product group which&nbsp;they are buying. I want to be able to count the numbere of customer account&nbsp;lines, but am not finding a
 way to do so.&nbsp;I only want it to count the number of Customer Account Names, not the number of product groups. The customer account names are all different (unique), so I need it to simply count the amount of&nbsp;Customer Accounts for the information that I have
 it filtered by. So, referencing the table below, I want to count the amount of Accounts(Rows)... Which I have put in Bold. Then, to be able to make sure that this formula will still work once I change the filters/parameters (which would&nbsp;increase/decrease the
 size of&nbsp;the table) . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

            If you're using excel 2013 or later, then you can right click on the data in the pivottable, and select "summarise values as" and then "distinct count". If it's an earlier version you can't do it directly in the pivot table so would need to calculate it
 beforehand from the input data

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, &nbsp;I just want it to count the amount of Customer Accounts&nbsp;. So, in my above example, it should come out with a value of 4 (for the 4 Customer Accounts; Arringtons, Boss Direct, Cectere, Dinwiddies)</p>

 quite common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I installed iCloud&nbsp;for windows on my laptop, and it went through setup&nbsp;no problems, everything syncs fine.&nbsp; Went as far as merging the .reg file from my laptop to my desktop... still won't work.&nbsp; I have tried a solution I found on here about downgrading
 office to a previous build, reinstalled iCloud for windows and still no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The add-in shows as active in Outlook but no iCloud tab on the ribbon.&nbsp; Please help I am beyond frustrated with this.&nbsp; I don't know what to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This screams of a registry problem to me, by no means' am I an expert but it seems like the only logical answer when I have two computers side-by-side, and one does as I desire and the other does not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>goto method not moving cursor in word doc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dsudduth  say:</h3>
<h2>            goto method not moving cursor in word doc</h2>
                    I have an embarcadero delphi XE2 app that inserts statements on lines and in fields of a word doc. This app was&nbsp;originally&nbsp;written in D2005 using Word 2k and Microsoft office 9.0 object library for use on Windows XP OS.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We recently bought some Windows 7 computers 32bit (hp brand) after setup we discovered the app does not work. The app will not insert the statements on the correct line or in the fields. Statements will only be written on line 1 regardless of what line
 is in the code. Fields do nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things i have done to troubleshoot the problem are:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Update the workstation to Office 2007 using Microsoft office 12.0 object library</div>
<div>Used a new blank word doc</div>
<div>Unprotected the doc</div>
<div>Changed parameters in the "goto" statements</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a sample of the code:</div>

            <p>Well, I have no problems if I execute your code from VBA, so we can only guess what happens.</p>
<p>If the code is executed immediately after the document is opened, try to call (the equivalent of) DoEvents and wait some milliseconds , maybe the application is not ready to perform the code.</p>
<p>And you can try to pass the argument "Which:=wdGoToAbsolute" too.</p>
<p>But I would use the Range object to insert the text, so it doesn't matter where the selection is. Below is an example for VBA.</p>
<p>Andreas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub TfrmMainInsertDate()<br />
&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp; Set R = ActiveDocument.Content.GoTo(What:=wdGoToLine, Count:=4)<br />
&nbsp; R.InsertBefore "test 11"<br />
&nbsp; Set R = ActiveDocument.Content.GoTo(What:=wdGoToLine, Count:=6)<br />
&nbsp; R.InsertBefore "test 12"<br />
&nbsp; Set R = ActiveDocument.Content.GoTo(What:=wdGoToLine, Count:=12)<br />
&nbsp; R.InsertBefore "test 13"<br />
End Sub</p>

            <p>Hi - it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sounds like</span> you are not actually copying the files,,, playlists are separate 'list' files and are just pointers to the original track location... so if you created a playlist from songs on a portable
 drive and then removed it - WMP would be unable to locate the files to play them, hence the error.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on USB sticks for cars - navigating through the files on them is a pain (and potentially distracting!) The best bet is just to copy over a bunch of tracks that you enjoy listening to and stick them on shuffle - just add new ones from time to
 time. You'd have to copy over the original files - I suspect&nbsp;playlist files&nbsp;are unlikely to be recognized by the car player.&nbsp; Get back if you need any more detail... Cheers, Ric.</p>

            Soft reset means to reboot or restart your device.
<p>&nbsp;In Pocket MSn's menu, you should have an option to switch or clear password. Select that option and re-type&nbsp;your password.</p>

<h3> vincea_990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam Mail Folder Appearing for users Exchange 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have several users with an issue where almost every single e-mail they are getting is going into a folder called 'Spam Mail'. NOT the 'Junk E-mail' folder, a folder called 'Spam Mail'. I need to turn this off for all users, but I can't find a setting for
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of notes:<br />
1.) This 'Spam Mail' folder is on the users' OWA interface as well as the local Outlook 2013 installation.<br />
2.) I have tried Outlook 2013 on multiple PC's, and the Spam Mail folder appears, it's something with their e-mail account in Exchange.</p>
<p>3.) This 'Spam Mail' folder also appears in their Outlook Web Access display, so it is NOT a localized PC issue.</p>
<p>4.) We are using Exchange 2013, not Office365</p>
<p>5.) Setting up any settings for 'Junk E-Mail Options' does not have any effect.</p>
<p>6.) I uninstalled the AntispamAgents with the scripts from the Exchange Management Shell, and it has had no effect.7.) There is no 3rd party software (that I can see) running on the Exchange server. Again, this is not a local PC issue, since it comes up
 in OWA, and Outlook 2013 installations on other PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any information as to why this is appearing and how to get it to stop/turn off/etc. it would be most appreciated.</p>

    <title>outlook.com sends emails very slowly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nibes777  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com sends emails very slowly</h2>
                    <p>I have the issue where emails, even the most simple short message with no attachments, take about 30 seconds to complete the send process - you can see it on the progress bar. &nbsp;If I'm not watching the progress bar and close the email or go to another website,
 the email get's stuck in my outbox. &nbsp;I have not sent the email I thought I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if I send an email using legacy Outlook, or Windows 10 email, it sends instantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer working with Outlook.com for several reasons but this issue is troublesome. &nbsp;Can anyone offer help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;I live in a rural area and my internet is not super fast (upload at .5 mb/sec, but this issue is relatively new (last month or two) with no change in ISP or speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Nibes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to the number of emails on your folders and internet connection. We would like to know more information about your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried using other browsers and check if the issue still persists?</li><li>Have you also tried to clear the cache and cookies of your browsers?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply to assist you further. </p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Yes, I have tried with both Chrome and Edge and it makes no difference. &nbsp;I have cleared cookies and cache and it makes no difference. &nbsp;Yes, I have a fair amount of emails and several folders. &nbsp;But why would that make a difference
 only with outlook.com - mail still is sent quickly from Outlook (Outlook 365) and from Windows 10 email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to confuse the issue, but I also wonder if anyone can tell me why the folders are not synced between all three. &nbsp;All the same emails are there but not all the same folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks Anthony but this does not answer my question.</p>
<p>I'm well aware that Outlook has more advanced features, almost all of which I do not need or use.</p>
<p>I use IMAP since I have 3 devices which need to be synced.</p>
<p>The issue I want solved is why it takes so much longer to send an email on Outlook.com than it used to take to do the exact same thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to help, but what you post is an entirely different problem, one that I do not have.</p>
<p>My issue is the actual time it takes, approx. 30 seconds, for the email to complete the sending process from my computer, as can be seen by the progress bar at the upper right. &nbsp;If I exit the program before it finishes the email sits in my outbox as a draft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the problem you sent me an answer to, that is NOT my problem.&nbsp; I can send from Outlook.com to myself and have the email shortly after it completes the send process.&nbsp; Furthermore, if you set up your account to&nbsp;have&nbsp;your emails from your other accounts
 forwarded to your outlook.com email address (rather than having outlook "fetch" them, there is no issue with the "once every thirty minutes" problem.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links above.&nbsp; It appears the issue is not just me, but everyone, and has been going on for at least 4 years.&nbsp; And I don't know how I can make it more clear than I already did, but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It is&nbsp;not instant "delivery" I am seeking, it is instant departure from my computer to the web.&nbsp; It hangs on my computer (any one that I may be using).&nbsp; Absolutely NONE of the moderator responses, including yours, will admit to understanding the problem.&nbsp;
 It is sooooooo frustrating that you continue to offer answers to questions that I have not asked.&nbsp; I just sent off an email, text only, and timed it.&nbsp; It took exactly 30 seconds to complete sending.&nbsp; If I close the browser or exit the program prior to that,
 it has NOT been sent.&nbsp; THAT is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If you note my original question, I acknowledge that I also use MS Office Outlook, I also use Windows 10 email.&nbsp; The reason I prefer Outook.com is that it is accessible from the web, and since I use multiple devices with IMAP, I can delete an email from
 Outlook.com and it's gone from all my devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You suggest that I try Windows Live Mail, yet Microsoft hasn't updated nor supported Live Mail since 2012, and MS tells you to switch to Outlook.com.&nbsp; I don't know why you would advise me to switch to a program that MS is doing away with.</p>

<p>Thanks Anthony - at least these links are very substantive.&nbsp; I don't see anything that's helpful for me as an individual home user - most of the slowdowns mentioned are more for business applications.&nbsp; But thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is what it is and I'll probably be using Office Outlook more and outlook.com less.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging in to your account, you have to use the specific credentials you created it with. If you've used the email address (Microsoft account), log in with the same. If you've used your Skype Name or phone number, sign in with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note of the log in credentials and their corresponding Skype names. It is possible that you have an account for each (<strong>email address</strong>,
<strong>phone number</strong> or <strong>Skype name</strong>). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your credits or subscriptions are in the account you've used when you made the purchase. Your contacts are also tied to each specific&nbsp;Skype account. To use the credits and subscription and to find the right contact list, you need to be logged in to the correct
 profile. </p>

<h2>            Emails forwarded from POP not reaching Outlook accounts</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook365. &nbsp;I have had an email account with Earthlink for many years and prefer to keep it. &nbsp;I have turned forwarding on at Earthlink to two Outlook email accounts and my Gmail account. &nbsp;All emails are reaching Gmail. &nbsp;Most are reaching the
 two Outlook accounts, but some are not. &nbsp;In addition, the ones that do not reach the Outlook accounts might reach one and not the other. &nbsp;I have had other instances where the emails from Earthlink reach an Outlook account a couple of days later. &nbsp;Again, everything
 is reaching Gmail, so I am confident the Earthlink side is working. &nbsp;To continue using Outlook as my main point of email processing, I must have the confidence that all emails forwarded out of Earthlink reach our Outlook accounts.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">In your response below, you ask me how many emails I might have sent.&nbsp; I probably receive and the Earthlink system would forward about twenty of my emails across a 24 hour period.&nbsp;
 The forwarding process from Earthlink might have had more, but I would not know.&nbsp; You also state that “</span><span>Unfortunately, some messages from 207.69.195.105 weren't sent</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">.”&nbsp;
 I’m not sure what that implies, but that unfortunate situation has happened several times since I’ve adopted this process allowing me utilize the power of Office365.&nbsp; Is this a higher level technical issue between Outlook and Earthlink?</span></p>

            I think I would disagree with that idea. I can log directly onto Outlook.com through my browser and the missing emails are not there. Since they are not on Outlook.com, they do not pass to Office365.

<h2>            Change email address from my skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My skype account was created with my gmail address and I used my professional email as second email. Some time ago my employer shortened the email addresses and I changed that in skype. However, very recently skype is demanding me to register again and is
 using my old email to send the verification code!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I handle this if it is sending the verification code to my old email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help.</p>

</p><p>Changing your email address in Skype, will not change your security info. Are you still able to sign into the old email? If yes, verify the account.&nbsp;Then change your security info.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10634/microsoft-account-replace-all-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a> Therefore, it will be your new email that will be used when verifying your account.</p>

<p>Hi Julie_S1,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for answering my question. The problem is that my old email does not exist anymore. I cannot get there to receive the verification code, and when I request the alternative (verifying through the internet), it is getting me nowhere, because
 the verification system requires three old passwords (which I am afraid I don't have -- I've always used the same :-o) and then asks me for three contacts in my address book (which I give), and after the whole process, sends me an email to my current email
 address saying I have not given enough info (even though I gave everything I have!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating and I am about to say goodbye to Skype forever, and change to some other communication system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I understand how upsetting it is for you to not be able to access your Skype account. Based on what you have mentioned you have done so far, you have done what is supposed to resolve the issue and we appreciate your time and effort in doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account recovery process is fully automated and the only way to lift the restriction of the account is if the information you provided on the form match the information that is in the account you are trying to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best course I would strongly recommend you to do is to revisit the answers you have provided on the form, change what you think may be inaccurate, and resubmit the form. Should that fail again, I suggest that you create a new account instead.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Clare,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Student can only view Content Library but cannot edit it and Collaboration space is a section where students and teachers can collaborate their work together</span><span>. Teachers
 and students can both view and edit the collaboration space. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d48ddefe-d660-44c8-8023-317dd7347d06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d48ddefe-d660-44c8-8023-317dd7347d06" /></a></p>
<p><span>The Teacher Only section group is a private space where only the teacher can see what is inside—students cannot see anything.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eaae2b1f-6e8b-4c6c-95fe-cb80945f6335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eaae2b1f-6e8b-4c6c-95fe-cb80945f6335" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned, students can see Teacher Only section in their notebook. Please confirm if you have created the “Teacher only “section by clicking on “Enable Teacher-Only section group” in
 Manage Notebook tab. To check this please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click Class Notebook tab on the app launcher in Office 365 home page.</span></li><li><span>Click Manage notebooks tab</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2bffdf4-8d8f-4e42-bcb8-e4a7870e179f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2bffdf4-8d8f-4e42-bcb8-e4a7870e179f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click “Enable Teacher-Only section group” in the notebook for which you wish to create the “Teacher only” section, as shown below</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9848d906-d504-43b5-8c68-ac7c4a83cdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9848d906-d504-43b5-8c68-ac7c4a83cdcc" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clicking on this link will create a new section only for the teachers in the existing notebook, students cannot view this section at all,
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to lock the Collaboration Space,
</span><span><span>then move the slider to the right to lock the collaboration space,
</span></span><span>in this way</span><span> students will not be able to edit this section but can view it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For reference: </span>

            One of the few drivers I haven't had problems with is Nvidia.&nbsp; I download the appropriate driver from the Nvidia website,&nbsp; then do the custom install which lets me choose which components to install--also check the box to do a clean install--that gets
 rid of other driver bits and pieces.&nbsp; I generally install the graphics driver, the HDMI audio and PhysX--don't need the 3D stuff nor the GeForce Experience panel.&nbsp; Important to be sure and check the "do a clean install" box on the options page of the installer.&nbsp;
 Have run with both GTX 780 and GTX 980 Ti and so far no problems.&nbsp; Wish the other W10 drivers were as stable.

<p>I have just found your post in the MSE forum where it was moved to. This is not normal behavior.</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?<br />
Any security software still installed?<br />
<span>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.<br />
You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:<br />

    <title>Excel 2010 Gridlines Disappeared, Come Back Dashed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seli lopez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 Gridlines Disappeared, Come Back Dashed</h2>
                    <p>All of my previously saved Excel 2010 spreadsheets have no gridlines.&nbsp; I've done everything that has been suggested.&nbsp; The gridlines are not white, there is no fill, I've tried&nbsp;clearing all the formatting in the cells.&nbsp; I've checked view gridlines on the
 toolbar.&nbsp; The only thing that seems to work is when I go on advanced in the options menu and I unselect "show gridlines", hit save, then go back and select it but choose a color other than black.&nbsp; But even when I do that the gridlines are ALL dashed!&nbsp; I don't
 really mind the dashed gridlines but I don't want to have turquoise gridlines and have to do this Every time I open a Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Please help, I'm going crazy!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>File / Options &nbsp;/ Advanced - "Show Gridlines" checked, but make sure your color is "Automatic" or the lines will appear as dots. &nbsp; And you may need to save your workbook or worksheet as a template to retain that look:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For a workbook template, save the file as Book.xlt(m or x) &nbsp;For a sheet template, save it as Sheet.xlt(m or x)</p>
