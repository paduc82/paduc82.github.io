<h2>            Do I own microsoft games that I bought with real money &#63;</h2>
                    . I bought Forza Horizon 3 a few days ago with REAL money and I liked the game so much that I bought all the expansion packs.And when i go in the store the following message appears above the play button:''You can play this game for now or buy to own it''.How
 should i understand that.Did i rent the game by accident or something, or it will disappear after a few months, maybe a year.This really bothers me and I would like to receive an explanation.

            That should not be case, games should belong to you and the devices you run them on.

    <title>Unable to boot to Windows in normal mode after upgrading to 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to boot to Windows in normal mode after upgrading to 8.1</h2>
                    Hi
<div>I bought Win 8 for a Win 7 Dell laptop in Jan. 2013 and have happily used it for a year. I have a Win 8 backup disc and valid license key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I decided to update Win 8 to the free Win 8.1 a few days ago and went ahead with the download and installation of Win 8.1. However, after a seemingly successful installation, set up and login, a simple reboot resulted in no longer being able to boot. I
 can boot to safe mode but cannot boot properly no matter what I do.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I obtain a free Win 8.1 disc to use the 'Refresh' option ? I have attempted to do so with my Win 8 disc but this fails with the message 'invalid media', which I presume is because my system is now Win 8.1 not Win 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div>OR</div>
<div>Can anyone please help me repair and boot my system?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of error do you get when trying to boot into 8.1 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a way to get a Win 8.1 ISO and burn it to DVD or USB Flash...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not work any better than your Win 8 disk, but it's not a bad idea to have one anyway...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try booting in Safe Mode and turn off some stuff in Taskmanager... Startup and\or MSConfig... Services.... Check the "Hide All Microsoft" at the bottom to start...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also try a Windows Update and look for newer graphics drivers...</p>
<p>You might&nbsp;look for newer ones manually, or even try switching back to the older ones in Device Manager...</p>

<div>There is no specific error message when I reboot, the OS simply fails to reach the login stage and reboots again. It then opens the 'Failed startup' page asking if I wish to use advanced options or restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried turning off all non-Microsoft software like AVG, Comodo, Samsung Keys, etc., but it didn't solve the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also noticed that Safe Mode boot fails when I attempt to boot to 'Safe Mode with Networking' but is successful when booting to simple 'Safe Mode' or 'Safe Mode with Command Prompt'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will attempt to burn that disc, thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just save the ISO to your hard drive... You can then use a burning program to burn it to DVD...</p>
<p>And you will have a permanent copy you can burn again, or to USB...&nbsp; You can even do your upgrade if you need to reinstall directly from the iso image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have something like Nero or another, you can download a free one... This one is popular..</p>

<div>Win 8.1 will not download to a Win XP or Win Vista system, it is designed for Win 7 or Win 8 only. This is what the error message said when I tried, twice, to download Win 8.1 onto my Win XP system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried disabling the network adapter in Safe Mode, it didn't fix the error unfortunately, it simply went through the same reboot process, first trying to 'Diagnose the PC' then presenting me with the 'Automatic Repair' screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for trying to help so far.</div>

<div>Thanks for your replies and my apologies for not being bale to get back to you sooner.</div>
<div>Everything non-Microsoft was disabled while in Safe Mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have now saved all my documents to a USB stick and have resolved myself to the fact that the system is as good as lost. However, I tried to reinstall Win8 with my backup disc and now it won't even allow me to do that. When trying to install Windows using
 the disc, the system simply turns off during the setup process with no warning (the system is not over-heating). Also, with the disc not inserted, the system seems to be stuck in a continuous reboot loop after showing the screen saying ' :( there appears to
 be a problem.... collecting data', etc., and doesn't even show the 'Preparing Advanced Startup' page or 'Diagnosing the PC' page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, unless anyone can suggest another way of getting this system up and running properly, I think I'm going to remove the disc and wipe it via a cable and another system then just do a fresh install of Win 8.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstalling may be your best bet at this point... especially for the long term...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to reinstall your OEM Win 7 first... I didn't catch whether your Win 8 was an upgrade, or other...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make life easier in the future, you might consider a 3rd party imaging program.&nbsp; With a image, you can have a fresh install, updated to whatever level you choose, with whatever installed software,&nbsp;and reload it into your computer in 1\2 hour or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Acronis TrueImage for a variety of reasons. It comes on a bootable CD so you don't need to install it to make or reload an image...
</p>
<p>There are a variety of free programs available that will do this... Macrium Reflect is one I hear about a lot, as well as Easeus...</p>

<p>1) reload your Windows 8 and try the online windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) if you have Windows 7 Home premium, load the windows 8 disc to install as a full version before executing the online windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p><br />

</p>
<p>**there might be a problem with your windows 8 due to your usage of Windows 8 for a year, some files might be damaged or what........a reload and retry is the best troubleshoot for such issues.</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'm trying to run two monitors in Win7 using my Gigabyte z77x-ud3h. If I install NO drivers, I get a mirrored display;
 if I install either the Gigabyte Intel VGA driver or the native Intel driver, however, I get dual monitor performance... but only when the driver is freshly installed and the computer is still on.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If I restart or reboot, Win7 "forgets" the second monitor and only uses the VGA monitor.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If I uninstall the drivers and disconnect the VGA monitor, Windows will use the DVI monitor with no drivers installed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But if I install the drivers again, Windows -- even if the VGA monitor has never been connected -- will "use" the VGA
 monitor and the DVI monitor will stay dark.&nbsp;</span><br />

<div>All that the BIOS settings do is let you set whether to initialize the onboard graphics, PCI-e graphics or PCI graphics first... useful for many, but not in this case.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Windows 10 password settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathana36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 password settings</h2>
                    I need to turn on a password for my computer without my computer actually going to sleep. i use software at work which runs through our company network. Which means every time my computer goes to sleep, it kicks me out while i'm away from my desk(which
 is frequently). i could turn off sleep for my computer which would be best. However, if i do that then i can't turn on a password for my lock screen, which i have to have because of sensitive information that can be accessed from my computer.

            Hi Jonathan,<br />
<br />
We understand that importance of your computer password and the security of your files stored. The best option for this is to set the
<strong>Turn off the Display</strong> and <strong>Sleep</strong> to "<em><strong>Never</strong></em>". This way, the running programs on your computer will continue to run even after you lock your computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps.

            that helps with part of the problem, but is there a way to setup my PC so that it will lock automatically after a certain period of inactivity? without it having to go to sleep?

<p>I've tried that, the problem though is under the <strong>Require sign-in </strong>
option, it will only let me select between <strong>never</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>When PC wakes from sleep</strong>. There isn't any option to lock after a certain period of time, unless i choose for my computer to go into sleep mode which causes several problems
 as I mentioned above.</p>

<p>I found a solution finally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to prevent my computer from going to sleep through the&nbsp;<strong>power &amp; sleep</strong> settings. but still keep an automatic lock using the screensaver. Since I'm not one for fancy screensavers, i just use the blank one, but check the box that says
<strong>on resume, display logon screen</strong>. So I now have my computer set to stay awake at all times so no more kicking me out of network based software. and I have automatic lock which is a must.&nbsp; Hope this can help some other people as well who might
 have this issue.</p>

<h2>            Why is Windows 10 riddled with so many bugs and the updates makes the matter worse. &#91;NOV 2018&#93;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a gaming laptop with latest specs and yes "WINDOWS 10 Home". It fast, boots in 2 secs and u can log in within 5 secs.. All seemed nice, until the fateful Oct 2018 updates started rolling in and things started getting messy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I started having issue with Windows Defender Virus Protection. It was saying that "Its been controlled by the organization". even though i have admin privileges I cannot get in the windows defender screen or make any changes. I contacted the Microsoft
 Tech Support and the tech guy remotely logged in to my PC and then he removed "Windows defender" from the registry and then after restarting the PC, I was able to get the control over the application. Then again it happened to me after few weeks down the line.
 I followed the similar steps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Now since the last update from Oct 10-30th in that time frame, The Windows cannot connect to certain apps which used the Microsoft Account - Cortana, MS Outlook, Microsoft Store, Xbox Live App. If I tried to go in those apps it will give the error message
 "Could not connect to the internet, seems you are not connected to the internet. Error code 0x800704cf" I looked for that code in the forums and other sites and found that many people are going thru this same issue with some people able to fix it but most
 could. I followed their steps but couldn't fix mine.</p>
<p>Then I contacted the Tech support and was asked to install the current Oct build of Windows 10 (build ver 1809) but that too didn't fix the issue. So now I again contacted the Tech support, he remotely connected to my system and did sets of procedures in
 creating a test account, local account and fixing the registry. Now things have gotten worse.
</p>
<p>a) I can no longer sign in using my Microsoft account, have to log in thru a local account. And,</p>
<p>b) Now if I sign in to the account or app it wants to setup "Microsoft Hello" , which my laptop doesn't support and there is no way to bypass it, as it seems because the tech guy exhausted all the tricks he had up under his sleeves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly he suggested me to wipe n factory restore the OS. But then again this problem will come one I start getting the sH***y updates from MSoft which will again break the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone facing this issue has a proper solution before doing the clean wipe, I am all ears. I hope this will fall in the deaf ears of Microsoft Windows development team and they will really listen to us (which i feel is a very faint chance) but i am still
 hopeful.</p>

<p>Hi EXPLODINGDRAG0N,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the dump file you've provided, the unexpected restart was caused by <strong>
ntoskrnl.exe</strong>. The <strong>ntoskrnl.exe</strong> contains the cache manager, the kernel, the security reference monitor, the memory manager, and the scheduler. It is also responsible for process and memory management, and hardware virtualization.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can turn off the fast startup feature on your device to check if this is causing the issue. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> and click <strong>Change what the power buttons do</strong> under
<strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Turn on fast startup</strong> under <strong>Shutdown settings</strong> then click Save changes.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04c28668-c9c0-4498-9650-7548678fe697?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04c28668-c9c0-4498-9650-7548678fe697?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li><li>Restart your computer and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The fast startup is a setting that helps your PC start up faster after the computer is shut down. It saves an image of the Windows kernel and loaded drivers to the C:\hiberfil.sys so it can use it later when the computer boots up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to consider are the drivers on the device. Make sure to have the latest drivers installed, as outdated drivers may cause blue screen errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep me updated with the results.</p>
<p>

    <title>Photo Gallery Viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonny73n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery Viewer</h2>
                    When I "choose default program" on selected image, "open with" pane pops up, in "other programs" there are Photo Gallery Viewer and Windows Photo Viewer among few others, but Photo Gallery Viewer doesn't have an icon and nothing happens when I choose to
 open with it. I don't know what this program is since Windows already has Windows Photo Viewer which is working fine.<br />
<br />
This is a new installed Windows 7 Ultimate, along with Photoshop CS6, WinRAR and VLC, nothing else.<br />
<br />
Could this be a virus or a bug in Windows?<br />
<br />
This unknown program bugs me a lot. It's there but it doesn't work and I can't find it anywhere. Worse, it has a common name which makes it harder for me to search for a solution.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <br />
I did a search thru registry, the only key I found that has associated with this program was C:\Windows\System32\shimgvw.dll. Tried to delete that (after backup of course) but it came right back in by itself. And the shimgvw.dll file in C:\Windows\System32\
 folder couldn't be deleted or moved.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that I have SP1<br />
<br />
My laptop which also has Windows 7 does not have this program but it also doesn't have PS.
<br />
<br />
It took me awhile to fine tune this new build. This is the only problem that I can't solve. Do I have to reinstall the whole Windows just because of this?<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />

<span><span>Folder and file permissions</span></span></a><span><span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;Here are the steps to modify ownership and permissions of folders and files:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the file or folder, click
<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>, and then click the
<strong><span>Security</span></strong> tab.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>, and then click the
<strong><span>Owner</span></strong> tab.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>Edit</span></strong>, and then do one of the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<strong><span>Other users and groups </span>
</strong>and, in <strong><span>Enter the object name to select (examples)</span></strong>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the
<strong><span>Change owner to</span></strong> box, click the new owner.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<strong><span>Replace owner on sub containers and objects</span></strong> check box.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> when you receive the following message:
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not have permission to read the contents of directory folder name. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you
 Full Control?</span></em></span></p>
<p>
<span><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All permissions will be replaced if you click
</span></em><strong><em><span>Yes</span></em></strong><em><span>.</span></em></span><em><span><br />
</span></em><span><br />
<span><strong><span>Note
</span></strong><em><span>folder name</span></em><span> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>&nbsp; Additional considerations</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assigning ownership of a file or a folder might require you to elevate your permissions using User Access Control.

<h2>            Disabling Mouse Hover</h2>
                    I can't seem to disable the mouse hover feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hover feature is&nbsp;active and selects items I don't want to be activated.&nbsp;&nbsp;A program I was installing&nbsp;asked to install third party software but before I&nbsp;could select no the mouse was hover over&nbsp; yes and
 installed the the third part software.&nbsp; I was also uninstalling&nbsp;all the&nbsp;unwanted software&nbsp;that came with my new&nbsp;computer and&nbsp;it&nbsp;selected a&nbsp;program&nbsp;to uninstall that runs&nbsp;my media.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't disable it.&nbsp; I've tried folder options, mouse options, &nbsp;and ease of
 access with no luck.&nbsp; The disable feature doesn't exist.&nbsp;

<div>Hi Keyvie,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•&nbsp;Who is the mouse manufacturer?<br />
•&nbsp;Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>We recommend you to slower the pointer speed. To do this, try these steps.<br />
1. Open Mouse by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware, and then clicking Mouse.<br />
2. Click the Pointer Options tab, and then do any of the following:<br />
a. To change the speed at which the mouse pointer moves, move the Select a pointer speed slider towards Slow.<br />
b. To make the pointer work more accurately when you're moving the mouse slowly, select the Enhance pointer precision check box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-mouse-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change mouse settings</a></div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong>Some users also fixed this issue by changing the ClickLocks settings. To change the settings, try these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, click Control Panel.<br />
2. Double click Mouse.<br />
3. Click Buttons tab, enable ClickLocks under ClickLocks section.<br />
4. Click the settings button and move the slider to long.<br />
5. Apply the changes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            maybe a&nbsp; wired or wireless mouse would solve the issue and dissabling the trackpad.

            Change the cursor pointer from Aero to Standard.&nbsp; This seems to disable the auto-open hover functionality.

<p><strong>MOUSE HOVER EXPANDS LINKS / STARTS PROGRAMS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am seeing is when I go to <strong>BIOS&nbsp;I get a repetitive dialog box</strong> as if I was holding down the enter key.
</p>
<p>Once I hit some key it stopped repeating </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I for the third time I changed my PS/2 keyboard. It now doesn't have the repeating dialog box in the BIOS and I don't have a problem with
<strong>mouse hover expanding links or starting programs</strong>. Again similar to the BIOS in that the windows system assumes that I am hitting the enter key when I mouse hover.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I am currently able me to run CHKDSK C: /r on the&nbsp;windows reboot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I still think that the keyboard problem is not solved.&nbsp;This has&nbsp;reoccurred several times.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know if there is a conflict with the PS/2 keyboard and the Microsoft basic optical mouse in a USB port.&nbsp;So I&nbsp;expect to see the error again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I will try using a PS/2 mouse with the PS/2 keyboard or a USB Keyboard with the USB mouse.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What a pain. </p>

<h2>            Profile keeps corrupting. Help please.</h2>
                    
<p>No gamer picture, achievements. Nothing shows up when viewing my gamertag. So I'm forced to delete and recover my profile, and I've deleted my cache. Nothing helps. I know my Hard Drive is fine because this appears to be some sort of glitch (I hadn't had
 this problem before), so I have no problems with my HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find any fixes for this and it's making me angry. There has to be some way.</p>

            <p>We would need to definitely rule out your hard drive as the cause. Can you try removing your hard drive, recovering your Gamertag to a USB flash drive configured as a Memory Unit, and see if you experience the issue at that point? </p>

<p>Had the same problem and it kept corrupting my profile but I finally found a solution. Do these steps and youll be fine...</p>
<p>1) Go to system settings then go to memory</p>
<p>2) Go under profiles and you will see corrupted profile</p>
<p>3) Recover profile</p>
<p>*4) This is what I recommend since the profile kept getting corrupted, MAKE SURE YOU TURN AUTO SIGN IN SETTING OFF. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do that and you should be good.</p>
