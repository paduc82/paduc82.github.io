            HI Dennis.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt;  Update History to see the latest Updates installed.
<br />
<br />Manually install from here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions</a>
<br />
<br />If you're having problems with Windows Update see I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all: 
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1903 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If you don't have Version 1903 then, yes, I would install the Media Creation Tool from this link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise expedite Windows Updates and it should bring along anything that's needed.

            I just installed 1903 for the second time. When I go to Windows Security/Settings/About, My engine version, Anti-Virus version, and AntiSpyware version all show 0.0.0.0! So, I tried running mpas-fe64.exe (released today from Microsoft for updating Windows
 Defender). I get no prompts or any indication other than the hourglass for a few seconds that the program is running. So, I waited a few minutes and checked About, no change to Engine, Antivirus, and Antispyware versions still 0.0.0.0. Any advice?

            Hi Dennis - <br />
<br />
Is any action required when you check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Defender &gt; Open Security Center.
<br />
<br />
If not I'd view it as a reporting error which are common in Windows 10, especially if you have an inferior Upgrade or Factory install (or both).
<br />
<br />
If you want to try to repair it and all Security systems are functioning, then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue
 with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Then you can ignore it as a minor reporting error unless you find other evidence of corruption.  Then I'd check over the install more thoroughly or consider doing the Clean install.  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.

<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

    <title>Touchpad problems after installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pulkit10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad problems after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 and am having trouble getting the touchpad to work properly. Prior to the upgrade, I had the ability to scroll on the touch pad and use other gestures like pinch to zoom and rotate. After the upgrade, I cannot seem to
 do any of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that this is a driver issue and have tried, in vain, to update and roll back drivers but no result. What's worse is that the driver that Windows 10 tries to install is an absolute abomination. The cursor dances all over the screen and it is impossible
 to select or click anything. I also realize that I am not the only one experiencing such issues but mine is unique in the sense that I have basic click functionality but everything else that was there prior to the update has been lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am using a Samsung SF510 and the drivers support page from Samsung for this one is absolutely dismal (</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://www.samsung.com/ca/support/model/NP-SF510-S01CA</p>
</span>
<p>). The latest update to the touchpad driver was back in 2011. The driver I had used prior to the update was "ver 2.6.0.0" by Elantech/Synaptics. It worked fine in Windows 8.1. I believe the main issue is the process "ETDCtrl" not being able to boot up and
 run the same way it did in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the following as well:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>- Running the driver and it's supporting processes/installing the driver using compatibility with Windows 7 and giving it administrator privileges.
</p>
<p>- Installing a generic Synaptic driver (v16).</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your solution did not work at all. All the hardware troubleshooter does is update the driver I had rolled-back in the first place due to compatibility issues. My problem is with the current ELAN Input Device driver being forced down by Windows 10. It makes
 my touchpad unusable - the cursor jumps around the entire screen and it is impossible to click or select anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem is that the driver that worked in Windows 8.1 (one provided by Samsung) has stopped working altogether in Windows 10. The driver relies on a process called "ETDCtrl" which fails to run properly in Windows 10 (I have tried running it with
 administrator privileges and with compatibility for Windows 7 and 8/8.1). Due to this process not running properly, I don't have access to features like touch to click, pinch to zoom, scrolling and three finger right click. They're all part of the same problem
 - the failure of the driver package to run properly on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps you understand the problem better and I do appreciate you taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same issue with the same SF510 and I resolved it by uninstalling the drivers and then installing version 2.9.0.0 of synaptics that I found on the net. It worked pretty well until Windows 10 made some updates automatically and updated the drivers,
 so I am stucked again... Hope I won't have to do this every time</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply! That helps and I will give version 2.9.0.0 a shot and see where I get with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is pushing the generic updated Synaptic driver to your machine too, I just opted out of the mandatory "driver updates" it provides. Here is a link that will walk you through the steps:
</p>
<span>
<p>http://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Scroll down to the "Disable Automatic Download of Drivers&nbsp;from Windows Update" section there. It's a bit of a pain since you might not get the latest and greatest drivers released but considering how our machines are now approaching the 6 year mark...I'd
 say we are not really missing out.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Satellite laptop suddenly goes black screen and shuts down.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this Toshiba Satellite P50-A laptop running Windows 8.1 for three years now and it has been bulletproof - I've run ArcGIS, Pro Tools, etc, and never a problem that wasn't quickly solved with a restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then suddenly this problem: </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I have running is my Firefox browser and I'm reading an email when suddenly the screen goes black - no sound, no message, no warning - then 25-30 seconds later the laptop shuts down - the hard drive stops and indicator lights go out, except for the charge
 light as I have it plugged in. When I press the power button it comes back up right where it was, on the same email, with no re-boot. Then a short time later - sometimes 30 seconds sometimes up to 3-4 minutes - I get the black screen and it shuts down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few rounds of this I tried a Restart, which it accomplished, but that didn't fix it, it still had the same problem. I've tried several Restarts with the same result. I then bought a FixMeStick and did a full scan in case there was some malware at
 work. The laptop stayed on for the 4+hours it took for the scan, but when I started it up again the problem was still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is <em>not</em> an over-heating shutdown issue - it will go black screen and shut down when it's only been on a few minutes and the fan is barely running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a bunch of searches on this problem but didn't find anything that matched exactly what I was seeing. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, JP</p>

<p>Thank you for performing the steps we have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why your system files get corrupted. The common causes are: hardware failure, hard disk corruption (bad sectors), system crash (improper shutdowns), virus or malware infections, and failed installations and updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the SFC scan failed to fix the issue, we recommend that you run the DISM tool while in safe mode with networking still to scan the image for component store corruption and perform repair operations automatically. Refer to this wiki article created
 by <em>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP) </em>for the steps to run the: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix things SFC cannot</a>.

<h2>            Creators update enforces login.live.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a local account with my Windows 10 installation (Pro, x64, version 1703, build 15063.332). This means: no domain, no Microsoft account. Connecting to login.live.com is prohibited as privacy is most important - there is too much spyware on our devices
 anyway. For a while, MSFT seems to enforce the connection to login.live.com because, otherwise, Windows updates do not work anymore. "Do not mork" means that I'm getting
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">error 0x8024402F</span> when trying to update. I've checked the firewall rules, and everything that should be necessary to make updates work, is open. In the group policies, I've enabled logging dropped packtes to the
 security event log, so I do know what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable updates for "other Microsoft products", I'm getting error 0x800704cf. 0x4cf means ERROR_NETWORK_UNREACHABLE. However, only login.live.com is not reachable, everything else is reachable, so it must work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is <em>not </em>a problem with a virus scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and ran the latest wu10.diagcab. It did it's job, but updates still do not work.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p>What can I do now? Do I have to go back to a previous Windows version? Granting access to login.live.com must not be required. It wasn't required until a couple of weeks ago - I do not exactly know when. Lately, I've been downloading updates, including defender
 updates, manually with the browser. This is not a solution in the long run, and it shows that there is no need to "login" to anything just in order to install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have a windowsupdate.log created, and all entries are like this</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Armin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A possible cause of the error you're receiving are software conflicts. We recommend stopping the running startup processes on your device then run the Windows Update again. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on your <strong>taskbar</strong> then click <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Startup</strong> tab, then click programs that can be disabled. An example of a program that you can stop. Simply click
<strong>Microsoft OneDrive </strong>then click the <strong>Disable </strong>button on the lower right portion of the window.</li><li>Retry Windows Update and see if it resolves the issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update us if you were able to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I did as you've suggested. Applications listed there are Epson Status Monitor, Nvidia Backend, Nvidia Capture Server Proxy, Realtek HD Audio-Manager and Windows defender notifications. Nothing suspicious, so disabling all of them didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several attempts to pinpoint the actual problem within the past weeks - as a programmer for 30 years I'm usually able to help myself pretty well - I've just decided to grant access to login.live.com for one single time. This is the one and only thing
 I've just changed. Effect: updates are working the first time since 2nd of May! Honestly, this should not be necessary.</p>

            Your disappointments are noted, Armin. <br />
<br />
<br />
On your statements, it clearly describes that you are not able to perform any update while not connected to the
<strong>Live account</strong>. We've tried to grab more information regarding the same concern, but we could not find any documents that we can link here as a support.
<br />
<br />
As far as we know, and how we use the latest update on our system, we're still able to get update even when we're only using an exclusive local account. Check if you can still create one local account (not linked).<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply. Using a different (admin) account, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>If I disable the "Login service for Microsoft accounts" (or similar), "wlidsvc", checking for updates immediatelly results in error 0x8007042c (ERROR_SERVICE_DEPENDENCY_FAIL).</p>
<p>If I keep it enabled and use ProcMon to observe registry access of wlidsvc, one of the keys is HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\LoginUrl, and it's value is, surprise, "https://login.live.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link to the feedback hub. I'll consider making use of it.</p>

<p>Unfortunatelly, the feedback hub is another application that would have to be granted internet access, which is just what I do not want. If reporting using a normal browser is not possible, I can not give any further feedback. Meanwhile I've tried several
 things, but I'm still forced to use a local Microsoft account to be able to update. I will continue downloading updates manually via browser.</p>
<p>A final thank you anyway.</p>

<p>I just found this post and hopefully I can add some insight for MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an SCCM admin building OS deployments for our company.&nbsp; A couple days ago I ran updates on&nbsp;my base Win10 Ent&nbsp;1607 image, took a snapshot and installed the 1703 ISO to update the&nbsp;version.&nbsp; After the upgrade was complete (no errors) I ran windows update
 again to receive the following message</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later.&nbsp; IF you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x800704cf)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the various suggestions of checking to see if time/date/time zone were correct, (it is). Ran the Windows Update trouble shooter, which says it&nbsp;fixed things but did not change the end result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated, I built a fresh image from the 1703 ISO.&nbsp; Nothing else is installed on this image, just a fresh install of a base OS.&nbsp; When I run updates I get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company network is reasonably locked down.&nbsp; A freshly built machine that has not joined the domain and does not have the proper certificates is limited to a very short list of domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the list of&nbsp;domains that we had to add to the firewall exceptions
 list to get 1703 to get updates.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks. "With a digital licence" (not linked to a Microsoft Account). I've never used a MSFT account linked to a Windows installation. Only inside a browser, I'm using this account I'm logged in with, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my 3rd Windows 10 installation on this machine. The first one was an in-place upgrade from Windows 7. Updates were working. Months ago, I've decided to do a fresh reinstallation. After that, activation didn't work even though it should. After reinstalling
 again exactly performing the same steps, activation worked. Updates still worked for a certain period of time. Then it stopped one day. I do not know when exactly, but I guess it was after one of the Windows updates. Only if I enabled wlidsvc
<em>and</em> grant access to login.live.com, it would still work (every time).</p>

            <p>- It could be due to overheating. Have you checked the cpu's temperatures ?</p>
<p>Locking up/freezing is often due to heat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Two other possibilities:</p>
<p>You Intel integrated graphics, and the 2GB RAM.</p>
<p>As you are already aware, your RAM is filling up when running the game.</p>
<p>You graphics processor is also low end, assuming you are&nbsp; using the Integrated graphics on the i3 processor.</p>
<p>While the system may be able to run the game for short periods there comes a time when the stress</p>
<p>of keeping up with the data processing become too much, so it crashes.</p>
<p>If you are already using all low settings there is nothing more you can do.</p>

            Why when I was using windows 7 and play this game I am not getting this crashes or freezing when I am playing the game in win 7 but when I upgrade win 7 to win 10 I am getting this gta episodes from liberty city has stopped responding. I have the latest
 driver for my intel core i3 hd graphics should I Downgrade to the second to the latest driver for my intel hd graphics and see if it helps in preventing getting this error. Should i try the compability mode and set it to windows 7 and see what happens

            <p>It may help to use the driver you were using on Win7, but I rather doubt it will help if the game is running</p>
<p>as long as it does before it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Win10 you first need to prevent Win10 from automatically reinstalling it's preferred driver when you
</p>
<p>reboot after uninstalling and re-installing your choice of drivers. </p>
<p>To do this, use the tool below to 'hide' the Intel graphics driver from Windows updates.
</p>
<p>I don't recall how I did this for my Nvidia drivers, but you may need to first uninstall your</p>
<p>Intel graphics driver&nbsp; and run the tool before rebooting, </p>
<p>so that Windows updates detects a missing Intel Graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS15-097: Description of the security update for the graphics component in Windows: September 8, 2015</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Note to, that the most recent Win10 cumulative update installs a large number of drivers, so if you have</p>
<p>not already installed this update, do so before you install the Intel driver of your choice, or it may override</p>
<p>the 'hide' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If Compatibility mode is going to benefit at all, I would try&nbsp; XP sp3.&nbsp; I do know that GTA4 was developed with
</p>
<p>XP sp3 in mind, as I was still using XP sp2 when it came out, and had to install sp3 before installing the game.
</p>
<p>Vista sp1 may also be good. I still have GTA4 set to XP sp3, but have not done so with EFCL</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have not been monitoring the cpu temps you should do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

    <title>Need help installing MiPony downloader in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> istern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help installing MiPony downloader in Windows 7</h2>
                    I am trying to install MiPony downloader in Windows 7.&nbsp; I get an error message when the installation begins which stays:<br />
Error opening file for writing:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\MiPony\MiPony.exe<br />
<br />
Click Abort to stop the installation,<br />
Retry or try again, or<br />
Ignore to skip this file.<br />
<br />
The MiPony team gave me several suggestions none of which works.&nbsp; This got to be a problem with Windows 7 and perhaps Net Framework 2.&nbsp; Anyone have suggestions/help? Thanks<br />
<br />

            Hi istern,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to install MiPony setting the computer in clean boot state and check if you come across the same problem.<br />
<strong><br />
Step 1:<br />
</strong><br />
Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.<br />
To find out which startup application is causing the issue, you may perform clean boot.<br />
Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. <br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)
<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
For more information on clean boot, you may visit the link mentioned below:<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note: Set the computer in normal start startup after the issue is resolved.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Install MiPony<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3:<br />
</strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
If this doesn’t help, I would suggest you to run MiPony in compatibility mode.<br />
<strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</strong><br />

    <title>Password-protected documents visible in preview pane. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristinelise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password-protected documents visible in preview pane.</h2>
                    So I just noticed that my password-protected documents are visible right there in the preview pane (guess I wasn't using the preview pane in the past). What??!! What then is the purpose of password protection? I contacted Microsoft via chat, and the tech
 confirmed that there is no way to prevent these files from appearing in the preview pane.

<p>I previously mentioned that a Word forum would be a good place to ask questions about Word.</p>
<p>Same for Excel: The experts in an Excel forum would tell you straight away that you can protect an Excel file against

            All I'm trying to say is that it doesn't help to prevent a file from opening (WHATEVER file type it may be) if you can still see the contents of the file in the preview pane. This is a problem with the very way Windows is set up, not a problem with any

            So you are correct. This is an odd situation where I had some old files I created and password-protected with Office 2003. For some reason, in Office 2010 I still needed the password to open them, but I could view the file in the preview pane without opening.
 I removed that password and created a new one in 2010 and now I cannot view them in preview. I had actually called the Microsoft help line, and the tech just said you can't prevent anything from appearing in the preview pane, so he seemed to be agreeing with
 my assessment at the time. Thanks for taking the time to help me get to the bottom of this, even though I still don't really know why it happened the way it did.

<h2>            dns issue</h2>
                    i am having the dns issue of no internet connection . I've tried your fixes numerous times (dnsflush, ipconfig/all, release, renew, etc.; and reset IPv4 &amp; IPv6 to automatic, reset router, rebooted computer, etc. I still have no connection . btw, I just
 enabled virtual wifi mini port adapter because one of the diagnostic tools warned that it was not on, and I hoped it might help this issue : struggling for 3 days now ... any suggestions?

<p>
</p><p>The more information you provide the sooner you will have a resolution (probably from someone smarter than me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you think the Internet connectivity issue is a dns issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a Dell system what is the Service Tag number?</p>
<br />
<p>Has the system ever worked properly before and if so what do you think happened to it since the last time it did work properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the system ever upgraded to Windows 10 and then reverted back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you used a wired or wireless connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If wireless do you have any other devices that are able to connect wirelessly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />

Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply..<br />

<p>You sure are trying alot of things and sometimes trying things makes things worse.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(189, 19, 152, 1)">the reason i tried the fixes i tried is that the error i received all day yesterday said 'your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (dns server) is not responding' and these were the suggested

 the device or resource (dns server) is not responding.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/793bddf1-eb53-48ca-8169-89de0e2e14ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/793bddf1-eb53-48ca-8169-89de0e2e14ae" /></a></p>

<p>Has the system ever worked properly before and if so what do you think happened to it since the last time it did work properly?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(189, 19, 152, 1)">yes : reliably, no issues! i am using a ubiquiti m2 bullet radio for wifi connection. i live on a boat and this is the best option. i recently reset the radio to factory defaults, and recall that i had the same issue when i first
 installed the device. i can't remember what i did to resolve the issue, but do remember the pain.</span></p>

<p><em>ping 192.168.1.1</em></p>
<p>sends test packets to your router. This is one of the first commands one issues while trouble-shooting network connection problems. Your router responds correctly which proves that your local network connection is intact.</p>

            <p>hello -</p>
<p>thank you for responding. in trying to resolve the 'no internet' issue yesterday, i received (a number of times) the error message: your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (dns server) is not responding; which is the
 reason i performed the ipconfig commands. it does appear that the dns error is no longer appearing, but now am receiving the message that the connection is broken. if i don't have a dns issue, and have a decent signal from the radio, what do you think is causing
 the computer to believe it is not connected? i created a screenshot of the error message and have attached it here.</p>

<p>this is a screenshot of my radio connection. one of the things i've noticed since the problem started is that the wlan transmit indicator(red flattish line on left) shows 0 or near 0 bps, even when the dbm is sufficient or even very good. i'm sure hoping
 someone can help me to resolve this : thank you.</p>

<p>I have no experience with systems that access the Internet via a radio link but my guess would be that your radio link is failing at times. To test the functionality of your network you can use these three commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>ping 192.168.1.1<br />
If successful then your PC can talk to your router.</li><li>ping 172.217.6.68<br />
If successful then your PC has a working Internet link (but could be unable to resolve names)</li><li>ping www.google.com<br />
If successful then you have a fully working Internet link, with name resolution.</li></ul>
<p>What are your exact IP settings? You can find out like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>ipconfig &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;"%Username%\Desktop\IP.txt"</li><li>Open the desktop file IP.txt.</li><li>Mark &amp; copy its contents, then paste them into your reply.</li></ol>
<p>BTW - Why did you mark ElderN's reply as "Answer" to your post while your query remains unresolved?</p>

            <p>Your IP settings are fine. I would actually select 8.8.8.8 as my primary DNS address and 192.168.1.1 as the secondary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ping tests I gave you are for future tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>if i don't have a dns issue, and have a decent signal from the radio, what do you think is causing the computer to believe it is not connected?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Just because you have a decent radio signal does not necessarily mean that every hop works. Your radio signal is presumably picked up by some receiver, then relayed on to some other station until it finally connects to the World Wide Web. If the signal
 does not make it across each and every hop then you have a problem. Your ISP should be able to tell you more.</p>

</p><blockquote>I was trying to restore system, but it says "No restore points have been created on your computer system drive."
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>You can restore your registry files manually to an earlier point by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area. Note that
 it might reset your password to an earlier value. You need to do this soom because Windows can overwrite the registry backup copy at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu.<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; /d&nbsp; Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy&nbsp; *.*&nbsp; Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; RegBack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after you hacked the registry?<br />
9. If they were made before then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One error code&#58; 0x80073cfe</h2>
                    When I put a new game into my xbox one, it starts to install but then i get a notification sating that the installation has stopped. The message is: Something went wrong, try again. and the error code I get is 0x80073cfe. I get this message also if i try
 and play a game that needs an update. I am part of the preview program, i am wondering if this is a result of a new deployment? has anybody got any idea on this?

<h2>            Windows 10 Settings won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I installed an update for windows 10. I didn't read it but it said something along the lines of "synaptic device".</p>
<p>I turn off my laptop, go to work and I come back and want to go into settings.</p>
<p>I click the gear, setting windows pops up hangs on the blue background for a moment and closes.</p>
<p>If I right-click on the Desktop and got to Display setting, the same thing happens but afterwards I get this error message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09479438-7773-4fbe-91ce-ed3fc15daac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09479438-7773-4fbe-91ce-ed3fc15daac8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Did anyone else encounter this? Could you fix it? How did you fix it?</p>
<p>From what I read online I'm stuck with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S.: Setting will open in safe mode. I reinstalled my nvidia drivers but that didn't fix it.</p>

<p>Hi Lenard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that you are experiencing issues with accessing your settings due to corrupted system files. To resolve your concern, we recommend that you run the
<strong>System File Checker tool</strong> and the <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool.
</strong>The <strong>System File Checker tool </strong>and the <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</strong> check if there are corrupted system files on your computer. If the
<strong>System File Checker tool </strong>detects incorrect, corrupted, or damaged system files, it replaces them with the correct file versions. If it cannot repair the issue, the
<strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool </strong>will try to fix as many errors as possible. To do so, kindly follow the steps in this article:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've went through the article doing the following steps with the following results:</p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow -&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Windows did not find any integrity violations</span></p>
<p><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;</span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span>&nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth -&gt; Ran successfully</span><span>sfc
 /scannow -&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Windows did not find any integrity violations</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my attempts to fix this I've found this article before. I went through it again but to no avail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I reinstalled my Intel graphics drivers as well but that didn't help either. I keep reinstalling drivers because as I mentioned everything works fine in safe mode.</span></p>

<h2>            System Cooling Policy&#58; Acrive or Passive&#63;</h2>
                    In Windows 7 Power Nanagement Advanced Settings, what do the &nbsp;System Cooling Policy: Acrive or Passive settings do?&nbsp; The current setting is "Active".&nbsp; What does "Passive" do?&nbsp; There's mothing in Help or Answers about this.&nbsp; I have two 120mm PWM case fans
 plugged into the system fan PWM power socket but they are running full-speed from startup to shut down.&nbsp; Heat is NOT an issue: no graphics card, 3.0GHz Core 2 Duo with stock clocking under a giant blown heat sink with properly applied Artic 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Temps are...,
 chilly.&nbsp; Noise is getting to me!

            i dont beleive you would be mucking around <br />
the bios can be changed back at any time you wish just note what you have changed
<br />
so if you stay with win7 you have the noise <br />
if you set the mb to smart fan the bios will automatically adjust the fan speed as needed
<br />
good luck and happy new year

            if this a machine that you built go to the bios settings of your motherboard there is an area for setting up fan speed.<br />
&nbsp;if the machine is a branded machine some will let you reset the bios and some won't<br />
&nbsp;active refers to win 7 controlling the settings <br />
passive refers to the motherboard handleing the settings&nbsp;&nbsp; SEE ABOVE

<h2>            Xbox one gears of War ultimate edition bundle</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought a brand new console bundled with the gears of War ultimate edition. My understanding is that downloads should be available for gears 1,2,3 and judgment for the 360 (backwards compatible). However I'm not seeing the downloads available anywhere?
 Am I missing something? They showed up for several other people as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They scan for new players each week and add you to a list. It can take a couple of weeks to receive the codes. If you don't see them after a couple of weeks, you can try posting here -

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;When did you first notice this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Were you able to play .wmv files earlier without any issues?<br />
3.&nbsp;Does this happen with some particular .wmv file?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Reinstalling the drivers for sound card and display card has helped few in resolving similar issue. Let’s give it a try and check.</p>
<p><br />
Here is how you do it:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device manager</a>.&nbsp; <br />
b.&nbsp;Now search for sound card/display adaptor (one at a time). <br />
c.&nbsp;Right-click on those devices (one at a time) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. (Make sure that the<strong>Delete the Driver Software for this device</strong> check box is checked.)<br />
d.&nbsp;Restart the computer. This should install proper drivers for it.</p>
<p>Refer:<br />

<p><br />
<strong>Step 2: </strong>Also check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</p>
<p><br />
Steps to check Application Event log:<br />
a. Click on start.<br />
b. In the search box type <strong>eventvwr.msc</strong> and press enter.<br />
c. Now click on Application under Event Viewer (local).<br />
d. Now look for event log on right hand side of the Event Viewer windows.</p>
