<h2>            Unable to Make a Network Share &#38; Sub-Directory a &#34;Trusted Location&#34; for Microsoft Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying this for days now, without success... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a copy of Office 2016 Professional... I also have a QNAP TS670 NAS box, running QTS 4.3.4.0516 (2018/3/15). I am able to access the QNAP NAS drive using CIFS.&nbsp; When I view the mapped share in i.e. Windows Explorer, I see the following text:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Public(\\192.168.1.42) (T:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ My main shared data volume on this NAS is named "Public" ]. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are detailed instructions available in lots of locations on the web about the use of the "Trust Center" in Office releases from 2007 onwards. I have set up Office in a way that appears to be compliant with those instructions (please see the screen
 image below), but, despite this, the process simply does not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I attempt to open a macro-enabled Access Database from a child folder within this location, I get the "Security Warning" yellow bar and have to explicitly "activate" my database.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The instructions available on line from Microsoft are pretty clear and state that the above steps should work, but they do not. Is there a bug in this part of Office 2016? [ I get exactly the same result with Office 2013 - in fact one of the reasons I spent
 £389 on Office 2016 was to try and get round this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that anyone could offer to address this would be very much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Have you tried this manually through the Trust Center in Options? Does the mapped drive appear but then still prompt? Of does the Trusted Location not stay?
<br />
<br />If you are allowed to create the Trusted Location, but it doesn't stay I would check with QNAP. I would also suggest trying to create a Trusted Location in subfolder of T not the root of T.

<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to review this for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and add a folder to "Trusted Locations" using the Trusted Locations utility itself, I get an error message in a box that has the title "Microsoft Office Trusted Location" and for which the text of the message reads,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The path you have entered cannot be used as a Trusted Location for security reasons. Choose another location or a specific folder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a number of different techniques to map to the network drive. I have mapped and re-mapped my network share. I can access the folder flawlessly using Windows Explorer, and this program describes the mapped drive thus:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Public (\\192.168.1.42) (T:)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Trust Center, I have tried using both the IP Address and the CIFS Name for the QNAP device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found advice to suggest that the problem might be resolved by editing the "hosts" file, so I modified C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts, adding in the IP address and "short name" for both of my 2 NAS boxes. I used short names of "TS459" and "TS670".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a second copy of the hosts file on my machine, in folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-w..ucture-other-minwin_31bf856ad364e35_10.0.16299.15_none_582bc98d636655c\hosts</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this does not look like a legitimate OS file and I suspect is much more likely to be some leftover of a Windows update that has yet to be cleaned up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I manually hack the Registry, I can go to :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Security\Trusted Locations\Location 0\ and I find a total of 5 keys...&nbsp; These are set as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Default)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (value not set)</p>
<p>AllowSubfolders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_DWORD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0x00000001 (1)</p>
<p>Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25/01/2018 07:12</p>
<p>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QNAP TS670 NAS</p>
<p>Path&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_EXPAND_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\TS670\Data</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, if you check, you will realise that the key type for the "Path" entry is in fact non-default - when it is/was created, this was entered as "REG_SZ" along with the other strings. However, there is a Page on TechNet which suggests that changing this to
 an Expanded String might work. I've tried it and it makes no difference. I can easily set it back if required.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a little reluctant to experiment randomly on my own from this point forward. What is clear to me is that the documentation on this topic (for example, I have a copy of "Microsoft Access 2013 Inside Out" by Jeff Conrad, published by Microsoft Press)
 is factually wrong - and following the directions simply does not work as described.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be entirely happy to run tests and experiment with "Microsoft supervision" as it were, but I don't want to poke about blindly for fear of breaking something else...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't raised with QNAP's community forums, but will do so and report back...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just in case this is relevant, when I map from my Windows machine to the QNAP NAS, I have over-ridden any default options and I use "admin" and my NAS Admin account password. The admin account has full access to everything, which hopefully means that
 any privilege-related restrictions can be side-stepped. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the operational Control Panel of my NAS, there is a dedicated "application" that lets me control Microsoft Networking. Below I document all the settings currently held...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Enable file service for Microsoft networking" [Activated]</p>
<p>Server description (optional): "NAS Server" [default value]</p>
<p>Workgroup: "WORKGROUP" [default value]</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is then a radio-button pick-list with 3 options:-</p>
<p>Standalone Server [selected]</p>
<p>AD domain member (To enable Domain Security, please click here.) [unselected]</p>
<p>LDAP domain authentication (To enable Domain Security, please click here.) [unselected]</p>
<p>Current Samba ID: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced Options</p>
<p>- Enable WINS server [unselected]</p>
<p>- Use the specified WINS server - WINS server IP address [0:0:0:0] [greyed out and unselec</p>
<p>- Local master browser [unselected]</p>
<p>- Allow only NTLMSSP authentication [unselected]</p>
<p>- Name resolve priority: DNS Only</p>
<p>- Enable Asynchronous I/O [unselected]</p>
<p>- Highest SMB Version [SMB 3.0]</p>
<p>- Enable WS-Discovery [Selected] </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Happy to experiment if you can think of options for me to try...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            I also have a QNAP NAS (though a different model). I have it mapped to a drive letter and have had no problem in setting a folder on the drive as Trusted.
<br />
<br />So I suspect the problem is with QNAP and not with Office.

<p>Hello Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought you might like to know I solved the problem this evening... In this particular case, I'm going to say that IMHO the problem/fault lies fairly and squarely with something in the Microsoft Code Base...&nbsp; Especially as I was able to fix the issue without
 making a change to my QNAP NAS... </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may recall that when I first tried to add a path to a network folder, Access basically rejected all attempts at placing anything on my network drive. My second attempt was to edit the relevant registry key directly. Both of these failed. My third attempt
 was to alter the mapping of the network drive in the Trusted Location field so that instead of appearing as "T:\Data\" (with allow subfolders activated), I changed it to show "\\TS670\Data\"...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that too failed... </p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening I was once again searching for advice on the problem and came across this thread,</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_other-mso_2010/adding-a-mapped-network-drive-to-the-office-2010/ef12d2c6-4b55-42fe-b28c-527d8da6d6fb</p>
<p>
</p><p>And although this didn't directly solve the problem, I was able to follow one of the suggestions in that thread [launch Access using "run as Administrator"] and I rather fell through this to the solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had been manually entering the path to the network folder in my Trusted Locations field, I had been using a path name that was configured in exactly the way that Microsoft Windows Explorer "sees" the folder. That is to say that the path name appears
 as:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>"T:\Data\Office Files\Microsoft Access\"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where T: is my assigned drive letter, and this is in turn mapped [in Windows Explorer] as "\\192.168.1.42\Public"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the interesting thing here is that the "Public" suffix [which is the way that QNAP "presents" or "exposes" the named share that it is hosting, is actually truncated by Windows Explorer, invisibly. So what you end up seeing, once you've made that initial
 map, is as I represented it above - i.e. "T:\Data\..." </p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I bet you can see where this is going... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back in to Trust Center, to Trusted Locations, to my existing mapped entry for this network share... I changed the entry from this:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>\\TS670\Data\</p>
<p>
</p><p>to this</p>
<p>
</p><p>\\TS670\Public\Data\</p>
<p>
</p><p>and, hey presto, everything now works... As a sort-of extra tip, I mention that I "fell through" to this solution - and this is because what I was actually able to do this time around was:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run Access as Administrator</p>
<p>2. Open Trust Center</p>
<p>3. Select "Trusted Locations"</p>
<p>4. Single-Click my "User Location" entry for the NAS box, then click "Modify..."</p>
<p>5. Ignore the "Path" value, even though it is possible to hand-hack it here, and instead click "Browse"...
</p>
<p>6. Realise that, as Administrator, I can no longer "see" my 2 QNAP network drives [which I map as Q: and T:], presumably because that mapping is done under my default, non-Administrator ID, and I am currently running Access as "Administrator" ...
</p>
<p>7. Instead go to "Network"</p>
<p>8. Double-click the "server" icon for the relevant NAS box...</p>
<p>9. Find the 5 shares that I have configured on the NAS, and pick the relevant one...</p>
<p>10. Pick the "Data" folder within that network share, to at least put *some* limitations on the extent of the trust...</p>
<p>11. Save and quit access</p>
<p>12. Re-launch access as a non-Administrator user, and observe that I get full access to the file, without the annoying warning...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is, I hope you'll agree, a pretty convoluted set of steps. It is made all the more interesting/frustrating/difficult by virtue of the fact that when mapping directly to the NAS via Windows Explorer, something in the way that Explorer "displays" that
 network drive actually suppresses the "Public" part of the network share. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this instance, my familiarity with Windows and my willingness to simply jump into the text box and manually enter the pathname was actually the cause of the process failing to map.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I will not accept that as the problem here. Rather, the actual problem is the completely
<em>useless</em> error message issues by Access, which suggests that the issue is a security problem and not because it can't find the folder. I suspect but don't know that the programmer who coded the error condition presumed that if they were unable to find
 a folder as entered, it was because they did not have permission to view it - and so defined the error accordingly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, bottom line is - this now works. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope that anyone else who hits this is going to be able to find and follow this explanation of the fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>Did you install windows recently or change rings recently? You have to wait for 24 hours as compatibility checker runs in background and new builds are targeted to your device after 24 hours. Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Dear answer.microsoft.com,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for inquiring if my question has been answered. &nbsp;Yes and no. &nbsp;Yes, your system finally tries to retrieve the latest insider build, but NO, my real problem hasn't been resolved, "installing the latest insider build". &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate others attempts to help, it is pathetic that the suggestions have all related to previous versions of Windows and not Windows 10. &nbsp;Not their fault, unless they are MS staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, seriously the error message is as dumb as the blue screen of death message;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some update files aren't signed correctly.<br />
<br />
Error code: (0x800b0109)</p>
<p>
</p><p>REALLY?!?! &nbsp;How about offering some Windows 10 method for fixing this problem, or offering to ignore the signatures, or better yet, the OS seems to know the files aren't signed correctly, how about you just fix them.</p>
<p />

            <p>It is terrible that Microsoft has not answered this yet. A friend of mine got the same problem. He had to discontinue using Outlook.com, because our country (Latvia) is not listed.</p>
<p>Please fix it, either by making the list of countries bigger, or adding the option "Other", allowing to enter country code manually.</p>

            Thank you for accurately locating the problem. There are many Windows Feedback issues where it talks about search disappearing in Start. I also figured out that if Start is set to side of my desktop, hitting WinKey and typing 'notepad' immediately afterwards,
 would not bring up Notepad in search results.&nbsp;

<p>I found this really interesting because search does work if you use the &lt;Win+Q&gt; shortcut ... so ... if I have the taskbar on one side &lt;Winkey&gt; opens the start menu without the search box and &lt;Win+Q&gt; gives me the search without the start menu. I actually
 like that, Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi, I think that EVERYTHING was better pre-Windows8, including Vista and XP. I wasn't saying the bug was better, just interesting :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft cant go back to XP/Vista/7 because they are trying to convert us into always paying windows-as-service clients ... so the rubbish that is Metro is here to stay no matter how interesting the bugs are.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows10 is mediocre at best so I might as well enjoy it's Beta quirks. &nbsp;Interesting but not better or useful.</p>
<p>

<p>i have skype for business (v16.0.4266.1001 32-bit), and this all works fine - can make and receive lync calls, attend meetings, etc.</p>
<p>when i attend an online meeting, i can see the meeting content being presented just fine. however, when another presenter begins presenting, or when sharing content is stopped and then started again, i can no longer see the content (see image below). to
 be able to see the content again i have to exit the meeting window and re-join again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas? this is really annoying!</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>Regarding “when sharing content is stopped and then started again, I can no longer see the content”, I have done some tests on my side and cannot reproduce it. I need to collect some information below to better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. The detailed steps about how you attend the online meeting, share content and then stop the sharing.</p>
<p>2. Where did you install your Skype for Business client, from the Office 365 portal or any other channel?</p>
<p>3. Do any other users encounter the same issue if you stop sharing content and then start sharing it again? If no, please configure your account on their Skype for Business clients to check if the issue occurs. Also, let them configure their accounts on
 your Skype for Business client to test it. This is to identify if the issue is related to the client or account.</p>
<p>4. Try different networks to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>We will further investigate the case after receiving the information above.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

<p>I was wondering why the windows phone or zune software does not have anything that is compatible with macbooks. Apple iPhones are compatible with Windows but not vice versa. This makes using my phone to it's full capability difficult and I was wondering
 if that is going to change any time soon because I do not want an iPhone and I don't want a regular PC computer.</p>

<p>My question here would be - do you realy need F-Secure on-board your phone? Remember that it uses RAM! More RAM and apps the quicker batt goes down. What on earth virus can you&nbsp;catch in your phone? Perhaps you use your mobile as a Memory stick then yes,
 possibility remains. If you lose your phone - accept the fact it's lost!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. in real life I'm not so pesimistic as it sounds here just realistic!</p>

<h2>            Every time I restart my computer, Outlook deletes all of my email accounts</h2>
                    I just got a new Mac Book Pro with the 2010 version of Microsoft Office. I have several email accounts that I add on Outlook. I don't have any problems adding the accounts or viewing my inbox etc. However, when I restart my computer and open outlook, none
 of my accounts are there and I have to go through the adding process all over again. I have no idea what to do to make my accounts remain after restarting my computer. Ideas?

            <p>What is the type of email account in Outlook (POP3, IMAP or an Exchange)?</p>
<p>Create a new Identity and check if this helps.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to create a new identity:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Make sure Outlook 2011 for Mac is closed.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on Applications and then on Microsoft Office 2011 folder.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on the Office folder</span></p>
<p><span>4. Open the Microsoft Database Utility</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on the + symbol</span></p>
<p><span>6. Give your identity a name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, try repair permission and verify the results.</p>
<p><span>To use Repair Permissions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Disk Utility in your Applications/Utility folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the First Aid tab and select Repair Permissions</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on the icon for your boot volume.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the repair permissions button.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even this fails to resolve the issue, b<span>ackup outlook data, then remove and re-install the Outlook.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Conditional formatting based on a range of cells</h2>
                    I have a worksheet of Student vs Subject Target Grade and Subject Forecast Grade. So one row contains Student, 20 potential subject target grades and 20 potential&nbsp;subject forecast grades.&nbsp;A student will only have up to 10 subjects with grades due to choices
 of subjects studies. If the forecast grade is higher than target then I want the forecast to turn green. If it is lower then red. I have converted the grades to numeric but can't seem to drag the conditional format to other cells in the same way you can drag
 formulas...

<p><br />
Apply the formatting all at the same time.</p>
<p>I don't have Excel 2010 but it should be about the same as Excel 2007.</p>
<p>Let's assume this is your data:</p>
<p>

<p>Forecast numbers in the range B2:B10.</p>
<p>Select the *entire* range B2:B10 starting from cell B2. Cell B2 will be the <br />

<h2>            OneNote &#34;Couldn&#39;t Sync&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>My OneNote (v15.41 for Mac) keeps going into "Syncing" then pops up the message "Couldn't Sync" at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking on OneNote online, all the changes I have done appear to be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is causing the Couldn't Sync message ?<br />
</p>
<p>FWIW (perhaps nothing), I also use Evernote, Dropbox, Sync and Box, and on the rare occasion they have given trouble, they have a log I can see (odd filename might be listed, for example).&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot find any obvious logs for the work OneNote is doing behind
 the scenes.&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone knows where OneNote logs might be found, that could help me to help myself!<br />

<p>Hello Abo Ward,</p>
<p>I tried to answer your questions one by one:</p>
<p>1. It is not possible to change the People Hub background. You can either change the Picture Hub background by long tapping on an empty space and choose the picture you want as a background, or you can change the theme from light to dark or viceversa. (And
 of course the tile colors too).</p>
<p>2. At the moment there is no such feature as a full backup of apps;</p>
<p>3. To reinstall an application you already bought, simply visit the Marketplace again and you will be able to reinstall free of charge. If the app is over 20 mb, you will be prompted to use a wi-fi network to redownload.</p>
<p>4. For contacts and general backup, I also suggest you to check out these threads:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsphone7/thread/4d38a00c-917f-497c-96b9-b60e29feb5f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsphone7/thread/4d38a00c-917f-497c-96b9-b60e29feb5f0</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsphone7/thread/61013923-59ab-4a24-becf-969db0ad2702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsphone7/thread/61013923-59ab-4a24-becf-969db0ad2702</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this addresses all your issues. Thanks a lot for your contribution to the forum!</p>

    <title>email stuck in outbox - Outlook for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twest54  say:</h3>
<h2>            email stuck in outbox - Outlook for Mac 2011</h2>
                    This started with one email message stuck in my outbox. &nbsp;Outlook continues to try to send it, but it won't go. &nbsp;I have tried deleting it and dragging it into drafts to no avail. &nbsp;If this is relevant, outbox only shows up in my list of folders briefly,
 not as a standard folder. &nbsp;So I have a short window when the folder appears to highlight the email and attempt a delete or move. &nbsp;Other emails continue to send just fine. &nbsp;I also tried to copy the body of the email and paste it into a new email and sent it,
 but now it's also stuck in the outbox. &nbsp;Any ideas?

            <p>It took a lot of troubleshooting but I figured out how to fix this when the steps above didn't work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open outlook</p>
<p>when the annoying message pops up click the little left arrow under the red X to close the window. This will bring up all conversations related to this email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open all of them by clicking on each one then going back to the list.</p>
<p>Then click the "Delete/Trash" button on the top left of each email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked for me and now I don't have that annoying message every time I open outlook.</p>
