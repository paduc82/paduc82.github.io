            You have connected the phone in Date Storage mode.<br />
<br />
This means the phone is now usable as a flash drive to windows. You can copy all your music and files onto the drive that the phone makes in windows.<br />
<br />
Try to copy something onto it using Windows Explorer (My Computer).

            Hi rudiy<br />
<br />
Go to Menu &gt; Tools &gt; USB &gt; USB mode<br />
<br />
Has your phone got "white dot" against "Data transfer" if so select "PC Suite" instead and try again.<br />
<br />
In "Ask on connection" have you got "No" otherwise you would be prompted.

According to the screenshot the user wants to use Windows Media Player for the transfers. I am not sure PC Suit mode is going to help with that.

<br />
Personally I wouldn't try to keep both Nokia PC Suite and Sony Ericsson equivalent software on the same PC, as it doesn't take much to interfere with installation of Nokia PC Suite.

            Gees guys, it the year 2008 and this is a USB device. How can it be soooooo xxxx hard to connect it to a pc. Kids toys plug in and just run why can't this phone!!<br />
<br />
Hint the message popped up AFTER I installed the latest updater software V1.4.36EN.<br />
<br />
The phone is at V 03.31 RM 289 01-08-07.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the reason I am screwing around with this at all and that is that the phone just powers itself off at any old time.<br />
Yep, just **bleep** and it is off, or it starts making a hellacous noise and I have to power it off.<br />
<br />
Oh and before you ask, yes it is an official Nokia battery, came in the box and has the holigram on it!!<br />
<br />
So, sports fans, any ideas about either of tese issues.<br />
<br />
Chao<br />

<p>Millions of Nokia users around the world use various phones with PC Suite without problem, sissues like this are relatively rare which is probably why this forum (where we are all users ourselves, not Nokia staff) might not have a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a peer-to-peer support forum like this, it is perfectly possible that there are no other users that have experienced the same issue. Nokia's customer support staff are at the end of the "contact us" link above.</p>

    <title>80GB Zune Player has suddenly stopped working after 5&#43; years of no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyliekniep  say:</h3>
<h2>            80GB Zune Player has suddenly stopped working after 5&#43; years of no problems</h2>
                    I have an 80GB Zune player, Model 1126, that has worked without issue since I first got it not long after they started making them, . Then several days ago I noticed it was displaying a screen telling me to connect the player to my PC. At the time I jut
 assumed I was overdue for an update that was required for the switch to the new Xbox Music service and didn't think much of it as my Zune Player appeared to update to a new version of it's OS. Once it finished installing and syncing the player continued to
 work without issue for most of the next day, until that evening, when the player started freezing, or lagging, whenever I tried to play any music.
<br />
<br />
Anytime I hit play on a song it would appear to freeze up, though after several minutes it would seem to "catch up" and if I had tried to move around the menu while it was "frozen" it would try and do it all at once, similar to how a computer will open multiple
 instances of a browser if someone clicks on it multiple times while the computer is just lagging trying to open the program. I tried to sync the Zune to the computer again, checked for any new updates to the software of both the Zune itself and the player
 on my computer, and even restarted the Zune Player itself 3 or 4 times. <br />
<br />
After several hours of the Zune continuing to freeze up and refuse to play any of the music I have on it, it started giving me error messages, the first being that it "couldn't access important data on my Zune", then it displayed the screen asking me to connect
 it to my computer again, and is now, and has been for over a day, stuck on a screen telling me to contact support. It would seem that the update has done something to make my Zune no longer work, but I admit that it is rather old for an electronic device,
 and it is technically possible that it just decided to up and die on me around the same time Microsoft changed their music services.
<br />
<br />
Any advice for how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated, preferably without having to send the Zune Player in for repair, but I will if I have to.
<br />
<br />
Since my Zune it not working right now I would also like to know if/how I can use Xbox Music Pass on my iPhone or Android tablet since I do still have the Zune Pass version of this software connected to my account.

            Unsure how to fix the Zune, but to use the Xbox Music service on your iPhone or Android tablet, you'll need to download the Xbox Music app for those devices, sign-in with your account and your good to go.

<h2>            Onenote 2016 - Outlook dates with custom dates not showing correct date in Tag Summary</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just started using Outlook2016 and Onenote 2016 and starting to use tags for the first time. I really need due dates on my tasks so that I can plan my workload so I'm using the "Outlook Task" option. I am chosing the Custom Date option and selecting a
 suitable Due Date in the task window that pops up, saving the changes and closing the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to my Tag Summary, the tag shows in the list as "No Date" which isn't right. I have tried creating outlook tasks from within Onenote2016 selecting one of the predetermined options such as "Tomorrow", "Next Week" etc and these correctly show in
 my tag summary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have the same problem and if so is there a workaround or fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gavin</p>

            Hello !
<br />
<br />I'd be a good idea to repair  Office , following these steps :
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Open up the Control Panel on your PC (and show All Control Panel items, if necessary) and click on Programs, then Programs and Features. 
<br />Find Microsoft Office in the list and highlight it .Also say Microsoft Office 365
<br />Click Change. 
<br />Select Quick Repair and Repair then follow the prompts. 
<br />
<br />Hope it helps , plese let us know if it worked !!
<br />

            This is now resolved. It turns out that it takes a few minutes to sync, until that time the custom dated tags don't show the correct date...just needed a little bit of patience for it all to sync up

<h2>            Creating a meeting without being a participant</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sometimes I need to create meetings for others that I am not participating in myself. I don't have access to their calendars to create it with one of the participants as organizer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to not be the organizer of a meeting I create?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, is there a way to mark myself "Free" during that time without that effecting everybody else's invitation as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 710</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a old Nokia Lumia 710 running Windows Phone 7.1.</p>
<p>It has been running quite happily for many years. Contacts, spreadsheets, documents, notes, etc, all syncing with my Windows Live account.</p>
<p>I recently had to do a factory reset and now none of the Windows Live features work. Crucially I can not load my contacts on to the phone.</p>
<p>The phone's data connection is fine and various other internet features work.</p>
<p>I deleted the phone from my Windows Live account but this did not help.</p>
<p>Is there something in the set-up I may have overlooked or is this just MS shutting down services to these old phones?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

</p><p>Support for WP7 devices like your Lumia 710 ended back in 2014. You can no longer set it up with a Live account, the store does not work either.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>The phone was syncing to Windows Live up to a few days ago - before I did the factory reset. So was MS not actively removing old phones, just preventing 'new' old phones from registering?</p>

<h3> raevyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trendline Not Appearing in new version of Excel &#40;2007&#41;</h2>
                    When I open an excel file that was created using Excel 2003 with my newly updated Excel 2007, the trendlines do not appear and the equation displayed for the trendline is garbage.&nbsp; Is there a setting to correct for this?&nbsp; I have tried re-adding a trendline,
 but nothing happens.&nbsp; I can go and make a new chart and the trendline option works fine, so there is something that is making the original chart/trendline not work properly in the new version of Excel.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; There are about 50 plots that I need trendlines
 for and I hate to have to redo all of them if possible!

<p>This is not the way Excel 2007 normally behaves. Do you have the lastest service pack (SP) installed?<br />
Have you tried hiiting F9 to cause the worksheet to recaculate?</p>
<p>You say the trenslines are garbage: the first release of Excel 2007 had a tendency to drop the first coefficient from trednline equations but the last SP fixed that.</p>
<p>If you want to visit my website to get my email address I would eb happy to look at your workbook</p>
<p>best wishes</p>

<p>If you have SP2 installed as Bernard suggested and you still have these problems:</p>
<p>Tell us the step you go through to add a trendline and the equations.&nbsp; Then tell us the "garbage" you are getting for the formula and what you got when you did it in 2003.</p>
<p>Since these are 2003 files - is the file in Compatibility Mode or have you converted them to 2007, saved, closed and reopened them?</p>
<p>Test 1 chart by replotting it from scratch (delete it) and see if it works - is the trend line correct? is the formula correct?</p>
<p>Let us know and maybe we will be able to help.&nbsp; I'm working today so I won't be back for another 6 hours, but someone else may help.</p>

There is a warning at the bottom of the screen that says "Do not disconnect your phone or turn your phone off. Disconnecting the cable will cause severe damage to your phone and it may stop working"<br />
<br />
What should I do?

            Do you have a good net connection? If the update is on-going do not touch or do anything with the pc. The phone will definitely brick if you d/c it.

    <title>lumia onenote sync settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave11---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            lumia onenote sync settings</h2>
                    Is it possible to adjust the phone sync settings so onenote only syncs every few hours, so that any errors are not instantly replicated on the sync copy? I have a Lumia 1020.<br />
<br />
This post relates to a problem described in another post (onenote syncs and backups) which no one has replied to, so I am breaking the issue down into smaller chunks. Please help.

            Thanks. I wonder if there are any sneaky ways to achieve the same thing - eg what happens if we use flight mode or battery saver mode? Or having ' data turned off'? What does that mean? Thanks

<p>If you have no working data connection, then obviously Onenote will not be able to sync the file on the phone to the cloud.</p>

    <title>Unique Link for each OWA email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gttg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unique Link for each OWA email</h2>
                    <p>One of the nice things in GMail is that it's easy to link directly to an email no matter what label/folder it's archived to.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can we get direct links to emails in OWA?</strong>&nbsp; Currently OWA does provide a link to an email in a particular folder, but if it is moved (from say the Inbox to Archived) the link completely changes - almost like it's a new email.&nbsp; Having direct
 links to emails is a great way to keep track of certain contextual emails in OneNote or other note apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi GTTG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not feasible to get direct links to emails in Outlook Web App(OWA) like Gmail. As a workaround to track certain email, you can flag the, or create a specific folder to track the emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only MS Office 2013 uses am MS Account that you may have created when you purchased Office 2013</p>
<p>There is no MS Account for Office 2007, you only need the Office 2007 Key.</p>
<p>If this is a new PC on which you installed Office 2007 its possible that a preinstalled MS Office Trial is causing the problem.</p>

            <p>Office 2007 doesn't work this way. To activate it, you need a license key, usually printed somewhere on the packaging if you installed from a DVD or sent to you in an email if you installed from a download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to create new documents and save them, then Word appears to be working. The fact that you can no longer open and edit them indicates that something else has gone wrong. If you can open Word at all, click on the
<strong>Office Button</strong> and choose <strong>Word Options</strong>. In the <strong>
Word Options</strong> dialog, choose <strong>Resources</strong> and click <strong>
Diagnose</strong>. This will repair the Office installation.</p>

    <title>MS Office Outlook 2010 Mailbox Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c j austin  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office Outlook 2010 Mailbox Size</h2>
                    <p>I got an email saying that my current mailbox has less than 5% capacity.&nbsp; Not sure if it is my 2 Outlook email boxes or the Hotmail boxes that my emails flow from into my Outlook email boxes.&nbsp; The email goes on to say that I can double the current capacity
 of the mailbox to 20GB free of charge and includes a webpage to click on.&nbsp; The email purports to come from Windows Live ID Customer Support from The Outlook.com Team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a legitimate email or should I just go into my Hotmail accounts and spend the afternoon deleting messages?</p>
<p>Since I rarely go into the Hotmail account,&nbsp; the 95% used capacity could very well refer to the Hotmail accounts - not my 2 Office Outlook email accounts.&nbsp; I don't want to report a possible phishing attempt to Microsoft if this is a legitimate message.</p>
<p>

</p><p>If you are indeed reaching the default mailbox size limit (which is indeed 10GB for Outlook.com), you should also get a notification of it when you log on to the Outlook.com mailbox in your browser. Notifications you receive by email from Microsoft are usually
 also marked as such in Outlook.com with a Trusted Sender shield.</p>

    <title>After Importing data into MS Access DB table, queries show no results - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After Importing data into MS Access DB table, queries show no results</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello, I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me with this please?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'm a beginner VBA coder who has been using a lot of templates from the internet to develop my VBA code and sort of patching them together.&nbsp; I apologise that I'm really unaware of how to structure my code and how to lay it out fully
 for neatness, but I'm learning :-) Anyway, here's my problem:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two pieces of VBA code in an MS Access Database.&nbsp; One for exporting data from a table to a MS word document (containing only a bookmark) and then another piece of code to import the data back in.&nbsp; Upon importing the data back into my database table,
 the queries I have developed to process the results, show nothing, there are no results whatsoever.&nbsp; It's as though the data imported into the database table either isn't there, or the data in the table is a format which the queries can't use to process the
 results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, in the MS Word document there is only a Bookmark which the export code uses as a sort of placeholder for where I generate a table and then insert the records, one by one into table cells.&nbsp; Both pieces of code do exactly what I want them to
 do, but now the queries don't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the export and import code:</p>

            Hi David, I'm an independent adviser and will try to help. 
<br />
<br />But I'd like to take a step back here. Throwing code at a problem is not always the best methodology. Why are you using Word at all? Why not use an Access Report? Why would you import data back from a Word document? If you give some more background of what you app does we may be able to help more.

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the reply! I maybe haven’t explained my point clearly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code imports and exports the data perfectly. The data that i expect to be transferred, is transferred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The data is there, when i go to the table, i can see the data that i expect to be there.<br />
2)If i generate a query using only the data imported, so for example table “X”</p>
<p>
</p><p>select *</p>
<p>From X;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this returns all expected results, so all records. If i include other tables there are no results. for example if i have “a” in one table and then “b” from another table, but they are identical i receive no results if i were to create a query which includes
 the selection of fields from both fields, from both fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>hi Scott, thanks for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree throwing code isnt always the best! The idea for my database is: A user enters data into the database that needs reviewing, due to quality assurance, and industry standards. If there are multiple users, then each user has to export their data for
 review. This data needs to be imported back into the database. I have managed to create code to export code to review in ms word, but as soon as i import the data back into the database, the data seems to be invisible. Unfortunately, my boss wants the data
 to be exported to ms word, because he likes microsoft products and probably doesn’t anticipate that there might be other products out there that do an easier job. Thanks!!</p>

            Does your boss require Word or just Microsoft products? It would seem to me that Excel would be a much better option than Word. I also don't understand why the data needs to be exported for review, why can't it be reviewed in the database? 
<br />
<br />Finally, after doing the import have you checked the tables directly to see if its there? Are you replacing the exported data or importing as new records? 
<br />
<br />Frankly, I think you are making this process more difficult than it has to be.

<p>Hi Scott,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boss is insisting on Microsoft Word, mostly due to the Spell check and Track Changes facility.&nbsp; I do know that Excel has a "spell check" functionality, but no Track changes.&nbsp; The data needs to be exported out of the database and to a different piece of
 software such as MS Word so that a reviewer can clearly make changes/ add comments/check spelling and grammar etc.&nbsp; The track changes functionality in Word is perfect for this, because when the reviewed work is then sent back to the original user, or even
 another reviewer, they can check that what has been changed is indeed correct.&nbsp; Track changes highlights specifically what has been changed.&nbsp; Reviewed in the database means that any changes are not trackable.&nbsp; I could change anything in any table and you wouldn't
 really know what had been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data needs to be reviewed because the work we do needs to be held to a quality assurance standard.&nbsp; We have audits every year, to show that we externally and internally review our work.&nbsp; We have other companies review our work and we have our own people
 review our work, to check and double check and triple check that the work we have done is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, the export and import code works well.&nbsp; I have checked that the data is exported to MS Word (I have checked this data to see if it matches with my table in ms access) and when I then import the data back in to MS Access (with any changes in the
 table) the data is imported back in with 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the export and import- I export data from Table A, but then import to Table B (both tables in MS Access).&nbsp; this is to keep yet another record of the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably not the best way of doing things, but it's what my boss wants and he pays my wages :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there is any other information I can provide, thanks again!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tom,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was speaking with my colleague and he says that i have string data that looks exactly the same but a query with an equals between two identical pieces of data yields no results. So, if I were to create a query such as:-&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT [ASME Reqts_PostReview].[Technical Element], [Technical Elements].[Technical Element]</p>
<p>FROM [ASME Reqts_PostReview], [Technical Elements]</p>
<p>WHERE [ASME Reqts_PostReview].[Technical Element] = [Technical Elements].[Technical Element];</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have two tables, </p>
<p>
</p><p>[Technical Elements] with a list of Technical elements.&nbsp; This is a list of ALL Technical Elements. Sample data includes AS, L1, T1, etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ASME Reqts_PostReview] with a number of other columns but also with column [Technical Element].&nbsp; This table contains a SUBSET of the Technical Elements that are contained in the [Technical Elements] table in MS Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have identical Technical elements in each so the technical element&nbsp; "AS" in both tables, yet does not feature in my query above.&nbsp; I get NO results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an issue with the text/strings in [ASME Reqts_PostReview] being a different type?&nbsp; Hidden characters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Let me respond first by saying that VBA is different with each application. So Word VBA differs from Access VBA. I'm an expert on Access and not so much with Word. So if you want to end this I understand.
<br />
<br />But you didn't answer why you think the data is disappearing. You said the Import is working, so I'm not understanding where the problem is. For me to help further, I need to understand where the problem is.
<br />
<br />However, you ae not correct when you say that Access cannot tack changes. I wrote a Blog article (<a href="https://scottgem.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/audit-trail-using-data-macros-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://scottgem.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/audit...</a>) showing one way to track any changes made to a field in an Access table and store that change. But if you have external checkers, then  that would make that impractical. 
<br />
<br />But you CAN track changes in Excel. See this article <a href="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/ms-office-tips/track-changes-in-excel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.online-tech-tips.com/ms-office-tips...</a>.

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you!<br />

I understand that Reading List app not showing anything. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps. Thanks!

            Thank you for your prompt response.&nbsp; I installed the AVG after the MS security alert problem occurred in order to determine if there was any potential malware that was specific to MS Essentials.&nbsp; AVG found no issue.&nbsp; As soon as I installed the AVG, the
 MS security alert issue was resolved. I then uninstalled the AVG program using the AVG uninstaller.&nbsp; When I started the computer, the MS Essentials security alert reappeared immediately.<br />
<br />
Recapping:,the problem existed prior to installing AVG, went away once AVG was installed and appeared again once AVG was uninstalled. I also subsequently used the MSE troubleshooter analyzer and malware programs.&nbsp; Neither detected issues; however, the problem
 persists. Any other insights?<br />

            <p>Are you sure that you ran the AVG uninstall tool after uninstalling AVG. A normal AVG unstall leaves **** behind which requires using the additional removal tool. Then try uninstalling and reinstalling MSE. get it here</p>

            The MSE history shows no "quarantined items", no "allowed items", no "all detected items".&nbsp; I uninstalled MES this afternoon and then reinstalled it.&nbsp; The Windows Security Alert (white check mark in red ball) that was on my desktop tray disappeared right
 after reinstall; but, it reappeared soon thereafter.<br />
<br />
One further piece of background.&nbsp; I have had MSE for over a year.&nbsp; The problem with the security alert that directs me to the&nbsp; Security Center and the notice that the "Virus Protection" is turned off only began occurring in the past two weeks.<br />
<br />
The real question is this: is the "Virus Protection" really turned off or is this an MSE software anomaly. MSE control panel tells me that "Real Time Protection" is on &amp; that "Virus and Spyware definitions" are "up to date".&nbsp; That icon in my desktop tray displays
 a white check mark on the green icon ground and relays "PC status protected" when you hover over it<br />
<br />
What really complicates the matter for me is that auctionflex, my auction software, which is a rather complex and sophisticated program has conflicts with many common anti-virus programs.&nbsp; They (auctionflex) recommend using MSE exclusively as it appears to
 have no conflicts with their product.&nbsp; If that were not the case, I would simply uninstall the MSE and choose another program like AVG.&nbsp; As it is, I'm forced in to using MSE because I cannot do without auctionflex.&nbsp; It is an integral part of my business.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the interest and input.&nbsp; If anyone else has any suggestions I'd appreciate any insights<br />

<br />
Thanks for your assistance.&nbsp; Per my previous posts, I uninstalled AVG using the AVG uninstaller.&nbsp; I then uninstalled MSE.&nbsp; I then reinstalled MSE from the MSE website.&nbsp; For a brief period after restart, the security alert icon disappeared.&nbsp; Not long thereafter,
 it reappeared with the same warning that the virus protection was off.<br />

I generally do not use IE; however, the security icon in the system tray never varies regardless of the browser I use.<br />

            <p><strong>@Bill WDH <em>only</em>:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. Was <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> (MSE) <em>originally</em> (i.e., the very first time you installed it over a year ago) offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>...[I'd] had MSE [installed]&nbsp;for over a year. The problem with the security alert that directs me to the&nbsp; Security Center and the notice that the "Virus Protection" is turned off only began occurring in the past two weeks.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>1b. Did the behavior start on or shortly after 25 September 2012?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1c. Was it&nbsp;brand-new computer when you got it or a used computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you <u>first</u>&nbsp;installed MSE over a year ago</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2744842 [<em>or KB2722913</em>], KB2723135, KB2705219, KB2712808, KB2731847 and possibly KB2736233;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2698365, KB2691442, KB2655992 &amp; KB2719985;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) KB2707511, KB2676<u>562</u>, KB2659<u>262</u> &amp; KB2686509;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) KB2653956; KB2661637, KB2598479, KB2631813 &amp; KB2585542</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) KB2393802 <em>and especially <strong>Update for Windows XP (KB971029)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6a. Is Java Version 7 Update 7 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;(<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6b. Is Adobe Flash Player v11.4.402.278 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;(<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7a. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7b. Is IE8 working OK if you choose to use it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner
<em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> or <em>a clean install</em> of WinXP on&nbsp;the computer--in-question&nbsp;for any reason?</p>

    <title>Issue with Network Card settings after upgrading to TPB 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue with Network Card settings after upgrading to TPB 10041</h2>
                    <p>I was notified of a new TPB late last week. Everything appears to have upgraded in place just fine. However, I cannot now get into the properties of my Network Card, when I right click on the optiont to "Change Adapter Settings" then right clikc on my "Ethernet"
 adpater (Realtek PCIe GBE Famaily Controller) and goto to properties I get a warning window that says "An unexpected error occurred." and just an OK box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I try yo modofy my settings on the NIC, I cannot get to the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried through Powershell yet, but I should not have to do this to change the details on my NIC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to uninstall and reinstall the NIC as I thought I would flag this error because this is what Beta testing is about, Id rather flag it and see if it's a real issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feed back would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to check the NIC properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to uninstall the NIC and reboot&nbsp; the computer, it just states that "An unexpected error occurred", it might be caused due to driver update or driver corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the device from device manager and reboot&nbsp; the computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about how to uninstall refer to the below article:</p>

            <p>actually I have similar problem. Today updated from 9046 (cant remember for sure, some build before 10xxx) to 10049&nbsp;and since then I cannot change ipv4/ipv6 settings on Ethernet adapter. Properties button just remain grey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to uninstall NIC, reboot but still not working. (Actually after that dhcp didn't pick up any settings so I had to set everything with netsh to get online again.)</p>
<p>So netsh works but not the GUI.</p>
<p>Win10 is running as virtual.</p>
