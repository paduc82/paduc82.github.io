<h2>            pictures have .pds file extension</h2>
                    How in the world can I get them changed back to what they were in XP and Vista?&nbsp;&nbsp; and please, don't ask me what they were. &lt;G&gt;&nbsp; I'm assuming .jpgs.&nbsp; I made a sheet with pictues and wording for a wrestling tournament for a scrapbook.&nbsp; I've searched on the
 net for .pds file extensions to no avail.&nbsp; I've never seen this file extension before.

            The most common application I know with the .pds file extension is PowerDirector (by Cyberlink) used for editing video and authoring DVDs. In fact, pds stands for PowerDirector Script, a format used for saving PowerDirector projects. PowerDirector projects
 can contain both static images (e.g. jpg files) as well as motion pictures in various formats.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers part of the question (what pds file extension is) but I am at a loss with your first question. If you could open the files in XP and Vista, surely you must have installed the relevant application (most likely PowerDirector); You should do
 the same on Windows 7 since .pds files have nothing to do with Windows (be it XP, Vista, or 7).

<h2>            File transfer freezes the process</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having wierd issues with file transfer. &nbsp;Im using windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While transferring files between two NTFS drives the file explorer process speed suddenly drops from full speed, about 120mb/s to 0. The file transfer process under windows explorer tree in the task mananger stops responding and the drive where the file
 is located becomes really sluggish/unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happend with two different files. Although file transfer works great for everything else, files that are larger and smaller. What's interesting is that the speed always drops at the same spot in the file transfer process. Different between the problematic
 files but same for a specific file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get logs like this:</p>
<p>The program explorer.exe version 10.0.14393.953 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Security and Maintenance control panel.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. However it did not solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might add that i have scanned both hard drives for bad sectors and checked that windows updates are up to date.</p>
<p>Also it is the same two files that cause trouble. Can a regular video file disrupt the OS that much or is it 100% the OS problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open for more suggestions :)</p>

    <title>.Wri is a Text-Only Format&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daddyman  say:</h3>
<h2>            .Wri is a Text-Only Format&#63;</h2>
                    I find Wordpad really handy for short documents where I only need basic formatting.<br />
<br />
The default file extension for Wordpad is .rtf, however, .rtf files open in Word on my computer. If I try to save a Wordpad file as .wri - so it will open in Wordpad by default - I receive a message saying that .wri is a text-only format. And sure enough, if
 I save the file as .wri, the next time I open it the document is text-only.<br />
<br />
Curiously, if I save a Wordpad document as .rtf, and then change the file extension to .wri, the file will open in Wordpad with formatting applied. So, depending on how it's created, a .wri file is either text-only or formatted.<br />
<br />
How can I save a Wordpad file as a .wri with the formatting preserved?

<p>I've got bad news...for myself.</p>
<p>I found this on Microsoft's website:</p>
<p>"WordPad can be used to open and save text documents (.txt), rich text files (.rtf), Word documents (.docx), and OpenDocument Text (.odt) documents.
<em>Documents in other formats are opened as plain text documents</em> and might not appear as expected." (The emphasis is from me.)</p>
<p>URL: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Using-WordPad</p>
<p>Therefore, I can save Wordpad documents as .rtf and then change the file extension to .wri; or set .rtf files to open in Wordpad by default.</p>
<p>I have decided on choice #2.</p>

<p>Hope this is the right place to post this. My screenshots are not uploading to my OneDrive account now. I go to "share", and select OneDrive, and it tells me the screenshot should be there in a few minutes, but they never show up. I tried uploading multiple
 screenshots last night, and after 12+ hours they still aren't there. The last time I used it was the day Fallout 4 released, and it worked just fine at that time. I'm going to Files &gt; Pictures &gt; Xbox Screenshots, and my old photos are there but the new uploads
 do not show up.</p>

<h2>            Reset display settings, windows XP</h2>
                    My display settings have gotten all out of whack.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with screen resolution, but my fonts are too small, my background picture will not center.&nbsp; No matter which picture I choose, it pushes it down into the the bottom right corner of
 the screen.&nbsp; I would like to reset all "personal settings" if possible.

            Hi reid4par,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope&nbsp; you are doing good. To change the display settings you can try the following steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Dispaly adapter:</span></strong><br />
You can uninstall and re-install the display adapter. To do that<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click on start, then click on run.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Type devmgmt.msc and then press enter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. The device manager will open and you will see the display adapter listed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Right click on the display adapter and click on uninstall.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>If the above steps do not work you can try the steps in the KB article below</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310543</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can also download and install the latest drivers from your computer manufacturers website or from the display adapter manufacturers web site.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the KB article does not work, you can try restoring your computer back to an earlier point of time when it was working fine. To do that you can follow the KB article below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please read the article carefully before doing the system restore.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can also try the windows XP forums and answers at<br />
<br />

<br />
You can check the link as well as the solution centers.<br />
<br />
I hope these steps will help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Looking forward to tour reply.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

<p>There's no Quick Launch bar in Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are two ways to use the taskbar to get quick access to a folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag the folder to the taskbar, which pins it to Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Then, right-click the Windows Explorer icon in the taskbar to get the jump list, which includes pinned folders and frequently accessed folders.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Create a toolbar for the folder:<br />
<br />
a. Right-click the taskbar.<br />
b. Click <strong>Toolbars &gt; New toolbar</strong> .<br />
c. Browse to the folder and click <strong>Select Folder</strong> . </li></ol>

<p>Two possible approaches.</p>
<p>1) Try swiping up on the screen.</p>
<p>2) Cover the camera lens before powering up. &nbsp;If it doesn't see u it should give u other login options.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. That does not work. Blocked for to many sign in tries. I can see the sign in text but nothing pops up to choose pin. I swipe up to get to sign in options. Still stuck.

            <p>First do a 30 second power button press to be sure the sp4 is fully shutdown.&nbsp; Then cover the camera lens at the top of the display before powering up and keep it covered when powering up, the login screen should not see you and display "looking for you"
 at which point a swipe up should work and the next screen should have&nbsp; "sign in options" .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please be more descriptive about what happens and what you see when you try this approach if it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also did you setup the sp4 to login with a Microsoft account or a local account?</p>

    <title>Caret browsing setting in Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> readyornot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caret browsing setting in Edge</h2>
                    Where's the setting in Edge to turn on caret browsing? It used to be under More &gt; Settings &gt; View advanced settings, but it's not there in my current version of Edge (v38.14393.0.0). Did MS remove it? I know I can use F7 as a keyboard shortcut but I'm
 looking for the place where I can visually toggle the setting. Thank you in advance for your help.

            @Mike_Keys, thanks for replying but those instructions don't work. As I mentioned in my original post, when I look under
<strong>View advanced settings</strong> as described in the article, the <em>Always use caret browsing
</em>setting isn't listed there anymore (it used to be there when I looked several months ago). Do you know where it got moved to?

            <p>Are you aware that when you turn caret browsing on with F7 it stays on - even if you shut down Edge and open it again - and you can then turn it off again using F7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That functionality makes having a separate toggle button a redundant option, which I guess is why there isn't one anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F7 gives 100% of the functionality you'd have with a toggle button, and it is less hassle to use unless someone only had the use of one hand.</p>

            Yes, as I stated in my original post, I'm aware of the F7 key. Nevertheas, for reasons too involved to get into here, I'm looking for a "visual" setting within Edge to turn this feature on/off, like the caret browsing toggle switch that used to be in the
 Setting menu&nbsp;

            <p>Please don't think I hadn't seen that. I was simply pointing out that F7 does exactly what a screen-based toggle would do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, as you have surmised, there is no such screen-based option at the&nbsp;moment, probably for the reason just mentioned.</p>

<h2>            Skype won&#39;t let me correct email address for security verification code</h2>
                    I recently updated windows 10 which required me to revalidate my skype login.&nbsp; Unfortunately when doing that I accidentally put a . in my email address that is part of the verification process.&nbsp; Therefore I an not getting any of the verification emails.&nbsp;
 There is an option to click and "correct" typos in the email address however whenever I try to do that it comes up with an error that I already renamed this account.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a vicious circle.&nbsp; Anybody know how to get through this roadblock?

<h2>            XBOX Live Family Account - Adding a childs current gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I just upgraded my xbox live gold account to an xbox live gold family account.&nbsp; In the process of adding my son to our xbox gold family, it never gave me the option of adding an already existing gamertag.&nbsp; It just assigned him a new gamertag and windows
 live ID.&nbsp; My son has had an xbox live membership for about a year.&nbsp; It just expired.&nbsp; Instead of renewing his gold account membership, I upgraded mine to the family account.&nbsp; Is there a way for me to add my son's original gamertag to our new family account?&nbsp;
 Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

    <title>Unable to play Original Fable and Morrowind - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lordalucard iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to play Original Fable and Morrowind</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a big issue with the Marketplace version of Fable. I purchased it for like $10.00 and it will not play. the original message was for me to download it again and that would solve the problem. after 4 tries downloading the game it still will not
 work. Now I have contacted XBOX support over the phone they were very friendly and shared a few other options. Option 1 : delete system cache 3 times and restart, download again/ this option was intriguing but it failed. Option 2: Delete System cache then
 delete all system Updates, unplug internet and router for 15 seconds, turn back on. wow a bit extreme but that failed as well. Option 3: Create another Profile do a license transfer for the game over to the other profile and now it should work. that failed
 as well. I hope someone can help me out with this.</p>
<p>Also on a side note that Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind will not play either although I don't know if they are related in anyway... No disc Error. console telling me to download the game again... ?</p>

<p>Knock offs can look very official, but it doesn't mean they are. What console are you using (the older models or a Slim)? What size hard drive? Did you purchase the hard drive separately and if so, was it purchased brand new or from a third party/used?</p>

<p>No. Any 360 console can play original Xbox games as long as it's an official hard drive. So yours should be fine, I'm just not sure why you're getting that error.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t install printer software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vicmontoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install printer software</h2>
                    <p>I just got off of a half-hour long session with an HP Printer tech about this issue. He now says it's a system problem and he can't do anything with it. Here is the issue I'm experiencing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I deinstalled my HP4650 printer in order to try and fix a situation where it wasn’t printing in color from my PC only (phone and tablet were ok). Now I am trying to reinstall and system won’t let me. I get the
 following error message: “Another installation is already in progress. Complete that installation before proceeding with this install. I have restarted PC, done a file cleanup, deactivated firewalls and unchecked startup programs and it still will not install
 software. Any other suggestions? Windows 10 <span>&nbsp;</span>64; V1709 (just upgraded to April2018 version. Problem is existent on both versions.</span></p>

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Could you then try installing the printer?
<br />
<br />You can also try installing the printer using Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Connect the printer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add printer
<br />
<br />Click 'The printer what I want isn't listed'
<br />
<br />Select 'Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings'
<br />Select 'Use an existing port'
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Under Manufacturer, scroll down then select the printer brand
<br />Over the right hand side, scroll down through the list and look for your printer model.
<br />
<br />If you don't see it, click Windows Update and wait while Windows Update checks for the printer.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't find it, click the back button, then click Next again.
<br />
<br />This time, select printer brand and in the printer list, select a driver series that closely matches your printer model

</p><p>It sometimes happens that a process terminates for whatever reason and stays resident in RAM (your computer's memory.) Windows thinks the process is still working.</p>

<p>No this is a totally different problem. A well known problem from windows 95 to windows 10. It happens on occasion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A registry edit or the process I listed above is pretty much the&nbsp;only 2 ways to resolve the issue as far as I have seen in 20 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the printer is already uninstalled and the install wizard&nbsp;thinks something is still running, which is can not be, because the printer is uninstalled, then you have to delete the left over files in those folders from the&nbsp;uninstall,
 because&nbsp;the spooler will have&nbsp;the left over files&nbsp;in service from a bad uninstall from the registry entries not being removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the printer install wizard&nbsp;detects that a file is used from spooler service and can not install that file as needed or replace it because it is in service, and even turning off spooler service may not free&nbsp;up left over file(s)&nbsp;when
 trying to install the same files to replace left over files.</p>

            That worked.&nbsp; I did an upgrade install from an iso on a flash drive.&nbsp; This kept all of the app.&nbsp; I've done a reset before when I had this problem, but reinstalling apps is a huge pain.&nbsp; And it didn't fully work, I was never able to see computers on network
 even though NetBIOS was enabled.

<h2>            Computer Lockups &#38; Random Restarts &#40;BCC 0X124&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
This is my first post and I am totally at a loss in regards to what's wrong with my PC for the past month or so now I have been experiencing computer freezes/lockups which result in no BSOD but just restart and then a popup after it restarts notifying me that
 windows was not shut down properly. I have done alot of research online and have narrowed it down to hardware in my PC. I ran memtest86 three times so far this month for cycles of 6-8 hours each time with no errors. I also ran chkdsk which didn't show any
 sort of error either. I then noticed that monitoring programs (speedfan, CPU-Z, HWinfo, etc..) are giving back low readings for PC voltages such as the +12V reading as of 8.58V on all the programs (I know these programs are not to be trusted for accuracy).
 I have no way of checking the voltages in my BIOS either and I am currently waiting on a volt meter I purchased online to arrive so that I may manually test the PSU. I do have a feeling though, that it may be either the mother board or the CPU in my PC. I
 have tried to read the DMP files from the 2 latest crashes which are identical, but I am unable to find any concrete information within them. I will post them here in case there is something I have missed.<br />

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the disk by using the chkdsk command. </p>
<p><span><strong>Run Check Disk from a Command Line to Check for and fix Disk Errors</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee872425.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee872425.aspx</a></p>
<p>If the issue is caused by the external hard disk, then I would first suggest you to connect it with another computer and check if the same issue happens there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this same issue happens on the second computer, then you may try the following methods and let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the hardware troubleshooter, you may refer to the article: “<b><i>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</i></b>” and follow the instructions in it from the given link and let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter</a></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also perform a complete security scan of the hard disk using Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if this is caused by any virus or malicious software infections in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 2: Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p><span>You may download and run the “</span><b><i>Microsoft Safety Scanner</i></b><span>” from this link:
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><i><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</b></a></span></i></p>
<p><b><i><u><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></u></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: When running a scan using an Anti Virus program, any data files that are infected may be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><u><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Hope this is helpful. Please do get back and let us know the results.</span></p>

<p>They are just horrible, the amount of user traffic has died off and I rarely find myself posting anymore. Who on earth thought it was a good idea to have to load a whole new page just if I want to quote someone? That mixed with how slow the forums are makes
 posting seem more of a hassle. </p>
<p>They really need to do more refining to the forums or just go back to the old setup until they come up with a better setup.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade&#58; Error code 80070002 seems unresolvable</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After recently getting the notification of a free upgrade to Windows 10 from 7, I have attempted to upgrade several times without success. Each time, the install fails roughly half way through the installation (not download) with error code 80070002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the steps listed here,&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-update-error-80070002#1TC=windows-7, the problem persists; removing download files has no effect other than to wipe the update history and the Windows Update Diagnostic comes
 up clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this problem is to do with missing files in the download, and so I rebooted in selective startup mode with non-ms services deselected to remove potential obstructions - no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could suggest a next step for me to take that would be great, as the fairly exhaustive options I have tried yield no success.</p>

<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade&nbsp;a (e.g., Vista; WinXP)&nbsp;computer to Win7? </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Have&nbsp;you ever done a Repair Install and/or a clean install of Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

            <p>Wow, thanks for being so punctual and thorough about responding to my apparently non-generic problem!</p>
<p>
1a. Early 2014<br />
<br />
1b. Came with Win7<br />
<br />
1c. No<br />
<br />
Note - I am currently dual booting with Arch Linux (obviously not preinstalled)<br />
<br />
2. Avast! Free Antivirus - Free subscription lasts a year and I didn't start long ago, so February 2017?<br />
<br />
3. Norton is currently installed (came preinstalled)<br />
<br />
4. Norton free trial when bought<br />
<br />
5a. Yep, got all of these<br />
<br />
5b. And all of these<br />
<br />
6. It is now! (just updated that - now 8/77)<br />
<br />
7. Again, seemed quite out of date (I never use IE) - updated for IE and already up to date for chrome<br />
<br />
8a. 28/06/14<br />
<br />
8b. 11.0.29 (KB3139929)<br />
<br />
8c. Chrome 49.0.2623.110, Chromium 50.0.2632.0<br />
<br />
9. No<br />

            <p>1. Whoops, seems like I gave some incorrect info here - apparently I have only had Norton Internet Security installed, and must have uninstalled the antivirus software a while back (sorry about that, I assumed they were synonymous)</p>
<p>So only Avast has been loading at boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. (If helpful) Norton Internet security 20.6.0.27</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. I have no idea - the account page on the website doesn't log it if it came preinstalled</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. 10 March 2016 - I only installed it recently</p>

</p><p>After following these instructions to the letter, the upgrade still gets 80070002 with the same error in the logs (a different registry key though -&nbsp;<em>969079ba-a479-42b7-be3c-a5decb888696</em> now)</p>

            <p>We're at the point&nbsp;where&nbsp;we need to rule&nbsp;OUT problems, my friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download &amp; scan with AdwCleaner. Have it remove/delete anything found, then reboot =&gt;
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Download &amp; scan with Junkware Removal Tool. Have it remove/delete anything found, then reboot again =&gt;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/junkware-removal-tool/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Download &amp; scan with MalwareBytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) Free (not MBAM Premium free trial). Have MBAM quarantine anything found, then reboot again =&gt;
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/free/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Follow-up by running a scan with HitmanPro (30-day free trial). Have it remove/delete anything found, then reboot =&gt;
<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro</a>
</p>
<p><br />
NOTE: Save your AdwCleaner, JRT, MBAM &amp; HitmanPro logs in case they're needed later - but don't post them here!</p>
<p><br />
5. Run the Windows Update troubleshooter (again) from start to finish then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Test.</p>

==============================================<br />
<div>Insert the SD Card in your media reader and go to...Start / Computer.<br />
<br />
The media reader should be recognized as one or more Removable Disks and each will have a drive letter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Example:</div>
<div>Removable Disk (F:)</div>
<div>Removable Disk (G:)</div>
<div>Removable Disk (H:)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Left click each Removable Disk until you reveal the Root Directory of the SD Card.<br />
<br />
OK...now that you know the drive letter...if you right click a selected group of photos you should be able to choose...Send to&nbsp; / Removable Disk (?:)...this should copy the photos to the SD Card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Be sure the photos are in a folder because the number of photos you can copy to the root directory will be very limited.</div>

    <title>KB980396 will not install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            KB980396 will not install</h2>
                    Hi, I am new to these forums.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not too long ago I purchased an ASUS N56VZ,. It came pre-loaded with windows 8, which I promptly removed and installed Windows 7. The Bluetooth worked for the 10 minutes that windows 8 was installed just fine, but after installing Win7 the Bluetooth will
 not work to some degrees. My smart phone is able to detect my laptop, but my laptop cannot seem to find my phone. I have done a few clean installs, and I seem to arrive at the same problem every time. &nbsp;I even purchased a separate USB dongle, and still the
 same problem. It seems that every driver is installed, save for one "Bluetooth Server." I searched the web for solutions and finally came back with the hotfix,&nbsp;KB980396. No matter what I do the hotfix will not install, I just keep receiving the message "The
 update is not applicable to your computer." I have trouble understanding this as I downloaded the KB file that is for x64 Intel chips. Please any assistance would be greatly appreciated, Thank you very much.</div>

<p><br />
Did you simply <em>assume </em>that the Win8 computer's hardware was fully-compatible with Win7 or...? [Chances are it isn't.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: You voided your new computer's Warranty by downgrading the computer to Win7!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: If you chose to (attempt to) install KB980396. this has nothing whatsoever to do with Windows Update functionality. Try posting here instead =&gt;
