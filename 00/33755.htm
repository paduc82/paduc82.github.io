    <title>Surface 3 automatic repair loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paisferg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 automatic repair loop</h2>
                    So I bought my first laptop last week, a surface pro 3. Pretty much have been saving for months to get this laptop, I did a ton of research and made a very educated decision. 3 days ago my laptop did the windows 8.1 update, I thought it might take a while
 so I went to bed. In the morning my laptop still said "surface" on the screen. I thought that was strange so I turned it off and back on, it then said "diagnosing PC" and "automatic repair". I've been stuck in the automatic repair loop for 3 days *sigh*. I'm
 super disappointed with the costumer service thus far, and i have no idea how to fix this. Should I just reset my laptop? I've only had it for a week so I wouldn't be losing to much.&nbsp;

            That is a poor response. A customer has expressed how disappointed they were with your product after saving for it but it sounds like you couldn't give a damn. I guess this is why people buy apple products. Such a shame too since the surface 3 pro is one
 of the best machines on the market currently. It's going to be overshadowed by non-existent customer service.

            Seriously! &nbsp;This customer writes that their week old computer, built by MS, SW by MS, is needing a full rebuild. &nbsp;The reply should be, how do we contact you and set up a time to ensure you are taking care of, real time. &nbsp;I found this thread because the
 24 hour old Surface Pro 4 I have is experiencing the same problems with its Win10 build. &nbsp;This experience is why if it were my money, I would stick with the Apple ecosystem. &nbsp;I would have been directed to the nearest genius bar, and most likely given a new
 machine for my troubles whilst they repaired the lemon I had. &nbsp;MS, I want to like your stuff, but outside of the business world with professional company IT administrators on one's side, it's simply not worth the gamble.

            <p>I just bought surface 3 for my daughter and has the problem within 2 days.</p>
<p>The O/S is Windows 10.</p>
<p>First time, we follow the instruction and reset / reinstall the whole windows. But the problem comes back after few days. So I decided to dig up a solution to save my time and data.</p>
<p>I suspect the problem for my daughter one is caused by combination of windows auto update and running on tablet. I do not have a solution for this as I think the problem is caused by coding, but here is the temp solution we applied.</p>
<p>When looping, goes to "Advance options" =&gt; "Start up settings", then restart. System will still pop out the auto repair message but will give you the start options. (Title is Startup setting), then select option #7 (Disable Driver signature enhancement),
 and system will restart and give you (will I hope) the sign up page.</p>
<p>Now, go to "Check windows update", you may (or should) see windows is in middle of some updates. If you see this, you should change the option to "notice" rather than "automatic update". Then you should keep on checking windows update until all updates are
 downloaded and then install all updates.</p>
<p>Warning for tablet users, I suspect you need to connect the power line to the table before the restart. And secondly, always sign in and ensure system runs fine before you shut off the system.</p>
<p>I do find this is a big issue to tablet especially as for some reason the surface 3 does not give us the message "ensure power connection is or (or something like that), and it does not give you option to "install updates then shut down (or restart). And
 windows will try to carry out the update (say 1 patch) while it is downloading other patches, and then the loop will occur if you are not aware of it (it does not gives options when you click the "power option".</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Restarting the tablet from the Startup Settings goes back to the same screen and doesn't give an option to Disable Driver Signature Enforcement or any of the Windows options available.</p>

            <p>JA, yours was the only suggestion that worked for me so far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just got my Surface Pro 3 last Friday, and after setting it up just the way I like it, I used it for a couple days with no issues. Then on Sunday morning, it got stuck on an infinite Automatic Repair loop, got super-overheated, and I couldn't get back
 into the computer at all. So after trying all the different options, I ended up just resetting everything to factory default and reinstalling everything last night. After working well this morning and afternoon, it went into an automatic repair loop again
 when I tried to restart it. Using your method I've finally gotten back into Windows and I'm going to install all the updates (and switch to notify rather than automatic update) and see what happens. This is a big issue and I can't believe MS doesn't have a
 better response to it. Maybe this is only an issue for people using BitLocker encryption?</p>

            You have to dig around a bit, but basically you need to get to the option of starting up Windows in safe mode. There are a number of options there, including starting up with driver signature enforcement disabled. It worked for me.

<h2>            My computer not updating</h2>
                    My computer is set to automatically update every day, but has not been updating at all for the past year.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;check for updates,&nbsp;a message appears that&nbsp;says "failed"&nbsp; and when I&nbsp;look to see&nbsp;the list of things that try to update, they all say "failed."&nbsp;
 When it seaches for updates,&nbsp;a code comes up that says "error" with a bunch of numbers after it.&nbsp; Because of the computer unable to update, I am no longer able to print or open up any Microsoft programs, such as Word or Exel.&nbsp; When I try to&nbsp;open these programs,
 it tells me that not updating the computer could affect the stability of the computer and that I would need to go to Windows Update to install new updates.&nbsp; When I opened up Windows Update, it said that I must first install an update for Windows Update.&nbsp; I
 clicked "Install now" and&nbsp;it attempts to install, but then&nbsp;goes right back to the original page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other night&nbsp;I went online to see what else I could do about this.&nbsp; Several websites said that the problem was most likely from the catroot2 folder and that&nbsp; renaming this folder to catroot2old would fix the problem.&nbsp; I tried this and it would not allow
 me to change the name.&nbsp; Now I don't know what else to do.&nbsp; Please help!

And what are the error messages and bunch of numbers after each error message?<br />
<br />
Please also advise what your operating system is including service pack level and whether or not you have scanned for viruses/malware etc.<br />

A year is a long time to go without updating.<br />

<h2>            Full-Screen applications crashing computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said above, full-screen applications are crashing my computer. It doesn't matter what application it is (firefox, steam games, etc.), whenever it goes full-screen, not maximised, my entire computer freezes. I can't move my mouse, nothing comes up
 with Ctrl-Alt-Delete. I have to hard reset just to get back to my computer, and no error report comes up when it reboots. I have an XFX Radeon R9290X, and the latest AMD Drivers installed. MalwareBytes comes up with no malware found, as does Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this?</p>

    <title>No way to enter a name and phone type when saving a phone number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limeydi  say:</h3>
<h2>            No way to enter a name and phone type when saving a phone number</h2>
                    <p>It wasn't easy, but at last the "new improved" Skype seems to be working adequately on my Windows 10 desktop PC - I use it for Skype to Skype calls, IMs and voice calls to phone numbers.&nbsp; However, new improved does not work as seamlessly as the old with
 respect to contacts. I used to be able after making&nbsp; a call to add/save the contact phone number, add the NAME (without which I fail to see any use for the anonymous "saved" number) and specify if this is home, work or mobile. WHY ISN'T THAT INTUITIVE IN THE
 NEW IMPROVED SKYPE??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please show me how to accomplish this basic task?&nbsp; "View profile" shows me the number with an editing pen icon - but all that does is allow the NUMBER to be edited - nowhere to add the name or change from the mobile setting (which seems to be
 the default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help ... please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also ... my question is about Skype for Windows 10 but the REQUIRED sub-topic doesn't include anything appropriate. The choices are Calling, Getting tarted and Messaging.&nbsp; I've used Skype since it first started ... my subtopic is why the update made it worse?????</p>

As I hoped my details request indicated, I did everything you describe except try to add the name before the number ... counter-intuitive based on former, simpler Skype system. Also, I wonder why Skype assumes and defaults to the assumption-based criterion
 that every number I save is a mobile number? As in the past, many numbers I save are "work" or "office" or "home" numbers. Once again the forward march of digital change has led to a step backward.&nbsp; At least i can now look up that number by name, so that's
 an improvement ... <br />

<p>
</p><p>I am unable to get rid of the Kingsoft Office Suite from my Dell computer. It is called WPS Office and whenever you click on the uninstall option in Control Panel/ Programs &amp; Features, it only brings up a screen stating that you can reinstall it if it isn't
 running properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried iObit Uninstaller but the software could not even find WPS Office on the computer.</p>

            Tried the first suggestion. It failed. Took me to the programs and features section of the control panel, but no other action was performed. The "clean boot" instructions are for Windows 7 &amp; 8. I'm running Windows 10.

<p>I recently had to send my xbox one into Microsoft for service. &nbsp;Since I received it back I am unable to control the TV with the xbox one. &nbsp;This means not powering on or off or responding to volume commands. &nbsp;</p>

                    <span>I have an older computer that meets the basic system requirements for installing Windows 10, except for the WDDM 1.0 driver requirement. How important is the WDDM 1.0
 driver requirement? Is it possible that Windows 10 would work on my computer without the WDDM 1.0 driver? Since there are many refurbished computers being sold with the combination of Windows 10 and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3000 (which lacks WDDM),
 this appears it may be a minor issue. For example, see <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?N=100006550%20600015319%20600566987%20601190711&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Submit=ENE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            After updating anniversary edition, getting BSOD when connects to the WiFi network.</h2>
                    <p>Works fine on Windows 10. When the anniversary edition is loaded then it BSOD when the WIFI connects to the network. It appears Microsoft is loading a new WIFI driver which causes the BSOD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling the device and it will work. Once you connect to WIFI it BSOD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a better driver to try? or if a fix is coming? </p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>Already tried this. It reboots, reinstalls the driver and once you connect to the Wifi SSID then it BSOD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you do not connect to the WIFI then you can use the computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver crashing is the realtek 8821ae.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to load the older version and it then receives a security BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put Windows 10 back on and things work normally. </p>

<h2>            Windows shuts down automatically after Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello&nbsp;(I'm Finnish so my English is not perfect but try to understand)&nbsp;so I have HP Pavilion dv6-3150 laptop. When I turn it on hp logo comes in and windows logo pops up with that starting windows tex. After that screen becomes black and there reads something
 like this in Finnish : Checking the status of the file system. the type of the file system is NTFS. a single hard disk must Integrity Check but it is recommended to continue.&nbsp;CHKDSK to check the files in (step 1/3)</p>
<p>before step 1/3 thing there percentage that keeps rising slowly. When it reaches 10% (sometimes earlier) my laptop shuts down. I have no idea what is wrong so anyone got any idea what I could do to fix this? (if I press f1 f2 f8 f9 or something like that
 before windows logo pops up it goes diagnostics and different options like that. If I stay as an example in diagnostics menu my laptop still shuts down in about 1-2 mins)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you using Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run Checkdisk from Windows Recovery Environment(WinRE).
<br />
</p>
<p>Refer this article:<br />
What are the system recovery options in Windows?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open Commnad Prompt using this article.</p>
<p>b. In Command Prompt, Type chkdsk /f /r and Press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer:<br />
Computer Does not Start (Windows 7, Vista, XP)<br />

            Did the chkdsk several times in the past year or so but problem still persists. I know sometimes windows need to auto restart due to updates installed. But I am talking about restart episodes other than the updates.

<h2>            XBox One Wireless Adapter Driver &#40;BSOD&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Since I installed the wireless adapter I have now had 4 Blue Screens and the offending file has consistently been mt7612US.sys which just happens to be one of the files related to the wireless adapter driver. &nbsp;Anyone else had similar issues? &nbsp;I hope it is
 something that they are working on since I'm going to have to go back to wired until it is resolved.</p>

<p>Same issues with my system since day 1. &nbsp;Is it an issue with "wireless noise"? &nbsp;On what band, 5ghz? &nbsp;I have a 5ghz n/ac WAP within about 3 feet of this receiver. &nbsp;But I can't say I've ever heard of a wireless device so garbage that the mere presence of another
 wireless device in the area would crash an OS.</p>
<p>What an utter disappointment. &nbsp;Far, far worse than anything with the chinese knock-off $12 xb360 USB dongles I've had for years.</p>

<p>An update to the driver is scheduled some time this week. I will post a message here when it's uploaded. This will take care of some of the highest buckets for crashes, and potentially better information gathering for other buckets. Unfortunately some of
 the crashes that we have observed have minimal information and we will need further investigation with better collection to diagnose.</p>

<p>NAP is a process whereby a domain-based network controls which computers do and do not get network access, it's not something you can turn on or off unless you are running a domain in your home.&nbsp; See here for information:</p>

            <p>Hello MKubeer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you downloaded any third party program?</li><li>When do you receive this error?</li><li>Did you make any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p><span>If you notice a process is reducing your computer's performanceâ€”because it either uses a high percentage of central processing unit (CPU) resources or a large amount of random access memory (RAM)â€”you can use Task Manager to end the process. However,
 you should try closing your open programs to see if the process ends before using Task Manager to end the process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to End process <strong>arp.exe</strong> in task manager and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to: <strong>End a process</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-process#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-process#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may have been caused due to any conflict between third party software. I would suggest you to perform following methods and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Start computer in safe mode</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Perform clean boot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Run Microsoft Safe Scanner</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><em>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</em></p>

            <p>You don't multiply resolution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To use metro apps, your screen must be at least 768 pixels tall.&nbsp; Yours is 720 pixels. Not tall enough. End of story.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Adding more wide and multiplying doesn't help: it has to be tall enough also.</p>

<p>Not sure if it is what you want or not. &nbsp;My current world has a small jungle at the south end of the landmass. &nbsp;It has all the tree types, all the biomes. &nbsp;It has a large desert area with wooded areas north and south ends and a river through the desert.
 &nbsp;It has one central village in the desert with several wheat farms. &nbsp;It has a stronghold with end portal, abandoned mineshaft complex with chests, at least one of which has melon seeds and a couple have cocoa beans. &nbsp;It has a spider spawner dungeon underground
 near your spawn location, a zombie spawner on the surface in the desert, and an underground skeleton spawner (maybe more but I have found and exploited those three). &nbsp;It has a pair of two chunk slime chunks near each other so you can have an easy 4 chunk slim
 farm. &nbsp;There is a large sea along the eastern half of the map so there is plenty of deep water to build over. &nbsp;The sea floor has openings into the abandoned mineshaft complex for fairly easy access.</p>
<p>The spawn location is in a wooded area to the south with both oak and birch (the white trees you want). &nbsp;There are pumpkins not far from the spawn point as well for making jack-o-lanterns. &nbsp;There is at least one surface lava not too far from the spawn location
 should you need it.</p>
<p>Give it a shot and see if its what you want: Wolfiesden</p>
<p>(note capitol W)</p>
<p>If its not what you want, easy to simply delete the game and move on.</p>
<p>FYI, create it in Survival mode. &nbsp;Then save and exit. &nbsp;You can then load it up in creative (with autosave turned off) and explore it to see if its what you want. &nbsp;Just don't save while in creative and it will remain a survival mode game.</p>
<p>If this is what you are looking for, I can provide X,Y,Z coords for many of the features mentioned above.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the Code 10 error generated for your Realtek Audio Codec, you can click on the Driver tab and check for the Driver version installed for that device. You can then download the latest from the manufacturer website.
<br />
<br />
For reference, please refer to this link as well: Fix: "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/943104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This Device Cannot Start" Code 10 Error in Device Manager in Windows.</a></p>

            <p>it didn't help. It made problem worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get red cross icon. over sound icon on RHS taskbar.</p>
<p>saying "No Audio output device installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find all the drivers are removed and not getting installed automatically upon next startup, after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 100% sure its just driver/software problem, no issues with hardware, as it inbuilt speakers. No problem of connection at all.</p>

            <p>red cross mark is no more there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yet sound is not there. (rest assured I have checked volume)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rememeber when sound was working.. there were two devices listed in sound and games.</p>
<p>Comparing previous ones, now intel device is working good. but I2C controller could not find drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>see image, and tell me how to get those drivers. As per specs, my laptop needs Realtek, ALC5645 codec. Don't ask for manufactures. They do not provide any drivers. I have visited the website. They have absolutely no drivers available for laptops. I have
 contacted manufactures so many times but no response at all. Just let me know if you have any other option to get those drivers<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d524b0a7-d416-454f-bf58-d595560dfbdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d524b0a7-d416-454f-bf58-d595560dfbdb" /></a>so

<h2>            Teredo is unable to qualify - I&#39;ve tried EVERYTHING...</h2>
                    <p>Xbox app on my PC says Teredo is unable to qualify and that my server connectivity is blocked. So i can't play with my friends on Forza Horizon 4. I can't find any sites that I can download back onto my PC. The internet swears it's impossible to not have
 it but I CAN NOT find it ANYWHERE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My command prompt shows this stat for Teredo: </p>
<p>Type = Disabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>Server Name: win711</p>
<p>Client Refresh Interval: 20 seconds</p>
<p>Client Port: unspecified</p>
<p>State: offline</p>
<p>Error: none</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywho, Command prompt&nbsp;<strong>netsh interface Teredo set state disable&nbsp;</strong>and then
<strong>netsh interface Teredo set state type=default&nbsp;</strong>does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teredo is also NOT under Device Manager &gt; Network Adapters (Even with show hidden devices)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager &gt; action &gt; add legacy hardware &gt; next &gt; install manual&nbsp; &gt; network adapters &gt; Microsoft &gt; Teredo is supposed to be here but it IS NOT.</p>
<p><br />
Restarting IPHelper does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm literally stuck and super disappointed that I can't play online. There has to be a fix somewhere. PLEASE... PLEASE help. Thanks. :)</p>

<p>Hello DriftingBrandon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. The teredo error has to do with a connection issue between Xbox Live and the home network. Forza updates will not resolve the issue. We recommend attempting the troubleshooting steps on
<a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/articles/360001992147-Multiplayer-Connection-Troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza's Support Page</a> in order to resolve the issue. The details&nbsp;of a refund must be discussed with the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support Team</a>. There is an article on our website entitled

<p>Hey there! Most of the time this can be fixed with a full reboot. Go into Settings, Power, Restart Xbox. If that doesn't work, in Power, go to Turn Xbox off, and unplug the power cord from the back for about 2 minutes.</p>

            <p>There is no need to install the .NET Framework 2.0 or earlier versions such as 1.0 or 1.1 on Windows 7. The .NET 3.51 included with Windows 7, offers a full installation package which includes the full runtime installation packages for .NET 2.0 SP2 as well
 as .NET 3.0 SP2 for multiple operating systems (Windows XP/Server 2003 and Windows Vista/Server 2008) and for multiple CPU architectures (x86, x86-64, and IA-64).

<h2>            Fallout 4 Creation Club credits not showing</h2>
                    <p>I bought creation club credits to download some things, but the credits havenâ€™t showed in my wallet. The transaction went through my account and itâ€™s been over 24 hours. Contacted Microsoft support and they told me it was the developer. So I contacted Bethesda and they said itâ€™s microsoft. What do I need to do???</p>
