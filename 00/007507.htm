<h2>            Retrieving Deleted Text Msgs on the Nokia 6300</h2>
                    Saw a couple of discussions which were on this topic but didnt quite address the issue.<br />
Is it possible to retrieve deleted messages from the 6300. I know there is freeware available which along with a simcard reader can apparently retrieve deleted files and msgs.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried doing like this before, and how cumbersome is it?<br />
<br />
And on the same token, how does one then delete messages so that they can never be retrieved - or is that not possible?

Hi Vipervik - it was probably my post that you read :)<br />
<br />
It all comes down to where the messages that were deleted are stored - I may be wrong here but I think there's three locations you can store them :<br />
<br />
1) On the phone itself<br />
2) On the memory card<br />
3) On the SIM (Not 100% sure about this one, I know you can save contacts on the SIM, but not sure about messages)<br />
<br />
On my N95, I'm presented with options to save text messages on either phone memory or memory card.<br />
<br />
The principles of data recovery rely on the fact that no new data is written over the data that has been deleted. If you examine what happens when an Operating System (the software that runs your phone or computer) deletes a file, on older OSs what used to
 happen is that the file actually just got renamed with a question mark as the first character of it's filename. The OS then recognised this as meaning that the file was deleted and marked it as free space ready to be reused. If the space that the deleted file
 was reused, then there is no way to recover the data. (Technically this isn't strictly true if the two different files are different sizes and live in different clusters, but this is WAY beyond the scope of this discussion).<br />
<br />
Military (and financial) institutions ensure that data can not be recovered by deliberately taking advantage of the above fact and writes gibberish data continuously to every location on a disk/device before deleting it finally. This ensures that the data recovered
 would be gibberish. Often if the material in question is VERY sensitive, they will often physically destroy the media rather than risk its reuse.<br />
<br />
Going back to your phone example, yes it is capable of recovering data on your phone. There are two ways of doing so :<br />
<br />
1) Taking it to a qualified data recovery company and paying a lot of money to a guy in a white coat and probably a clean room to open up your phone and perform data recovery forensics on it to get the data back<br />
2) There MAY (I don't know as I've never researched it) be software out there which you can install onto your phone to check for deleted messages, data etc. However anyone installing the application will have the same quandry that I outlined above - in order
 to install the application, they MAY be overwriting exactly the information that they want to save.<br />
<br />
The memory card situation was covered in my other post, but essentially it's a lot easier. You take the memory card out of your phone, and plug it into a laptop/PC, install some data recovery software on your PC, and start looking for your data - easy - if
 you know what you're doing. It would pose a challenge to a non techie.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

Mine does not seem to store text messages to the sim or i don`t know how to set that up.<br />

            As i have just posted on a diff post.. the messages on the nokia 6300 are stored to the phone by default and as far as i am aware there is no way to change that... making it impossible to recover the messages stored on the phones EPROM.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - suddenly started asking password every minute. How to resolve&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using MS office 2010 for more than a year. The OS is Windows 7 (64 bit). For last few days, as soon as it starts, it keep on popping a window to confirm the password. Clicking on 'save to password' file has no effect? Rebooting PC also has
 no effect. What is happening and how to resolve? There are no outstanding patches.

<p>Sounds like the auto polling interval (auto send/receive) is set to low, modify it to at least 10 minutes, then see how you go.</p>
<p>(Set to frequently results in resource problems and problems with any integrated AV)</p>

            <p>I don't know where to make the change and I haven't changed any settings. So it has to be&nbsp;the default&nbsp;polling interval. Since the password is saved in the account settings, Outlook should take it from there instead of popping a window - as it has beendoing
 for more than a year.</p>
<p>I accidentally noticed today that this issue disappears&nbsp;when I deleted the&nbsp;email in the outbox. Hope these information may assist in resolution.</p>

            <p>Hi Guruprasad,</p>
<p>Your reply is very informative, generates confidence. The link to the MS KB article that you have&nbsp;addressed lot of my queries.&nbsp;I will be trying the&nbsp;solutions and will revert back&nbsp;to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, given below are the answers to your queries (in different order):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Yes, I can log through webmail using same user name&nbsp;and password. I also access my emails thru iPhone4S, Samsung Galaxy S3.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Email account is configured as POP in Outlook 2010. This issue is only with Outlook on my home PC and only when 'sending an email'. Receiving emails (which uses the same user name and password) is all OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. Removal and adding the email account didn't help. Tried it before writing on this forum.
</p>
<p>4. Hadn't tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Outlook 2010 because I wasn't sure if it would resolve the issue.</p>
<p>5. Reading the KB, I think it could be 'virus issue', not sure though. I have Microsoft Security Essentials running on my computer. I did have few times window popping up saying 'to fix the virus completely, I need to restart the computer.'. Which I did
 restart every time that window popped up. I have shut down the computer for last 2 days - for the virus to really die:-)</p>
<p>6. KB says to 'recreate' Outlook profile that is possibly damaged. The .pst file contains all the emails in Inbox, Sent Box, Contacts, folders. I am afraid that by&nbsp;recreating profile and hence .pst file, may result in my loosing all this valuable information.
 If I have easier means (not exporting to Excel, which looses lot of information), I will be brave enough to try this option. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really appreciate your assistance. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may create a new Outlook profile and check. You will not lose any of the data in the old profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find that in new profile Outlook works, then you cn open the old data in the new profile and access all the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open the Outlook old data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Outlook &gt; Click on file &gt; Open &gt; Open Outlook data file &gt; Choose the old data &gt; Click on Open.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, here are my answers;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have a calendar called Family Events, I have exported all the entries into an ICS file and want to import into the new Family Calendar, called surprisingly 'Family Calendar' that Microsoft have created on my behalf.</p>
<p>2) I have tried other browsers, these include Edge, Chrome and Firefox, all the latest versions</p>
<p>3) And yes I have cleared the browser cache and cookies, and I have even tried importing when running in the browser Inprivate or Incognito mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps you mentioned in another thread by Siva I have already gone through and the result is the same. Microsoft has created a calendar for me that I cannot use properly! All I want to do is import existing events into the calendar, it's a very basic
 requirement.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1, I can confirm that I cannot import any ICS file into the Family Calendar, it works into other calendars but not with the Family Calendar, which is the one I want to use. I get an error message that states;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The events couldn't be imported, Please try again later. Error message: The folder specified in the Import Calendar Event request is a shared or read-only folder"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2, I'm using Outlook.com and not Outlook for Windows, but the error is the same, I cannot import the calendar into the Family Calendar that was created by Microsoft. And again I do not get any sharing options for this calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3, I have tried a different browsers and have the issue, I did try your suggestion of Safe Mode, but that does not make a difference the error is the same.</p>

            I'm sorry the UserVoice service is useless, I have tried raising this on there along with other entries that I feel are important and they just get closed down by your moderators, with no or minimal feedback that states I should check the support pages
 that contains no information on the issue or request I put through. From past experience I've decided that it is not worth the effort as the people running the service have no idea of the actual products or services offered by Microsoft, my guess is that it
 is manned by 3rd party who have no idea what they are doing! Sorry to be harsh but when relevant items get closed or rejected by this team as being complete when they clearly are not, it makes you wonder what the point of the service is!

<p>I agreed with gjmartin.&nbsp; Uservoice is a blackhole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding to Family Calendar, I want to use it but found it completely useless.&nbsp; I can't send invitation directly to the family calendar.&nbsp; Flight and hotel information Outlook.com capture in my email are directly added to my main calendar.&nbsp; There is no way
 to move them from the main calendar to the Family Calendar.&nbsp; Meaning, I have to entered it to the Family Calendar manually which means it would not receive update of the event by the airline or hotel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is easier to open another Outlook.com account and share that calendar with family.&nbsp; At least, it can receive invitation or external events into the calendar.</p>

<h2>            Download and Installed Office 2019 but getting Office 365 and 2016 Professional</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble installing Office 2019 Home and Student for pc. Before I think I installed Office 365 using the my account from my school. But it shows that it is a trial only as I've remembered. Now I managed to buy Office 2019 H&amp;S. I followed the steps
 on registering/connecting the key to my account, and I can download and install the 2019 on my laptop. But then, when the installation was finished, I saw in the File&gt;Account that the Office 2016 Professional (trial) and Office 365 was installed instead. What's
 wrong? Did I missed something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Martin P.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the trial version before installing Office 2019. Used the removing tools (o15-ctrremove.exe) and (MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta).</p>

            Hi  martin03in2018 
<br />
<br />This is an issue we often see where personal copies you buy and try to install conflict with pre-bundled trials of Office 365. You need to remove the trial first, then install your copy.
<br />
<br />Use Revouininstaller to remove it completely.

</p><p>Would like to be able to re-load the product onto the machine where I originally downloaded it, which had to be wiped clean because of some internet-related issue (never found out exactly what happened). It seems I should be able to type in the product code
 and download again without having to pay for the product but the product key received with my software is showing up as an invalid code. I have my original receipt. Please explain the best way to solve this problem, thanks.</p>

 Odds are that you do not have a MAC, so the answer to your question is likely to be substantially different than the original question. By asking a new question you can provide us with the information we need to provide the best answer.</p>

            <p>Hi blaze289,</p>
<p>Have you tried resetting Internet Explorer?&nbsp; Please see the following article with instructions:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></p>
<p>Also keep in mind, when you reset Internet Explorer settings, all add-ons and customizations are deleted, and you basically start with a fresh version of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

                    <p>When I create my account I set up the birthdate at 1.1.2016 and now I cant sign in to Skype due to parental control. I signed in Microsoft account and put the correct date in my profile,&nbsp; presed Save button but nothing happend.</p>
<p>I need to solve it and I dont have the credit card to verify my age.</p>
<p>Other thing is that Im located in Slovakia so here should not be the same conditions like in US or South Korea to which you refer in other answers to same problem.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Online Security Trimning</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to find out how Security Trimming works in SharePoint Online.&nbsp; I have a site collection that has links to many separate subsites on the landing page.&nbsp; Each subsite has it's own security.&nbsp; In previous versions (and like the TOC) does in the team
 sites I only want the users to see what they have access to.&nbsp; I do not want them to see all the things they do not have access to.&nbsp; What is the best way to accomplish this?</p>

    <title>Newest Firmware update causing problem when tracking workouts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dregus311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Newest Firmware update causing problem when tracking workouts.</h2>
                    <p>So the newest update pushed last week has made my MS Band stop tracking workouts correctly. I narrowed the issue down to notifications during workout tracking. If you receive a notification while the band is in workout mode (run or bike thus far)&nbsp;this will
 stop the GPS and bring up the "resume" &amp; "end" which also appears to&nbsp;stop the time tracking and of course mileage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone else had this occur to them recently?&nbsp;It was a&nbsp;bit upsetting as I was attempting to complete a solo distance record on Saturday for
 road cycling when it decided to start doing this to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS I hope that a solution and update can be brought forth quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Issue with Excel data-chains via Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with a coulpe of Excel data-chains through Sharepoint at my work. When i set up a chain it shows for instance [Sheet2.xlsx] and fetches data just fine. But when I close and re-open the sheets, the chain code is changed to the entire http-adress,
 such as "http://company.com/controlling/[Sheet2.xlsx], and gives a VALUE-error instead of fetching the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my problem connected to Excel or Sharepoint? And what can i do to make the chains work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, and please excuse if some of the mentioned terms are inaccurate. I use Excel in my native language (danish), but the Danish community in here is not very large :)</p>

<h2>            Email flagged in Android Outlook not displayed in Outlook 2013 Inbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Outlook on my Android smartphone. &nbsp;Last week I uninstalled 2010 and did a clean install of Office 2013 and Visual Studio 2015 on my company laptop. &nbsp;We use an Outlook Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received several emails last night that I read on the Android Outlook app. &nbsp;After reading the new emails I left them in my inbox but set a flag on some of them to remind me to respond to those items first when I got to the office the next morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I arrived at the office and opened Outlook on my laptop the emails that I had flagged the night before were not in my inbox. &nbsp;However, the status bar said All Folders Up To Date and Connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flagged messages were still in my inbox on my Android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a clean install. &nbsp;I verified that there were no filters set and no rules set. &nbsp;I have no search folders defined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The missing messages only appeared in my laptop inbox after I unflagged them on my Android device and then searched my inbox for the sender name. &nbsp;Once the email was visible in my laptop Outlook inbox then I could flag the email on my Android device and
 the email stayed visible and the flag responded as expected on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need help at this point. &nbsp;I found a workaround; I just won't set a flag on important messages on my smartphone. &nbsp;But you probably need to look into this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Moving a shared file into a personal folder</h2>
                    Hi - is there any way I can move shared files into a folder of my own? I've got a list of files that were shared with me, but I am not able to move/organise them into folders as there is no "move" or "copy" function on the "shared with me" page. Is there
 any workaroud to this? Thanks!

<h2>            Error Code 8501001F and my Time and Date are correct&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting the error code 8501001F and I've been reading through all the forums but they don't help. I've set my time and date manually and both are correct unless there is some sort of thing I'm doing wrong and I'm a few minutes off? Which I don't see
 how I'm even supposed to be able to check that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reset the password several times to no avail. It keep saying "Attention Required" and each time I keep trying to retype the password and fix the problem, nothing happens. Also, I've tried resetting the phone multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to hard reset the phone because I know this can be fixed. I just don't know how. Is there a way to remove the account and put it back in? Also I have a WP htc 8x if this helps anything...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Model: HTC PM23300 and OS version: 8.0.10501.127</p>

            Delete the content that produced it.
<div><br />
<div>Internally in a Word document, there is no such thing as a page. &nbsp;Word "invents" pages when it displays or prints the document, creating a new one every time there is enough content to require it.</div>

<p>Once a lock screen password is set there is no way to get the password. </p>
<p>Wouldn't be very good security if you could.</p>
<p>You have to reset the phone.</p>
<p>If you did not turn of reset protection you will also need the reset protection key to access the phone following the phone reset.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Launcher and signing in</h2>
                    <p>I installed Microsoft launcher and Microsoft Edge on my old Android phone running Android 7.0. It is as up to date as it can be. App installs fine but I can't login. I was trying to set it up for my daughter so I used her acct that is part of my family.
 It didn't work. Uninstalled app and started again. Same issue. I tried finding a help chat but there doesn't appear to be one for this. One I did try led me to a nice guy but he was useless. I finally tried as my acct in case it was some dumb age issue. Nope.
 I really would like this to work for the excellent family control Microsoft has. Any help would be great.</p>

            The launcher app was not as smart as the outlook app. I installed that to try to log in there and see if it worked. It prompted me to update Chrome. This is what worked to allow sign in. So Launcher needs a fix to make sure it does what Outlook does.

<h2>            Brand new Lumia 930 - Unresponsive screen</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p><br />
Picked up a Lumia 930 earlier this week (in Melbourne, Australia).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a really annoying intermitent issue and I'm hoping there might either be a plan to fix or a work-around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intermittently (and I can't figure out what's the cause), the screen goes unresponsive (hardware keys still work) and I can't do anything with the phone without doing a forced reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interesting thing about it is it actually behaves as though the screen is being pressed in lots of areas as whatever is on teh screen (eg browser) moves about the page, and if I go back to the start screen, it intermittently opens apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found a similar thread on this for the Lumia 920, but nothing for the 930 yet (See below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-8-1-preview-developers/280388-lumia-920-8-1-unresponsive-screen-recovered-8-0-same-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-8-1-preview-developers/280388-lumia-920-8-1-unresponsive-screen-recovered-8-0-same-problem.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help to resolve would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Cheers,</p>
<p>matt</p>

            hi mate, have you tried performing a soft reset, and also checking that you are up to date with the latest firmware and Nokia system app updates from the Store? there have been reports of problems with the display coming in, yes.

It will (after being put to sleep) occasionally come good, but it's temporary at best.

            sorry to hear it is still happening mate. only option in this case would be to perform a hard reset, and if the problem is still there, take it back to your point of purchase or arrange it to be sent to Nokia Care.

I did the Nokia Software recovery tool, and no dice, the screens gone from intermittently faulty to completely faulty, and the hardware buttons on the front are no longer working.<br />

It must be a hardware issue. &nbsp;Oh well, back to the shops to replace it.</p>

                    <span>Hello. I use Office 2016 with Windows 7 Pro. I like to view Word documents and Folders in vertical half screen size and I would like all open docs and folders to align
 against the left edge of the screen. If, for example, I open 4 docs (or folders), the left edge of the first doc/folder I open will align along the left edge of my screen but the left edge of every successive doc/folder I open will be about an inch from the
 left edge of the screen. When I physically move all docs/folders to align against the left edge and then close and save, the next time I open the docs/folders they will again open an inch from the left edge of the screen. Is there a way to solve this so that
 all docs/folders will open against the left edge? Thanks for any help (I hope I explained this clearly enough).&nbsp;</span>

<p>Hi Joey, <br />
<br />
Word is set up to recover the last Window position used by a document. Having them always start in a certain location regardless of where they were last positioned could be done with a macro, but I do not have it off the top of my head. If you are willing to
 use one, I will write it for you this weekend. Please let me know. <br />
<br />
Here's how to use a macro found in this forum or on another webpage: <br />
For PC macro installation: <br />

This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user. </p>

<strong>What can help you get more help is providing more information or examples about the problem you are facing.</strong> You can do that by replying to this post (Reply button below). Please let me know if you have any more questions or want me to write
 a macro for you. If I do, I'll try to explain the process I go through, which will start with recording a macro.

            Hi Charles and thanks for your reply. I'm really not good at this and if you sent me a Macro I honestly wouldn't even know what to do with it. But thanks anyway, I do very much appreciate your taking the time to reply and to make the offer.&nbsp;
