<p>windows 10 mail, I think.&nbsp; Trying to upload to SimpleSite. When I right click and select I get a black screen that shows the "name" (number and format) of the image and a message that says, It appears we don't support this format. If there is a way I can
 send you a copy of the screen, tell me and I'll send it to you. This a problem I have never had before, in my many years of PC/Windows usage. I didn't have it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; It seems like Windows 10 willy-nilly changes some obscure setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>drives me, and many others based on what I see online, crazy. Thanks for continuing to try to help.</p>

            Thank you for your help.&nbsp; I found the solution from another source. You must go into file explorer, select View; advanced options, and unclick box that says always show pictures as thumbnails, or words to that effect.

            No, you can send any photo file, especially jpg in any mail app on pc or online. I do it everyday. Showing thumbnails or icons for the view on your PC has absolutely nothing to do with sending the file in an email.

            Is this serious or scam? Not understand why something so basic needs so many steps. There should be just a checkbox somewhere.

            Hi  Soerendip
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>

    <title>Problems since Skype Desktop for Windows Upgrade - Taskbar and Sound - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems since Skype Desktop for Windows Upgrade - Taskbar and Sound</h2>
                    <p>I recently got an update for Skype for Windows Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly a very different interface...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old days Skype started at Windows start-up and there was an icon in the tray.&nbsp; I could right click that icon to quickly change status as well as use the icon as a quick means of opening Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That icon seems to have disappeared and it seems that Skype closes everytime I click the X button on the program so that it isn't running in the background.&nbsp; So I lose the quick means of changing status and have to keep the program minimised to the taskbat
 instead which takes up a load of taskbar space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, although I have audio set to my headphones, the 'ringing' tune plays over speakers and audio only switches to the headphones when I click answer.&nbsp; That seems a bit counter intuitive or at least it should be an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone able to point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

<p>I became so frustrated with the audio issues that I rebooted a couple of times and then, finally, realised that what was happening was that the update to Skype was offering me the Windows 10 app as a trial which I was accepting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally rejected the offer and I think everything is OK again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for me, the lesson is read the offer more carefully and reject the Windows 10 app version of Skype ;)</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Slow boot-up, issues with Edge and Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmygrant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Slow boot-up, issues with Edge and Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded two laptops....the Lenovo G505s and it went smoothly.&nbsp; Then I did my main laptop, a Toshiba Satellite L75-B7150 and it is full of gremlins.&nbsp; On the Toshiba, things are SSSSSLLLOOOOOWWWWW.&nbsp; Wakeup is quick....boot up will likely have my boots up
 (from the grave) before this thing is ready to go.&nbsp; Pull up a photo----some mouse must be painting the thing for as long as it takes to display.&nbsp; Things do NOT work faster.</p>
<p>I have the Jekyl &amp; Hyde of CORTANAs....if I want the Display Settings, I can say that to her on the Lenovo and get to where I need in one step. On the Toshiba, this conflicted NON-AI couldn't find her way out of a room with a single door.&nbsp; The answer to
 "open Display Settings" results in "Which APP would you like me to open?"&nbsp; If I instead command "Open Settings" Cortana responds, but with a LIST.&nbsp; Make a choice and then a choice in the next step.&nbsp; WHY was I doing this with Cortana?</p>
<p>Well, with a gesture on the track pad, (maybe, I don't really know) the screen orientation changed and the track pad went goofy....very hard to get to the settings to get the screen back in place.&nbsp; I've had it go from landscape to portrait and also to portrait
 reversed.&nbsp; So Cortana helps me get to the necessary page without wanting to throw this confoundingly frustrating Win10 across the room with the computer that it has infected with an alternate personality.&nbsp; This is my primary computer for personal and work
 use....and it is now a time-consuming piece of ****.&nbsp; I can't understand why two computers would react so differently to the the same upgrade---both from fully updated Win 8.1 builds.&nbsp; Both ran the same antivirus programs + antimalware + anti-spyware + firewall
 programs---both showed themselves to be clean.&nbsp; I did NOT like Win 8.1 all that much but I got it to a relationship that worked.&nbsp; Win 10 is not there, not ready---if Cortana is any indication: Schizophrenic.&nbsp; I hunted around for goofball things like screen
 orientation issues but didn't find any.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>OH, while I'm at it, my preferred browser is Firefox, but it runs slow and locks up on Win10.&nbsp; WORSE is EDGE which is slow more often than not and grinds away, unable to load sites.&nbsp; It locks up and can only be dealt with by killing it in Task Manager....responds
 to nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to ask "a question"----this is such a garbage experience that it has no real focus to lead me toward a solution or even to ask pointed questions to seek help.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After upgrading to windows 10, did you update the drivers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the Desktop system in Clean Boot and check if you are facing the same issue in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

            <p>if stuck at 32%, go to device manager, if there is any hardware that shows exclamation marks, disable all of them that have the exclamation marks.&nbsp; This worked for me and I have been working on trying to get windows to install for several weeks now.</p>

    <title>Windows Desktop files are storing at different location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karm patel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Desktop files are storing at different location</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I freshly installed Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 in my desktop PC. I created total 5 Windows User Accounts including myself for my family members with their outlook credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that, the files which I am storing on my desktop are storing in the different location. For an example, for a sample.txt file on desktop, it is storing at location C:\Users\Username\OneDrive\Desktop\ instead of C:\Users\Username\Desktop.<br />
<br />
Also, "Desktop" which is pinned in the Quick Access is of location C:\Users\Username\Desktop. I didn't make any changes in the Quick Access.<br />
<br />
So, when I am storing some files on my desktop, it will not appear in the Desktop which is in the Quick Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening for all the users in my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Karm.</p>

            This is the autosave feature that Windows 10 assumes you want to use if you are signing in with a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />You can change it by right clicking the OneDrive icon in the Taskbar
<br />Click Settings
<br />Click the AutoSave tab
<br />
<br />Click in the list box and change the save location from OneDrive to This PC

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Auto Save option in the OneDrive is set to "This PC Only" for Desktop, Documents and Pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is that my files should be at C:\User\Username\Desktop.</p>

<p>MS Store Apps pre-provisioned in Windows 10 starting to malfunction<br />
===================================================================<br />
When I attempt to launch the Calculator (using the start menu), I get the "spinner" showing that the system is working; but when the "spinner" stops, the calculator has not been launched.&nbsp; The MS Store thinks that the Windows Calculator App is installed and
 does not give me an option to repair it.&nbsp; Other MS Apps such as "Alarms &amp; Clock" are malfunctioning the same way.&nbsp; Everything used to work a couple of months ago and the only software changes were made by "MicroSoft Update".&nbsp; The Calculator still seems to
 be working (at least for now) on some of the other accounts on my machine...</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have tried using the "WSReset.exe" amd the "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps". Neither of these methods worked for me - neither method detected any problems...</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I tried a "manual" de-install / re-install using PowerShell (Administrator) to no avail - it fails - but at least I got some useful diagnostic information from the event log about a missing install file...&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Log follows:

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience and at the same time we appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? Is it an abrupt issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is it an abrupt issue? Also,&nbsp;do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you check if the same issue occurs when you log in to Windows using a different Local Administrator user account?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to run the <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps troubleshooter
</span></a></strong>and check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to update the&nbsp;apps from the Windows Store. This may resolve the issue.

<p>
</p><p>If it still does not help, follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue may happen due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow

<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I don't remember making any significant changes to my computer.&nbsp; I am very diligent about what I do.&nbsp; The only thing that updates Windows in the background without my intervention is Microsoft Update.&nbsp; The malfunctions started a&nbsp;few weeks ago - I first
 noticed that the Calculator was malfunctioning (ie: not running).&nbsp; Initially it would start with a "blank outline" for the Calculator that didn't contain any content (other than the grey background).&nbsp; And now it won't even do that much when I attempt to start
 it.&nbsp; It still works for some of the other accounts on the machine.&nbsp; Go figure!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I can't pinpoint the exact time when things started to go sideways&nbsp;on me - so it would be difficult to find a restore point.&nbsp; I generally delete other than the last two, so I might not have anything to go back to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I just tested "Calculator" on another account with Administrator privileges.&nbsp; I simply launched it from the Start Menu.&nbsp; The Calculator first installed and then launched as expected.&nbsp; Go figure!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I did try the App Troubleshooter first (see my initial post), it didn't find anything amiss.&nbsp; I re-ran it after you posted your question and attach the log - it still can't find anything amiss:</p>

</p><p>5. The MS Windows Store thinks that Calculator is already installed and working on my account and does not give me an option to repair or re-install.&nbsp; (Which is why I attempted to do it "manually" as per my posts.)&nbsp; MS Windows Store is brain-dead!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. When I first detected the problem, I&nbsp;ran the sfc/scannow command you referenced.&nbsp; Always good to check things are not corrupt before embarking on further research and testing and posting to this forum.&nbsp;The sfc/scannow did not discover any problems.&nbsp; I
 re-ran it after you posted your question and attach the log - it still can't find anything amiss:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; When I first detected the problem, I also ran the two DSIM.exe commands you referenced.&nbsp; Always good to check things are not corrupt before embarking on further research and testing and posting to this forum.&nbsp; Neither of the DSIM scans detected any problems.&nbsp;
 I re-ran both scans after you posted your question and attach the log - DSIM&nbsp;still can't find anything amiss:</p>

            <p>After a little more digging and after discovering that the MS Windows Apps are malfunctioning on only some of the accounts on my machine, I discovered the following article that attempts to describe how "scaling" works in the MS Apps world:</p>
<p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj679352.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the article is poorly written and does not go into much detail. &nbsp;It did however lead me to check the manifest files in the WinApps directory for the calculator. &nbsp;What I discovered is that the installed files do NOT match the manifest in:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_2016.149.20.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxMetadata\AppxBundleManifest.xml"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect, the manifest was updated by MicroSoft Update &nbsp;(see previous reply/post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I do remember, resizing the Calculator (and some of my other non-functioning Apps) using the normal "click on the edge of the app window and drag" technique. &nbsp;Maybe this triggers the app into attempting to use another scaling file (which is described
 in the manifest but doesn't exist in the install)???</p>

            <p>You won't believe this!&nbsp; Windows Calculator started working for me this morning...&nbsp; Something installed the missing file (and it doesn't look like Microsoft update - I checked the update history and nothing is logged for the last couple of days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, several scale files were installed.&nbsp; Go figure!&nbsp; Maybe a Magical Microsoft Minion did it - after all, this is Windows 10 and things just apparently happen for no reason.&nbsp; In any case, the following log shows what happened to Calculator&nbsp;and when.&nbsp;
 Hope this helps someone at Microsoft figure out what is going on.&nbsp; I still have problems with Alarms&nbsp;&amp; Clock and will start focusing on that in my following posts.&nbsp; I have also included a "full directory dump" for all the MS Store Windows Apps.&nbsp; You can see
 that almost all of the "scale" files magically appeared over the last 3 days.&nbsp; Log follows:</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, the Windows Calculator is now working on all of the accounts on my machine.&nbsp; I note the "something" installed most of the missing "scale" directories that were missing on many of the MS Store Apps.&nbsp; This happened&nbsp;on June 24/25/26 and&nbsp;caused
 most&nbsp;malfunctioning MS Store Apps&nbsp;to start working properly again&nbsp;- so I guess someone at Microsoft is reading this thread and figuring out how to fix things...&nbsp; Many thanks - please do identify yourself - I'll buy you a beer when you're in town.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Windows Alarms &amp; Clocks isn't working yet and whatever "fix" was sent out on June 24th / 25th / 26th did not resolve all of the issues - the cause is related but somewhat different.&nbsp; See next post.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The file NvCpl.dll belongs to nvidia driver installed on the computer. If you have any nvidia application on the computer, try to reinstall it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall and reinstall the device from device manger. <br />
a. Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
b. In device manager, locate the device.<br />
c. Right click on the device and select uninstall<br />
d. Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you visit the video card driver manufacturer website download and install the latest driver for the device and check if it works.</span></span></p>

    <title>Installing Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Platinum 25th Anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainbowstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition on Windows 8 question</h2>
                    I recently bought an HP laptop with Windows 8 installed on it. I have the Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition of the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing software which will run on both Windows and Mac, and the minimum requirements for Windows is either XP, Vista
 or 7. What I would like to know is if I can install the Mavis Beacon software that I have on my Windows 8 laptop and just set it to run in Compatibility Mode, or if I need to purchase the&nbsp;25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of the Mavis Beacon software. Any help
 with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<p>The XBL PET do not discuss console bans. You should check the e-mail account associated with your profile as they tend to send notices of suspension/ban there.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    I used the Windows 10 Update assistant to update my PC to the latest version..... But it failed at the last step and showed "Restoring previous version of Windows" However there were some updates pending.. Did the update failed because the current version
 was not up to date? will updating previous version fully get windows successfully updated.&nbsp;I'm at build 10240 since anniversary update are no more OTA, Does that mean I wont get the update and ill have to be at 10240..

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check

<br />Well 1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load or use the "Even better methods" or "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have update the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Thank you Kapil Arya! This solved our problem.</p>
<p>But the first time I wasn't able to rename the catroot2 folder. It seemed the service cryptSvc was running again.</p>
<p>After another "net stop cryptSvc" and a quick action to rename catroot2 to catroot2.old it worked.</p>

<p>I've got the same problem - domain of about 60 W10 Pro machines, all currently running 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until now I've normally done the big six-monthly updates manually by downloading and extracting the ISO and running the setup program. That works, but is time consuming. I've done it with a couple of machines for the 1709 update, and it installs no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I am trying to do the bulk of them through WSUS, but I get the above error when they try to install. I've tried moving one machine to an OU without the WSUS GPO applied, so that it tries to get it straight from the Microsoft servers, but it gives
 the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running the suggested commands by sticking them in a batch file (with the intention, if it worked, of calling the batch file from a logon script on all machines), but I get an access denied error when it tries to rename the SoftwareDistribution
 folder (I am running from an elevated command prompt).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried the Microsoft script linked to above, and that also fails to rename the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? I can do the update on all computers manually if I have to,&nbsp; but I'd rather not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<div>Hello David, if you can't rename the SoftwareDistribution folder it could be that the service "wuauserv" is running (again). If you try another command (net stop wuauserv), does it say that the service is not running? Or is it stopping? In that case if
 was still on. And you can try to rename the folder before the service is restarting again.</div>

<p>I'm running it using a batch file, but looking at the output when it runs shows that it's reporting the wuauserv service as stopped, and when the start command later in the batch file executes it reports it as started - if it was still running it would normally
 give a message indicating that it was already started.</p>

<p>For my brand new (yes new) surface pro with this same problem with 1709 update, i tried the set of commands above from&nbsp;Kapil Arya MVP as admin.&nbsp; Kept getting access denied for some.&nbsp; So i rebooted and simply manually changed the file name for SoftwareDistribution
 to the .old suffix.&nbsp; Reboot and everything worked!&nbsp; Oh, and i set up my surface to never turn off while on power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue was that the surface was going to sleep during the download and it was corrupting the update file somehow.&nbsp; Would be really nice if MS could let you "flush" an update file more easily.</p>

 see&nbsp;no solution in the Help file. How can I get those failed updates to install? Windows Update doesn't seem to have a command to re-install or re-download them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>An unused code wouldnt help you out, because the codes had a redeem by date on them, &nbsp;which is why the pre order stuff gets put online for sale, like Sting and Hogan.... &nbsp;Hogans DLC was removed so chances are you wont be able to get it in any form now....
 Just like he was removed from being included in WWE 2K16</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Enforcement... A sorry excuse of internet enforcement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bajabling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Enforcement... A sorry excuse of internet enforcement</h2>
                    <p>So I was playing a ranked game last night on Rainbow Six: Siege. I had a long day and it was the last day before the season ended so I wanted to get a couple games in. It may have been a bad idea, due to my tiredness, I struggled all game long and we ultimately
 lost the game because of my poor performance. My teammates were probably upset with me, I know I would be if I were my teammate in a ranked match. So after the match, I get this guy, who was struggling himself by the way, messaging me saying "Yo stick 2 casual.
 U r trash". That is understandable, I played like trash I get that. But knowing that he also played like trash and having the audacity to say that to me, I got irritated so I replied "Just not my night. Check my stats, don't @ with your
<strong>[mod removed-profanity]</strong> .88 kd". The guy is not a good player, judging from his kill death ratio, and with further research he has reached platinum 2 in a previous season. You know what that means? He plays with good teammates and boosts himself
 to higher ranks when he should really be a high silver or low gold at best with his individual performances.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward about 16 hours, I get a 1 day suspension from communication on Xbox Live. Now I'm not tripping about the suspension, I kind of earned that. But what irks me the most is that I am actually the victim in this situation. The guy calls me trash
 and instigates everything and when I retaliate, I'm somehow the bad guy? And once I get the suspension, the perpetrator messages me stating "Enjoy ur chat ban loser lol". If that is not a suspension worthy violation of communication on his part, then I don't
 know what is. If he goes without any sort of punishment, then I seriously question the integrity of the Xbox Live Enforcement team.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I earned my suspension, but do not let the other guy go scotts free when he was responsible for all of it while committing to violation of the TOS himself. This is unbelievably irresponsible and questionable on your part, Microsoft. If you're going to review
 a report, review the whole&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed-Inappropriate) </strong>&nbsp;thing. You can't punish one party when two were involved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I actually did not expect for so many to view this thread. So let me tl;dr this for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got punished for breaking violation, I understand that and I accept my punishment. However, what I DON’T accept is the fact that the other guy got away when all the evidence of his violation is right there along with mine. That is lazy, one sided officiating
 and quite frankly disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how a situation starts. If you respond in a way that violates the code of conduct, you can be punished. It's best to just report the other person and block communications with them. As long as you reported them, the enforcement team will
 also investigate them and take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p>

            Enforcement teams do not use these forums. you can request to appeal the ban, but basically he tried to get you to say something worth banning, and you said it. They don't care who started what, they care about what you said. From now on, ignore comments
 from players like that.

<p>Hello Bling,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the one day suspension.&nbsp; In these instances best thing to do is ignore, report, then block them. Some people look for chances to report. Unfortunately, with a 1 day suspension unable to file a case review as the suspension is too
 short. It usually takes them about 72 hours to review a case in that time your suspension would be over. We totally understand how this can be frustrating. Also, some suspensions don't come right away. For example, if something got reported it can take weeks
 sometimes for a suspension to be issued. Not saying this is the case because I don't know but it has happened in past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Oh no, I totally agree. It doesn't matter how it starts, what matters is what happens during the duration of it. All I want is some fair and equal treatment on both parties that were involved. If one person is to be punished, punish the other one too.
 It's simple.

<p>Send me a message on Xbox Live, I'll show you what I was suspended for (which was not warranted, regardless of who initiated comms) and how Brad A. here just locked my forum and edited the hell out of my original post. I can't do it until 3/19 when the bogus
 ban is lifted. I am going to start an Xbox Enforcement Exposed Facebook page TODAY. We will compile evidence/experiences. Here's the link to the butchered post, but I'll show you the original version and what he actually edited out. I screenshot everything

            Hi I'm sorry to hear this being an issue, if you made a report to enforcement they will do their due diligence in handling the matter. Unfortunately the enforcement team does not use the forums here. Any information about your profile etc. can be found
 by going to http://enforcement.xbox.com

<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic Startup Repair Loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm part of the Windows Insider Program. &nbsp;With the latest Windows update, I ran into numerous issues and used all the information to date on your site, as well as other tech blogs to assist with troubleshooting to no avail. &nbsp;I'm unable to perform a system
 repair, system image backp nor roll back to a previous build. &nbsp;It's in an endless reboot since December 10. &nbsp; It goes through the diagnosing PC. &nbsp;I've done numerous restarts, shutdowns, etc. &nbsp; I've done some of hardware troubleshooting, such as removing battery,
 as well. &nbsp;I've attempted to do a clean install. It won't recognize. &nbsp;It sounds like it wants to boot, but nothing. &nbsp;The only thing that seems operational is the command prompt. &nbsp;I've done sfc /scannow. &nbsp;It finds no issues. It has all the files, etc. &nbsp;I've
 done all the troubleshooting that I can do. &nbsp;Hoping you can do something from your end, since the computer is non functional now, however is needed since all my office programs are on that one. My other newer pc that has been updated from windows 7 to windows
 pro 10 and while it has experienced some glitches, never encountered anything such as this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your continued courtesies.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestions that you have provided have already been attempted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what occurs when the computer is powered on and the cycle will repeat after each option is selected, whether restarted and/or shut down. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's already in "preparing startup repair" modedthen proceeds to " diagnosing pc"</p>
<p>Automatic repair screen (blue) Your PC did not start correctly, prompted to either select "restart" or "advanced options" then "choose an option" screen with 3 options: "continue" "troubleshoot" or "turn off pc". &nbsp;Select Advanced options screen with 6 options
 "system restore" "system image recovery" "startup repair" "command prompt" "startup settings" "go back to previous build". &nbsp;I've selected all options and the loop then repeats without correcting any issues. &nbsp;The "startup repair" has been selected continuously
 and doesn't correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that works is the command prompt and its now running an older build from July. version 10240. &nbsp;I believe this occured when I attempted to go back to a previous build, even though it stated can't process. &nbsp; And there are no corrupt files that
 have been detected in the self registry and/or other scans performed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to run another clean install of Windows 10 with the media tool as it continuously repeats the process of the automatic startup repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occured after the last windows update from November. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have repeated this process on an ongoing basis since 12/10. &nbsp;With updates being pushed, thought it might have self corrected but no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use my computer at all now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your kind reply.</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Thank you for your response with the current status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please provide the information:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disclaimer for Reset:</span></strong></p>
<p>All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled. If you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and your PC has a Windows
 8 recovery partition, resetting your PC will restore Windows 8. You’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after the reset has finished.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed all that was suggested prior to contacting. &nbsp;System restore option did not work either prior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the reset pc . &nbsp;It hung at 42% for 11 hours approximate. &nbsp;I turned off computer and now all I receive is&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>"an operating system wasn't found. &nbsp;try disconnecting any drives that don't containt an operating system press ctrl + alt +del to restart"</p>
<p>
</p><p>it won't start or reboot with dvd or usb either now. &nbsp;May be worse than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this device was never on 8, but 7. &nbsp;My pc could not never complete the process. &nbsp;However, it was working on 10, until the last updates from Nov. 28 with glitches, such as the start icon, cortana, settings function, etc. &nbsp;With each update
 fixes generally fixed the problem, now it's not even in a usable state. &nbsp;and I'm sure things will be lost that won't be recovered, including all the time to get it back to working conditions.</p>

<h2>            Desktop randomly disappears and the whole screen goes Green. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So lately my surface Pro has been doing this thing where the desktop randomly disappears. I only get a Green screen. Everything is technically working though. For example, I could be doing something with browser open and then I notice my bar go green. However
 the browser is still there and I can go in the internet and work normally, but if I minimize it disappears and I can't get the browser back.&nbsp; (or anything for that matter).</p>
<p>Crt alt delete works, and restarting the surface solves the issue. The problem is that it keeps coming back frequently enough to be a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has had issues like this before? is there anything wrong with the surface? it's rather new. I bought it a couple of months ago.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402348...</a>.  I would download the whole package of latest drivers to make sure they are all current.
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />You can try downloading the latest Surface Pro recovery image and use it to reinstall Windows 10 to see if it resolves the problem:

<br />
<br />If that does not work, I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>I just bought the latest surface pro 4 so it has the latest updates and the latest windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no roll back option but im a bit afraid of uninstalling a display driver.&nbsp;</p>

            Uninstalling the display driver is not gonna make your Surface inoperable, it will either do one of two things:
<br />
<br />- Reinstall the driver
<br />- Revert to Microsoft Basic Display driver

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. I’ll certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Low memory problems occur when your computer runs out of RAM and becomes low on virtual memory. This can happen when you run more programs than the RAM installed on the computer is designed to support. Low memory problems can also occur when a program doesn't
 free up memory that it no longer needs. This problem is called <span>memory overuse</span> or a
<span>memory leak</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s <strong>run a System maintenance troubleshooting</strong> and check. It
</span>checks issues that might slow down your computer's performance, such as how many users are currently logged on to the computer and whether multiple programs are running at the same time</p>
