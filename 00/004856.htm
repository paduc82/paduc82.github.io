            <p>Hi SwaroopBolledla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having difficulties with Syncing your Email Account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In order to best assist you please clarify&nbsp;if the Hotmail Account you're referring to&nbsp;is set as an additional Email Account or is it used as a Microsoft Account in your Lumia 730 configuration.<br />
<br />
You can check that in Settings &gt; Email + Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also other than the Error Code you're receiving. Is there any additional description of the issue?<br />
Account could be for instance identified as "Not up to date".<br />
<br />
If your Hotmail Account is set as additional Email Account, one thing to try would be to remove it from the phone and add it back again after that.<br />
<br />
Thank You,</p>
<p>Marek </p>

<h2>            Word Crashes Every Time I Try to Print Full Color Document</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to print a sheet full of 4" x 2" full-color labels (I'm copying an pasting color images from Photoshop into each 4 x 2 cell in the table on Word). Every time I try to send the document for printing to my HP Photosmart print, Word crashes. Now,
 I have to print each of the 10 labels one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to keep the program from crashing every time?</p>

            <p>Within the document, BEFORE printing it, run File&gt;Reduce file size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's almost instant, and achieves the same effect as reducing the size of the individual images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs to me that your TABLE may be what is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case, fix it with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Table&gt;Select&gt;Table, then&nbsp;</li><li>Table&gt;Convert&gt;Table to text, then<br />
WItHOUT moving your selection</li><li>Table&gt;Convert&gt;Text to Table</li></ol>
<p>That will remove the corrupt table if it is bad. &nbsp;The pictures should fall back into their correct slots if you have inserted them correctly.</p>

    <title>Sync Outlook 2013 POP email account calendar with an EAS Hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonviamonte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Outlook 2013 POP email account calendar with an EAS Hotmail calendar</h2>
                    <p>I have a POP3 email account and use it with Outlook 2013. I want to sync the primary calendar associated with my POP email with my Hotmail account so the calendar will sync with my Windows phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have both my POP3 email and EAS account running at the same time and they each have their own calendar in Outlook. Can I merge the&nbsp;calendars into one so that the&nbsp;EAS will&nbsp;show all calendar entries on all of my devices running&nbsp;Outlook or Windows
 EAS? I have EAS running on my Surface and Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or how can I simply merge the POP3 email account calendar to my Hotmail calendar like someone would do with Google calendar, which actually works on my Windows phone now? I want to turn off the google calendar and just run one calendar for everything off
 of my Hotmail account.</p>

            <p>There's no such thing as a POP calendar.&nbsp; The POP protocol is a mail-only protocol.&nbsp; It knows nothing about calendar or contacts.&nbsp; Moreover, it is one-way - from the server to the client.&nbsp; Nothing can pass back up the link to the Inbox of the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchange ActiveSync accounts do synchronize, but since they must at all times reflect the contents of the server, they will always have their own folder sets, including calendar and contacts.&nbsp; If you want to designate the EAS account as the default account
 and the EAS account's data file as the default data file, you'll be as close to what you want as you can get.</p>

            <p>You are missing the point. I didn't state that I had a POP calendar. I stated that I have a POP email account in Outlook that has a Calendar associated with it&nbsp; it, along with an EAS account with a calendar associated with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can I Sync my primary&nbsp;POP data account in Outlook with Gmail and&nbsp;my Windows phone&nbsp;but not with Hotmail? I don't want to make @Hotmail.com my primary account because my primary email is @simplicitinc.com. I simply want the calendar information on my business
 account in Outlook to save/sync to my Hotmail calendar, that will then sync with my phone and other devices like my Surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do I have to designate my non business account as my primary as opposed to simply synchronizing my business calendar in Outlook with the online Hotmail calendar like I would do with a Google calendar? Or like I used to do with Google Calendar Sync?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I make my personal EAS account my primary account, anything I receive or send from my business&nbsp;account won't sync or show up in my business calendar. Think about it. If I&nbsp;get a meeting request to my @simplicitinc.com account and save it, it will always
 go to that calendar in Outlook. People are not sending me meeting requests, nor am I sending them out from my personal email account. However I do want use my Hotmail calendar as my central storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR why can't the multiple emails in Outlook save to a single calendar instead of having each account in Outlook have a separate calendar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your solution doesn't make sense for ANYONE that doesn't use MSFT as their&nbsp; primary personal or business emails. This needs to be addressed with a supported fix.</p>

            <p>Hi Hal,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have the same problem as Brandon and followed the steps given in your link above. It works to sync the outlook calendar linked to the personal outlook.com email ID.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, if someone sends me a calendar invite using my POP3 / business email ID, that appointment shows up in my business calendar linked to my POP3 / business account and not the calendar linked to my&nbsp;outlook.com personal account. So, this calendar invite
 is not synced to my outlook.com account and thereby my WP8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any idea how to take care of this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><br />

            It seems reasonable to expect calendar invites sent to your work address to appear in the work mailbox's calendar. &nbsp;If you make the Outlook.com mailbox's data file the default data file, then all your default folders will be in the Outlook.com mailbox
 and invitations will be placed in that calendar by default.

            Good grief!&nbsp; I have this same issue!<br />
<br />
I've got 75 Windows Phones deployed in our business.&nbsp; We were using Office 2010 with the Hotmail connector to successfully sync calendar events and contacts with the Windows Phones.&nbsp; Then, MS migrated all MS accounts to their EAS platform, and the syncing stopped
 working.&nbsp; I have our owner set up on Outlook 2016 with an MS account that uses our company domain.&nbsp; For a non-techie user, this all gets very confusing.&nbsp; What would immensely help my users would be the ability to flat get rid of the multiple contacts lists,
 address books, and calendars, and be able to just set ONE that everything ties to.&nbsp; My boss gets so confused shuffling between calendars when switching between his office PC, his Surface, and his Windows Phone.<br />
I also hate that if I choose to set up MS accounts for employees that do not use our company domain, I find that devices now must have two email accounts (one for our domain and one @outlook.com), and I have to constantly remind employees not to use the outlook.com
 account for email as it confuses our customers who see emails coming from us but not from our domain.<br />
<br />
For a company and their devices that are supposed to be geared toward users, this is just a mess.<br />
I refrain from using our domain as MS accounts exactly because of how often MS decides they want to change how their platform works, and how it syncs with other features.&nbsp; I feel "safer" keeping our domain accounts separate from our MS accounts.<br />
<br />
MS, please provide an option to specify a single calendar and contacts list that will be used consistently and can leveraged to sync info with all of a users devices, regardless of the number of accounts a user has set up in their desktop version of Outlook.

<p>Let me see if I understand, your are using a free Hotmail account with your domain Alias? for a business, and not a full exchange mail account?</p>
<p>MS has been migrating old Hotmail/Outlook.com/MSN/Live mail accounts from EAS to Exchange since late 2015</p>
<p>There have/are issues with alias mail accounts&nbsp;</p>

            Hi....I have been having the same problem (and have been checking online for days to see if this problem is widespread). I have a hotmail account and everyone who has Yahoo is finding my emails in their spam box (which is odd....b/c these are friends I've
 emailed for years and I'm in their contacts). &nbsp;My one friend (who has Yahoo) said a whole bunch of her friends wound up in spam. When I asked her to check if they were all hotmail addresses she said "Yes." &nbsp;I'm guessing it might be a Yahoo problem, but I don't
 quite know how to resolve this. &nbsp;Any ideas? Christine

                    <p>Hello, &nbsp;A few days ago we tested our clasiffieds site clasin.com and tested out the Contact Seller option with our old hotmail account. &nbsp;And we discovered it went to the junk mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are concerned about this because many of our users have a hotmail account and might not get the messages from their buyers because of this.</p>

<h2>            Switching networks between WIFI and Cellular data is TOO DAMN SLOW&#33;</h2>
                    Microsoft!&nbsp; What the heck is up?&nbsp; WP 8.0, 8.1, &amp; 10 if I leave a building and try to use my phone's networking feature, it takes about a minute to switch from the building's wifi and my phone's data network.&nbsp; This is particularly evident when using Cortana.&nbsp;
 I use Cortana when I'm driving.&nbsp; So when I leave my building and hop into my truck, I use Cortana IMMEDIATELY to try and contact my wife and let her know I'm on my way home.&nbsp; Invariably, Cortana will think for 45 seconds and then say, "Something went wrong.&nbsp;
 Try again in a little bit."&nbsp; This happens every single time.&nbsp; It is embarrassing and irritating.&nbsp; Please find a way to fix this!

            Thanks, but I am not having "slow&nbsp;down issues...".&nbsp; I am having issues with Cortana specifically when&nbsp;switching from Wi-Fi to cellular.&nbsp; She is useless for the first minute that I am exiting Wi-Fi.&nbsp; This was an issue with WP8.1 as well.&nbsp; Cortana seems
 to be the only one suffering from this issue while I am exiting a building.

    <title>fill series automatically in certain cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fazlulhaque  say:</h3>
<h2>            fill series automatically in certain cells</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody, I am making <b>Seating Plans</b> for Examinees coming from different colleges. I am trying it in Excel 2007 and I wonder if there is any way that if I fill one cell of the first bench, the other cells will be filled in
 automatically without the use of the Cell Handle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Features of my Room and Seating Plan</p>
<ol>
<li>The room is rectangular in size.</li><li>There are 3 columns of benches.</li><li>There are 10 benches in each column</li><li>In each bench, 3 students can sit.</li><li>There seating arrangements for 90 students</li><li>I took Column A,B,C as a bench keep D blank for walking between column then EFG a bench, H blank;<span>&nbsp;
</span>IJK is the last column of benches</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Problems</p>
<ol>
<li>Filling in each column by cell handle is boring</li><li>At the beginning of each column I have to type Roll No. and drag the handle</li><li>Some students may be missing in the middle (students registered but dropped out)</li><li>What to do if someone is missing in the series</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need</p>
<p>I will just fill in the Student Roll No.in the first cell and all other (89) cells will be filled in automatically.
</p>

            <p>OK!&nbsp; We can do that with simple formulas.&nbsp; In A10 on Room 01 sheet put this formula:</p>
<p>=OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10,0)</p>
<p>The -10 would be the same as the first row number in any seating arrangement.</p>
<p>In B10 we need to account for seats already used, so we modify the formula a little:</p>
<p>=OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10<strong>+10</strong>,0)</p>
<p>The +10 accounts for all the seats to the left of this column that would be filled.</p>
<p>In C10 this formula:</p>
<p>=OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10<strong>+20</strong>,0)</p>
<p>All we had to change was +10 to +20</p>
<p>Now for the other formulas </p>
<p>cell E10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+30,0)</p>
<p>cell F10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+40,0)</p>
<p>cell G10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+50,0)</p>
<p>cell I10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+60,0)</p>
<p>cell J10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+70,0)</p>
<p>cell K10&nbsp; formula =OFFSET('All Rolls'!$A$1,ROW()-10+80,0)</p>
<p>At this point you can select cells A10:K10 and fill down to row 19 and your seating should populate automatically.&nbsp; Unused seats near the end will show up as zero in the chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can adapt that formula for your 2-seat benches easily also.</p>
<p>I've uploaded a copy of your file with the formulas inserted into the two sheets - along with an additional sheet showing how things might look if the room is not filled.&nbsp; Click this link to open the file - then click the small "Open in Excel" link that
 appears near the top of the worksheet as seen in your browser to place a copy onto your computer.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 published calendar keeps asking for login</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've published my Outlook 2010 (Exchange account) using the publish online feature. It has been working ok until yesterday. Outlook as started to ask for my Live credentials every 30 minutes or so. I've tried unpublishing the calendar but this action requires
 the Live credentials. I can log in to ohter Live services like Outlook.com so my account seems to be working.</p>
<p>I have also tried to republish the calendar but Outlook errors out saying there was an error trying to connect to the webserver.</p>
<p>Have also read other users reporting this same issue starting today.</p>
<p>On my Event Viewer I can see several of these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Microsoft Outlook</p>
<p>The upload of "Calendar" failed. The next upload attempt occurs with the next send/receive. There was a problem uploading the file to the server.</p>
<p>P1: 301895</p>
<p>P2: 14.0.6029.1000</p>
<p>P3: 3psa</p>
<p>P4: 0x80072F7C</p>
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a problem with the publishing feature of calendar from Outlook 2010 to Office.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Well seems MS is discontinuing the publish to Office.com feature from Outlook (2010 and earlier, 2013 does not support the feature since RTM).</p>
<p>The alternative is to use another webdav/ical free publishing service like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icalx.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#9b4f96">www.icalx.com</font></a> seems rather simple to use, just create an account and from the Outlook client publish
 to webdav server using the URL provided by the service. You can select to publish private or public (required to subscribe from Live Calendar if thats your objective).</p>
<p>I'm testing it right now. Subscribed from Google calendar and from Live calendar.</p>
<p>Seem to work really nice.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com dormant email after one year... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kd_cooke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com dormant email after one year...</h2>
                    I understand the outlook.com email addresses go dormant if not accessed within a year... Can anyone tell me if this is determined based on login to the outlook.com web site, or will any email activity suffice.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Specifically, I have a small number of users I manager (15 or so). I am considereing moving our domain to outlook.com. The majority of my users use an iPad to access email, and will never use the web interface. My concern is that those users who exclusively
 use the Hotmail or ActiveSync iPad connectors will have their accounts locked -- as they will not use the outlook.com web interface.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I have seen, and have read the snippet of text in your reply. And I understand the requirement of logging in to the outlook.com web interface. To be clear, after setting up and logging in once (within 10 days), I would still need to login once every 270
 days (from each account) to ensure the account is not flagged as dormant. Correct?</div>

It is fairly simple.&nbsp; In order to reset the inactivity COOKIE you have to log on using a web browser.&nbsp; I have no idea how you are logging in using an iPad and what you mean by outlook.com "hosted" but it needs to be via browser.<br />

Does access of mails using products like MS Outlook 2013 or MS Outlook 2010 ( kindly 'bing' them in case still not understandable ) count towards activity of emails, is the question posted by OP and me too now.<br />

<p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>Currently, that is the normal behavior and it is not feasible to change the path. When clicking the Save to OneDrive-company button, the Save to OneDrive action will automatically saves your files to the Email attachments folder. Once they are in OneDrive
 for Business, we can move them to any other folder.</p>

<p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>I would explain that, as the contents in Shared with Me are stored at other users' online library, we would not be able to directly move the files in our own OneDrive for Business into other users' storage.</p>
<p>We need to manually download the file, and access colleague's library to upload the downloaded files instead.</p>
<p>This action requires your permissions in the library which you are not the owner of. Please turn to your colleague if needed.</p>
<p>We would appreciate your understanding.</p>

            I stand corrected. If the reference style is a character style and it does not extend onto the next line, the StyleRef field will pick up the paragraph mark. If it is a paragraph style, this does not happen.<br />

                    I find it convenient to use keyboard shortcuts, when available, rather than moving my hands repeatedly back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse (or trackpad).<br />
<br />
In Word for Windows it's possible to select menu items using the keyboard: ALT + the initial letter of the menu item, followed by the initial letter of the submenu item(s).<br />
<br />
Is there a similar mechanism in Word 2008?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>There have been a couple of dozen posts of people having similar problems with saving. Until Microsoft fixes this, the best work method is to
<strong>Save As</strong> instead of saving. Give an increasing number to each new file. Then when you finish, delete the intermediate versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, you can enable OS X's Time Machine so it can back up versions of your work. If you're low on disk space, you'll need an external drive to store the files.</p>

 it reverted back to "Games". If I use the same live ID on my Windows 8, I seem to have access to the Xbox live games in the Windows Store.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you please tell me if this is a problem on my phone, or Xbox live games are allowed to Windows 8 in Romania, but not to Windows Phone 7.5? A clear list with country by country availability information would be useful, but I cannot find any...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind Regards,</div>

    <title>Crippling virus - can not run any .exe files, open task manager, or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derek d_991  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crippling virus - can not run any .exe files, open task manager, or perform any administrator tasks</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I encountered a virus on my HP Envy laptop today. It is using the Windows 8.1 64 bit operating system.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What the virus appears to have done is prevent any .exe files from running (displayed error is "The extended attributes are inconsistent"). My next step was to open the Task Manager to see if there was a process causing this problem that I could close,
 but the Task Manager can not be opened. What happens is that I get the error message "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an associate in the Default
 Programs control panel."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OK, so I went to the Default Programs control panel and found that I had no clue how to add the Task Manager to the default programs listed there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Alright so my next attempt was to do a system restore. This is where I learned that the virus is blocking the system from performing any administrator tasks. When I went to the System Restore option in the Control Panel, my screen flashed green (my Windows
 8 theme background), and brought me back to the desktop wit the control panel closed. I tried this a couple times, all with the same result.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next was to try opening the command prompt. I found that opening the command prompt will work if I DO NOT open as an administrator. If I open as an administrator, the screen flashes green and I am returned to the desktop again. Also, opening up my file
 explorer now appeared to do the same thing. After opening, the screen flashes green and then I am brought back to the desktop, so I can not navigate any folders at the moment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I started up a full computer scan using AVG 2014. After the scan, 3 threats were detected and removed. I did a complete system boot (shut down, removed battery, held down power button for 10 seconds), then started it up again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem persists - can not run any .exe files, open task manager, or perform any admin tasks. I can not do a system restore either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to install new antivirus software, including MalwareBytes. Downloading was no issue, but trying to run the .exe resulted in the same errors as above.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me with this virus? I was hoping to get this solved without a full system wipe, but that seems like the only option. Since I am unable to open my file explorer, I can not think of a possible way to backup my files to an external device
 right now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help. And please remember in your responses that I CAN NOT download and install new programs, run any .exe files, can not open my task manager, and can not access any administrator functions.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook 2013. Folder cleanup</h2>
                    When I run the cleanup utility in Office 365 Outlook (2013) on my inbox, it appears to delete (move) messages that are NOT duplicates from my inbox. Has anyone else had this problem? It is a bit disturbing (to put it mildly!). System is win 7 pro, Office

<p>1. Yes. &nbsp;I am using Clean up folder on Home tab. I set the options so as to move duplicate messages to a folder (A_test). Then looked in A_Test at the messages it moved. Unable to find these messages in the original folder by looking at the same date.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi all</p>
<p>Panic over! Thanks to Nayana! I checked the box "when a reply modifies a message, don't move the original" and the problem went away. This is a very poorly worded rule and is misleading. &nbsp;I thought it meant what it said --"modifies a message" -- &nbsp;when it
 actually seems to mean "includes a message in its reply". I hope the software engineers take note!</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            OOPS Spoke too soon! Problems is still there. The above fix (checking option "When a reply modifies..") worked on a couple of messages, but not on others. THIS IS VERY UPSETTING! For now I will not use the cleanup facility, but it makes me worry about
 how many similar issues exist!

<h2>            &#34;Memory stick&#34; features in a mobile device</h2>
                    We're currently researching Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices for our nonprofit.&nbsp; (I'm leaning towards the Windows).&nbsp; I know very little about these devices, so I'm sure I'll have lots of questions after I read some more posts.&nbsp; I did get a question
 from my Director today that I'm not sure how to answer.&nbsp; He currently uses a Palm and said he was able to use it today as a "memory stick".&nbsp; I guess he stored a document on there - I'm not entirely sure?? Assuming that's what he means, can I, or would I even
 want to, store info on the device?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.<br />

<p>The simple answer is YES you can and YES you will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I copy documents to my device all the time and then place them on a different computer when I arrive.&nbsp; It is easy and convenient.&nbsp; And yes, sometimes I just do the transfer by taking out my removable storage card , insert it in my computer nad
 then place it back in my device.</p>

That's good to know - thanks.&nbsp; Does the Windows device come with a removable storage card?&nbsp; (Keep in mind, these questions are coming from someone who's NEVER used one).

I guess I should clarified... do you purchase the card separately or is it part of the phone?

<h2>            &#34;This web page wants to run the following add-on&#34; message keeps coming after yesterday</h2>
                    <p>Every time I use IE11 on my Windows 8.1 OS i keep getting this message. The add-on asked for is most often 'Adobe Flash Player' but it can be others as well. I have tried solution to resolve problem with flash player help from ADOBE but all 3 suggestions
 does not work for me. I can address this problem from within 24 hours beginning 2014-11-12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has no effect to click "Allow" or 'Allow for all websites'&nbsp;button, the problem remains. Cant solve it or get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did something in the latest patch for IE change the security settings like this? How can I solve this?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The proposed steps did not work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got it running again by manually uninstall every security patch installed by windows update the last two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that it all worked again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I let windows update install the patches again piece for piece, that did the trick for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time and money spent for this I don't want to think about.</p>
