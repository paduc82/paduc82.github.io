<h2>            Different colors on Microsoft and Mac PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a PowerPoint layout for my company that has a specific red for background and for some elements and it changes color form a Mac computer to a Windows one. Even if the RGB is the same on both computers, the color is completely different. And even
 more so, when tow or more people with different types of operating systems work on the same document the presentation keeps changing color, until it becomes a red rainbow...</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered this problem before and can you advise on the best way to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Anca&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Desktop taskbar icons not responding</h2>
                    I have found holding the mouse button on the icon helps, sometimes. I check mouse settings all were default and other icons (other then taskbar) were working normal, also Windows Explorer very slow, it is default, and Chrome is installed but not default
 but works quickly as normal, I suspect the aforementioned condition a result of "keylogging" by I.E.

<h3> j-m_90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails coming delayed to Outlook 2016 client as a bigger batch at the same time</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
We have 4 computers in our company office. Three of them has Outlook 2013 installed and fourth one has Outlook 2016.<br />
Those 3 computers using Outlook 2013 seem to work fine with email and they have had Outlook installed longer time already but that<br />
fourth computer is a new one and we installed Outlook 2016 on that. We transferred old emails from Windows Live Mail 2011<br />
to that Outlook client.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there is a delay between 20 minutes to even a day with incoming mails appearing in Outlook 2016.<br />
Those emails arrive as a bigger group at the same time when coming late to Outlook client.<br />
We have google searched the problem and tried a lot of settings that has helped some people with these problems.<br />
When logging in with that same email to RoundCube webmail provided by our ISP all emails are there and mails have not been lost so that problem<br />
seems to be related to mails just coming late to Outlook from server side. So webmail works OK but usually there is delay with mails apprearing<br />
in Outlook 2016 client.<br />
<br />
We called our ISP and there should not be any problems on their part and those 3 other computers also use email addresses provided by that same ISP and they work well with Outlook 2013.<br />
<br />
We have pressed send/receive button, changed main folder path to INBOX, changed automate send/receive from default 30 minutes<br />
to 1 minute. That 1 minute setting already seemed to correct the problem couple days ago but same problem returned next day even when that<br />
setting had remained 1 minute as expected.<br />
<br />
We have chosen IMAP from Outlook's view tab and deselected setting "when displaying hierarchy in Outlook, show only subscribed folders".<br />
<br />
At least these things come to mind that we have found when google searching and have tried to change those settings. Any other suggestions why emails are delivered late to Outlook and what settings we could try to change? Our ISP guessed that this could be
 somehow related to Outlook offline behaviour and sometimes disconnecting from server.

            Ok, thanks for your reply. Selecting other folder and going back to Inbox did not update but what actually seemed to correct that delay problem was to make a new profile in Outlook, export messages to pst-file from old profile, put IMAP-settings to that
 new profile and finally import messages from that pst-file exported from old profile. Folders appeared in new profile after import and at least today new messages seemed to appear without delay so mail delivery is currently looking good.

            Word has no functionality that would enable you to do this in the way you describe. It cannot, for example, dynamically search even the current file as you type, let alone an external one to retrieve anything from there.

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update in the private message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From the information you provided, I noticed that you would like to add a subdomain
<em>www.hos****nal.org.au</em> to Office 365. I check the domain <em>hos***nal.org.au</em>&nbsp;from the back end and found it has been added to an Office 365 tenant. Based on the screenshot, the name server for the domain is Microsoft and Office 365 is hosting
 it. Given the situation, if you would like to continue to add its subdomain to Office 365, you need a third party host provider instead of Office 365 to manage its DNS records. The name server for the domain should be the host provider. Otherwise, you will
 get the following error: &nbsp;<br />

<p>Humor me and try something:</p>
<p>1a. Uninstall AVG &amp; reboot, then do a fresh install of AVG: This time select the CUSTOM install option and do NOT install (i.e., uncheck) Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active Surf-Shield, Security toolbar [none of which are IE8-compatible IMHO], or any of
 the email scanning components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Why you don't need your anti-virus to scan your email&nbsp;<br />

<p>1b. Better yet, uninstall AVG &amp; reboot, then install Microsoft Security Essentials (free):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>2. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!! =&gt; Manually &amp; repeatedly update your anti-virus application (i.e., AVG or Microsoft Security Essentials) until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>3. Open IE8 (only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>&nbsp;&amp; run the Fix It (again).</p>
<p>4. Reboot once more &amp; test.</p>

<h2>            Emails getting redirected</h2>
                    <div>Hi</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am looking at switch back from Google mail to Outlook webmail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However there seems to be some strange re-direct happening when an email gets sent to my Windows Live account, once I open it 2 things happen:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) It gets redirected to my Gmail account.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) It gets moved to the delete folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked the Email Forwarding settings and it's set to "Don't forward".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas what's causing the redirect?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, Ken</div>

<p>Hi Ray_den,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could of been a corrupted file on the sd card when its showing "this card is unable to accept new data and may be failing. Please use another card". For a better understanding of what's error code 0x80070005 is, click

<h2>            I need to search multiple fields in a subform</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem: I need to be able to use the value in the main form's combo box to search MULTIPLE fields in the subform's recordsource.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to do that. For example, suppose I enter a person's name in text or combo box on the main form.&nbsp;
 But the data source for the subform has both FirstName and LastName but I need to filter records where EITHER one matches the combo box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like "SELECT * FROM Query WHERE Query.Firstname = cboName.value OR Query.LastName=cboName.value"</p>

            <p>Hi and welcome,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone must detect the SIM card automatically after it is inserted.<br />
There are no settings on the phone to turn it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Do you use a proper size micro SIM, or is it a cut one?<br />
- Is there any visible damage to the SIM tray and its tiny connection pins?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your mobile operator should provide a replacement SIM for free when the trouble is explained to them. Even if the SIM works in another phone is no guarantee it will work in a Lumia phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the trouble started after a hard reset, you may also consider recover the phone. A PC, a USB data cable, and a reliable Internet connection on the PC is required to download around 1.5 GB recovery data. Please refer to:<br />

<h2>            Office 2010 Pro Plus on Windows 8, 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to load Office 2010 pro plus from disc on a new WIndows 8, 64 bit PC. gives "<em>Setup cannot file Office.en-us\1033\dwintl20.dll. Browse to a valid installation source, and then click</em> OK."&nbsp; It's the factory disc, so I'm unsure of what to
 do! I initially tried the first level setup.exe, but it said it was wrong software (or something like that), so I saw the x64 and that's the setup.exe that I'm on now.</p>

<p>I find that Alt brings up the menu hotkey buttons only if I am not already editing a cell.<br />
If I am editing a cell then Alt+Enter works as you would want.<br />
If you want to start a cell with a line break then F2, Alt+Enter should do it.<br />
<br />
If your experience is different, maybe you have different options set?<br />
The only one I could think of that might affect the behaviour would be "edit directly in cell" but Alt+Enter works right for me whether that is true or false.</p>

            I dont see any improvement on the battery life of my N95-2 with the new fw. Usually it lasts for 2-2.5 days.

<h2>            Cortana Setup.</h2>
                    Cortana is asking for my old Local password which was setup many years ago and subsequently has been forgotten. Can this be recovered?? I have exchanged words with an extremely ignorant techie who said that I didn't need it. He then broke the connection.
 Any sort of help would be gratefully received.

            Yes I realise that but the windows login was done so long ago I can't remember the password. I have tried all the passwords I have created over the years. Surely one solution would be for MS to issue a temporary Password to the thousands of people with
 the same problem. It would only have to be used once and then discarded. MS don't seem to be interested in solving this problem.<br />

<h2>            Outlook Web Access - Office365 Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently have two ongoing issues with our emails on OWA. We use exchange online to manage all of our school staff users and students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my colleagues is unable to perform 'searches' through her emails on OWA, it simply returns that the action cannot be completed.Is there anything that I can do to rectify this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another user is using owa light version as whenever they attempt to use the full version they receive the following error message:</p>
&nbsp;
<p>:-(<br />
<br />
Something went wrong<br />
<br />
We can't get that information right now. Please try again later.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Both users are using Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 Professional, 32bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a little bit of research and it mentions a cumulative update. Can anybody advise whether updates/patches are automatically applied to exchange online? I have used powershell in the past to connect to our exchange online to make small changes
 but never performed any upgrades as such.</p>
<p>

    <title>excel print row height - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agent of fortune  say:</h3>
<h2>            excel print row height</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I would like to increase the row heights in a printed portion of an Excel worksheet that contains both filtered and sorted content.&nbsp; Despite various printer and worksheet manipulations the small printed version row height makes reading difficult.&nbsp; The cells
 contain only text in varying quantities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. printer adjustments: I have tried several adjustments to orientation, scaling and paper size, but results are unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Are printer adjustments the best way to improve readability by increasing the printed row height?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Excel adjustments: I have adjusted formatting (font size, bold font, area selection, wrap text, manual and autofit row height and column width, centering) without success.&nbsp; The worksheet printout has about 8 columns and several dozen rows.&nbsp; The number
 of pages printed is not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions are welcome, thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>According to your description, it seems that the print result of the row height is different than the settings you do in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you change the height of the rows, you can check the print preview before you print it: File&gt; Print&gt; Preview on the right.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Please capture a screenshot of your Office product name and full version number refer to this article:

What version of Office am I using?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Could you please capture screenshots of the data in worksheet, in preview and the print result to share with me?</p>
