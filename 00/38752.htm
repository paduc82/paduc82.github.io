<h2>            High, Unknown CPU spikes - Windows 7 Home premium x64</h2>
                    Hello everyone! I was going to try and fix this problem myself but I just can't lol so thought I'd post here. I see a lot of friendly people willing to help so maybe you can =)<br />
<br />
Firstly, the title says it all and I currently have a fresh install of windows 7 home premium x64. Last week or so, I noticed extreme lagging just while browsing the internet. I noticed right off when I first got it but I just thought that was the norm for
 microsoft windows =P It just wasn't as bad...<br />
I couldn't figure out why so I decided to reinstall for a fresh OS. Even then it started spiking right at startup. I'm not very techy but I do know how to do certain things, haha. I disabled all useless programs that come with a new computer then went to msconfig
 to disable startup programs and all 3rd party applications then restarted. The problem was still there so from there I spent hours following guides from what seemed like every possibly solution I could find on the web. Some from running a scan in command prompt
 to installing DPC Latency checker, windows performance toolkit, using process explorer to examine threads/stacks, finding out-of-date drivers and so on but I never found anything. It's very possible that I just missed something that was right in front of my
 face.<br />
When I ran DPC latency and ran a command to put it all in text, I reviewed it and found a couple things that didn't look right according to a guide I found. For example - usbport.exe and a couple others but I can't remember what they were at the top of my head.
 But I did find a windows update for the usb problem and once I restarted the issue was still there so that didn't do anything at all...As for the other one, it had something to do with Atheros drivers according to someone on another thread but I didn't know
 what to really do from there or what update I "supposedly needed". Sometimes google sucks that's why I need you guys.<br />
I've also tweaked my system for better performance but trust me, I shouldn't have had to anyways with my specs. I'm going to include screenshots of my system information and the processes running along with my installed programs. Maybe you'll see something
 in there that I just don't understand. Like I said, I'm not that techy! =)<br />
<br />
Oh, and one other thing. This computer is only a few months old, I bought it back in November, 2011 so it's not a really old computer running a new OS =P I'm tempted to just take it back to Best Buy and let the geek squad figure it out.<br />
<br />
This is my system information:<br />
http://i41.tinypic.com/2i11n5u.jpg<br />
<br />
and here are all of my current processes:<br />
http://i44.tinypic.com/dpzpe8.png<br />
<br />
AND my installed programs :)<br />
http://i41.tinypic.com/skzwk1.png<br />
&nbsp; Note: There is only one other program installed that I didn't fit into the screenshot and it's remote graphics receiver.<br />
I'm also not really sure what that Microsoft Visual C++ stuff is, but I uninstalled it for the heck of it on a previous install of 7 and it didn't change anything... as far as performance...lol<br />
<br />
I think I've pretty much provided you with everything you needed to know, at least I tried my best to do so. If there's anything else you need let me know. If you have a possible solution then I would greatly appreciate your feedback! :D You have no idea how
 much, this is driving me nuts. <br />
I can't do anything without it spiking, whether it's typing, loading a page (depending on how heavy the web content, sometimes it just stops responding), install anything or uninstall anything..<br />
<br />
OH, one last thing...it seems okay idle for the most part but every few seconds it will spike to about 20% then to 30 then to 50.<br />
I also always have automatic updates turned off. I don't bother with them or go looking for them unless I know exactly why I need it BUT just to see if anything changed I went ahead and checked for them, installed them and it made everything worse. When idle,
 it wouldn't go below 50% so I uninstalled and started over. Now I'm here =(<br />
<br />
Lol, I just checked my links to make sure they worked before I posted. Yes, I named my computer "Fred" as you can see under system information. Don't make fun of me =P<br />
<br />
Thanks you guys. :D<br />

            <p>go to device manger in control panel then from view menu choose show hidden devices then make sure there are no danger signs on any driver, if there were any try updating or unistalling them by right clicking them and choose accordingly.</p>
<p>If that did not help, then try clean boot:</p>
<p><strong>go to msconfig (type in searchbox in startmenu then press enter) then prepare ur pc for clean boot by disabling all startup items and none windows services then restart ur computer. See if it make a difference? if it did then you have to find out
 which ones caused to slow down ur pc.</strong></p>
<p>I recommand that you unistall auslogistic software... instead follow these to keep your pc running healthy:</p>
<p>perform scan using</p>
<p>http://www.malwarebytes.org/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommanded<br />
<br />
Make sure ur system is clean. use ccleaner to get rid of junkfiles http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download<br />
<br />
preform disk cleanup and defragment to improve ur system performance. (windows tools)
<br />
<br />
unistall programs u don't use.<br />
<br />
make sure ur windows is uptodate and drivers are working properly and they are uptodate too.</p>
<p>minimise ur startup programs trough msconfig (type it in search box in start menu then press enter), you could also use ccleaner tool.</p>
<p>try check ur disk for errors and also run system file checker (sfc) through cmd. (run cmd as admin then type sfc /scannow)</p>

<h2>            I use Mozilla Firefox.  Can I also use Windows Search Service on my PC&#63;</h2>
                    I cannot search the files on my computer as I could with Explorer.&nbsp; When I used Explorer my computer really bogged down.&nbsp; Firefox is much faster and doesn't bog me down anymore, but I have apparently lost the search ability of Windows Search.&nbsp; Is there
 a solution?

<p><a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-customize-toolbars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-customize-toolbars</a>&nbsp;that probably contains what you need to know.&nbsp; I've been using Firefox since version 1 so I may've done some customization
 in the past, but I don't remember having to do anything to get that search box.&nbsp; One thing you could try would be the

<h2>            MICROSOFT KGR 1173 COMBO KEYBOARD AND MOUSE WIRELESS, ,MOUSE DOES NOT ALWAY SCROLL AS IT SHOULD.</h2>
                    In some case the mouse will scroll or function properly as scroll up or down the pages, and other time does not want to do as I would like to do, as scrolling up or down, left or right. The system has a chip connected to computer usb wiring, without the
 chip since it is wireless keyboard and mouse.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I realize that the wireless mouse is not working as it should. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Does this issue occur while using a wired mouse?</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In which user account are you facing this issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Some problems can be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in. Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and select Sign out. Once you’ve signed out, sign back in to your account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try to connect the USB wired mouse or the receiver to a different USB port, and then check the behavior. By trying the receiver on different ports, you can eliminate any issues with the port.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note By-pass any port replicators, USB hubs, KVM switches, and so on, and connect the receiver directly to the ports.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may want to update the software that came with the wireless mouse to check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several
 programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

                    My Daughter was trying to import songs from a Sansa MP3 player to our iTunes libary on compute.&nbsp; Somehow she changed&nbsp;every program so it opens to iTunes, and every "type of file" is running as "iTunes Music Player (.Ink).&nbsp; Every icon has been changed to
 the music notes.&nbsp; Under&nbsp;properties it does list the correct program name and show the path, but under detials and type it lists iTunes and it goes to iTunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get correct settings/paths back?&nbsp;

    <title>Changing virtual memory size for 4GB RAM system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duncan cat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing virtual memory size for 4GB RAM system</h2>
                    <p>I often get a partly blank screen when I open Explorer for some sites that can be corrected by mimizing then maximizing the screen.&nbsp; I though maybe I should increase my virtual memory size to try and correct this.&nbsp; Microsft gives two sets of conflicting
 instruction on sertting the minimum size page file at eithe the total RAM of the system plus 300MB or the total RAM of the system times 1.5.&nbsp; Non-Microsoft sites suggest the total RAM times 1.5 is the correct choice for the minimum paging file?&nbsp; If I change
 the settings, am I at risk of crashing my whole system if I do it wrong?&nbsp; As far as I know there are no partions in my system, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>My system does not tell me what the 'Minimum and Maximum' paging files sizes are, but shows 4061MB for 'all drives', '6091MB recommended' and '4061MB currently allocated'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the '4061MB for all drives' the 'minimum'?&nbsp; I cannot tell what maximum is currently
 set.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Unless you have been fiddling with the win7 settings, the virtual memory will be managed by win7, and as such the err you see is caused by something else, the most likely suspect would be your graphics driver, thogh if its only applicable to certain sites,
 either some third party maintenance utility you have installed or whatever browser you are using. Try clearing your browser temp files

    <title>SPAMfighter folder in windows live mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whatsisname  say:</h3>
<h2>            SPAMfighter folder in windows live mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I saw a new folder marked SPAMfighter in WLM and having very recently tried it and then uninstalled it and installed MailWasher instead, I thought the new SPAMfighter folder must be a remnant and tried to delete it but it wouldn't allow me to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to my provider VM and saw it there and managed to delete the same named folder. Since then I have been having trouble with syncing so I re-entered the folder at my providers site. However the syncing difficulty still remains and a pop up in WLM
 tells me to try updating the folder list. I have looked everywhere to find how to do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I heard that microsoft had put the folder in WLM to aid anti spaming etc, I do wish they had let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get WLM back to fully working and syncing with VM mail back to how it should be.</p>

<p>Hi iFiredog,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for your reply. I found the way to update the folder list by fumbling around.</p>
<p>I got rid of it from the VM server and carried out the update folders and SPAMfolder disappeared, then the following morning there it was again plus SPAMfolder_2. So did the same again for both and they disappeared, then they came back with no sign of them
 on VM. I found them on my ipad and deleted them, back to VM and there they were so deleted and carried out update imap folders again. That seems to be an end to it, I'll post again in a few days to see where I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for Spamfighter. Note the word <em>partnered</em></p>

<h2>            Will WIndows 10 Fix Duplex Printing Compatibility Issues With Brother Printers&#63;</h2>
                    Just bought a dreadful Windows 8.1 machine. &nbsp;Can't print duplex on Brother MFC-L2700DW printer, and it appears that 8.1 won't allow duplex printing on any Brother printers. &nbsp;Score another New Coke award for Microsoft and their brilliant OS. &nbsp;Question:
 Will Windows 10 fix this printer compatibility issue? &nbsp;Brother isn't the only make affected.

<p>Hi Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by compatibility and driver problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify, can you check the status of the Bluetooth device connected to your laptop?<span> To do that, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Devices<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong>. Bluetooth devices will only show as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Connected<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>when
 the device is actually in use (for example, a Bluetooth speaker that’s connected and has music playing over it). When the device isn’t being used, the status text will show as<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Paired</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your Bluetooth device isn’t working, you can try removing the device and pairing it again. In Bluetooth settings, select the Bluetooth device that’s paired but not working &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Remove device<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Yes</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 verify. After that, pair the device again. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more info about pairing devices, see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Bluetooth devices</a>.</span></p>

You mentioned Windows Defender with Windows Vista in your question header. Windows Defender in Windows Vista is only an antispyware product and cannot provide full security. I think your problem is virus concerned so y<span>ou
 can download and run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Safety Scanner</a> to remove viruses.&nbsp; However, you can use these tools for second opinion:

<h2>            My skype number is no longer working</h2>
                    I have a skype number that is not working. I read something about an email having been sent out on November 13th 2017 but I did not receive this email so could you please re send it or explain to me here. Presumably I will get a refund as I have close
 to six months left on the number. I have been a skype client for many years and find this system of raising questions rather clumsy and have been going in circles for an hour which is extremely frustrating. I hope to receive a rapid reply. &nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I regret to inform you that we do not have an option to resend announcement emails. I believe the email that you’ve received is all about bundled
 subscriptions. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding on the issue with your Skype Number, I strongly advise to sign out of all devices. Make sure you’re using one device only. Signing in
 to multiple device can cause issues with receiving calls on the Skype Number like misrouted calls.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please also try to use a different Internet connection and check if the same issue happens. Check the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA140/how-do-i-manage-my-privacy-settings-in-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=privacy+settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s exact Skype version that you’re using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your response.

</p><p><span>What’s the exact Skype version that you’re using on your PC? Changing privacy settings is not yet available on the new Skype app for Android.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check the privacy settings on the Skype app on your PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Photo Editor from Office 97 on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> borderrider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Photo Editor from Office 97 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and Office Home &amp; Student 2016.</p>
<p>Can Microsoft Photo Editor from Office 97 be loaded in Windows 10 and made to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this software desirable?<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>- Opens quickly.<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
- Can easily define a selection within an image and copy, paste, move, delete, crop, and print quickly.<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
- Can do a number of other essential functions (correction of color, brightness, contrast, and all-important gamma) much easier than any other software.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>- Can easily re-size or rotate an image (there will some quality loss with these two functions).</p>
<p>- The only downside is that if image is too large, then Photo Editor will not open it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any later product from Microsoft cannot do all of the above, then it is unacceptable.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

            <p>Office 97 &nbsp;and its components are not supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You understand that between 1997 and 2016 the Windows code has changed enormously? You cannot expect software from 19 years ago to work properly - or at all - on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal favorite for image editing is an application called <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Paint.net</a>. &nbsp;It's supported on Windows 10 <em>and</em> it's free. But there are many other excellent image editing products - free and paid. Your big problem is going to be deciding which one to choose.</p>

            <p>I already have the "free" paint.&nbsp; Paint is one of the lowest pieces of image editing garbage every concocted.&nbsp; When one has worked extensively with MS Photo Editor and Adobe PhotoShop CS3 for over 8 years, anything else is so inferior that they are not worth
 considering.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have ArcSoft PhotoStudio 6, but it is SLOW, and tries to make something Simple to be Very Awkward and Inprecise.&nbsp; For example, in doing a copy/paste from an existing image back to that image it is unthinkable that the copied area can be allowed to
 extend beyond the original image boundaries, but such is the case.&nbsp; PhotoStudio 6 also tries to make a simple two-dimensional task into a layered chore, and thus tries to change the extension from jpg to psf.&nbsp; In order to enhance a partly completed project,
 it has to be saved and then closed; then re-opened to lighten, darken, change contrast etc.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks, Gina, for the links to other software products.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic problem with all of these is that IF they can be made to work with all of the utility that I previously had, it has to be re-learned through time-killing trial and error.&nbsp; I had over 8 years INVESTED in learning all the Tricks of Adobe PhotoShop
 CS3, and that coupled with the Simple MS PhotoEditor allowed me to do anything needed with High Quality and Speed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft wants to Make MORE Money (Endless GREED), it is KILLING US who made a living on the older Tried and True Software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now after 4 MONTHS of frustration with Windows 10 and Office 2016, I am beginning to consider buying another computer and loading XP and Office 97, along with all of my previous software that Worked so well.&nbsp; And keep that Computer Offline, away from
 the Internet Viruses of China, Russia, Iran and wherever.&nbsp; Between the wiles of Microsoft and Government Intrusion, no small company needs any more adversity!!!</p>

            It isnt supported but photo editor works.&nbsp; I installed word 97 and deselected all components except photo editor.&nbsp; It installs and gives odbc errors.&nbsp; Once install has finished, it shows up in the program files and runs just fine.&nbsp; It is in no way a supported
 installation, but it will work.&nbsp; Just my experience.<br />

            <p>It's not about greed but it is about the money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software technology has changed enormously since Office 97. Windows has been re-coded extensively since that time. You can't expect software that was written 19 years ago to work as-is on Windows 10. To make the old software work, it too would have to be
 re-coded to keep up with all the changes in technology. Re-coding costs money, and the more you have to code and test and code and test, the more expensive it gets. After a while, it simply doesn't make financial sense to keep going, particularly when newer
 software does so much more so much better, even if you personally don't &nbsp;like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you like it or not, that's how software works. The world doesn't stand still.</p>

            <p>It may have changed, but I see NO Improvement.&nbsp; In fact with Windows 10 and Office 2016, every time I open a Word file it balks and says "not responding".&nbsp; Then I try to search that doc for a word, and again it seizes up and the message "not responding"
 happens again.&nbsp; Finally after about 1 minute I get to edit that doc, but when I "save" the progress bar shows that it takes 30 seconds to save.&nbsp; This is Garbage, not an improvement!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 forced me to buy a new scanner ($200), and I still need to re-purchase AutoCad ($3200?) and at least Adobe Photoshop.&nbsp; But right now I hate this "operating system" so much that buying more software is throwing good money after bad.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another company MUST step in and give those of us with small businesses something like XP, because buying all of this new software is not only expensive, but most of it is now unavailable (example: all of the oil &amp; gas production engineering software that
 I have).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken with other businesses who can afford all of these costs, and they HATE Windows 10 because of all of the lock-ups and basic instability.&nbsp; Microsoft can either listen to consumers or go Down in a Ball of Fire!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTHING will ever get any better unless we Complain, and Complain Loudly!!!&nbsp; And if someone in this forum doesn't like that, then Enjoy The Misery!!&nbsp; Enjoy the Bitter Complaints from across the spectrum of business everywhere!!</p>

            You'll get a couple of screens that show something about odbc not being able to be registered.&nbsp; Those are "open database connectivity" program interfaces which have updated over the years.&nbsp; I think in this case, they were used for the microsoft portfolio
 app or something that was built into MS Works.&nbsp; Either way, the install will run, click ignore when you get the errors and when complete the photo editor runs.&nbsp; I installed on win7, 8, and 10 laptops and it worked great.&nbsp; As I said though, it definitely isnt
 a supported install, it just works.&nbsp; It's old but I do like the interface better than the new editor :)&nbsp; Good luck

            <p>Thanks for the additional info on installation.&nbsp; I recall working for a company in 2007 that had Windows 2003.&nbsp; One of their IT guys installed the Office 97 PhotoEditor, and the only problem was that I could not print the final product.&nbsp; But at least I could
 edit a map (usually a crop down of a large map) in jpg and save, and then print with other software.&nbsp;

<h2>            I have black squares over my Windows 7 desktop icons. How can I remove them&#63; - resolved.</h2>
                    <p>I have removed the visible shortcut arrow on shortcut icons.</p>
<p>This has the consequence of turning all the icons black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to restore the icons without having to re-initialize the visible shortcut arrow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And secondly please how do I re-initialize the visible shortcut arrow?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Activation Error 0XC0000022 &#40;Access Denied&#41;</h2>
                    <br />


After experiencing problems during an automatic windows update of windows 8 I ran a system "refresh" which restored factory settings. However, now my windows won't activate, giving me Activation Error 0XC0000022 (Access Denied). Additionally, when windows tried
 to automatically update, it spends a very long time doing so, then says the update failed, and spends a very long time uninstalling the update. I cannot stop this update from happening and it says it will try again in "1 more day."
<div>
<p>How can I activate my copy of windows and make sure windows is able to update properly?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            How to pin Power to the taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    Currently, if I want shutdown, I first move my mouse to upper right corner of the screen to bring up the bar, then click on Settings, then click on Power which brings up a options shutdown, restart, and sleep. Can Power be pinned to the taskbar (or any
 of other items within Settings)?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to pin the Power setting to taskbar, but as a workaround you may create a shortcut for 'Shutdown' and&nbsp;'Restart' and pin the shortcut to taskbar. To create a shortcut, refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>a) Right-click an open area on the desktop, point to <b>New</b>, and then click
<b>Shortcut</b>.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;To create a shortcut to shutdown the computer,&nbsp;type in 'shutdown /p' (without quotes).</p>
<p>c) Click on 'Next', type in a name for the shortcut.</p>
<p>d) Click on 'Finish'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the shortcut is created, right-click on it and select 'Pin to Taskbar'. You may also change the icon of the shortcut. To do so, refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>a) Right-click on the shortcut and select 'Properties'.</p>
<p>b) Under 'Shortcut' tab, click 'Change Icon'.</p>
<p>c) Select the icon you want and then click on 'Ok' to apply changes. </p>
<p>d) Click 'Ok' to close the properties windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. </p>

<h2>            TOP casino Games for X Box</h2>
                    Hi! I'd like to find out some really good casino games for my Xbox. I've already tried&nbsp;The Four Kings Casino &amp; Slots, Pure Hold’Em
<div>
<p>&nbsp;and Prominence Poker. The last one, by the way, is a rival for Pure Hold’Em, and in some respects goes a bit further in its offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also used to read some reviews of download casinos&nbsp;<a href="https://casinobonusesfinder.com/type/download-casinos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://casinobonusesfinder.com/type/download-casinos/</a>. But didn't found out weather these games
 are available to play via Xbox. Anyway, If somebody has something to recommend to play at - you're welcome to reply)</p>

<p>My Asus Windows 10 tablet was recently updated, and since then the Rotation Lock option disappeared from the action center.</p>
<p>Under Settings --&gt; Notifications &amp; actions --&gt; Add or remove quick actions, there is no option for rotation lock. It disappeared.</p>
<p>Currently my tablet is stuck at portrait mode. This is extremely annoying.</p>
