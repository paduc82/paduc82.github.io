<h2>            Outlook seems to be a massive mess at the moment</h2>
                    I have tried to create an outlook.com email account and under microsoft accounts outlook is not even an option. I have read many post to many questions and have found that the answers just don't work.&nbsp; Is Outlook just the equivalent of an email client
 and the email addresses are still going to be @hotmail.com or what? If you switch your hotmail account to outlook and then go to help there is no mention or outlook when you get there. The help is for hotmail, messenger &amp; skydrive. Seems that Microsoft has
 done it again. What a mess with no answers to be found. We need a complete by the numbers instruction guide telling us what the change actually is and how to make the conversion.<br />
<br />
I cannot even find an answer to a basic question, like--Why can I NOT receive email addressed to me @outlook.com after I have switched over, but do receive is when addressed to @hotmail.com.&nbsp; Another thing I noticed is when I send a test email to myself from
 my yahoo account it goes to junk unless I add ME to my contacts using my yahoo email address. What is that spam filter doing? I think that that email should go to the inbox and not junk even without that email address being in my contacts list.<br />
<br />
If things do not get fixed here, I for one will totally stop using hotmail / outlook whatever forever.&nbsp;

            Thanks for the answer, however, I do wish that you had taken the change over a little further.&nbsp; When I compose a new mail I see my address as @hotmail and not @outlook.&nbsp; This leaves the question as to how do you get an @outlook address and actually be
 able to RECEIVE email at that address?<br />
<br />
Based on the random questions that I have seen in the forum it seems that many are as totally confused as I am.&nbsp; A step-by-step guide would be very helpful to many.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you rename your account to @outlook.com. <span>
When you rename an account, the old account name will be the alias of the new one.
</span></p>
<p><i><span>Example:
</span></i></p>
<p><span><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** was renamed to
</em><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></p>
<p><span><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** will become the alias of
</em><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><em>
</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, you won't be able to log using their old account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). You have to use
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>&nbsp;to log in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rename your account, please refer to the link below for detailed instructions:</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - gmail imap not properly syncing</h2>
                    outlook 2013 does not properly sync IMAP with gmail. &nbsp;When something is marked as deleted in outlook it is not properly getting moved to the trash as it did in previous outlook versions.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the google groups thread:</div>
<div>https://productforums.google.com/forum/?hl=en&amp;fromgroups#!topic/gmail/9alMlaOkMC4</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;google has basically said it is in the hands of outlook at this point since other clients work fine. &nbsp;I noticed today there was an office update and this is still broken</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>please fix this, its incredibly annoying since we have emails hanging around in multiple locations. &nbsp;I have tried the previous suggested fixes of setting various expunge settings and as shown in that thread, nothing works, outlook is broken</div>

            Ive tried a new profile and a fresh install. &nbsp;Outlook will act fine for a few days, then slowly it will stop correctly syncing deleted emails until it takes hours for it show up correctly if ever
<div><br />
<div>It was fine with the previous version of outlook, only started with 2013. &nbsp;Its also not like those cases where its an all or nothing problem. &nbsp;I still receive emails, and in some cases some email will properly get deleted in gmail. &nbsp;For example if I get
 say 5 emails in 30min, go in to outlook, delete them all, then I go check in gmail, maybe 2 or 3 will actually be deleted but the rest will still be there</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also other clients work fine, like thunderbird, this is only an outlook 2013 issue</div>

            I also have this problem, it is incredibly frustrating.
<div><br />
<div>I have Office 365 on Windows 7 installed on a Samsung Series 9 notebook. In Outlook 2013, I have set up several Gmail and Google Apps accounts using IMAP.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In an IMAP folder, when I delete a mail it disappears from the folder. But when I check on Gmail webmail, it is still there! Even after I run a full send/receive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Furthermore, when I drag and drop an email from an IMAP folder into a local PST, it remains in that folder in webmail!</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems like Outlook is not synchronising properly with the Gmail server.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the other hand, if I delete a message in Gmail webmail, it disappears from the IMAP folder in Outlook within a few seconds. So the synch seems to be working properly in that direction.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I called Microsoft India support and tried my best to explain the problem to them but they refused to accept that there is a bug, their attitude was quite ridiculous, and their technical knowledge was appalling. They claimed that IMAP is not meant to synch
 both ways.</div>
<div><br />
<div>They also tried to blame the Gmail settings. They asked me to go to Gmail web settings for IMAP access and switch off Auto-expunge and select "Immediately delete the message forever". Neither did these changes seem relevant to me, nor did they solve the
 problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then they tried to blame it on Gmail and told me to contact Google for support. I explained that this problem never happened in Outlook 2010, but they could not give any response to that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried deleting and adding the IMAP account back in Outlook, but the problem remains.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right now, I am having to manually keep my inboxes synchronised by checking what I delete/move in Outlook and manually deleting those items in webmail. A horrible waste of time!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm hoping for a quick solution to this, else I will have to switch back to Outlook 2010.</div>

            So I guess no real response or solution then. &nbsp;Would be nice to know an ETA on the fix since it has been acknowledged elsewhere by the actual development team
<div><br />
<div>At this point I have completely stopped using outlook 2013 and switched to thunderbird which can properly handle IMAP. &nbsp;This problem makes using outlook with imap and other devices basically worthless since the main advantage of imap is removed with this
 issue</div>

</p>
<p>other than the commonly suggested steps, I guess. <br />
<br />
This may not be a bug but some glitch with Outlook 2013 and IMAP sync. <br />
<br />
I hope with fingers crossed that MS comes up with a fix to resolve this.</p>

My problem is different: I always receive mails in time, but, randomly, if I delete a mail or move it to a folder, on Outlook 2013 the operation seems to complete correctly, but if I connect with another client (my mobile phone, or though the gmails web site),
 I realize that the mail was NOT deleted or moved.

<h2>            Excel VBA timer close the file with count down and additional time option</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to create a timer to close the file if the user opened or idle for 5 minutes, then the countdown timer (let say a minute countdown) popup message will appear (in the case I create a user form since the message box will not auto close itself)
</p>
<p>If user need more time then they need to click on "need more time" button which will added extra 2 minutes.</p>
<p>If the user clicked OK or did not response then the message will close after the countdown complete and then Close the file automatically. Could you please help.</p>

    <title>Why Outline format works in Outlook but not Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michealcox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Outline format works in Outlook but not Word</h2>
                    <p>I have posted this question about Outline formatting in Word and gotten links that pretend to address the issue;
<strong>but don't.</strong> Oh, they provide lots of complicated workarounds but they don't address
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the issue:</span> why, when you click the Outline icon in Word you enter a world of chaos, where nothing works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">know </span>how Outline <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
should </span>work because when I am in Outlook, and click the same Outline Icon, I experience
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">exactly </span>what is expected.&nbsp; The tab key indents; in as well as out, just as expected, the numbering system works just as expected and everything moves smoothly and without a hitch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to do the same thing in Word I end up with a mess of confusing issues; and nothing seems to work as expected!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why does Outline in MS Outlook work perfectly while Outline in MS Word not work at all; unless you jump through a whole lot of hoops that you learn about from a long article; with an interesting horn players vs director analogy?</p>

            <p>Even in multilevel lists, the Numbering or Bullets icon will be highlighted to indicate whether the current paragraph has numbers or bullets; it is not an indication that you're not in a multilevel list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you select a multilevel list that is not already linked to specific styles, then&nbsp;Word applies the List Paragraph style, and all members of the list will use that style (unless you've selected the option to use Normal for lists).&nbsp;Whether you can use
<strong>Tab </strong>and <strong>Shift+Tab </strong>depends on the AutoFormat As You&nbsp;Type setting already discussed, but you can always use
<strong>Alt+Shift+Left/Right</strong> to promote/demote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use (or create) a multilevel list linked to specific styles, then promoting/demoting the list level will also change the style. If you use one of the lists that is linked to heading styles, then pressing
<strong>Enter</strong> in Print Layout view will give you a paragraph in the Normal style (not part of the list) because Normal is the "Style for following paragraph" of all the built-in heading styles. If you want to create an outline using heading styles,
 then you can work in Outline view, where pressing <strong>Enter</strong> gives you a new paragraph in the same heading style (and you can also use the
<strong>Promote/Demote</strong> buttons on the Ribbon.</p>

<h2>            How to get the Language Proofing Tools for Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2010 and wish to install the proofing tools for Chinese PRC and Taiwan, and Japanese. However, through the Language Preference, I was only directed to http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language-packs/microsoft-office-language-options-multilingual-support-FX102851176.aspx
 and can only download the proofing for Office 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever I downloaded were all useless as in my language preference the proofing tools always show "Not Installed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know what I can do without upgrading my office version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>It's unfortunate that Microsoft has pointed all the Office web resources at Office 2013 versions. There is a different address for Office 2010 proofing tools, but it's difficult to know that you need to look for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike the 2013 proofing tools, the 2010 proofing tools are not free for download. Microsoft sells them for USD 24.95 per language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For customers in the United States, the address to use is <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.253665800?cdid=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.253665800?cdid=en-us</a>. If you're outside the US, you'll have to replace the 'en-us' notation with the proper one in both places.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office for Mac 2011 - There is a problem with office database</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;installed&nbsp;office for mac 2011 on my MacBook pro retina mid&nbsp;2014 model. I then went to open up word and the following message came up:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>'There is a problem with the office database.' Office might be unable to access the database of the database file might be damaged. Without the database, you might be unable to use the scrapbook and other features that store your personal information. To
 rebuild the database. open Microsoft office 2011/office, and then open the Microsoft database utility. For more info, open the database utility application and on the help menu, click database utility help.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel opens up and then the error message comes but I am able to get past it. With Powerpoint it&nbsp;is exactly the same as excel or at worst it wont open up at all. When I open up word it freezes and I have to force quit to close the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been assisted online by a Microsoft tech person who has accessed my mac via remote control. They have&nbsp;uninstalled office and then reinstalled office only for the same error message to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS X Yosemite</p>
<p>version 10.10.12</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me get office working.</p>
<p>

                    I created a newsletter document in Publisher, and in several text boxes, most of the text was black, but just a few words were in color. When I save the file as a PDF, all the text in the text boxes turned black - there wasn't a mix between black and colored
 text in any text box. How can I fix this? I want colored text mixed in with my black text sometimes!

<h2>            Uninstall office professional plus 2013 volume licensed product</h2>
                    <p>When I purchased a copy online of office 2013 professional plus for my personal laptop several years ago, I was apparently sold a copy of the software with a volume licensed product key.&nbsp; I was not aware of this until the software became corrupted during
 a&nbsp; Windows 10 operating system update.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am attempting to purchase a new single user license but cannot uninstall the old 2013 software.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the process for uninstalling volume licensed product if you are not the administrator?</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2013&#58; Weird second display issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> netzev  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2013&#58; Weird second display issue</h2>
                    <p>I've got two monitors, and starting a few months ago I've noticed a behavior that only affects PowerPoint in non-presentation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my primary &nbsp;monitor:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d1f0baf-966f-41f4-9243-6280e2e25c22" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On my secondary monitor, viewing in PPT:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb156fb1-4d34-4fe9-ba3b-cb415eb093d7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that when viewed in other programs, sometimes it looks OK others not. For example: &nbsp;X1 the search engine using the preview pane:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb7ecb66-63a5-440e-9e64-86177c57e551" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The same is true of the windows screen shot utility - the screenshot looks fine. On the other hand, using WebEx it be messed up the same way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In show mode it also looks fine on the second monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody come across this before? It started a few months ago and I suspect something changed video settings that seem only to affect PowerPoint. Word, Excel and any other program I use are unaffected as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Deleting emails in the outbox that are being transmitted</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Microsoft Outlook 2007 on my PC. My daughter had to use my email address to send some emails only containing attachments of photos&nbsp;to her own email address. I am now stuck in the situation of having one of the five emails she sent stuck&nbsp;in my
 outbox which when I double click on it I am told that I cannot open it as Outlook has already started to transmit this email (70mb containing attachments of photos). It has now been doing this for the last 28 hours.&nbsp; If I right click on it in the Outbox folder
 and then click delete nothing happens. How can I get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards Paddy</p>

<p>Hi Bhoira Maaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have IMAP server for GoDaddy, yes,&nbsp;Office 365 supports the IMAP migration from other IMAP server. After you purchased Office 365 and register Office 365 tenant, you can migrate your IMAP mailboxes to Office 365, and then add your custom domain in
 Office 365. Here are the instruction to run a IMAP migration in Office 365:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Before that, I suggest you to backup your items via .pst file in case of data loss.</p>

            Thanks Karen I am not seeing the above path when I click on my profile. I have Windows 10 and the Skype version looks very new. I am not getting an error message when trying to contact somebody in Ethiopia, the call is ended very quickly. My contact is
 en route USA and I'll try him again later today. If I connect then, I assume the issue relates to Ethiopia. Thanks again, Robert

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, please let me know if your call will connect or not. If in the event the issue persists, here are some troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a different internet connection.</li><li>Check if this is happening to your other contacts located in US.</li><li>Uninstall and reinstall Skype.</li></ol>

<p>Please suggest me solution, which automatically updates summary sheet based on input sheet. Request to avoid Pivot Table suggestion.</p>

            <p>I got OK report. It was my mistake. There was one column blank for whom I have not entered "1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my another question is:</p>
<p>All the time do I have to start with cell "A1"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why I am asking this question is, in due course of time I may add some rows on top of input screen or I may add some columns left of input screen. In this scnario what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise it works perfect. Good coding. Thanks a lot...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your specific scenario is:<br />
in row 1 up to row&nbsp;3 are headers&nbsp;.. <a href="https://1osllw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p9DuDAxFb5c4FQPaFDbq2WhZkuhrzLQUT_iECyfvDLpBGP3a8CY0xwqRo8qpdJrKAC6ZQpIFgpy08AidS7hCIBI3W64R-HlNh/Convert%2006Mar2013.gif?psid=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#800080">Convert</font></a><br />
and the data (employees: xyz, abc) starting&nbsp;from the&nbsp;third column</p>
<p>now,<br />
you want to add more Headers (if the answer is yes, then code need to change a bit)<br />
otherwise if you want to add and other columns (employees),<br />
no problem.<br />

<h2>            &#34;No Printers Installed&#34; and other issues</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Following the last build of the Tech preview, I am unable to print.&nbsp; When I select PRINT in every application I have tried, I am greeted with the printer screen, but "No Printers Installed" is displayed where my default printer should be!&nbsp;When I attempt
 to install a printer, I am told there is no active directory, and I am not allowed to add a printer.&nbsp; When I go to the settings|devices, my printers ARE listed, but all but my "default" printer are listed but the printer drivers are not recognized.&nbsp; Anyone
 have any thoughts?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; That worked sort of.......&nbsp; I was able to print a one sided document, but when I attempted two sided printing (same document) I found that the print spooler has stopped again, and the "No Printers Installed" message had returned.&nbsp; after several
 retries, the print spooler seemed to have a mind of it's own, and would stop in mid print.&nbsp; I plan to reinstall the printer later today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping the team will (probably IS) addressing this issue as we proceed with the Tech Preview.&nbsp; BTW, I like the preview so well, I intend to install it on my new Surface 3 when it arrives tomorrow!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had&nbsp;" Print Spooler service not started even set on automatic" and found solution that
<strong>may</strong> help some of you to fix your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know some how WTP 10 turn off&nbsp;LDP port after installing new printer driver and leaves only Internet client port only. That's why the printer spooler service failed to start. Solution could be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Programs and Features in Control panel &gt; click Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>2. click <strong>+</strong> sign of <strong>Print and Documents services</strong></p>
<p>3. Select<strong> LPD and LPR</strong>. You should remove <strong>Internet Printing Client</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfb5cd41-2b60-421b-a019-3d9db6167b7d" /></p>
<p>&gt; restart your PC to ensure there is no error of spooler service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Add your printer driver again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked for me. Let try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I've been seeing people say that the ability to prevent Outlook from deleting email invitations that you respond to is a "feature" that is not available on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, that is a _terrible_ default that makes little or no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that there is no good way to prevent this obnoxious and irritating behavior that should at best be opt-in, not opt-out, is not best described as a lack of a feature. It is a severe oversight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A: Give us the ability to disable this problematic default behavior.</p>
<p>B: Don't make an obnoxious behavior the default behavior to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, I've enjoyed my experiences with the Office 365 suite so far, except for teensy things like this.</p>

<p>Hi Coyote Osborne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it troubles you a lot, actually it’s not feasible to do it, you are welcomed vote via
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/13031544-don-t-auto-delete-meeting-requests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our product could be improved based on customers’ feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can try to set up some rules as workaround. For example, condition is “subject or body contain xxx”, action is “copy to specific folder”. So that even if the meeting has been deleted, the copy stays in your specific folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office &#34;Corrupted&#34;</h2>
                    My Microsoft Office programs are not opening. I'm currently trying to finish up my midterm projects in advance and need them to open as everything is saved to my laptops hard drive. (Silly me I know). How do I fix this? Can I fix this? I bought a scratch
 card and installed the programs in September, so I know that they're still ''good'' but they're saying that they're in need of repairs and when they do manage to open they say they're unlicensed, I can't save my documents and I can't open my previously saved
 projects, nor save new ones to be sent through the online portal to my professors. TIA!!&nbsp;

            Hello,<br /><br />I am an independent Advisor trying to help, I suggest to you performance an office repair, before you have to check and install the operative systems and office updates.<br /><br />Repair steps:<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.<br />If this doesn’t work try the online repair.<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the online repair. This can take around 10 minutes or more.<br /><br />Let me know if this worked for you.<br />Regards.

            I am so sorry to read that, 
<br />I would recommend to try the safe mode and disable the office add-ins
<br />
<br />1- Try to open office in safe mode:
<br />Close all office apps
<br />Press the windows key + R and write the command to open the office app in error, below are the commands to open all office apps:
<br /> 
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />2- Disable the add-ins:
<br />Go to file &gt; options &gt; add-ins select COM and uncheck the first add-in checked, close the office app and make your test. If the issue persist repeat this step until disable all add-ins.
<br />
<br />I hope this work for you, if you have a further question Let me know.
<br />
<br />Regards

            This problem appears to have been caused by a recent Windows update. The current word from Microsoft (and some users) is that manually updating Windows and then restarting Office seems to clear this and similar problems.

            we are using the integrated approach, protocol is IMAP, I guess office 365 recently did some upgrade and caused IMAP service not stable, it had been running for almost 3 months, suddenly there had two major issues/outages in the last two weeks. office
 client never had the issue to receive the email, just integrated way with IMAP.

<p>Hi SHEMAIL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you configured your Office 365 account with IMAP to Java Mail and then when sync your emails, you get the error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Outlook installed in your machine, please try to configure your Office 365 account in Outlook also with IMAP protocol to check if you get any error.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            configure live.com in outlook 2010 32 bit &#40;windows 7 64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    Tried the outlook/hotmail connector method, one window keeps continuously popping up asking for my password: first, while outlook 2010 is searching for server settings to connect to, the connector window pops up asking for the password. I give it, enable
 "remember" and click ok, but it continues to pop up and ask for it all over again endlessly. Until I click cancel, and then the setup seems to finish "successfully" the configuration of my mail in office... Except it really does not, as if I try to access
 my outlook.com/live.com mail configured "successfully" in outlook 2010, it will not do anything (nor has any mail/folders under the account), except popping up endlessly yet again the connector password window. If i click cancel again, then an error message
 pops up saying "the file *.ost is not an an outlook data file" and cannot be opened (!). An in fact, if I go to the account settings and data files, the location for the live.com account is given as "not available".
<br />
Yes, I did try redownloading and reinstalling the connector, closing/reopening outlook, restarting my pc... Nothing changes these issues.
<br />
<br />
So I tried method 2: configuring outlook with my live mail as a regular IMAP account. At this point another window shows up asking for my password to the imap-mail.outlook.com (incoming) server. I enable save password and hit ok, and guess what? The window
 continues popping up... So I hit cancel... And the test of server fails. Same thing all over again with the outgoing smtp-mail.outlook.com server.
<br />
<br />
Never used windows mail before (live/hotmail/msn), have configured in the same outlook 2010 on the same pc several other IMAP accounts (yahoo, personal domain, etc.) without ANY difficulty... Absurdly enough, it's only the Microsoft product that gives me headaches
 with the Microsoft product.... Please help! Thank you.<br />

            <p>Theofrastus: &nbsp;Don't feel like the Lone Ranger. &nbsp;I am experiencing identical misery with Outlook 2010 and Outlook Connector. &nbsp;Microsoft has not updated Outlook Connector since 2012...and it frequently failing to either connect or sync my MSN, Live, and Hotmail
 email accounts. &nbsp;I am now on Day #2 of trying to fix Outlook to receive and sync emails again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BEST SOLUTION IS to install Thunderbird email software (which I just did). &nbsp;Thunderbird operates a lot like Outlook...but without Outlook Connector and without Outlook's problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think these solution-less problems with pre-2013 versions of Outlook are Microsoft's attempt to force people to migrate to Outlook 2013. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to execute a formula in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a cell formula:</p>
<p>="'"&amp;Summary!$B$4&amp;Summary!$B$5&amp;" '!$J$"&amp;Parameters!B8&amp;"=""CAD"""</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It produces this result:</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then want to execute the result in a different cell to produce a value of TRUE or FALSE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I try doing:</p>
<p>=INDIRECT('C:\Users\Daniel 2013\Finances\[BMO Investorline DFE TFSA 2013 04 01 - 2013 12 16.csv]BMO Investorline DFE TFSA 2013 '!$J$4="CAD")</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
I do not really understand you. You create a string but INDIRECT needs a range written as string.<br />
<br />
Further, TRUE or FALSE can only be returned when comparing values and I don't see this in your formulas.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you are looking for this:<br />
<br />
In A1: ="'"&amp;Summary!$B$4&amp;Summary!$B$5&amp;" '!$J$"&amp;Parameters!B8<br />
In A2: =INDIRECT("A1")="CAD"<br />
<br />

                    Have been having this problem 3 consecutive times. In the middle of editing or writing a document, Word says&nbsp; "Autosave Failed" and "we have not been able to save your recent changes, please save to a different file in order to keep all of your changes."
 It's gotten kind of annoying to repetitively save different files for one document just because autosave isn't working. Has anyone had this similar problem or know of a solution?&nbsp;

            Same problem here and have run into it on more than one machine. After rebooting the PC this issue doesn't initially happen, but after some unknown period of time it starts happening and the provided Save As option also never works. I've ensured that Office
 is updated and the latest Windows Updates are installed.

<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No option to sync Quick Notes to SkyDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No option to sync Quick Notes to SkyDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using OneNote 2013 for several months saving all my notebooks including Quick Notes directly to SkyDrive. Recently, I had to reinstall my PC from scratch and when I signed on to SkyDrive from OneNote 2013, I was able&nbsp;to open all my notebooks
 on OneNote except&nbsp;the Quick Notes. So, I recreated the Quick Notes using copy and paste from OneNote Web App&nbsp;to OneNote Quick Notes. After the sync,&nbsp;all my&nbsp;Quick Notes are still there in OneNote but are gone from SkyDrive. Under Options, I see that Quick Notes
 are being saved to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\OneNote Notebooks\My Notebook\Quick Notes.one. In OneNote, Quick Notes don't show up under a notebook. There is a separate section called Quick Notes and there is context menu for these to do SkyDrive sync.
 I have searched everywhere but I cannot find any options that allow me to sync Quick Notes to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for the response. Are we saying that the default Quick Notes location cannot be synced on SkyDrive and I have to a create an arbitrary section on one of my SkyDrive notebook and then point my Quick Notes there? It feels more like a workaround than
 a feature and not intuitive.&nbsp; Is there a reason MS chose to do that?

<p>2. You selected "Sync to Web" when you first started OneNote 2010.</p>

            I am using OneNote 2013 and I did not upgrade from a previous version. I was working before...not sure how but after I reinstalled OneNote on a new image, it won't sync. There must be some setting that syncs Quick Notes to SkyDrive.

            <p>Is it still not possible to sync Quick Notes without creating an arbitrary section in one of the OneDrive notebooks and then pointing Quick Notes there? I did not upgrade from a previous version of OneNote (it's a fresh install of OneNote 2013), and it's
 the HUP version, meaning no options were given during setup (therefore, I didn't not explicitly choose to "Sync to Web".</p>

            I'm not sure what "in Personal (Web)" means. Again, I'm looking to sync Quick Notes across different computers that I have (all using the same email address for OneNote's login). I'm using Windows 7, by the way.

            <p>Personal (Web) is a default notebook which is created at the first moment you use a Onenote mobile client.</p>

            OneNote on my Android device does not show a "Personal (Web)", it simply has the notebooks shown on my PC versions of OneNote. Anyway, let's not complicate with a discussion on mobile. How can I sync Quick Notes between two PCs, each
<em>already</em> running Office 2013 (using the same email account) on Windows 7 without creating an arbitrary section or reinstalling (reinstalling probably wouldn't resolve anything anyway since I installed using the HUP, which does not provide any options
 during install)?

<p>I'm afraid this is the only possible way (since Onenote 2010).</p>
