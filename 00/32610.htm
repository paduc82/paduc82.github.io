<h2>            Folder Sizes in the detail view. What motive does Microsoft have for not displaying a list of Folder Sizes in the detail view&#63; I don&#39;t want to post this in feedback...... </h2>
                    
<p>What motive does Microsoft have for not displaying a list of Folder Sizes in the detail view? &nbsp;I simply want see my folders in list view and know how big each folder is! &nbsp;Is that to much to ask? &nbsp;Are you (MS) in cahoots with the makers of &nbsp;folder size software
 so they can sell me something that should simply be in the details view? Is it because it might slow down my "Windows experience" which ain't so great anyhow.</p>
<p>I don't care what MS has to say. &nbsp;This is not a plea (or tip) for them to fix this.I just wanna know why they have avoided millions (<span>&nbsp;5,180,000 results&nbsp;according to Google)&nbsp;</span>of requests for
 this feature &nbsp;Microsoft Users: &nbsp;Why do you think Microsoft has purposely chosen to omit a view "folder size" column in Window?</p>

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>This would be easier to answer if it was something new?</p>
<p>Windows has never had the ability to display folder sizes, as far as I'm aware. The only logical reason would be that it is about speed. This would be even more important today where multi-gigabyte folders are more common. These folders can be&nbsp;slow for the
 OS to enumerate, depending on the typical size of the files they contain.</p>
<p>You can simply hover the cursor over a folder and see the size in the popup description.</p>
<p>Or, like you said, there are third party utilities many of which are free.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Stops At 87&#37; All Blue Background Using Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Gateway FX6850 PC and want to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine passes the compatibility check and downloads the update, then it begins to work on the update and never completes.</p>
<p>It gets to 87% [I've tried two times to let this auto-install] and have to reset the PC. The Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant works pretty well and I've made sure to on my 3rd attempt [doing this now], I've removed my graphics card and also removed my WIFI card
 physically and rebooted the machine first to remove any additional hardware not already apart of the core system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will screenshot if the error happens again, what suggestions or log could I review to see why the error is occurring?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support!</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 and XP-Pen Artist 16 Display tablet, express key issues</h2>
                    <p>I bought an XP-Pen Artist 16 Display tablet. Think of it like a Wacom Cintiq. The Artist 16 has 8 built-in express keys on the tablet itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my desktop (Windows 10 Home edition) the Artist 16 works perfectly. I am able to assign the express keys with no issue what so ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 3 also&nbsp;&nbsp;(Windows 10 Home edition) the express keys do not function properly. When I assign shortcuts to the express keys. Nothing happens. I am forced to use the keyboard for all my programs (Photoshop,Sketchbook Pro ...etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What specifically is it about the Surface Pro 3 that is preventing the Artist 16 express keys from working properly? I use this as a mobile work station and it's a bit irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can draw on the Surface Pro 3, but it's a small screen, I needed a larger drawing surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be great.</p>

<p>My best guess is that there is a conflict of some kind with touch screen drivers. Your SP3 is a touch screen that is N-Trig based, and you may have downloaded Wacom drivers for your SP3 from the Surface site or the XP-Pen Display vendor's site. It's been
 tough for folks with Wacom based tablets - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/5dihul/using_wacom_intuos_4_with_surface_pro_4_possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/5dihul/using_wacom_intuos_4_with_surface_pro_4_possible/</a> is an example - as you can't have all of these drivers working simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is different is most likely that your other computer is not a touch screen with touch drivers while the Surface is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you considered asking the support folks at XP-Pen if they have information on this?

<p>&nbsp;Thank you Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I was thinking that as well with the touch screen drivers. I may remove those best I can and use a mouse instead. I'll post about that when the new Bluetooth mouse arrives. Worse case, I will install Windows 7 on the SP3 and (hopefully) that will remove
 all the touch/pen features and drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did speak to the XP-Pen tech support. They were really helpful, however we could not find a solution.</p>

<p>Good news! I was able to get the express keys working. There are still some calibration issues to work on, but for the most part the Artist 16 IS working on the SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled (all) of the Human Interface Devices. That of course stops everything..keyboard,touchscreen..etc from working. Held down the power button for a hard reboot. Powered back on and waited for the default drivers to reinstall. Then reconnected the
 Artist 16 and the new updated drivers (Star01,02,03 &amp; Artist16,22HD,22E for Win(0921)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now other than XP-Pen software not allowing (calibration) to be selected. It's working.... all the undo's and redo's an artist could want!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've booted my PC in safe mode but Windows Explorer crashed again when I opened with right-click menu and moved the cursor on "New". &nbsp;The crash only happens under these specific circumstances.&nbsp;I've also run a full virus and malware
 scan with no threats detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting further instructions.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. If the above steps did not work, let's try another workaround. You can try restarting your Windows Explorer from the Task Manager and see if it will resolve the issue. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Task Manager.</strong> </li><li>Click the drop-down arrow beside <strong>More details</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Processes</strong> tab, look for <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> from the list.</li><li>Select Windows Explorer, right-click on it and select <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After doing so, open Windows Explorer and see if it will crash again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>I might suggest to capture a user mode dump of the Explorer crash which has the potential to pinpoint the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>More info on collecting user-mode dumps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 blank sidebar &#47; desktop gadgets, registering - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 blank sidebar &#47; desktop gadgets, registering vbscript.dll does not solve</h2>
                    After uninstalling the trial version Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, some of my windows 7 sidebar gadgets are not displayed properly, my calendar gadget is blank and the weather gadget displays nothing at all. Some of my custom addon gadgets are also
 not displayed correctly either.<br />
<br />
I have tried the proposed solutions to register vbscript.dll, vscript.dll and a few other dll's from an elevated command prompt however this does not solve my problem at all. I have also tried restoring gadgets and reinstalling custom gadgets however this doesn't
 work either.<br />
<br />
However when I reinstall Kaspersky Internet Security 2010, this problem disapears but then returns when I uninstall it again.

<p>I figured out what the problem is. I ran a search for "kaspersky" in the windows registry which found a a fair few results even after using the kaspersky removal tool. I noticed a few of these registry entries (located in "Inprocserver32" in a few sections")
 were blocking some of the above mentioned dll's (in particular vbscript.dll) which, through googling, I have found to be the primary cause of this problem. These registry entries lead to "C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2010\scrchpg.dll"
 which, from what I can gather, is part of kaspersky which scans for, and prevents registry modifications. For some reason scrchpg.dll is removed, but the registry entries referring to it are not, which means vbscript.dll cannot be registered since scrchpg.dll
 can't be found to scan it.</p>
<p>Deleting these registry entries referring to "C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2010\scrchpg.dll" should solve these problems, however whenever I try to, I get an access denied message, even through safe mode. However I did manage
 to find a work around:</p>
<p>Before removing kaspersky, copy "C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2010\scrchpg.dll" to another location for safe keeping. Once kaspersky is removed, create the following folders: C:\Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet
 Security 2010 and paste the scrchpg.dll you copied there.</p>
<p>If you have already removed kaspersky, I have attached scrchpg.zip (which you need to extract and move to the location mentioned above) in a similar thread I created on the kaspersky support forum which can be found here:

            Hi jeremyst.clair,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />It is likely that you momentarily experienced a drop in connection and this causes your message not to send. This would cause this exclamation mark next to the message.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.       
        </p>

            If it was beside a message, it simply means that the message was not instantly sent because of a lapse of connection, but after you reconnected back again the message was read by your contact. 
<br />
<br />As long as this isn't repeatedly happenning, there is nothing to worry about here.

            Do you use mobile data or Wi-Fi for your network connection? It is likely that one of these is the root of the issue here.

            If it is with one person, and he then sent a message afterwards, what I believe is occuring is that when you are sending him messages he is completely disconnected off all networks on his end, so they are not being sent.
<br />
<br />Please ask him to maintain a steady network whilst you try to send him a couple of messages, and see if they go through.

<h2>            How can i delete one administrator account out of two admin accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I had one admin account. Recently i gave my laptop for servicing to service center and they created one more admin account. I was trying to delete it but there is no option to delete it in manage accounts option. There is delete option in my own admin
 account which i created at the time of buying of this laptop. Can anybody help me in deleting this other admin account?

            What will you do if you forget/mislay/lose your house key? Do you have a way of getting back in again even without a key? Do you have a way to log on to Windows in case your password no longer works?<br />

            Hi Are these all personnel files like music, my pic and my documents if so how is your external hard drive conncected to your pc ?<br />
<br />
if it is usb then it should be very simple:<br />
<br />
Plug in your usb hard drive and give it a few seconds for windows to find it and install it
<br />
<br />
go to my computer and it should show there as a new drive.<br />
<br />
if so you should be able to copy/cut and paste your file on to your new pc or alternativly keep it as a second drive and just access your files
<br />
<br />
I use a external hard drive for all my personal docs as that way if windows ever goes down all i need to do is re install it and re link my files
<br />
<br />
if you want to keep it as a second drive and want to link the folders to make them default let me know and i will explain how is is very easy
<br />
<br />
<br />

Use whatever it was you used to back it up to restore it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you used copy/paste - use it again.<br />
If you used Windows 7 backup - use it again.<br />

    <title>Cannot uninstall or reinstall quicktime or itunes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardjallen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot uninstall or reinstall quicktime or itunes</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I cannot uninstall or reinstall QuickTime or iTunes. I am using an HP Pavilion a1110y running Windows XP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: originally iTunes was installed on C drive, but I reinstalled newer version in 2008 on F drive (500gig internal hard drive). C drive had
 30gig, 10gig unused. I wanted to avoid running out of free space on C drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>iTunes originally worked fine. Late this year, iTunes upgraded and I could not download videos or music without the upgrade.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I took several steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Created a restore point in case anything went wrong.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. I tried to download the upgrade. Received an error saying QuickTime could not be uninstalled because "quicktime.msi file missing."
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Using Add/Remove Programs, I tried to uninstall QuickTime and iTunes. Both uninstalls failed due to "quicktime.msi file missing." Using search,
 I located quicktime.msi in Windows, and tried uninstall again, this time directing uninstall program to the folder where msi file resided.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Received error "trying to access a network or disc that is no longer available."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. I contacted Apple support by phone. Tech walked me through download and installation of iTunes, but received same errors. He suggested I contact
 HP (my pc maker). </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. I used HP online help program and reported errors as above, requesting help to find missing msi file. Answer: "You need to first uninstall
 all the ITunes related components from the PC and re-install the latest version of iTunes."
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. I would love to! But I can't do it with old files that won't uninstall, which was why I contacted them in the first place.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Next, I tried manually deleting every file I could find that was inside QuickTime's folders, however, some files could not be deleted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. I tried downloading upgrade again from Apple but received new error that download failed because some iTunes files were missing and the program
 could not be uninstalled. I tried downloading QuickTime by itself, and received the same error code.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I restored my pc to its original point.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Now, iTunes cannot run because it reports files are missing.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. Opened my pc's help program (which was how I reached HP support) and searched for error codes. It directed me to Microsoft support.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. I found similar error codes which had been fixed by using Windows Installer CleanUp Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>12. I downloaded utility, opened per instructions, and searched the list of programs that could be uninstalled. It listed iTunes, but not QuickTime.
 I used it to uninstall iTunes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>13. Returned to Apple, downloaded iTunes program, but error code says: "older version of QuickTime cannot be removed. Contact your technical
 support group." </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hoping Microsoft can help. How do I get old files to uninstall when cleanup utility cannot locate them? I cannot uninstall the files, nor can
 I reinstall fresh versions.</span></span></p>

            I'm in the same boat. I finally got iTunes to work on the older version, but still can't download v 10.0. I think it's time to back up my data, and reload Windows. It will probably take less time, considering how much time, and effort I've invested in
 researching this fix.

<p>I have encountered the same problem. Anyone had any success yet?</p>
<p>Have just got mine sorted. Downloaded free uninstaller from freedownloads.com called revo uninstaller pro. Windows uninstaller just aint good enough to get rid of itunes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Software is free for a month but it is so good i am for purchasing it after the month is up. The problem seems to be that windows uninstaller cant find or uninstall all of Bonjuor and Quicktime. They seem to leave traces behind that windows uninstaller
 cant deal with therefore itunes 10 cant be downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Download this software for a trial, it is excellent. I am not promoting this product, just letting you know it sorted out my problem. Use this software to uninstall your itunes in the order apple recommend, itunes,quicktime, apple software update, apple
 mobile device support then bonjour. As each programme is deleted revo then askes you if you want it to search for anything behind, do this and each programme will be fully deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hope this helps as i am enjoying itunes again. Goodluck.</p>
<p>Please vote and let me know if this has been of any help. Thanks</p>

<p>If you are still having difficulties uninstalling it....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could go into program files and delete it manually and check your common files too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next get a good registry clean up tool and run it...it'll find all the errors and fix them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh you can't delete them manually even though you are using windows xp.....ang on a mo....when you try to delete them manually what message do you get?</p>

<p>That's different issue altogether.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control Panel&gt;Administration Tools&gt;Services</p>
<p>Look for the windows search&gt;Dbl Click&gt;windows search.</p>
<p>A new box opens up,half way down you'll see Startup Type and next to it a drop down menu</p>
<p>If the Windows search is starting up change it to Manual and apply :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That'll stop it from starting on Startup</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Windows 7<br />
disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32<br />
or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />

sfc /scannow<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Next message includes methods to do intense drive checking.<br />
<br />
Make sure any external devices&nbsp;are disconnected while installing Windows.</p>
<p>By chance do you have the boot order set to the DVD?</p>
<p>Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot - set the boot order to the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Also BIOS issues can cause this error.<br />
<br />
If you just replaced the drive then check the cabling and contacts on both ends.<br />
<br />
The problem could be the hard drive or even the hard drive controller.<br />

<p>==================<br />
<br />
Sometimes you will have to do a clean install of Windows to solve this issue however be sure<br />
to check the drive for errors, cabling and other issues or the problem can return.<br />
<br />
The possible fix for that issue is the same/similar for the issues mentioned here :</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

</p><p>hi isha, THANK YOU so much for your reply </p>
<p>I don remember the name of the update but it was a windows update I thought that was the one which caused&nbsp;the problem so I uninstalled all the updates I downloaded that week,the problem is not solved yet ..so I reset the laptop but still I have the same
 problem :(...</p>
<p>ya and nothing happens when&nbsp;I press the button ...no error nothing...it just doesn't work ..the samething happened to the f7 button which enables flight mode if I press f7&nbsp;without holding the function key..sometimes that key works very rare..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;the 1 method you told ,I tried it displayed to enable the Bluetooth as it was shut off so I cancelled it and the second method that is the on screen keyboard,in that the number 5 and 6 buttons are working,i don't know&nbsp;why it is not working on keyboard&nbsp;but
 I donno how to check the ctrl button and volume mute,volume down,airplane mode and few other..</p>
<p>the ctrl button which is at the left side of the keyboard doesn't work but the right side one works fine...

<p>Don't know why my post came up &nbsp;blank, &nbsp;but my question was how do you beat Jace Beleron. Have tried varying deck combinations but he seems to always win in the end either he gets the card where he has two turns in the row to beat me or he just keep piling
 up creatures. Any specific decks I should use or combinations?</p>

            <p>I've found that my 2 favourite decks to use are the Dragon's Roar and Machinations. &nbsp;Try those 2 and see how they work for you. &nbsp;Otherwise, just keep testing out different decks.</p>

<p>I used the white deck and it was pretty easy using just Gideon's Avenger and the Kor Duelist equipped. The Kor Duelist gets double strike when equipped and also first strike which took old Jace out pretty quick. Oh and Gideons Avenger can knock out Jace's
 top guy each turn I had him beat by like the 6th turn. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>White is probably one of the worst decks you can pick. &nbsp;You have no way of dealing with Lord of Illusions, which just makes their deck amazing and they just mind control/sower &nbsp;or bounce the stupid avenger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Best deck to play is Chandra. All the extra kill spells are really good against the "sac if targeted" guys. You can kill all problem creatures and win by utilizing good tempo. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The idea is to get into a good rhythm with a kiln fiend or pumper: clear the way, swing, rinse repeat. You want to ideally try to keep him off of his card draw.&nbsp; The more cards you let him draw, the less likely you will win.&nbsp; So to keep him from playing
 Jace's Ingenuity/mind spring/Concentrate&nbsp; you have to stay super aggressive. Force him to commit to the board and punish him if he doesn't.</p>
<p>Cards that are amazing:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wheel of Fortune:&nbsp; This punishes Jace for having lots of cards in hand.&nbsp; It allows you to burn through your hand and reload while Jace often nets very little value.</p>
<p>Prodigal Pyromancer:&nbsp; The ability to instant kill half they're creatures is pretty good.</p>
<p>Either of those in an opening hand and your off to a good start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you draw into Inferno Titan,&nbsp; You want to be very weary of a mind control/ sower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you play this as a finisher after you've taken control of the game.&nbsp; It also helps to have something that can deal with it just in case (ie blaze, banefire)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also watch his open mana and watch out for repulse,&nbsp; if you're pumping a hellhound or brawler keep a few mana back to replay him if he gets bounced.&nbsp; Little things like this gain a lot of extra tempo</p>
<p>Also, don't be afraid to have your spells countered,&nbsp; I mean play around them for critical spells, but if you have to use 2 kill spells early on because the first gets countered it's still worth it.&nbsp; You just don't want to be passing turns without doing
 anything just because your afraid of a counter.</p>

<p>Poo maybe you have a different version of the game genuis but you have to beat Jace before you can unlock the Chandra deck at least that is how mine played maybe you have a different one then the one I palyed . So like I said I beat him &nbsp;with the white deck
 &nbsp;pretty easily. </p>

    <title>Xbox One Smartglass vs iPhone 5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xdarkhelmet03x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Smartglass vs iPhone 5</h2>
                    
<p>I have just spent over an hour with Xbox customer service on the phone and another 30 online chatting with an Xbox customer support agent. The conclusion of both conversations was to post here and have you guys come up with some sort of a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an Xbox One, an iPhone 5 with iOS 7,1,1 (11D201), a Netgear N300 wireless router WNR2000 v2, and a Cisco modem number: 244051186.</p>

<p>I have reset modem, network, and xbox. unplugged all for 30 seconds to rest. &nbsp;Turned off data on my phone to make sure I am using only wifi, checked that the subnet on both Xbox One and iPhone. I'm sure I'm forgetting other things, I just want this to work.
 Please respond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found that it was really finicky when Xbox was operating on Wifi. Sometimes I could make the connection and other times I couldn't. I have since plugged the Xbox directly in using an ethernet cable and I've never had a problem connecting any device (iPhone
 5 iOS 7.1.1, iPad 2. iPhone 4 that belongs to my roommate and my laptop). You may want to try that.
</p>
<p>Other than that I'm sure you've tried the obvious: ensuring you have the Xbox one App and not 360, power cycling both devices (yes, I know.. rarely works but.. worth a shot), making sure you have Smartglass allowed in your Xbox settings, ensuring that you
 have both devices on the same network, and trying to manually input the IP address of the Xbox into your iPhone.....</p>

<p>Trying it hard wired is the only thing I haven't tried. I may give it a shot this afternoon after work. That's sounds like a simple solution that xbox support should have.... Just saying, it's their app and their console...

<p>I don't disagree but to be fair I always have a hard time getting Apple devices to play nicely with others. My Google &amp; Microsoft devices/software can work in tandem just fine. Apple doesn't want to play nice. LOL.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>SFC /scannow - run when you suspect there may be a system file corruption as it will check the Digital<br />

<h2>            Wired Xbox 360 controller blinks once and turns off</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hey all!</p>

<p>I've been having this issue since I reformatted and reinstalled Windows 7.</p>

<p>I have a wired 360 controller, and when I plug it in, the green flight flashes once and doesn't stay on.</p>

<p>I have installed all of the Xbox Accessory drivers (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/g2jQ2bw.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">as can be seen here</a>), but they have not helped.</p>

<p>When I look in the Device Manager, the Xbox 360 Controller<a href="http://i.imgur.com/E0BqOPb.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> does
</a><strong><em><a href="http://i.imgur.com/E0BqOPb.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">not </a>
</em></strong><a href="http://i.imgur.com/E0BqOPb.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">show up</a>. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver three times now.</p>

<p>I know the USB slots I'm using all work (I've tried the controller on 4 of them) as they can use my external hard drives with no problem as well.</p>

<p>Any advice?<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch!</p>

            <p>Hey there BassmanGB!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the controller issue!</p>
<p>Do you happen to have an Xbox 360 console to test the controller with? If so, go ahead and plug in your controller to the console and see if it works. If it works, try a different PC to use the controller with.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you may need to contact Microsoft Hardware Support. Here are the numbers listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>CA Hardware Support: 800-876-8533</li>
<li>US Hardware Support: 866-833-7088</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to post back and let us know how it goes! :)</p>
