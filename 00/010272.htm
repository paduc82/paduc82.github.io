<h2>            SharePoint Admin Active Sites List permissions</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a SharePoint Admin in Office 365 I have access to view the Active and deleted sites in our Tenant.&nbsp; This list is obviously very handy.&nbsp; Is there a way to make it available to non-Admin users?&nbsp; I can't find an obvious way.&nbsp; The export function would be
 fine in a one-off scenario, but I have a request to make this available to a select group of management users so they can check in whenever they feel like to see what our usage is like, among other things... Anybody have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Brad</p>

<div>Hi Brad,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The active site list and deleted site list are in the SharePoint Admin Center, which only open for Admins. There is no entry for non-admin users to access the list. The end user can only see the sites that they have access in SharePoint. They will not
 see the sites they cannot visit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The workaround you can consider is assigning the group of users SharePoint admin role, but that will give them admin access to the whole SharePoint.</div>

<h2>            &#34;To insert a chart, you must first close any open dialog boxes or cancel editing mode in Microsoft Excel.&#34;</h2>
                    I have 64-bit Windows 7 and 32-bit Microsoft Office 2010.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since I teach a class and students don't need to be proficient at Excel, I want to show them how to insert a chart into PowerPoint using PowerPoint. When I click Insert&gt;Chart or the icon on the slide layout I see this error message: "To insert a chart,
 you must first close any open dialog boxes or cancel editing mode in Microsoft Excel."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Most of the forum discussions I've found address 2007 and using Diagnostics tool. I can't find Diagnostics on 2010 and saw posts stating this option is not available on 2010.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To try to fix this I've:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>updated MS,&nbsp;</li><li>restarted,&nbsp;</li><li>closed all other programs,&nbsp;</li><li>changed compatibility settings,&nbsp;</li><li>tried running it as Admin,&nbsp;</li><li>changed trust settings</li><li>etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't have any open dialog boxes that I can see.... especially since Excel is not open.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nothing worked. Please help. </div>

            You are right Diagnostics has gone in 2010. You can run a repair though.<br />
<br />
Windows &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features<br />
<br />
Right click the entry for Office 2010 and choose Change.<br />
<br />
You should now get an option to Repair<br />

<div>Please tell me where to find the library. I found one in the Office 14 folder but it didn't have a preferences folder.

</p><p>In my case, when I ran into this message it was because I already had another spreadsheet file open. Once I closed it, I could edit the chart in my powerpoint.</p>

            Zune won't transfer documents and Nokia Suite doesn't work with Lumia so you will have to either send yourself an email with the documents attached and open the email on your PC ; or upload the documents to the cloud ( Skydrive, Evernote, Google Drive
 or whatever your preferred cloud storage is using the relevant app) and access the cloud service on your PC and them download them to your PC.

            Why are my Skype contacts or credit missing?
<br />
<br />If you're signed into Skype but don't see your contacts or Skype Credit, you probably just signed in to a different account than you were expecting to see. 
<br /> 
<br />
<br />How did this happen?
<br />
<br />    You might have multiple Microsoft accounts and not even know it.
<br />    Have you ever used Outlook.com, Hotmail, Office 365, OneDrive, Xbox, or Windows? The email address you use for those services can also be used to sign in to Skype. If you have more than one account, you can be signed in to Skype but not with the correct account where your contacts and Skype Credit are stored. 
<br />     
<br />    Someone else may have used your device to sign in to their Microsoft account.
<br />    Someone like a friend, family member, child, or spouse may have used your device to sign in to their account and forgotten to sign back out.
<br />
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to sign in to the correct Skype account:
<br /> 
<br />
<br />    Do you have more than one Skype account?
<br />     
<br />        Do you use an email address to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Xbox, OneDrive, or Outlook.com? If you recently signed in to one of those other services, it's possible you may be signed in to Skype with a different Microsoft account. 
<br />         
<br />        Do you use Skype on more than one device such as your desktop computer or phone? It's possible you may be signed in to a different account on each device. 
<br />    Try accessing your Skype account from another device that you might already be signed in on like your desktop computer, a mobile device, or Xbox. 
<br />    If you're able to access the correct Skype account from another device, you can identify the username of the account you're signed in with by following the steps in this article to find your Skype name. 
<br />    Sign out of Skype, and then sign back in.
<br />    Make sure you sign in using the correct account with your email address, phone number, or Skype account information.
<br />    Still don't see your contacts or Skype credit?
<br />    Try signing in using any email address you may have previously used to sign in to any Microsoft services. If you still don't see your contacts or Skype Credit, sign back out and try again with a different email.

</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Why you should/must the ‚ÄúSafely Remove‚Äù function requires a bit of a historical and technological review.
</p>
<p>The first ‚ÄúUSB‚Äù drives used ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù memory chips with storage of 16/32/‚Ä¶/256 KB (NOT MB or GB!) rather than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù old school spinning hard Drives. Current techlogy has extended flash type drives to 256GB (and still growing). I still have my first
 thumb drive, which cost $75 for 256KB of space. You can now get around 1TB of USB spinning disk external USB storage for that price &lt;grin&gt;. Technological growth has expanded the ‚ÄúUSB Drive‚Äù definition to include external portable spinning disk type drives
 with up to 3TB in storage space (and also growing).</p>
<p>Writing / saving files to USB Flash storage is not a clear cut simple ‚Äúsave‚Äù operation due to technological limits of the flash device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Flash memory has a finite number of write operations before it fails. Writing to flash memory is done a whole ‚Äúblock‚Äù at a time. So even if you need to write a single ‚Äúbyte‚Äù to a block, the whole block is written, ‚Äúburning up‚Äù a write operation to that
 block. To minimize ‚Äúwasting‚Äù write operations Windows drivers for USB devices has been designed to stage ‚Äúwriting‚Äù to the USB device through a ‚Äúcache‚Äù file on the local HD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When a full block, or multiple of full blocks of file is ready to write to the flash drive it is all sent.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Partial blocks of information are ‚Äúleft‚Äù in the cache. Therefore, even though you have ‚Äúsaved‚Äù a file to the flash drive ‚Äúonly‚Äù, the tail end of the file may still only reside in the cache in the local. Unfortunately, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Word DOCX format files
 are structured so that the body text of your document is located at the logical and physical end of the file. If that last block is ‚Äúlost‚Äù even though most of the DOCX file structure is on the flash drive, the most important part, your body text, could be
 lost. ‚ÄúLeft behind‚Äù on the computer local HD. OOPS!</p>
<p>I do not know if the write cache is still used for USB spinning disk devices.</p>
<p>So that defines the first part of the problem. Why we NEED to use the ‚ÄúSafely Remove‚Äù function.</p>
<p>The second part of the problem is why does ‚ÄúSafely Remove‚Äù sometimes fail?</p>
<p>This failure happens because of how some programs are written. They take ‚Äúhidden‚Äù file open locks when users do not expect it. And sometimes the program does not properly release the file open lock even after it no longer needs it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>An example of a hidden/unexpected file open lock is using the preview function to display a thumbnail image of the file in tools like File Explorer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>‚ÄúSafely Remove‚Äù is designed to ‚Äúflush‚Äù the cache, writing all remaining file ‚Äútail ends‚Äù to the flash drive. It is not written to force applications with file open locks to close. And, unfortunately, it STILL (after too many years)
 has not been enhanced to list the programs that have file open locks on the USB device &lt;hint hint MS!&gt;. It is a simple enough change, Windows does know, so it is simple enough to program the utility to identify and list these programs.

Based on my research and test, it‚Äôs indeed not feasible to save an email to OneNote in the Outlook Web App in Office 365. Thanks for your understanding.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I understand you need a single photo from your screen saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be achieved using print screen, all you have to do is let the screen saver run and then click print screen button to take the screen short of the current picture that is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the below article, which will give you more information about screenshot:</p>

            <p>The MSRT is a special utility that targets a small subset of known malware.</p>
<p>Windows Defender (on Windows 8) and Microsoft Security Essentials provide real time protection against viruses and Trojans.
</p>
<p>This particular bit of garbage is adware. Unwanted, yes, but typically not something that the Microsoft antimalware engine goes after, unfortunately.</p>
<p>This guide will help you remove it: <a href="http://malwaretips.com/blogs/static-australianbrewingcompany-com-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://malwaretips.com/blogs/static-australianbrewingcompany-com-removal/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what your point is regarding guidance provided by an MVP (myself included). We are recognized for our efforts in helping people with Microsoft products, as volunteers.
<a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx</a>&nbsp; We are not restricted to only Microsoft solutions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know who "you" is for your question, but I assume you mean Microsoft. And, yes, Microsoft trusts us. I volunteer as a moderator. I am evaluated regularly. And my MVP award is not automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, back to how this got on your PC. It came bundled with something you installed. It is an unfortunate shady practice, but this junk pays for the shareware/freeware programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description on Malwaretips:</p>
<p><em>"The Static.australianbrewingcompany.com ads are caused by an ad-supported (users may see additional banner, search, pop-up, pop-under, interstitial and in-text link advertisements) cross web browser plugin for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome,
 which is distributed through various monetization platforms during installation</em>.
<u><strong>This malicious browser extensions is typically added when you install another free software (video recording/streaming, download-managers or PDF creators) that had bundled into their installation this adware program</strong></u>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, you, or someone using your computer with the ability to download and install a program, game, browser extension or add-on, allowed this junk to install.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that one of the tools we have been recommending for ages as a rescue scanner was bundled with a slew of garbage, including Conduit and similar junk. You are able to de-select the installation of these add-ons, but they are presented
 in such a way as to be confusing. It is fairly easy to proceed with the installation, unaware that you had the option to opt-out of the bundled adware.</p>

            <p>Dear Steve:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for identifying the Australian, et.al. as adware and not malware.&nbsp; I just purchased a Lenovo G780 w/Windows 8 and the further away Lenovo goes from the ThinkPad line they bought from IBM, the more bloatware they appear to be allowing on these
 strictly Lenovo-engineered products.&nbsp; I have been working w/ the machine and its O/S, upgrading, customizing, configuring, and tonight in particular I have been deleting sorts of useless applications, including Microsoft's so-called "store".&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My comments about MSFT not having either of the two utilities set to ID the "adware" was based on not knowing if it was perhaps a spyware implant.&nbsp; I say "two" because Win 8 has only Windows Defender and not Security Essentials, it is my understanding.
 I did not mean to impugn any MVP.&nbsp; I have been a MSFT Partner myself since 1985 and am a TechNet and MSDN subscriber w/ an advanced degree in Computer Science&nbsp;and I respect what you and others&nbsp;who are&nbsp;certified do for all of us who have questions and need
 guidance.&nbsp; So, thank you for your explanation and the link you provided. Just before I saw your thorough response to my query, I went into the files and there were THREE copies of the pop-up and I think I was successful in deleting them.&nbsp; I bought this Intel
 quad-core machine to keep track of financial data and the fact is that I was not at all certain it was just half-baked adware.&nbsp; I wonder if SPYBOT would have picked it up? Passive adware and not a Trojan hijack implant was not a risk I wanted to take.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, my thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I have dug deep into files and could not find the source code for the so-called "australianbrewery pop-up.&nbsp; I did run Windows Defender completely and at the end of the last file WinDef scanned, the Java screen popped-up and so did a file page for the australianbrewery
 adware. I know the Java install was done on the Oracle page (I needed&nbsp; Java for some spreadsheet data) and I know I did not check for any add-ons to be selected other than the latest version, 7 &amp; update 45.&nbsp; My question is simple: how do you (or me) know that
 the suggested malware removal sites are not adware themselves.&nbsp; I finally capitulated and used: Junkware Removal Tool (JRT) by Thisisu.&nbsp; It made registry changes which I was and am insecure about.&nbsp; None of the files it "corrected" showed the "australianbrewery
 name per se.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I won't burden you w/ the print-out from the JRTool, but I just wonder:&nbsp; I trust Microsoft; I do not know how or why to trust something free by "Thisisu" when I had to give it permission to access my registry on the hard drive.&nbsp; Hard to say what it did exactly
 since nothing from the aus.brew. showed, and how do I know it was a bona fide site that in and of itself did not modify my registry w/ spyware--worse than the adware?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For what it is worth I will run BOTH the online and offline Windows Defender tonight....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><br />

 I did not mean to impugn any MVP.&nbsp; I have been a MSFT Partner myself since 1985 and am a TechNet and MSDN subscriber w/ an advanced degree in Computer Science&nbsp;and I respect what you and others&nbsp;who are&nbsp;certified do for all of us who have questions and need
 guidance.&nbsp; So, thank you for your explanation and the link you provided. Just before I saw your thorough response to my query, I went into the files and there were THREE copies of the pop-up and I think I was successful in deleting them.&nbsp; I bought this Intel
 quad-core machine to keep track of financial data and the fact is that I was not at all certain it was just half-baked adware.&nbsp; I wonder if SPYBOT would have picked it up? Passive adware and not a Trojan hijack implant was not a risk I wanted to take.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, my thanks.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp; I am the person that started this thread (ThomasP) above. I am not a Microsoft MVP.&nbsp; The Junkware Removal Tool cited above might work.&nbsp; I removed it using several approaches and I did not test after using each one.&nbsp; Going into the files and looking for
 it and deleting it may have worked but likely it was the junkware removal tool.&nbsp; If you read the other responses you'll see it probably is Lenovo's fault for packing so much bloatware.&nbsp; Probably associated w/ a game of the other installed nonsense. Try the
 Junkware tool.</p>

            Dear Thomas P,
<div>Thank you for your Quick response. I just wanted to tell you, I am encountering this Nuisance&nbsp;</div>
<div>Http//static.australianbrewingcompany.com running a SONY VAIOS feat WINDOWS VISTA HOME 2007</div>
<div>Computers did not exist for consumers during my Educational Years, and I Do Intuitive Driving, Computing, Living, in other words, I am Klueless, I Don't Read Manuels Either. So, After deleting Needed components in my operating systems, after the Failure
 of Windows Defender, McAfee, Mr Microsoft Fix-it, Etc, I am Ready to Toss this Machine in the Sea and Start Over. By the Way, I would Retreive it and Despose of This Plastic Toxic Waste Accordingly. If you could send me the Best Junkware Removal tool that
 you used, I will give it One More Try before I Cut My Losses, I have Wasted Enough of My Valuable Time on this.</div>
<div>Why Can't the Microsoft Rocket Scientists give me the Correct Tool, and A Simple Fix for This?</div>
<div>It is Their Job to Stay LinkedIn to the Users of their Systems, Let's Go Microsoft, You Failing Me Big Time!</div>

            <p>Dear KKQYIN:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the answer to your main question.&nbsp; The junkware tool I used and which the MVP Stephen referred to is here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://thisisudax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thisisudax.org/</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes by the name of JRT Junkware Removal Tool 6.0.8 by thisisu.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot guarantee it is the precise utility that I ran that worked.&nbsp; I surmise it worked because I have searched my files and sub-files for anything "Australian" and nothing is found.&nbsp; Also, it has been a week since the last time the adware popped-up.&nbsp;
 However, I did run others including good old SPYBOT.&nbsp; Spybot did not find anything, incidentally.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to your level of frustration.&nbsp; Any thinking person who knows the history of the personal computing industry and can think even marginally out-of-the-box knows that since 1982 we users in the hundreds of millions globally have been guinea pigs. Personal
 computers and the technology involved should not have been foisted upon us--either hardware or software--w/o massive testing first. Computers should be like toasters and blenders. Instead we have wasted tens of billions of hours dealing with error messages,
 patches, fixes, hardware deficiencies--the list goes on endlessly. In the meantime, the industry leaders from Gates to Ellison to Schmidt (@ Google) have become multi-billionaires as we users have dealt with and "tested" their products the last 30+ years.&nbsp;
 In other words, your frustration is understandable and justified.&nbsp; But, here we are.&nbsp; Microsoft's security utilities SHOULD catch adware like this and remove it. &nbsp;Period.&nbsp; No excuses.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to let the readers of this thread know if you are finally successful in removing the "Australian" intruder.&nbsp; Hang in there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ThomasP</p>

<h2>            Cannot see posts from Yammer groups on My Feed on Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company just adopted Yammer recently, and we found that Feed (or Home button)&nbsp;on Yammer desktop covers all posts from all Yammer public groups (no need to be member or follow) but&nbsp;on Yammer Mobile, both iOS and Android, this does not work.&nbsp; On mobile,
 the&nbsp;'my feed' only shows direct posts on 'All Company'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we&nbsp;get Yammer mobile feed to work the same as Yammer&nbsp;desktop?&nbsp;&nbsp;People use mobile a lot more and they are missing out on group posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Windows phone is quite safe from viruses because of the secured operating system and can't be overwritten by any external program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For SD card, back it up using a PC, then reformat it. Once done, copy all your files back to the SD card.</p>
<p>

<h3> stevehargreaves  say:</h3>
<h2>            New OEM battery for 640XL&#63; &#40;U.K&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So my battery has suddenly nose dived when it comes to it's life. It is lasting a day at most - and that is with it just sitting there (switched on) not being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I need a new battery as I'm not ready to give up on my beloved Windows phone. The trouble is that you just know any batteries advertised as being "genuine" are probably anything but. I'd much prefer to source a genuine Microsoft one if possible. Thanks
 MS for not even having this stuff on your store by the way :/&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah I've been searching online. Sadly any reputable retailers are out of stock (and not expected to ever have stock again for obvious reasons) so stuck dealing with third parties, who seem to be importing them from China. You just

<p>- format the text in the signature window</p>
<p>- etc.</p>
<p>I ask for a solution to add my own html signature to outlook <strong>2016</strong> emails and where the signature are stored.</p>
<p>

            Unfortunately forced to migrate to a new laptop with Windows 10 (in general, W10 = YUCK!). I simply created a new Signatures folder in AppData\Roaming\Microsoft in my user folder and copied my old Windows 2007 signature files there. Then the signatures
 showed up in Outlook File Options Mail Signatures and I set the email options to use my new message and replies/forwards signatures.<br />

<p>I had the same confusion, but @palcouk made a correct assumption - that the folder didn't exist because I'd never created a signature (with this Outlook installation).<br />
<br />
I created a test signature from within Outlook, and hey-presto, the folder appeared. I copied the files over as I'd expected to be able to.</p>

<p>Whatever suggested here, I couldn't find the location of my signature folder.</p>
<p>But, in Outlook 2016 anyway, go to your options where you start your signature editor.</p>
<p>Just hold down the Ctrl-key when you click the 'signatures...' button.</p>
<p>Windows Explorer will open in your 'signatures' folder.</p>

<p><span>After buying new HP Envy 17‚Äù laptop I could not find the signature file for Outlook in its usual place.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I went into Outlook and make a signature by going to File and clicking on Options and then choosing Mail and choosing Signature. In the window I clicked on New and gave it a weird name so it would be easy to search for with would result with only results
 for the signature on the hard drive. I then went to the window below to edit the actual signature by adding my name and a picture.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then went to drive C and did a search for the name of the signature and up it popped in a different location then on my previous laptop as illustrated below.

            What you have is the "Centennial" or "Store App" version of Office 365.&nbsp; It's starting to come pre-installed on new computers and is installed as a UWP windows app.&nbsp; It changes a few paths which is causing some issues with some older macros, add-ins, and
 signatures.&nbsp; To avoid these, it is recommended that the Store version be uninstalled and replaced with either the standard Click to Run or MSI versions of the Office suite.&nbsp;

<p>I have an addin&nbsp;that gets installed&nbsp;in the Word startup. To make sure it works in all types of Word, I need to get the Store(Centennial) version of Office, however, going through the store, it directs me to their website, resulting in a C2R installer.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Also, doing some online research I have found people those have bought Office 2016 for Home and Business (One-time fee) are having the same problems. Does that even has this same problem.&nbsp;<br />

                    We just got a new laptop with a smaller SSD drive and it works super fast for working on most of my files. I also have a huge archive of photos and videos that I store on an external drive. I would like to sync files from both drives to my OneDrive account

            Unfotunately OneDrive syncrhonization does not work like that.
<br />You will need to decide wich of your drive you prefer the Onedrive location and then you can easily drag and drop your files with the new Onedrive client.
<br />For your info there is a limitations for large files cannot exceed 15 GB a single file.
<br />
<br />If need anything else let me know.

            If you are using the SSD to enhance performance, there is little advantage to storing your data on that drive anyway. You might as well use the HDD for your OneDrive files.

            Well, then you have a conundrum.
<br />
<br />Suggestion: Have your frequently used files on your SSD and copy them regularly to the external drive. For Word there is at least on free utility offered by Graham Mayor that will save in two places.
<br />
<br />Otherwise there is third-party syncing software available that would sync your HHD files with your external drive when connected.
<br />
<br />You might be able to designate certain files on your SSD as on-demand files.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-about-onedrive-files-on-demand-0e6860d3-d9f3-4971-b321-7092438fb38e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-...</a>
<br />
<br />I do not know that you can have this with a separate full-sync drive on the same device, though. This means you may need to do the syncing of your external drive on another computer with access to your onedrive account.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated from Outlook 2010 to 2016/365. After the update, flagged emails do not appear in the task view.</p>

            Hello Kaloyan. When you are in Outlook 2016, go to Task and check your "Current View". Try Simple List. One screenshot attached.  I have two flagged emails showing in the screenshot.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2dfa4d4-5a53-41c8-9356-0d670bf8e2d7?upload=true" />

            &gt;&gt; I found some answers where I should select "Display reminders and tasks from this folder in the To-Do Bar.", but I don't have it.
<br />This only applies to PST files that are not set as an email delivery location, such as Archive pst files. 
<br />
<br />Flagged email only displays in the To-Do list and the to-do bar. If you don't see the flagged messages, reset the view or use a different view - you may have a view set that hides flagged messages. 
<br />
<br />Do tasks show up ok? There was a bug in where nothing showed properly, but it was fixed.. since you are on 1709 and it was fixed in 1712, it could be this. See <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-2016/outlook-tasks-to-do-list-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-2016/...</a> for screenshots. To fix it: don't use a group by date view.

<p>OS Windows 7 Pro. Office (Outlook) 2007. Quad core 64 bit.</p>
<p>I recently exported my Outlook 2007 pst files to another drive&nbsp;in preparation for&nbsp;rebuilding the computer&nbsp;. I was running XP 32 bit at the time of export. After rebuilding my computer and installing Windows 7, and Office 2007 (re-installed), I cannot get
 Outlook to import the pst file. It shows up (with its outlook icon) in the drive but when I attempt the import, I get a dialog box saying I don't have permission to import the files (the&nbsp;dialog box has 'filename.pst).&nbsp;I am the administrator, and only user
 so I do not know what permission I need.</p>

<h3> shortino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N95 bluetooth problems with Medion GoPal P4410</h2>
                    I just bought a N95 a few months (it has the latest firware version) ago and few days ago a Medion GoPal P4410 (the latest model of GPS in their range and onboard software).<br />
<br />
There is a problem with the handsfree function between the GPS and N95 that is; it wont automatically connect and every time I want it to connect I have to 're-pair' them both even though the N95 shows the GPS is the 'paired-items list'.<br />
<br />
Both items are bluetooth discoverable and both will allow auto connections and Ive checked both settings a million times. The weird thing is I can transfer files from the N95 to the Medion GoPal system over bluetooth fine, its just the automatic connecting
 of the handsfree option!!<br />
<br />
I tested the Medion GoPal with another sonyericsson 750i and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem with the Medion range and are NOkia going to realease another update for the N95 soon? Or does anyone know anything else I can try?

<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, do you have any 3rd party antivirus/firewll installed?
<br />
<br />If so, can you please temporarily uninstall it, reboot and check if Skype works?
<br />
<br />Please let me know. 
<br />
<br />Ciao
