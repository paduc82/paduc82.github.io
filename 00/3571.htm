<h2>            Band 2 vs. Charge HR &#38; Suggestions to Improve the Microsoft Health App</h2>
                    <p>So I've been a FitBit person for a few years now, right now I have the ChargeHR, but when the Band 2 came out it was too cool to resist not picking one up to compare against my FitBit. I've been wearing both for 4 days, and so far I feel that it
 is a mixed bag. I feel that the ChargeHR is a better fitness tracker (obviously the ChargeHR does not have GPS), while the Band 2 beats the pants off of the ChargeHR in other smart functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest issue I'm having with the Band 2 is really something that could be easily improved on Microsoft's part, and pertains to the edge in terms of data presentation that FitBit has when using the website dashboard and the mobile app. Specifically,
 while the Band 2 does track second-to-second heart rate during exercises (like the FitBit does all day, another, separate, issue with the Band 2 - see below), it does not actually let you access that information - it simply plots it on a graph and gives you
 a few statistics like max heart rate, average heart rate, finishing heart rate, etc (see screenshot 1). One of the things that makes the FitBit dashboard so powerful is that you can actually track along each minute and see what your heart rate was during that
 minute (see screenshot 2). For me personally this is very useful, because I use this information to compare workouts afterwards on a spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other random thoughts/comparisons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Continuous" heart rate tracking</strong>.&nbsp;Both FitBit and the Band 2 claim to track your heart rate continuously throughout the day, but only the FitBit actually does this. The Band takes your heart rate once ever 10 minutes, and therefore by definition
 going to miss things that occur during your day. This isn't the worst thing in the world, but I do have to say, it is kindof cool to be able to look back on the heart rate graph of my day on the FitBit Dashboard and see how high my heart rate got exactly when
 I climbed those 10 flights of stairs (See screenshot 3). Or conversely, to find out within 5 minutes what time of the day that was that I climbed those 10 flights of stairs. The reality is that when you check your heart rate once every 10 minutes instead of
 truly continuously, you lose a lot of this resolution (See screenshot 4). &nbsp;Again, notice that you can't trace over the chart like you can on the FitBit dashboard and find your heart rate at every specific point in the day. Obviously the reason for the decreased
 "continuous" heart rate resolution on the Microsoft Band is for the purposes of energy conservation, to power the screen and all the other amazing smart features - I am just pointing out the trade-off. It is also worth noting that the Band does switch into
 true continuous heart rate tracking mode during exercise, just not during the rest of the day.</li><li><strong>The FitBit app</strong>. It is just much more refined than the Microsoft Health app for a few reasons:
<ol>
<li>Truly real time information. The FitBit app, when connected to the FitBit itself, will show your steps/calories/heart rate changing in real time (see screenshot 5). Meaning, when you pull out your phone on a run, you can see your heart rate on there, and
 your steps and calories going up in real time. In contrast, the Microsoft Health app syncs once when you open it, and does not show real time information gathered from the band.</li><li>Data density within one screen. There is much more information presented in the home screen of the FitBit app than the Microsoft Health app as per screenshots 5 and 6 below.</li><li>Data presentation. I was too lazy to take many more screenshots, but when you dig deeper and click on each of the numbers in the FitBit app, everything is presented beautifully, in a slightly more refined manner than the Microsoft Band.</li><li>Social connections. One of the areas that FitBit really excels is in the social aspect of fitness. The app and online dashboard enable you to friend other FitBit people, join activity groups and be ranked against them on your stats, have "competitions"
 of various types with up to 10 people in each. There really is no corollary within the Microsoft Health app or dashboard.</li></ol>
</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>. Obviously Band seeks to do more than the FitBit, but it is a major consideration that the battery life of the Band is 2 days, compared to 5 days for the ChargeHR (despite the true heart rate monitoring).</li><li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. Obviously the Band 2 tries to accomplish more in the way of sensors and therefore requires more weight and real estate, but I think some of this is probably superfluous... personally I do not find much utility in a UV sensor
 and would have opted for a version without whatever bulk is added by it. I would have appreciated a more subtle outward facing clasp area, something more akin to what the FitBit has.</li><li><strong>Feel.</strong>&nbsp;I can hardly tell that my FitBit is on my wrist. It is light, slim, and extremely flexible.&nbsp;The band feels sortof like a handcuff - not even close to as flexible and natural feeling as the FitBit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Barometer</strong>. Both the Band and the FitBit have barometers, allegedly so that you can track floors climbed. For some reason I have not been able to determine, neither lets you access the actual data from the barometer - it would be great to
 see calculated altitude based on air pressure as a tile.</li><li><strong>Music control</strong>. For some strange reason there is no built-in music control feature on the Band, something I assumed would be present. There are third party applications that can do this, but they are a little rough around the edges and it
 would be nice to see Microsoft come out with a more refined version.</li></ol>
<p>All of that said, I would be willing to settle for the Microsoft Band 2 - if they would just invest some more time developing their app and dashboard experience. Very curious to see what the next few updates to the app/band firmware will bring,
 but unfortunately I have to make a decision on whether I'll switch from my FitBit to the Band 2 within the return period of 30 days :)</p>

            Agreed!&nbsp; Considering Microsoft is, at its core, a software company, you would think that they would have the best software available for this type of watch.&nbsp; Incredibly, they don't.&nbsp; The hardware of the Band 2 is superior to other products out there--but
 what good is it if you can't pull the data and/or analyze the data?

</p><p>I use the Basis Peak, and would naturally like some of the competitors features added to it. As an engineer I like data, but equally health and fitness I love data, benchmarking and progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the Basis Peak app/smartwatch be added as a data source to Microsoft Health ? as that would be great :-)</p>

<h2>            Windows Outlook &#40;MAPIHTTP&#41; vs Mac Outlook &#40;EWS&#41; clients</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Outlook client uses MAPIHTTP protocol to send and receive the mails where as Mac Outlook client is using EWS protocol. Is there anyway to instruct Windows Outlook client not to use MAPIHTTP and make use of EWS just like Mac Outlook client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I have gone through following link, disabled mapi and set the parameter
<em>EwsAllowOutlook to true</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb125264(v=exchg.160).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both at organization level and user level but outlook client on windows continued to use MAPIHTTP. Can any one suggest if it is feasible to do this.

            Hi Ravi,<br />
<br />
It is not feasible to do this.&nbsp; The Outlook for Windows only uses POP, IMAP or MAPI protocol to connect to Exchange servers. Although there is EWS protocol in Windows too,&nbsp; it is only used for Skype for Business, calendar, people etc.<br />
About the cmdlets in the article you mentioned above,&nbsp; according to their description,&nbsp; they are just the settings of accounts instead of clients.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Andy <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 changing password credentials</h2>
                    <p>Strangest thing...., I attempted to log into my router, but when the logon screen opened, windows had inserted my Microsoft user account name in the "name" field.&nbsp; I corrected the "error", entering the right user name, and selected the "remember my credentials"
 block.&nbsp; The router opened, I did what I had to do, and closed my router.&nbsp; Then just to insure the changes had been saved, I attempted to re-open the router.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To my surprise, Windows 10 had changed the user name back to my Microsoft account name again!&nbsp;
</span>I made two more attempts at changing, even turning off "syncing", but to no avail.
</p>
<p>At this time, I have to change the user name every time I want to access my router.&nbsp; It has become rather irritating, and I was wondering if anyone has a "fix"?&nbsp; I'am using "build 14332_RSL&nbsp;,release . 160422-1940.</p>

<h2>            Comment Balloons in One Note&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know if there is a feature in OneNote where you can have a comment balloon with an arrow that points to a section of text that you wish to write a note about.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied parts of legislation in to my onenote notebook and would like to make comments that are boxes, cloud shapes, square shapes, circle shapes that point to specific pieces of what I'm learning where I can make notes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />Do you know what version of Skype you are using?
<br />
<br />You could try this Skype Classic version:

<h2>            Internet Explorer Opens and Closes Immediately on Win 8 Tablet</h2>
                    <p>I just received a "Refurbished" (by Dell) Dell Venue 8 Pro Tablet with Windows 8.1 (32 bit)&nbsp;installed today. I have been working all day to install the various updates and even did a BIOS update to version A05. Now, when I attempt to open Internet Explorer
 (which I assume is version 11), a blank box opens and immediately closes ... no error message at all. Please note that IE did open earlier today, but I was busy doing all the installs and didn't attempt to open it again until about an hour ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have attempted to repair the problem is to go to Internet&nbsp;Options in the Control Panel, to the Advanced Tab, and then to "Reset" the browser. That did not work!</p>

            <p>Amazingly, I did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I must give Dell some praise.&nbsp; I live in a rural community in Southern California. Their repair center is (apparently) in Fort Worth, Texas. So getting the repair sent via FedEx (overnight),&nbsp;done and back via FedEx (also overnight)&nbsp;in less than 4 days was
 fantastic. I'm not sure many other companies would have done this for me so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The repair, itself, I do not believe was difficult or took a long time. They simply had to wipe the drive or replace the drive, and&nbsp;reinstall the operating system and Dells proprietary software. That was not a difficult or time consuming task, but I had
 no way to do it here, or I would have done it myself. Using the Windows 8.1 software to reset or reinstall the OS was not possible (according to the machine). Apparently the OS was corrupted such that it could not have been done. But Dell knows how to wipe
 the drive and reinstall as that was what they evidently did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive arrived just after noon on Friday and by Friday evening, I had added all the software I wished to add to the machine. It works well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. To Undo an activity, please press and hold <strong>Ctrl </strong>key and press
<strong>Z.</strong></p>
<p>2. To Redo an activity, please press and hold <strong>Ctrl </strong>key and press
<strong>Y.</strong></p>

<h2>            Issue with Edge and IE on the new Win10</h2>
                    <p>Our company environment uses Chrome as a primary browser but have also always used IE when needed. We have recently begun upgrading our client PC's with Windows 10. &nbsp;Recently we had an issue with a third party site that can not be viewed at the moment using
 Chrome or Firefox. &nbsp;I attempted to use the Edge or IE to view our third party site but I am unable to even open either. As soon as I try to execute either from the start menu I get a message that states "You'll need a new APP to open this WinRT" &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I am unable to find any resolutions to this specific issue.</p>

Restarting the system was the first thing I did, to no avail. My Edge and IE worked originally after the upgrade but somewhere along the way last week something has glitched. I am definitely not going to revert back to another OS so I can reload Windows 10
 to see if that fixes/repairs the glitch either.

<h2>            Doing a clean install and reinstalling backups</h2>
                    <p>If you know that you may be having to do a clean install of Windows 10 and have a bunch of programs that you downloaded the best backup you can do is to not erase anything in the Download folder. and then copy that folder along with your data files to your
 backup.</p>
<p>Reason;&nbsp; Downloaded programs do not put all of the information into Program Files.&nbsp; Some of the parts of the installation, usually a .dll file, are installed in the Windows/System32 folder.&nbsp; These are not usually included in a normal backup.</p>
<p>Instead of copying the programs to the clean install you can reinstall from the Download folder and get every thing in the right place.</p>

<h2>            &#34;ie 11 critical update&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>I just started getting this message, I believe (based on the related text) is from
<strong>usertogo.com.</strong></p>
<p>I ran <strong>MS malware scan </strong>and it couldn't find any.</p>
<p>I phoned MS tech support, since this is a "higher level issue", for $149/yr they will "cure my problem"...and provide support for a year.</p>
<p>[Reminds me of calls one gets from India&lt;g&gt;]</p>
<p>I checked all my settings in IE 11, but nothing "odd".</p>
<p>I doubt I'm the only one effected...is there&nbsp;a (free?) cure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE TO MY POST:</p>
<p>It should be updatergo.com</p>
<p>the full message is:</p>
<p><em>Ie 11 User: Critical Software May Be Out </em><em>Of Date</em></p>

<p>Puh, you did a lot already. Therefore, please, remove the SIM – in that SIM try your Product Code (059…) should be mentioned. Furthermore, please, double-check the error code. Normally those are 8 digits, yours is 7 digits – and I do not find it mentioned

            The latest Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO available at this time is build 16296. You could download that that, perform a repair upgrade from your current build, then try upgrading to build 16299.15 through Windows Update.

Which build is currently installed on your computer?

    <title>Strange Behavior- Retention Policies within In-Place Archive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Behavior- Retention Policies within In-Place Archive</h2>
                    
<p>We've recently set up an retention policy company wide. We are now moving to importing emails from PST to In-Place Archive. Prior to this we are testing the retention policy within that archive. While it looks like the policy has taken effect (Managed Folder
 Assistant was pushed to the main mailbox), the emails themselves are still in the system, despite having a status of 'Expired' within the system, with the correct date it would have been removed.</p>

<p>hi michael,</p>
<p>to narrow down the issue, i’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;what are the detailed steps you set the retention policy in your place-archive?
<br />
2.&nbsp;which tag are you using? is it a default policy tag, retention policy tag or personal tag?<br />
3.&nbsp;how many days have you set for the retention policy?</p>
<p>you can use windows powershell to check whether the retention policy has been applied. the detailed steps are:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;mspperror=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online powershell</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;run the cmdlet <strong>get-mailbox &lt;identity&gt; | fl retentionpolicy</strong>.<br />
this will show the name of the currently used retention policy. please verify if it is the one you just created for archiving.</p>
<p>also, please upload a screenshot about the mails having status of expired and keeping in the system. to upload a screenshot: click “use rich formatting”&gt; “insert media”.</p>

<p>1.</p>
<p>a. we have created a retention policy for the entire mailbox, which deletes emails after 14 months (427 days), with two additional tags which are used to make sure notes and tasks are not deleted.</p>
<p>b. after it was ran, we forced it to immediately apply by using start-managedfolderassistant</p>
<p>c. we confirmed that the policy was applied using the powershell command you stated above, and it is applied.</p>
<p>screenshot attached.</p>
<p>strangely, the policy seems to work normally within the main mailbox. this is only occurring within the in-place archive.

<p>hi michael，</p>
<p>i understand that you create a retention policy consisting of a default policy tag(dpt) to delete emails&nbsp;which&nbsp; have existed for 14 months since you received them. it works properly for your main mailbox but doesn’t apply to in-place archive. i have tested
 with an office 365 account in outlook web app. emails in both main mailbox and archive are handled by the policy and deleted as the tag indicates. to investigate the cause, i’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;does the issue occur to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook web app</a>(owa), the outlook client or both?<br />
2.&nbsp;are you in a pure online environment? if not, is the mailbox in your on-prem server or office 365?<br />
3.&nbsp;a screenshot of the detailed tags in this retention policy.<br />
4.&nbsp;check in owa to see if the retention policy has been applied to in-place archive.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7ebc94ce-c9b9-4ae4-bd5f-b7df6781760e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7ebc94ce-c9b9-4ae4-bd5f-b7df6781760e" /></a><br />
5.&nbsp;the receiving time of the emails you imported.<br />
6.&nbsp;does the issue occur to any other users in your organization?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
chris</p>

<p>as the in-place archive is set within exchange online without any sort of cache, i would assume so. going into owa i confirm it, and the same email in owa shows "expiring in 0 days".</p>
<p>my outlook is cached, and comes from office 365.</p>
<p>the policy is applied to both in-place archive and main mailbox, confirmed in outlook, owa, and powershell.</p>
<p>i cannot say whether this is happening to others as i am the pilot to confirm that this won't happen to others.
</p>
<p>the received time varies depending on when the email was actually received, but for the examples i'm provided the reception time was in 2011. confirmed both on the email itself as well as within the internet headers. all time stamps show as 2011 including
 originalarrivaltime, and both "received" headers. </p>
<p>attached are screenshots of the tags within the policy</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Base on your description, the retention policy has been applied to the mailbox but not worked properly. To narrow down the issue, I need to confirm the following points:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur to all emails no matter whether&nbsp;they are&nbsp;imported or received by the mailbox?</p>
<p>2. Where&nbsp;were the imported emails originally received?</p>
<p>3. How do you import the emails? Do you achieve it in the Outlook client by clicking File-&gt;Open &amp;Export-&gt;Import/Export?</p>
<p>4. Remove and recreate the retention policy. Apply it again to check if it works.</p>
<p>5. Apply the retention policy to another&nbsp;test account to check if the issue relates to the account.</p>
<p>6. Create another retention policy (i.e. with tags applied to a&nbsp;single folder to delete emails after 1 day)to check if it works.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>1. It seems to be happening to imported emails, not necessarily emails received by the mailbox.</p>
<p>2. The imported emails were originally received within the main mailbox. In-Place Archiving was not in use at that time, so they were actually sent from the main mailbox to PST to the in-place archive</p>
<p>3. We use both import/export as well as software to import the messages. Both types remain.</p>
<p>4. Tried this before reaching out here.</p>
<p>5. It is happening across multiple accounts which have the policy</p>
<p>6. It does not.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on the information so far, there are two potential causes:<br />
1.&nbsp;The whole Retention Policy service for your organization has crashed down.<br />
2.&nbsp;The imported emails invalidate the Retention Policy. </p>
<p>Could you provide a .pst file with some unimportant emails as a test sample? We will check if we can reproduce the issue.
</p>
<p>I have created a workspace for you to collect the .pst file. I have sent you a private message about detailed steps of accessing the workspace.</p>
<p>To see the private message, please perform the following steps:<br />
1. Please go to "Your details" section on the right side of the community site.<br />
2. Click Private messages.<br />
3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris<br />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I have created a same retention policy&nbsp;as yours and tested with the .pst file you provided. I’d like to share the test results with you:</p>
<p>1. I imported the emails to the primary mailbox. The retention policy took effects. The mails were deleted.</p>
<p>2. I imported the emails to Archive mailbox. Make sure the retention policy had been applied to Archive mailbox. The mails still existed in Archive mailbox with a status of “Expires 12/19/2016” (14 months after import).</p>
<p>3. I imported the emails to the primary mailbox and moved them to Archive mailbox manually. The retention policy took effects. The mails were deleted.</p>
<p>I also tested with other .pst files of my own. As test results show, the retention age of the mails imported to Archive mailbox is calculated based on the import date.</p>
<p>Regarding your issues:</p>
<p>1. Emails show “Expiring in 0 days” in OWA and “expiration suspended” in the Outlook client.</p>
<p>2. The retention policy doesn’t take effect as the mails reach retention age.</p>
<p>I will do some further consulting. If there are any updates, I will post&nbsp;them here.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            Sync Outlook 2010 with Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    I want to sync my Calendar and Tasks between the Outlook 2010 on my PC and my HTC 8X.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please note:</div>
<div>1. I don't mind having a two way sync, via my Microsoft account or www.outlook.com</div>
<div>2. The Hotmail Calendar link only mentions that I can access my content from outlook.com on Outlook 2010, whereas I want it vice versa.</div>
<div>3. outlook.com is NOT my primary account. I'll use it if that is what it takes to sync phone to pc (pc &gt; outlook.com &gt; phone).</div>
<div>4. I don't use MS Exchange. I use POP/IMAP.</div>

            You could do it with a macro in the normal template e.g. as follows, which will use the signature associated with the active e-mail account. Note that this macro uses early binding to the Outlook object library so you will need to set a reference to that
 library in the vba editor - tools &gt; references - see<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm

<span>I am trying to run a simple macro, which inserts a footnote into a Word document.
 Each time I try this a VBA 4605:v error results. The VBA editor opens and shows me the error code. I am not a programmer, so this is useless to me. The code hinges around an end of document location that MS Word cannot find. Has anyone run across this before?
 I can doing all of this on a Mac and NOT Windows.</span><br />

            By deleting the periods, you've changed the command to variable assignments. For instance, you've told Word to create a variable named "Location" and assign it the value "wdEndOfDocument." Thus, those statements no longer do what they were intended for.
<div><br />
<div>But that is good, because it means that your effective code is really these three lines:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sub Macro1()</div>
<div><span>Selection.Endnotes.Add Range:=Selection.Range</span></div>
<div><span>End Sub</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>And that is what you should be using. With the other parameters, you were telling Word to repeat a lot of stuff that you need to specify only once for the document (by selecting
<i>Insert &gt; Footnote,&nbsp;</i>defining the parameters, then <i>Apply</i>):</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Treat them as endnotes, not footnotes</span></li><li><span>Continue numbering from previous endnote, if any</span></li><li><span>Number the first Endnote as "1"&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Use Roman numerals</span></li><li><span>Don't use any special reference symbol (like * or †)</span></li></ul>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that the "Start" button on the keyboard is not working. We will help you to resolve this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">First, I would suggest you to manually check if these keys are struck or if anything struck in between the keys which could prevent the key from functioning properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If its an external keyboard then I&nbsp;suggest you to connect the keyboard to a different computer and check if the Start button is working. If the button is not working with a different computer also then it must be a hardware issue and I suggest you to contact
 the keyboard manufacturer for further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the keyboard works fine with a different computer then you might be facing this issue due to corrupt\outdated driver. So I suggest you to logon to the keyboard manufacturer website and install the latest driver for the device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Un-install and re-install keyboard drivers from the manufacturer’s website and see if that helps:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <span><strong>“Windows Key + W”</strong> from the keyboard.<br />
b. Type <strong>“device Manager</strong>” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Right click on the keyboard drivers and select <strong>“Uninstall”.</strong><br />
d. Restart the computer once it is uninstalled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Before uninstalling the driver, please make sure that you have downloaded the latest driver for the keyboard device from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps.</span></p>
