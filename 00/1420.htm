            Why do you want a video editor on a phone? I mean, considering the processing capabilities of a phone, it might just ruin the video in post processing. Edit a video on a PC!

<p>because i'm a short film maker i love to edit videos on mobile phone itself.</p>
<p>if your view is correct</p>
<p>why all the nokia symbian 5 and symbian 3 devices are having video editor in them</p>
<p>i mean starting from 5233-nokia n8</p>
<p>i used to shoot my films on 5800 itself</p>
<p>i've made around 15 short films on my 5800</p>

            Not all of them have video editors, and I have tried them, and they're all bad IMHO and barely have enough useful features. If you really want one, you can always search for an app in Ovi Store.<br />
<br />
It may be because I've always used nice video editing and processing software like Sony Vegas Pro and PowerDirector on my laptop.

    <title>Bluetooth issues in WIndows 10 10586 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth issues in WIndows 10 10586</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:10586, Bluetooth and networking</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I ask if anyone else has tried this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>My W10 machine is logged on&nbsp;as a local user on a Workgroup where all machines share the same username.
</p>
<p>All machines could see each other and shared files moved as needed. I am fairly certain this worked fine on build 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine was updated to 10586 and very soon after, I had to use Bluetooth to connect to a sender in a vehicle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time, the machine can see all the network printers, but only itself and one other machine. It may be coincidence, but that other machine, running Windows 7, also has a Bluetooth capability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning off Bluetooth in each machine, and tried every test that I know of, but I can't get this machine to connect normally to most other machines. I am pretty certain that the contact with the other machine is via network (wifi) and not Bluetooth
 networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There does seem to be a problem with the W10 BT system, where BT can be switched off in either Settings or in Control Panel.&nbsp; Switching BT off in Settings causes an unidentified error in Properties in CP.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you see any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>This issue might arise due to outdated Bluetooth drivers. I suggest you to download and install the latest Bluetooth drivers
 from your computer manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />

            <p>This is a Lenovo X201 laptop. Lenovo appear to have "updated" their support site so it is now much more difficult to find specific drivers, but they appear to say that the BT drivers for this machine are provided by Microsoft as part of the OS.
</p>
<p>The Bluetooth system actually works as well or badly as it always did, in that it&nbsp;seems almost impossible to specify which virtual serial port the Bluetooth to serial part of the driver will allocate. I have asked about this here before but got nowhere.
 The onboard&nbsp;BT hardware is from Broadcom, but I am reluctant to install what is described as a Widcomm driver for earlier OS's from their site, when the Bluetooth is actually usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is not a Bluetooth problem, it is a networking problem that&nbsp;appears to have&nbsp;been triggered either by the 10586 update or by a side-effect of the Bluetooth driver being used. I suspect the former.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The networking drivers were the current Lenovo ones. I have tried updating them to some later drivers from Intel, but these have made no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the command line, it appears the system can see the other machines and the dns is working. It's just that they don't appear in the File Explorer network screen. What is weird is that the network printers do appear.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Robert. That is very interesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run through the procedures listed and, unfortunately, everything is set up correctly here, but it still works in the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One further detail - I've now fired up a second W10 test machine running 10586 and it appears on the first machine's list of network contacts. It also behaves exactly the same as the other W10 machine, seeing just these (now 3) visible machines and the printers,
 but not the other networked machines. It has never had Bluetooth, so I think that rules that out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked from it and can ping the other machines by name, but file explorer can't see them.</p>

<h2>            MSN.com&#47;Outlook.com email issue</h2>
                    <p>Sorry; not sure if this is the correct Forum; if not, please advise....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a Microsoft msn Email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this MSN by going to MSN.com website and clicking on the Outlook.com Menu item...and see/send emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a NEW email account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (don't think Microsoft lets you create a new email using @msn.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to MSN.com signed into my newly created *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; the new outlook email opened just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for doing this, my old @msn acct get so much spam (and I tried using all Filters).....I intend to eventually Close the @msn email and leave just the @outlook email open. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue right now, with the @outlook.com email open....I clicked on add email to sync ....meaning, when signed into @outlook.com email added the @msn.com email both emails would come into the Inbox of @outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I add @msn....and I tried using IMAP and POP....I get it cannot connect. &nbsp;I am using the correct ID/Password for MSN.com...I signed into that acct using a New window..... &nbsp;I even tried filling out the InComing and Outing going server information manually...I
 get cannot connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since, I think, msn and outlook are the same server...there must be an easy way....to 1)open at MSN.com click on Outlook.com sign into the New @outlook.com email.....and...also get the @msn.com mail. &nbsp;In otherwords one signon fetches mail from @outlook.com
 and msn.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some easy way to accomplish this?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Internet speed</h2>
                    Does Microsoft programs on high speed Internet? If the answer is Yes, then we don't have a fast Internet access if no right enjoy rapid technical development of Microsoft. Often Windows updates take our time a lot and often fail to update operations in
 10%.<br />
Why don't developers divide those updates on multiple files and then be assembled automatically on your computer

    <title>How to embed an online video without a Microsoft account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamie pringle  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to embed an online video without a Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I am wondering if it is possible or anyone found a way to embed an online video (such as YouTube or Bing) into PowerPoint without being forced to login with a Microsoft account? I work at a University and deploy the an image out to hundreds of computers
 which are being used by students that don't have Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I attempted to disable the SkyDrive services using Office 2013 Group Policy but after disabling it gave an error of "Online video not available".</div>
                </div>

            Hi Aravinda,
<div><br />
<div>My problem isn't that the YouTube videos won't play due to the embedded code formatting. The problem is when click video on the INSERT tab under Media and choose the option "Online Video" it pops up with the following message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f20f74e-6894-4d8e-8a87-527aef985a7d" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is that these computers are for students to use in computer labs at a university and we don't have Microsoft accounts. You should not need a Microsoft account to insert a non-SkyDrive video.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In PowerPoint 2013, it requires a Live account and sign in to Office in order to fetch the online video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this method seems to be broken at the moment and there is no embed option available after you sign in with the Live account.</p>
<p>We consider and value you feedback, please take some time and post your feedback by clicking on the link below:</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, you may try the add-in provided by John SR Wilson's post from my previous reply and check if that helps you to embed Youtube videos to PowerPoint 2013.</p>

<h2>            Outlook showing emails still in drafts but they are sending</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use outlook &amp; send an email/reply to an email it sits in my drafts with a line through the recipients email address, if you check the sent folder it is in there as sent yet still shows in drafts &amp; also has the highlighted red DRAFT writing next to
 the received email (if replying to a sent email)</p>
<p>Just makes it confusing to know if they are sent &amp; the draft folder keeps building for no reason. I`m not sure how I can fix this.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for your time.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you are doing well. We are currently installing the SharePoint and One Drive for Business app on phones for users within our organisation. We have had success when installing on iOS devices but get the following error message when trying to install
 on any of the android phones, irrespective of their connection to a mobile network and/or wifi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There's no network connection</p>
<p>Make sure you're connected to a Wi-Fi or mobile network and try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using SP 2016 on premise and have selected the "Sign in with a SharePoint Server URL" - the same details work perfectly on iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise?</p>

            <p>I too found that going back to an older version fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what else I found...</p>
<p>I shut down the PC and it again had updates ready to install. I let them install and restarted the PC and now IE was broken again! I did a search for IE no Internet access after latest security update and found that in some cases when IE installs the latest
 security update it selects a proxy server that effectively blocks program access to the Internet through IE. Since I don't use IE I never experienced any of the noted issues with my PC after the latest update. I however have a program that uses IE and thats
 when I found that I had the issue. <br />
<br />
What I did was follow these steps. Within IE I selected tools&gt;Internet options&gt;advanced tab&gt; "reset" and now it all works fine.

<p><br />
The way to compute percentage change is (new - old) / old.&nbsp; So, if Apr sales were 20 and May were 0, then you would get (0-20)/20 = -1, i.e., -100%.</p>
<p>Of course, if the old were zero, then&nbsp;the&nbsp;result is undefined (or infinite depending on your preference).</p>
<p>Deal with this with a formula along the lines of =IF(old=0,NA(),(new-old)/old) or =IF(old=0,"",(new-old)/old).</p>

            Then you've got something wrong with your formula. If the sales are DECREASING you shouldn't have a "DIV/0" message at all.

<br />
It would be helpful if you showed us the formula that is producing the #DIV/0 error.<br />
<br />
if April sales is in B2 and May sales is in B3, the percentage change (May over April) should be calculated by:<br />
<br />
=B3/B2-1<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage.<br />
<br />
In that case, you would not get a #DIV/0 error.&nbsp; I suspect you are calculating B2/B3-1, which is the percentage change of April over May, usually not the way we talk about change.<br />
<br />
However, if May is 0 and June is 15 (B4), you might want to compute the percentage change of June over May.&nbsp; Ostensibly, that would be:<br />
<br />
=B4/B3-1<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage.<br />
<br />
That <span style="font-weight: bold">will </span>produce a #DIV/0 error.&nbsp; There is no mathematically right answer in that case.&nbsp; You need to make an arbitrary decision about how to reflect change from zero.&nbsp; My choice:&nbsp; 100% with the sign of the direction of
 change.&nbsp; In that case, returning to the May-over-April formula, the general formula is:<br />
<br />
=IF(B2=0,SIGN(B3),B3/B2-1)<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage.<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; That assumes that no month will have negative sales(!).&nbsp; As strange as that might sound, it can happen (and it has).&nbsp; If you want a formula that works in that case as well, try:<br />
<br />
=IF(B2=0,SIGN(B3),(B3-B2)/ABS(B2))<br />

<p>&nbsp;- My mobile operator is Pepephone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- My region/location/language are spain/spanish international/spanish international.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- My OS version is: 8.10.14147.180</p>
<p>&nbsp;- My firmware is: 3051.40000.1349.0005</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yesterday, due another problem with the settings, which growed until 11GB and consumed all my phone space, I had to do a phone reset. After this reset and backup restore, it seems that the network is no longer detected as roaming, so it's working fine,
 now.</p>

<p>I think it can not be customised. It displays the no.stored under the detail 'Telephone'.. and if there are more than one nos. against 'Telephone' then the 1st no. in the order. But if you really want to take effort then there is a way out to show the default
 no. e.g. you want to show the mobile no. which is default to be shown then enter it against telephone and the telephone no. against mobile no. and edit the lables accordingly..but by doing so the icons will show wrongly...</p>

            Add black paragraph shading to your paragraph: Click the arrow on the last button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab, and choose Borders and Shading from the drop down. In the dialog box, click the Shading tab. Select black in the "Fill" box (and choose
 "Clear" for "Style"). Make sure that "Apply to" is set to "Paragraph," and then click OK.<br />
<br />
The <strong>font</strong> color is set to "Automatic" by default which means it will automatically change to white when you change the background, but if the color is anything else, you will have to set it to white of course (for example in the Font dialog
 box which you can display by pressing Ctrl+D).

<h2>            Pen tablet click and right click showing glitched dll</h2>
                    <p>After updating to the Fall Creators Update Release Preview 171010-1400, I jumped onto this problem with Windows: When using my Wacom Cintiq 27QHD the right clicking and tap circles were replaced by what seems like a glitched dll icon set. Disabling Windows
 Ink or reinstalling the Wacom Drivers didn't help fixing the issue. Functionally, it works as intended despite the visual artifact.</p>

<p>Heheheh :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just a trick played by few users regarding Asha 501 SW update.They are now following the same now in case of Asha 311. !&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best explanation is this way -- " A random guy posts regarding the update information(Though he doesnt know),then everyone will be checking that info and woud be thinking that update would be really available after prescribed date.(almost 80% of users
 trust this info because they just need update and not the one who posted it). And now when they realise that there is no update they start Blaming Nokia thinking that it would release update because of demand !&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----&gt; This is just similar to Asha 501 SW update demand(Ofcourse Nokia annnounced it :D )</p>
<p>-----&gt; """"""BUT FOR ASHA 311 NOKIA DIDNT ANNOUNCE ANY UPDATE SO STAY COOL GUYS :D :P """""""</p>

            That's pretty right. Announced or not, people are so known to start following the claims of anyone when the talk is about a software update.<br />
A random guy says that update will come by so and so date.. And then out of the 100 persons who'll read it,75-80 are going to copy paste it at another place. Thereby creating a big pool of false information.<br />
But in this case, he seems to be told by Nokia Care. But who knows if that Nokia Care is also like the Asha 501 page which calls itself as 'official' and everyone trusts that :p

<h2>            After Windows 10 update, Skype 12.13 useless</h2>
                    <p>After Windows 10 update, Skype 12.13 is useless because it won't notify of any incoming calls.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm logged in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Minimized all screens, incoming call notification is entirely missing even if Skype application is running.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Windows updates has broken quite a bit of stuff this time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- MS Access database engine</p>
<p>- keyboard language switching hotkeys</p>
<p>- Skype for Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for fun, it's also taking away file associations for good applications and replacing them with Microsoft applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions worth trying?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To confirm, are you receiving&nbsp;the calls? Is just that&nbsp;there is no&nbsp;visible incoming&nbsp;notification or it shows as a miscall?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised that by default, Skype for Windows 10 adapts your audio settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure that Skype notification is turned on from your device settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting&nbsp;steps, kindly follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the <strong>Start menu </strong>and click <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apps.</strong></li><li>Locate and click <strong>Skype</strong> from the <strong>Applications list</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced option.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Reset.</strong></li></ul>

Dozens wouldn't be enough though ...<br />
<br />
But Nokia went out on a limb with the 770/N800/N810 series, and have done very good with them. They really are purely for wifi (or bluetooth tethered) internet browsing and maybe some voip as well.<br />
<br />
However, there were some rumours of a possible new model with some GSM capabilities.

            Atleast me and my friends could use one device often when we are huntin, fishing or hiking, gps phone and computer are too much to<br />
carry separately... And often you are in places that there is only gsm signal to use.

<h2>            Access 2007 DLookup Field Help</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table called Companies that has 2 columns (Supplier and Contact). The Supplier is the company name and the contact is an email address for the main contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Form that contains a combo box. The combo box has a picklist for the "Company Name" that comes from the Companies table. I can click on as many as I want, but I usually only click one name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to have is a DLookup box or field within the Form to auto fill the the contact email address. For instance, if I select Company A in the combo box, the DLookup field will automatically fill in the corresponding contact email address. Is the DLookup
 field the way to go, should I use a query, etc.? Sorry, I am basic at Access, but want to cut down on some of the data entry I have to do in the form.</p>

            <p>Well... if you're trying to take the email address out of one table and store it in a different table,&nbsp;<em>don't</em>. Such information should be stored, once and once only, in the Contact table, and then looked up when you want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just want to&nbsp;<em>display</em> the email address on the form when you select a supplier, you can include the email field in the combo box's RowSource query, and display it on the form. Put a textbox on the form with a control source</p>
<p>
</p><p>=comboboxname.Column(n)</p>
<p>
</p><p>where n is the <em>zero based</em> index of the field in the rowsource; that is, if the combo cboSupplier has the email address in its third column, use</p>
<p>
</p><p>=cboSupplier.Column(2)</p>

            As you say <em>'I can click on as many as I want'</em> it sounds like you are using a
<em>multi-valued field</em>.&nbsp; If you only need to select a single supplier I'd advise that you change this to a conventional foreign key column, e.g. SupplierID, of long integer number data type. You can then use a conventional combo box set up as follows:<br />
<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cboSupplier<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SupplierID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT [CompanyID], [EmailAddress], [CompanyName] FROM [Companies] ORDER BY&nbsp; [CompanyName];<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm;0cm;8cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the first two dimensions are zero to hide the first two columns.<br />
<br />
Add a text box to the form and set its ControlSource property to:<br />
<br />
=[cboSupplier].Column(1)<br />
<br />
The Column property is zero-based, so this will show the second column, the email address.<br />
<br />
If you do need to select more than one supplier per record, then you should not have a SupplierID column in the form's underlying table (which I'll call Orders for this example, and assume it has an OrderID primary key column), but model the many-to-many relationship
 type by a third table like this:<br />
<br />
OrderSuppliers<br />
....OrderID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....SupplierID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
The primary key of this table is a composite one made up of the two foreign key columns.&nbsp; In your form you should now use a continuous subform based on the OrderSupplers table, linked on OrderID, and in it put a combo box and text box as described above in
 the subform, not the parent form.&nbsp; You can then select as few or as many suppliers as required simply by inserting a row in the subform for each.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this basic many-to-many relationship type and how to represent it in forms as StudentCoures.zip
 in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file various interfaces are illustrated, but I'd recommend the conventional form/subform, which is very easy to set up and code free.<br />

            <p>I am drawing a blank on what you did (sorry, I am not very good at Access apparently). I have attached pictures to show you what I have so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pic 1 shows the Supplier List Table</li><li>Pic 4 shows the Supplier List in design view. (both the Supplier ID and Contact have the same field properties)</li><li>Pic 2 shows the List from the Form (I do need to have the ability to pick more than one even though I dont often do it)</li><li>Pic 3 shows the Properties of the list from Pic 2</li></ul>
<p>What I need to do is add another "box" next to Suppliers to add the corresponding "contact" info. If I need to select more than 1, should I have to boxes for Supplier and two for contacts?</p>

            <p>Several problems. First, your Companies table should probably be renamed Suppliers (or, better yet, tblSuppliers). It should have three fields:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SupplierID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>SupplerName (Text)</p>
<p>ContactEMail (Text)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, what is the Recordsource of the form where you have the combobox to select the Supplier? That table should have a field: SupplierID (Number/Long Integer). That field should NOT have Lookup and should not be set to allow Multiple values. On the Form
 that Combobox should have the following properties:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name: cboSupplier</p>
<p>Controlsource: SupplierID</p>
<p>RowSource: SELECT SupplierID, SupplierName, ContactEMail FROM tblSuppliers ORDER BY Suppliername;</p>
<p>Bound Column: 1</p>
<p>Column Count: 3</p>
<p>Column Widths: 0";2";0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next you should have another textbox on the form with a ControlSource of:</p>
<p><span>=cboSupplier.Column(2)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This will display the contact E-mail for the selected supplier. It will NOT store it in the table the form is bound to,&nbsp;</span>which<span>&nbsp;is as it should be as you can pull the e-mail anytime you want
 to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might find my blog on Displaying Data from Related Tables to be helpful as it discusses this in detail.&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
<li>In the Combobox for the Supplier:
<ol>
<li>The Control Source is "Suppliers"</li><li>The RowSource is "SELECT [Suppliers].[SupplierID], [Suppliers].SupplierID FROM Suppliers ORDER BY [SupplierID]; "</li><li>The Row Source Type is "Table/Query"</li></ol>

            <p>No this will not wipe out your data. It appears that you already have An ID field in your table so all you need is to change the field names. However, you WILL have to do some updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't quite answer my questions. First, you didn't tell me the Recordsource of the form. If the ContriolSource of the combo is Suppliers, then you should have a field in that table named Suppliers. So what you need to do is ADD another field named SupplierID.
 You then need to run an Update query that joins the main table to the Suppliers table on SupplierName. it then Updates the SupplierID field in the main table with the SupplierID value from the Suppliers table. Once you have done that and verified it, you can
 change the ControlSource of the combo to the SupplierID field and change the other properties as I indicated.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>(I do need to have the ability to pick more than one even though I dont often do it)</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have a many-to-many relationship type between whatever table your form is based on and the suppliers table, which you will need to model by a third table which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; The model for
 my StudentCourses demo, to which I referred you earlier is as below and illustrates this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae26f27b-8192-4720-acbd-dce30b6890b5" /><br />
<br />
In my case the Courses table, which is analogous to your table of suppliers, includes only the one non-key column, CourseName, so the combo box in the subform has only this single non-key column in its RowSource in addition to the CourseID primary key column.&nbsp;
 In your case your equivalent suppliers table would also have the email column, so this would also be included in the combo box's RowSource and would be referenced via its Column property in an unbound text box in the subform in the way Scott and I have described.&nbsp;
 The unbound text box will show the email of the selected supplier.<br />

            <p>Sorry guys, I am completely lost with this. I think I may need to start from scratch with all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain how I should set up a Supplier Table and than how I can add two fields to my table? One field for the Supplier, the other for the contact info?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe I missed it somewhere in this thread? Sorry, I am just not getting this and I know it must be very frustrating for both of you to help me. I do really appreciate any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I need to go back to an Access 101 class and start from scratch to learn basic programming.</p>

<h2>            How can I use max, min etc using a named range</h2>
                    
<p>I have a table with a named range.</p>
<p>I collumn named 'slippage'.&nbsp; But if I enter max(slippage) i get 0 as some of the cells in the range are empty.&nbsp; The range is linked to an access query so I cant use a1:axx as this will vary.</p>
<p>ANy ideas?</p>

<p>Slippage is defined as whole column 'Sheet1!$I:$I', but doesnt work unless I put values directly in to formulae as you suggest?</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Your numbers might not be numeric numbers, they may be TEXT numbers which are different.</p>
<p>What result do you get with this formula:</p>
<p>=COUNT(slippage)</p>
<p>If you get a result of 0 then there are NO numeric numbers in the named range.</p>
<p>See this for methods to convert TEXT numbers to NUMERIC numbers:</p>
