            Yes I&nbsp; do have Microsoft Office installed.&nbsp; I have found a way to open these attachments by saving them in my documents file and then going into properties and changing how they are opened.&nbsp; I have to do this each time I received a doc or .xls which I
 never used to have to do before.&nbsp; If I recognised and knew an attachment was being sent I could always open them direct from my email inbox.

<h3> neon hawk98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Updating Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I install my games offline cause i have the same problem with it getting stuck at 0% whilst online, but if i want to play multiplayer i have to update the game, but it always gets stuck at 96-98%. The percentage went up from 96 to 97 percent within 10 min
 while updating ghosts but got stuck at 97% after that. I really hope the case is that the percent it gets stuck at is it actually downloading the update, next I'm going to try to leave it for an hour or two to see if it ever even goes up in percent by at least
 1....... Microsoft better fix this soon!</p>

            <p>Are you deleting the game file before attempting to re install. If even appears to be stuck you should just give it time. I think your next step you said you will take is a wise one. Just first locate that game tile "ghosts" on your dash board press the menu button on🎮 and choose to delete that whole game. </p>
<p>Now install while being extra patient on apparent stuck sections</p>

    <title>Just replaced printer, set all users to use network printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Just replaced printer, set all users to use network printer</h2>
                    /*&nbsp; Background information<br />
I have a setup with an aging 98SE/XP desktop that has served as a print server for over a decade, a Windows Vista Home Premium/Windows 7 Professional computer, and an XP Professional laptop that sadly is more capable than the XP desktop. The computers with
 two OSes listed are dual-boots, but I mostly ignore the older OSes these days except for when I'm helping one relative who is still using Vista.<br />
<br />
I just replaced my HP DeskJet 812C with a cheap HP DeskJet 1000 since it costs less to buy a new printer complete with cartridges than it does to buy a new black cartridge for the 812C, let alone a color cartridge and 15 years of technology advancement means
 the 1000 is probably just as good as the 812c.<br />
<br />
I've set up the 1000 as a network share on the XP machine, installed both 32-bit and 64-bit drivers, and successfully got the Windows 7 Admin account to print with it.<br />
&nbsp;** End Background Information */<br />
<br />
// Actual Question starts here<br />
Now the question is, how can I set it as <b><u>the default printer for all users and also set it to use only black and white by default</u></b>?<br />
<br />
I know how to configure that for a single user, but one of the other users here is not very computer literate and not only would have problems remembering how to connect to a network printer, but would waste lots of color ink since she wouldn't know how to
 alter the printing preferences. I'd like to use my Admin privliges and set it for everyone if possible. It was so much simpler when I was using Windows 98SE and installed the DeskJet 812c I'm now replacing.<br />
<br />
I know it's possible to push this kind of thing with a domain, but I'm on a workgroup. Is there any way to set up a default printer for all users on a Windows 7 Professional system?<br />

            Generally on a support forum, you shouldn't hijack somebody else's thread to ask an unrelated question even if it is somewhat similar. Asking a related question is SOMETIMES acceptable, but this one is not related.<br />
<br />
That said, generally with HP printers, you have to either use the CD that came with the printer or download the driver's installer from the
<a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP driver download website</a>.<br />
They don't usually distribute drivers in a from the "have disk" option will accept because they like to bundle other junk with their printer drivers.<br />
<br />
With older HP printers that were out for <b>at least a year</b> before whatever version of Windows you are using was released (or sometimes a year before the service pack included on the installer was released) you might be able to let Windows handle installing
 things, but with most current printers you need to download the drivers.<br />
<br />
I do see an "HP OfficeJet J4500 Series" on the Windows 7 list however. I have no specific knowledge of this driver or the model of printer, so I'm unsure if it is the same all-in-one.<br />
<br />
That said, my experience using the built-in drivers even when they are present is that you generally only get the most basic functions and you may not be able to use all the features of your all-in-one with just Microsoft's drivers. You may only be able to
 print with the most basic print functions.<br />
<br />
If you wish to try the Microsoft "HP OfficeJet J4500 Series" driver, follow these instructions below. However, you are better off downloading
<a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-search.html?tab=1#/qryterm=OfficeJet%204500&amp;searchtype=s-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP's drivers for your specific model from here.</a><br />
http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-search.html?tab=1#/qryterm=OfficeJet%204500&amp;searchtype=s-002<br />
<br />
I'm unsure if the following instructions will let you do anything but print, since I've never installed an all-in-one printer using this method. I've always used the CD that came with the printer.<br />
To try the Microsoft Drivers<br />
<ol>
<li>Log in with an administrator account.</li><li>Go to Start-&gt;device and printers</li><li>Click on "Add a printer"&nbsp;</li><li>Click "add a local printer"</li><li>Click the button for "use an existing port" (should already be selected), and choose either LPT1 or something that starts with USB depending on if it is a parallel printer (big wide connector) or USB (small rectangular connector with cropped corners on
 one side that is the same as a flash drive on the end that goes into the computer, a smaller squarish connector with the same cropped corners on the other that goes into the printer) respectively.</li><li>click next</li><li>In the next screen, in the left pane under "manufacturer" find "HP" and click on it. See step 8 before clicking next.</li><li>In the right pane, scroll down until you find the appropriate model, in your case "HP OfficeJet J4500 series" (I hope). It's in alphabetical order, and to the computer letters come after numbers, so the HP OfficeJets without the J in front will come first.</li><li>Click next.</li><li>Enter in a name for the printer or keep the default and click next.</li><li>Wait. Then answer the question on if you want to share the printer.</li><li>Click next, and do a test page. If the test page works, then click finished. Otherwise cancel and<a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> go download the drivers from HP</a>.<br />
</li></ol>
<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I keep harping on downloading the drivers from HP, but with all-in-ones that aren't automatically being correctly recognized, that is usually the correct solution 99.999998% of the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you aren't using Windows 7, you really should have created your own thread instead of hijacking this one. I can rewrite the instructions for Vista, XP, or even 2000 (I could do ME, 98, 95, or NT, but it's doubtful you would have the drivers built-in,
 and I don't recall off-hand what the most generic OfficeJet was similar to the way the HP DeskJet 600 driver works with almost any DeskJet made in the last 15 years if you just want to print B&amp;W text).

<h2>            Multiple Blue screens with windows 10, also kernal 41 error &#40;63&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built a desktop recently, and it seemed to be ok</p>
<p>Then randomly I get a lot of blue screens</p>
<p>The ones I have seen so far have been</p>
<p>bad pool caller, ntfs.sys</p>
<p>faulty hardware corrupted page ( I get a lot of these)</p>
<p>memory management</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The desktop specs are as follows</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Gigabyte GA-Z270P-D3 7/6th Generation Motherboard </li><li>Intel Core i7-7700K 4.2 GHz QuadCore 8MB Cache Processor</li><li>Corsair CMU16GX4M2C3000C15 Vengeance LED 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 3000MHz C15 XMP 2.0 Enthusiast LED Illuminated Memory Kit&nbsp;</li><li>Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB 2.5 inch Solid State Drive</li><li>ASUS NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB DUAL OC&nbsp;</li><li>Asus Xonar DGX 5.1 Sound Card&nbsp;</li><li>Corsair Hydro Series H55 High Performance All-in-One Liquid CPU Cooler</li><li>EVGA 650 GQ, 80+ GOLD 650W, Semi Modular, EVGA ECO Mode, 5 Year Warranty, Power Supply 210-GQ-0650-V3&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also if its worth noting I am in Spain, using an adaptor for the UK to European plug</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a cheaper psu, it was making strange buzzing noises so I replaced it to the one above</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran programs like driver booster etc to see if the drivers are out of date</p>
<p>I have updated the bios version, and manually downloaded any drivers I could find</p>
<p>I ran memory checks, no issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>The parts I bought from amazon, so if I need to replace one, then I have 1 week to do it</p>
<p>Please help here, I dont know what to do</p>
<p />

<p>Driver update websites can offer drivers that are different than computer manufacturer supported drivers.</p>
<p>You don't know what you are getting.</p>
<p>And these drivers may then cause BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall all drivers installed from the driver software websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an administrative command prompt command that will automatically create files on the desktop for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>The files will include:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, hosts, installed, uninstalled, drivers, services, event viewer, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the files appear on the desktop please use one drive to post them into the thread for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy and paste this whole command at one time into administrative command prompt for the file to appear on the desktop:</p>
<p>

<p>1) Uninstall all drivers installed from websites that offer driver update services as you don't know what you are getting.</p>
<p>2) Always use computer manufacturer websites for drivers as they have been tailored to the computer environment.</p>
<p>3) If computer manufacturer drivers are unavailable then use component manufacturer websites.</p>
<p>4) Again to reduce the incidence of BSOD only use drivers from either the computer manufacturer or the component manufacturer.</p>
<p>5) This is an administrative command prompt command to generate files on the destop.</p>
<p>It will collect:&nbsp; Msinfo32, dxdiag, drivers, hosts, installed, uninstalled, event viewer, mini dumps, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the whole command and paste into administrative command prompt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there were no mini dump files to debug.</p>
<p>Problematic RAM is high on the list.</p>
<p>The drive has file structure corruption.</p>
<p>There were problems with hibernation and fast startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important that you follow all of the steps and report your progress using the number of the step so that we can follow and comment about the test.&nbsp; Posting test results to verify them is required.&nbsp; Posting images are best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The logs indicated:</p>
<p>109&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Critical structure corruption</p>
<p>C2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bad pool caller</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>1) Open file explorer to locate the Memory dump file and post it into the thread:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use a smart phone camera to take pictures and post images into the thread for all test results.</p>
<p>If you have problems posting images into the thread please use one drive share links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp;powercfg.exe /hibernate off</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) chkdsk /x /f /r</p>
<p>Plan to allow this command to run for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) find the results of the chkdsk command in the event viewer</p>
<p>filter windows logs &gt; applications &gt; for chkdsk and wininit to find results</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Run HD Tune or Samsung magician (whichever is applicable) to test the drive.</p>
<p>Post results of Health (SMART), benchmark, and error scan into the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.hdtune.com/</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>9)Check to make sure that you are not running any cleaning software such as Ccleaner.</p>
<p>For disk cleanup make sure that you are not cleaning needed dump files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Run Memtest86+</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.memtest.org/</p>
<p>http://www.memtest.org/</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 16 GB of RAM this will take approximately 24 hours</p>
<p>It must run at least 8 passes.</p>
<p>If there is 1 error you can abort the testing.</p>
<p>Make sure you post a picture into the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) Open device manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>click view &gt; show hidden devices</p>
<p>expand all rows and look for yellow triangles</p>
<p>Post images into the thread for any devices with yellow triangles</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These were some of the problems noted on the computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dump file creation failed due to error during dump creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corruption was discovered in the file system structure on volume C:.<br />
A corruption was found in a file system index structure.&nbsp; The file reference number is 0x1000000015769.&nbsp; The name of the file is "\ProgramData\NVIDIA".&nbsp; The corrupted index attribute is ":$I30:$INDEX_ALLOCATION".&nbsp; The corrupted index block is located at Vcn

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>thank you for your time and effort here, the means a lot to me, I need this computer working to make a living</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for 1- here are the two memory dumps from the 2 crashes I had today since I started these tasks</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqpDnapoaGE0cUwlqSVamnlltGs</p>

Checking file system on C:<br />
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of your disks needs to be checked for consistency. You<br />
may cancel the disk check, but it is strongly recommended<br />
that you continue.<br />
Windows will now check the disk.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>For HD Tune there was only 1 image.</p>
<p>For HD Tune there are multiple tabs and tests.</p>
<p>Please run tests and post images for:</p>
<p>Health (SMART)</p>
<p>Error scan (full scan)</p>
<p>The full scan can take many hours so plan to run it overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For device manager it was a partial view of the listings.&nbsp; Was there a listing that had a yellow triangle and a black exclamation mark?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Ccleaner or similar cleaning software please post that information into the thread.</p>
<p>There are settings in the Windows software that when the boxes are checked makes the troubleshooting files disappear.</p>
<p>So these need to be checked with the disappearance of the mini dump files.</p>
<p>There also can be failure to create dump files and that can be checked too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>klif.sys is a software driver that is part of Kaspersky AV</p>
<p>So uninstall Kaspersky during the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>Use the Kaspersky uninstall tool:</p>
<p>https://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464</p>
<p>Turn on Windows defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The debugging indicated 2 problematic drivers.</p>
<p>1 software driver:&nbsp; klif.sys</p>
<p>1 hardware driver: &nbsp;nvlddmkm.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the Nvidia graphics driver using Display driver uninstaller (DDU)</p>
<p>The source for a new driver should be the computer manufacturer/MB manufacturer website or the Nvidia website.</p>
<p>The computer manufacturer/MB manufacturer website is preferred.</p>
<p>If you use the Nvidia website make sure that the clean install box is checked and install only the graphics and PhysX drivers.</p>
<p>https://www.wagnardsoft.com/</p>
<p>http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag</p>
<p>Allow it to load for several minutes.</p>
<p>Using one drive or drop box post a share link into the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE (12b) &gt; typically indicates faulty RAM</p>
<p>So when running Memtest86+ version 5.01 the more runs the better.</p>
<p>Please take pictures using a smart phone camera and post images of the results into the thread.</p>
<p>If both RAM sticks pass with 8 or more runs then the testing will be complete.</p>
<p>If there is a failure when both RAM sticks are tested the defective RAM or DIMM/MB must be defined.</p>
<p>Then run 1 RAM module at a time in the same DIMM for 8 or more passes each.</p>
<p>Again just 1 error is a fail and you can interrupt the testing and make an image of the results.</p>
<p>The testing can be ran overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 -3 of a stable computer environment (no BSOD) you can reevaluate Kaspersky AV.</p>
<p>It can be reinstalled and if there is a new BSOD it should be uninstalled and another AV used.</p>
<p>If it does not have a BSOD then continue to use it.</p>
<p>The computer stability period is important so several weeks is used.&nbsp; This way any new BSOD can be attributed to the new installation of the software without any confounding factors.</p>

            Hello! My favorite way to get into safe mode when a machine is booting too quickly for f8 or shift+f8 to work is to interrupt the boot process until Windows 10 tries to repair your PC automatically. You can do this by cutting the power while Windows is trying to boot. This usually takes about three times. It’ll kick you to a screen that will allow you to click into the advanced options and boot into safe mode. <br /><br />Alternatively, you can use a Windows 10 recovery disk.

            Should I do this by pressing down the power button while it's booting? I have beeen trying this and it does&nbsp; not seem to be working.

<p>
</p><p>I would say to go ahead and get the Surface 3 and try it.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, you can order the Surface 3 keyboard later.&nbsp; The tablet will work with USB/wireless/Bluetooth keyboards and mice as well.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 and 220 volt AC battery charger&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mahlonwagner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 and 220 volt AC battery charger&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Surface Pro 3. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am wondering if the battery charger will work on 220 volt AC current (with an adapter plug), and without a voltage transformer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo Thinkpad Ultrabook works just fine, both here in the US, and also the battery charger merely needs the adapter plug because the charger works just fine with 220 Volt AC in Germany.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to take my Surface Pro with me to Germany without a voltage transformer--in part to show my machine off to my German friends.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Yes, the charger is somewhat universal to use. You will only need a german style cable from the Power socket to the Surface adapter (should be available to purchase here without issues, if it is not available where you wish to visit anyway), or a mechanical
 converter for the US flat plugs to German round style.</p>

<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which operating system is installed on your computer?</p>

</span></span></span>Is it specific to any particular website?</p>
<p>As it is pre partitioned recovery drive, and it has been created by the manufacturer in order to extend it you would need to format it. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer
 for support. You should not be saving any files or data on Recovery partition as it is only meant to recover the operating system if something goes time.</p>

<h3> sambradley1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error updating Windows 10 to version 1803</h2>
                    <p>The error message I am seeing is "These programs need to be uninstalled because they aren't compatible with the upgrade". The listed program is Avira AntiVir. I have uninstalled this and deleted all associated application files. On another thread I was advised
 to search for *APPRAISER_HumanReadable. When looking in the most recent file matching this string, I can see one element containing &lt;Property Name="DT_ANY_FMC_BlockingApplication" Value="TRUE" Ordinal="1" /&gt;. The file associated with this block seems to be&nbsp;"%systemroot%\systemapps\microsoft.windows.secondarytileexperience_cw5n1h2txyewy".
 How can I remediate this file? Is it okay to delete it?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Receiving Blue Screen with error code&#58; 0x000000d1</h2>
                    <p>Since installing SP1 on a system running Win7 Ultimate x64 I have had a problem where the system BSODs after going into sleep mode immediately after logging back in.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minidump points to ataport.SYS and ntoskrnl.exe with a consistent Bug Check Code of 0x000000d1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 crash also involved volmgr.sys. A copy of that minidump has been posted to: [deleted]</p>

<p>More system details available. This was an issue on a Dell Precision T3500.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest on Windows 10.<br />
I can understand the inconvenience that you are facing with the issue. We are here to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1: Change Resolution</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow below steps to change resolution.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type Display Settings in search bar.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to Display Settings, and select Advance Sizing of text and other settings under Related Settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to Adjust Resolution and go to Resolution.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Change the Resolution as per requirement, Click on Ok.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check weather changes are reflecting or not.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to change resolution then update Display Drivers and try to change the resolution.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Further, if there no updated drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then trying installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the
 program using settings from a previous version of Windows.<br />
Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.<br />
a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.<br />
Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Un-install and re-install</strong> latest display drivers from the manufacturer’s website and see if that helps:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>“Windows Key + X”</strong> from the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>“device Manager”</strong> without quotes in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Right click</span></strong><span> on the display drivers and select
<strong>“Uninstall”.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer once it is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> To install it in the compatibility mode, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>a) Download the latest </span><span>display
</span><span>driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>b) Right-click on the audio driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>c) Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 10 operating system from the drop down menu.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            Hi Laszlo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p><span>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware").<span>&nbsp;
</span>Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to do the major spring/fall updates.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MS has marked it “We’ve got it”, but that is not enough. They need to be “encouraged” to produce a publicly documented fix for the problem they have created. One option is to recreate a "small drive" version
 of the Win 10 install that installs core features then prompts you for additional requirements specific to your machine and usage.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why did MS do this? Don't forget that Windows 10 has been in development for several years prior to it's release in 2015.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So back then, 32GB of SSD was still very expensive. AND, the initial versions of Win 10 were able to get by on 32GB for the first year or slightly more.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But now, due to "feature creep" it simply is not enough</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The wiki / article (next link) includes many tips and techniques you can use to free up space on your drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or, you can bite the bullet and do a clean install the current Windows Versions. In the long run, even with re-installing lost applications it may be faster that fritzing around trying to free up enough space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have this problem, please vote on this feedback to MS: https://aka.ms/Ilgpij<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am asking that they make repeat update failures a more urgent warning message.</span></p>

</span>It is a feature that allows you to install Windows in a compressed format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Depending on the specifics of your installation this can save up to 5GB of space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>It doesn’t matter if it’s a Windows Store or traditional desktop (Win32) app, they all end up installed (by default) on your primary computer’s hard drive. Although this makes sense in most cases, there are many reasons you may want to install
 apps on a separate drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It could happen that you have a low-end device, such as a tablet or laptop, that came with a very limited local storage and you’re running out of space. If you need to run demanding applications, you may want to install them on a faster hard
 drive to improve performance. Or it could be that you just want to keep your apps separate from the Windows 10 installation drive.</span></p>

<p><span>Whatever the reason it might be, </span><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows 10</span></a><span> includes a number of ways to help you install apps on an external hard drive or SD card storage,

            Hi  laszlohalmagy, can I assume you have a 32GB (28GB usable) SSD on that HP laptop?
<br />
<br />If so, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

                    I'm using windows vista and after i bought Norton 360 and put it on my HP laptop ..every time i would power up my PC it would say there is a problem with windows security. When i open it my windows defender would be off but would let me turn it on by running
 the update for it.&nbsp; Now it will not turn on at all....i get a message that windows security cant turn windows defender on please try later....well later it just says and does the same thing and will not let me install another version of windows defender.....OH
 one more thing...after installing Norton on this laptop as well as my older one neither of my CD/DVD burner drivers work at all...will not read a disk at all....whats going on ??????

<p>First of all, Norton is supposed to turn off Windows Defender because Norton has its oen defender. Running 2 defenders will create conflicts as well as redundant.<br />
So for that issue, you are OK. <br />
There is no such thing as " installing another Windows Defender version ". Windows Defender is part of your Vista system. It lives and dies with the Vista. It can NOT be un-installed either.<br />
<br />
Don't know what happened to your CD/DVD issue, but if you think Norton is the culprit, then I'd suggest you uninstall Norton.<br />
If you do decide to uninstall Norton, first do so via Programs and Features, then you will need Norton Removal tool to make sure nothing from Norton is still left behind in your system.<br />
Here is the Norton Removal Tool download :<br />

<br />
That done, there is not&nbsp;necessary to BUY an anti-virus program. There are some free programs which do the same job and better. Such as :<br />
Windows Security Essentials<br />
Avast<br />
etc, etc.<br />
I don't make recommendation. You can google and decide for yourself. Iam sure some ones will jump in offering their recommendations.</p>

<h2>            SD card icon on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>I used my Surface Pro 4 for several years, at the first the icon of SD card looks like a surface,&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/642b6f0f-7501-465a-b294-d93a732878a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/642b6f0f-7501-465a-b294-d93a732878a3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>after Windows 10 installed a driver named "Realtek USB 10.0.17763" automatic yesterday, the icon of SD card change, and it looks like the picture
 shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5ec45a2-6f32-41d1-ba89-d6ce21e2371f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5ec45a2-6f32-41d1-ba89-d6ce21e2371f?upload=true" /></a></p>

 I try to eject the SD card and remount card, nothing changes. And after I reboot the system, the icon changed again, it looks like this</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f9b0e3c-b451-466d-b99d-00a4cfd570bf?upload=true" />After all, I am really confused what's wrong with my SD card or my Surface device ??</p>
<p>How can I restore the icon to default Surface like icon ?</p>

            <p>If the microSD card(s) you have are working properly, leave it alone. There's<br />definitely something going on with Realtek card drivers as Microsoft has<br />documented some strange issues with these on the upcoming 1903 release. One of<br />my Surface devices is reporting this as a USB device, but my cards are working<br />fine. If it is only the <strong>ICON</strong> that is wrong let it be. (My other Surface shows<br />icons similar to yours, except labeled SDXC). </p>

<p>I have the same problem; if you want to restore the old icon and get rid of "safely remove device icon" you have to do this: go to device manager/usb controller/Realtek/driver/update driver/let me choose/search in the computer/choose from a list and select
 USB mass storage (sry, I don't know the exact translation in english). Strange thing is that&nbsp; in device manager the Realtek microsd card reader is as USB2 and not USB3 recognized or at least it is so in my system. This is true both in Win 10 1903 than in 1809
 version because when I upgraded my sp4 to 1903 through update assistant&nbsp; I noticed a strange&nbsp; card reader's behaviour (sometimes the microsd disappeared from file Explorer and device manager, tested with different microsd cards, and the different icon in file
 Explorer); so I decided to format to solve the issue and I've restored my Surface with a downloaded Surface image (1703) and upgraded until 1809 just to be sure to get rid of strange/uncompatible drivers; after formatting I had immediately a big problem: the
 microsd card reader was recognised as "unknown device" in device manager and wasn't impossible to install its driver (also generic) to let it work and I've spent many hours to try to solve the issue with no luck. In device manager its ID hardware wasn't this:
 USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_090C&amp;REV_0118<br />
USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_090C but the ID hardware was changing from something like "compliance mode" or "failure something" saying the system couldn't reassign the door (port reset failure). I was almost sure the microsd card reader was faulty, I was tired and went
 to sleep. Yesterday (I formatted the day before yesterday) when I switched on my Surface the Microsd reader was finally recognized (I've done nothing during the night!!) and now it's working, or at least I hope so. Anyway the icon in file Explorer is as you
 described (I immediately changed the drivers to USB mass storage) , so I think the latest&nbsp; drivers
<span>"Realtek USB 10.0.17763.31247" are buggy. </span><br />

<h2>            Where did the crop button go in Windows Photo editor&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    With the most recent update I've noticed the big 'Crop' button has disappeared when I try cropping an image. I thought updates are mean't to improve stuff. Not make things harder for everyone. How on earth do I crop images now?

            Hi Senhime.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you using the Photos app?  Because it's never used a big Crop button, but is as shown here: 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/how-to-crop-resize-and-enhance-a-photo-in-windows/7570cba9-e3e4-4b01-8d37-dcb4aa3ff769">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then please clarify the exact name of the app you're using.

 might try turning it off.
