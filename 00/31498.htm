            <p>Please provide further information on the file itself. Is it from a camera? a camcorder? What make and model? Is it from a download? What is the exact format of the clip?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do photos work or are they also black. If all visual elements are black, it could be your graphics driver needs to be updated. Run dxdiag and on the Display tab note the maker of your graphics device (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA) and then go to their site and find
 a driver update utility and run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, convert the problem clip to a known good format (say .wmv) and that should load fine.</p>

            For some reason FRAPS clips don't always work in Movie Maker. Check if you can convert them to another format, preferably .wmv.

                    After recent windows update (maybe co-incidence) Skype no longer opens when clicking on any shortcut or Skype.exe. Have tried renaming Skype file no joy.

            Hi moubray
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>

            Thank you very much for you response. Why does this problem occur especially as I understand Skype is now part of Microsoft.

<h2>            HELP&#33; Double vision on the screen... </h2>
                    Double vision on the screen that is so bad that I can hardly read what is oin the screen. I have had this problem since March. I have had to disabled my GeForce 9800 GT since&nbsp;the driver update does no good.&nbsp; I have uninstalled Aero. The screen is normal
 for 5-10 minutes, then goes into ugly mode.&nbsp; Sometimes, the computer starts up in double vision.<br />
Thanks...John

<p>It may not only be the video card, it may be the monitor itself.&nbsp; It may even be a problem with the hardware.&nbsp; Do you have another monitor you can swap it out with to see if the problem moves - then we'll have a pretty good idea if it is the computer or
 the monitor.&nbsp; The same goes for the video card if possible.</p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do so for at least the monitor and again the video card at least and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the
 computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above doesn't help, I think it is a hardware and not a software problem.&nbsp; I'd take the system to a competent computeer repair shop for diagnosis, repair, and/or replacement.&nbsp;
 You can also consider sending it for service back to the manufacturer.&nbsp; Compare costs, timing, warranties, parts availability and cost, and such things before deciding.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

    <title>Unknown folder with random letters and numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unknown folder with random letters and numbers</h2>
                    So I openned up my computer to find a strange pop up saying I had a virus and nedded to call a tool free number to get rid of it. I did not call and proceded to scan my computer and found some viruses. After deleting them I found a folder : C:\Program
 Files (x86)\491D4D60-1449609292-11DD-80C3-C86000DD9472. &nbsp; This is the first time I remember seeing this type of folder and was wondering if this could be part of the virus/malware that I have detected with my scan. There are 2 tmp files in this folder with
 one application called uninstall. I tried running the uninstall application but nothing happens when I try to open it. I also tried deleteing the temporary files but it says that i cannot because they are open in : Free up Joystick (I also have no idea what
 that is). Does anyone have an idea as what this could be?

            <p>Hi Etienne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you receiving any error while trying to delete the files?</li></ul>
<p>That could be virus too and since you are unable to delete those files, I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict and then try deleting those files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run Microsoft Safety Scanner and check the scan status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Unfortunately, if Windows 7 is on the boot partition, you will have to just upgrade the Windows 7 installation to Windows 8 then discard the Windows 8 installation on the current partition.

<h2>            weather apps no longer working</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface only a week ago. Update to Window 10 immediately. The weather app has now ceased to work after working well for a few days. I can still see the summary on the opening screen, but when I click to open the app, it is just blue buffering
 sign ... on and on.</p>
<p>Can somebody help? It is very frustrating to have lost the weather after just one week ...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Note: After running Windows apps troubleshooter, restart the computer and check.</p>

<p>OMG! A troubleshooter from Microsoft that actually worked! It was a corrupted cache, and the troubleshooter fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now riddle me this, Batman (Microsoft). Why was it so difficult for me to find this, and why was I not able to run the troubleshooter from the Store App menu? Or better yet, why doesn't the OS periodically check for corrupted store cache and fix it on it
 own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, all seems well. So thanks!</p>

            <p>This depends on the settings you pick in your Gmail.com settings.&nbsp; Under your Gmail settings, go to the "Forwarding and POP" section and look for what it says should happen when emails are accessed via POP (it's a drop-down menu).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It probably says "archive my gmail copy", in which case you can get to all your old mail in your "All Mail" folder inside gmail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, can you kindly let me know what your setting was set to?</p>

<h2>            Gamertag banned for having the word Cummins in it&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I made my account on 2/3/17 as the name CumminsInMe. Its an inside joke that my buddies and I&nbsp;have since I&nbsp;am a diesel fanatic and I love the Cummins motor in the Dodge Ram. We joke that I&nbsp;love them so much I&nbsp;must run on a Cummins since I'm so obsessed with them. I wake up this morning (2/4/17) and my gamertag has been changed. I&nbsp;was wanting some help with this issue and and have a potential refund since I&nbsp;find nothing wrong with the gamertag at all and I&nbsp;feel wrongly accused. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If you don't believe me that this is a motor:</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummins</a>&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            Thanks for the response, Noel.&nbsp; It is any program.&nbsp; No matter if it is just one window showing or several.&nbsp; I have not tried the "normal" exit....I'm so used to just using the X corner box, I didn't think of it.&nbsp; So far today, I have not encountered the
 problem.&nbsp; It is not every time, but the majority of time.

<div>This sort of thing usually occurs if the program is doing something in the </div>
<div>background (or another program is hogging all the CPU cycles). When it </div>
<div>happens to me, I just wait a few seconds, and things get back to normal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You're saying that waiting a while has no effect? Have Task Manager open </div>
<div>next time - and when it does, check in there to see if there's any </div>
<div>indication of a CPU-hog.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What's your Anti-Virus? (I've known such problems be caused by Norton, among
<div>others).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What's changed on your system (specifically around the time the problem </div>
<div>started)?</div>
<div>Is there any chance of using System Restore to get back to a time when it </div>
<div>didn't happen?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a look in Event Viewer and see if there's any clues there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Intermittent problems are always the worst to solve - a lot indicate </div>
<div>hardware faults, but I don't think that's the case here. Run a chkdsk </div>
<div>anyway - see if that reports any faults. also, run SFC /SCANNOW to repair </div>
<div>any system file errors.</div>

<p>FWIW.. Have you tried Alt + F4 to end the program? I am inclined to believe something is running in the background as noted by Noel above. This is usually the case.</p>

Is this program what you are trying to close on your system or over the network?

<p>Hi thanks for the solution, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. When I troubleshoot&nbsp;again after reinstalling Windows Media Player, the troubleshooter again showed that Windows Media Library is corrupted.</p>
<p>Is there any other way to fix this problem?</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>3 times</strong></span> restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>

<br />
Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

            A repair install is not a re-install.&nbsp; It's a good thing to try, and it won't remove any of your files or programs (although of course you should never attempt anything at all unless you have a backup).
