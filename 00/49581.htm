<h2>            Parental controls is randomly on my account</h2>
                    
<p>I logged in to see that I randomly have parental controls on my account. If I try to login to any Xbox it will ask for my parent to put in there password. I went to do that but the email it gave me is a dead email address that was canceled a few years ago.
 Is there any way to remove the parental controls? Thank you</p>

<p>As far as I know, only a parent can remove parental controls. Its done this way so kids can not remove the controls their parents put on their accounts.</p>

            <p>Yep although you made this into a discussion instead of an actual question where M$ might actually take it seriously I'd agree
</p>
<p>Many have seen the same issues </p>
<p>Windows updates client updates are getting worse and worse,</p>
<p>Last one was classified as Important which was included in this "so called" Important updates was more monitoringware for upgrading to win-10 kb3112343 :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complete garbageware</p>
<p>But then again so is this list of updates passed off to win-7 in 2015</p>
<p>Best I can say is remove these and hide them if they come back.</p>

            Microsoft no longer offers Windows 7 RC keys, but many websites have posted them because they are free, including this one:<br />
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/05/free-windows-7-product-keys-for-release-candidate-rc-activation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/05/free-windows-7-product-keys-for-release-candidate-rc-activation/</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: these will not work with the retail version of Windows 7, you must pay for those.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another note:<br />
<strong>Upgrade from Windows 7 RC to Final</strong> <br />
<br />
Sorry, you can't upgrade from the Windows 7 RC to the retail version. You must have XP or Vista installed first, then move to Windows 7 with an Upgrade disk. Or you can buy the Full version and do a clean install on your computer.<br />
<br />
The rules according to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
In order to install the upgrade version of Windows 7, you must have a qualifying Windows operating system installed and activated.&nbsp; You cannot install an upgrade version of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to insert
 a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the actual qualifying operating system must be installed.<br />
If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system installed with a genuine license activated , then you cannot use the upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "full version" Windows 7 license.<br />
<br />
In summary:<br />
<br />
1. A qualifying Windows operating system must be installed.<br />
2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated.<br />
3. To upgrade, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Microsoft:<br />
<br />
Please note: All users of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (including Windows Vista users who have upgraded to the Release Candidate) must do a clean installation of Windows 7 RTM. Please keep this is mind as you consider downloading the Release Candidate as
 opposed to waiting for the general availability release.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help in reaching this important milestone. We hope that you will join us in testing the RC and finishing Windows 7!<br />

    <title>Surface Book reboots rather than wake from sleep problem - Event ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harry bennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book reboots rather than wake from sleep problem - Event ID 6008 and 41</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a Surface Book i7, 16GB with NVidia graphics connected to a Surface Dock driving two 2 2560 x 1440 extended displays, mouse, numeric pad
 and HP Deskjet printer. I have the SB set to sleep and then hibernate after two hours when on battery power. This seems to work fine when I am out of the office. My issue seems to occur only when plugged into and powered with the Surface Dock. The SB sometimes
 reboots instead of just waking from sleep. When I look at the Event Viewer Administrative Events this behavior is always reported at the attempted wake up time with an Event ID 6008 Error and an Event ID 41 Critical Error. The&nbsp;description of the 6008 event
 is that the previous system shutdown at a given time and date was unexpected. The time and date reported is generally while the SB is supposed to be sleeping. I find no Events reported at that particular time and date in the Event Viewer anywhere. I had one
 time that the particular reported time and date was while I was actually using the SB but did not get the error until after I put the SB to sleep and then attempted to wake it back up.</span></p>
<p><span>I have looked through the items listed in the Task Scheduler and did not identify anything that might be occurring at the various reported times
 as well as in the Event Viewer. Does anyone have a suggestion for me to figure out what might be running or happening at the particular times reported with the errors?</span></p>

</p><p>This issue may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true: </p>

</p><p>I've done all that but it doesn't address the problem with my Surface Book Pro (i7, 512GB, 16GB RAM) - would it be a hardware fault that I need to take the computer in to get repair? apart from that issue, everything else is actually working ok. I have also
 done a restore along with checking updates and the problem still remains. It only occurs btw, when I have my lid closed over night but I did the same thing with my lid closed during the day for around the 5 hours I was away down the road, came home and everything
 worked as it should have. Although I am piggy backing I'm hoping to avoid creating another thread.</p>

            I tried the Microsoft recommended solution as well. It does not address our issue. I started this thread because I did not find any other posts with a Surface Book reporting the Event ID 6008 and 41 as it relates to the wake from sleep issue I am experiencing.
 It is good to hear that I am not the only one. Now if someone will answer the question I have posed it would be very helpful. Event ID 6008 reports the exact time and date pf the unexpected shutdown. If we could only figure out what the event was that caused
 the shutdown, I believe this would lead to a solution. I imagine there should be some way to do this.<br />

<p>I'm going to head back to Noel Leeming which is where I got it and see if they can replace it - it is a great laptop but god knows Microsoft need to do more than just offering half baked replies of "resetting the settings" as if people on these forums are
 too foolish to do something that basic given that I'm sure that is what 99% of us did before posting on this forum. Worse comes to worse I'll push for a refund if they cannot find a solution to this problem - come on Microsoft, get your act together.</p>

<p>Agreed - I saw someone post how they replaced their Surface Book with another one and it doesn't have the same problem but then again it might be something completely unrelated to the hardware change and maybe something to do with the configuration. You're
 correct, it sounds like it is a either a firmware or software issue and hopefully they can resolve this with some future updates because for now I've been shutting down my laptop each night than rely on the sleep function.</p>

<p>I'm going to take my Surface into Harvey Norman tomorrow and see if they can send it away to get repaired; if it comes back and it still hasn't been fixed then I'll take it back but ultimately if they have no solution then I'll push for a refund - it has
 become a bad joke when I've paid a premium price and what I've received so far from Microsoft is nothing more than deafening silence.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in my original post, I normally have the Surface Book connected to a Surface Dock at my desk. I have the Surface Book set to never hibernate when plugged in. Hence it should be in a state of permanent sleep when left overnight. I usually (but
 not always) find after an overnight sleep the Surface Book restarts in the morning showing the Event IDs 6008 and 41 in the Event Log at start up time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I thought I would try an experiment. I disconnected the Surface Book from the Surface Dock and connected Surface Book to the power adapter instead for the overnight sleep. This morning, no reboot! No Event IDs 6008 or 41. I will try this for a
 couple of more nights to see if the behavior is consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just thought you might be interested. Is your Surface Book connected to a Surface Dock or to the Power Adapter when you experience the problem?</p>

            <p>I have this same problem with my Surface Book.&nbsp; I thought I had narrowed it down to having a combination of apps open.&nbsp; I usually have Excel, Outlook and Firefox open all the time.&nbsp; I originally thought it was firefox, but that doesn't seem to be the case.&nbsp;
 It's an extremely frustrating problem, especially after losing some work after it rebooted within an hour of me stepping away from the machine.&nbsp; I've already tried refreshing and restoring the OS, and that has not helped.&nbsp; I'm also thinking this could be a
 hardware issue.&nbsp; Beyond event ID 6008 and ID 41, I also get this event warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event ID 37</p>
<p>The speed of processor 3 in group 0 is being limited by system firmware. The processor has been in this reduced performance state for 71 seconds since the last report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This event is leading me to believe this is a hardware issue.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Why does windows 10 Home keep installing when im using a Pro disc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I did&nbsp;a fresh HD format then installed Windows 10 Pro but when I go to activate the license I don't even have to enter a key it does so automatically. And it keeps saying its windows 10 home is installed and activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet when I use the same disc in my older laptop it offers me to either&nbsp;install Windows 10 home or pro and pro installs fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install pro on acer aspire es1 which was bought with Windows 10 Home pre-installed.

</p><p>I have a Skype number. I have a local cell phone. I don't have VOICE calls forwarded to my cell phone if they aren't answered.</p>

            Hi Brandon.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />  
<br />
<br />Right click the Start button to open Disk Management, look for the device in the drive map by scrolling down to find it by size.  If no drive letter, right click on the drive to issue one so it shows up in File Explorer. 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Find the devices in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  From Driver tab choose Roll back.  If that fails or isn't available choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help the driver may be the USB controller for that USB port.  Try the above for all USB Host and Hub controllers in Device Manager USB category.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Update the USB 3 or Chipset drivers from the PC or Device's Support Downloads web page.  While there check for newer BIOS, Display, Sound, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers to make sure the ones presently installed in Device Manager are latest.  
<br />
<br />See if the drive can be seen by any of these diagnostics tools which will help confirm if it's dead:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else can see it then Partition Wizard will see it if it's not dead, and has a Surface Test to check it's condition:  <a href="http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/partitiontest/partitiontest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/partition...</a>
<br />
<br />You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            A window keeps popping up asking me to download an executable file by an unidentified publisher</h2>
                    <p>A window keeps popping up asking me to download and executable file. When I cancel out, it pops up again or goes into the task bar and flashes at me. While in the taskbar, it has the Windows shield icon. The .exe file starts with "win" followed by a ten
 digit number. This number changes every time I click out of it. One would think this would be safe to allow, but it has Unidentified Publisher. Is this safe to download, is it just a Windows file that is safe? I've been hit with some bad viruses the past couple
 of weeks. especially the past two days,&nbsp; so I hesitate at allowing this file.</p>

            Hi, thanks for replying.<br />
<br />
1. I get this message immediately while the computer is booting up or shortly thereafter.
<br />
<br />
2. My computer has been going thru a lot of changes and has been very unstable, all stemming from a couple of weeks ago when I clicked on a link I shouldn't have on Facebook. The scan on microsoft just yesterday, found and deleted two Trojans that McAfee missed.
 Whatever had a hold of my computer was messing with several of my programs IE: Photoshop, Mozilla, and even McAfee. A couple of days ago, I added RegZooka, the registry cleaning program. It said I had 1200+ errors in my registry. I let it fix them. Things
 seemed to stabalize a bit the flashing window message went away.<br />
<br />
Then,&nbsp; night before last the same window came up and wanted me to download this executable. I was still leary, because like I said, even though it has the Window shield icon in the task bar, it still says "Unidentified Publisher". When I click off of it, or
 hit cancel, it goes straight to my taskbar and flashes orange at me. If I click on it again, the 10-digit number after the "win" in winXXXXXXXXXX.exe changes every time. I ran McAfeee and it came up with zero problems, I then ran Regzooka again, and it came
 up with 10537 errors in the registry, all but 124 of them were empty registry key errors. This was only 2 days after running it initially.
<br />
<br />
Even after getting rid of the two trojans yesterday, this situation is still persisting.<br />
<br />
I am not a novice at fixing these situations, but not an expert either. I will try the clean boot and let you know if it works. Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi KatWauters</p>
<p>It sounds like you may still have a virus or malware.&nbsp; If needed you can use the Microsoft Safety Scanner, it's free:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try using Microsoft Security Essentials, another free program:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we don't recommend using a registry cleaner.&nbsp; Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY
 settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><span>Hello davewilli,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might try connecting the device to another computer to determine if the camera is in proper working order. If the camera is functioning on the other
 computer then you know the camera is working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you recently installed any applications that might be causing a problem with the webcam? You might also try using the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility
 to remove any previous installations of the software. After removing and re-installing the software it is possible that the required files for making the device work properly have been written over or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might also try contacting the Life cam support website that I have provided below to see if they can offer support for this device and any problems you
 may be experiencing.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jailbreaking your Windows RT device won’t allow you to run any Windows desktop program. This removes the protection against running any desktop program not specifically written by Microsoft. Windows RT devices run on ARM chips, while standard Windows PCs
 use Intel x86 chips, that means you can’t just run standard Windows software on an ARM device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have any concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am Rob, a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis.
<br /> 
<br />Is there a DMP file in C:\Windows or in C:\Windows\minidump?
<br />If so we need to analyze those.

<br />
<br />We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the OneDrive or other file sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.

<br />

<br />
<br />If no DMP files then we need some more specific info on the crashes.
<br />
<br />In Event Viewer we need the info from the lower pane Friendly View from the cause events and not those after the restarts.

<br />
<br />This utility makes it even easier to find the specific events - see tips.
<br />
<br />FullEventLogView - Free is a simple tool for Windows 10/8/7/Vista that displays in a table the details of all events from the event logs of Windows, including the event description. It allows you to view the events of your local computer, events of a remote computer on your network, and events stored in .evtx files. It also allows you to export the events list to text/csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file from the GUI and from command-line.

<br />TIP  : Options - Advanced Options - allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file - set it to a bit before and after the time of the EVENT.

            Often there is actually a combination of problems which cause an issue so I would do a Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<p>Thank you for your quick response.&nbsp; I have a Dell XPS 8700, Windows 10 version 1709.&nbsp; I upgraded from Winows 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as troubleshooting, I have searched the Internet for individuals with similar issues, and I have gone to the Dell website and run a diagnostic test which reported that my computer passed all tests.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other user accounts on this computer.&nbsp; In checking the Event Viewer, it shows the issue began following a Windows update.&nbsp; I'm not sure that these dates that are showing on my computer are quite accurate.&nbsp; When I checked my programs in Control
 Panel, the installation dates of a number of programs is the same as the latest Windows update, which I know are not accurate, because some of the programs have been on my computer from when I purchased it in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed a spyware program (I have Avast as my anti virus program which was installed a couple of years ago) and a temperature monitor to see if it was an overheating problem.&nbsp; In the Control Panel, it shows the installation date of these programs
 the same as the last Windows update.&nbsp; I am going to uninstall those two programs and go back to a restore point before this started.&nbsp; Thank you for your suggestion to go back to a restore point.&nbsp; Hopefully this resolve my issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; While I am on my computer, it has not shutdown on me.&nbsp; It seems to only do this when it is idle/asleep, but then I am only on the computer for a couple of hours at a time.</p>

            Which suggest the issue lies with power management. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it.

<h2>            Korean Windows 7 Ultimate - Activating Key</h2>
                    I just bought Windows 7 Ultimate off eBay and was wondering how I would activate the product if the key is in korean?
<br />
<br />
At first I thought I'll just download some English-&gt;Korean alphabet and print it but I realized that typing with my keyboard will probably put the characters in English automatically, is there some kind of language option somewhere that I can change so my keyboard
 will input Korean letters &amp; numbers instead of English?&nbsp;

<h2>            sound problems after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I solved a problem with muffled sounds in some programs, such as Quicken, and no, or muffled sound in other situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into my sound settings and discovered that windows 10 upgrade process had changed my speaker set up from stereo to 5.1. I changed the set up back to stereo, and my Quicken sounds have returned.

    <title>Why did my Windows 10 activation key &#39;expire&#39;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> commodore65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did my Windows 10 activation key &#39;expire&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Got desktop message a few days ago that my Win 10 Pro needed to be activated. Well, it's been a valid activation for over a year now (came on the Dell desktop I bought).&nbsp; Tried to activate, had to run the troubleshooter - it said was successfully activated.
 Then the same thing has happened every day for the last 4 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally broke down and called MS tech support. They said the activation key had 'expired' and they gave me a new one but said it would expire in a year also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the frick? So Windows 10 Pro keys expire now? This is news to me.</p>

    <title>Multiple Displays taskbar configuration area not visible on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Displays taskbar configuration area not visible on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>i have windows 8.1 running on a Macbook Pro using bootcamp. I have 2 external monitors attached, and i would like to extend the taskbar across all monitors. However, when i right-click -&gt; Properties on the task bar, i do no have the dialog for Multiple Displays.
 On another machine, and all the documentation, there is an option to configure this.</p>
<p>Please advise</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the thread and follow the suggestions provided by 'Kelvin Xu' on Thursday, April 24.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a1dc4fa9-e3fd-4e1e-a174-5acde06a43e0/multiple-display-options-for-taskbar-missing-after-windows-81-update?forum=w8itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a1dc4fa9-e3fd-4e1e-a174-5acde06a43e0/multiple-display-options-for-taskbar-missing-after-windows-81-update?forum=w8itprogeneral</a><br />
</p>
<p>Note: If you are using Windows 8.1 pro, first follow the group policy steps to allow more than one display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, you may follow the registry steps.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up the registry for restoration</a><br />
Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type <strong>regedit.msc </strong>and press OK.</p>
<p>To Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer.</p>
<p>Now, follow the steps mentioned in the above link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, we will be happy to help you further.</p>

            <p>yes, they show up there and everything is working fine except for the taskbar not extending to external monitor(s). looks like there is a bug as people in that other thread are experiencing the same issue. hopefully there's a fix soon as i'd rather resolve
 this natively than install 3rd party software</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and I can almost make it go away, but not the way I'd like it to work. I have a Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus laptop running Windows 8.1 Pro. The native screen resolution on that is 3200x1800, and the screen resolution on my external monitor
 is 1680x1050. Windows warns me that this resolution is too low (it wants a minimum of 2400x1800) and says that some items won't fit on my screen. Apparently the taskbar is what it's warning me about, and the multiple monitor section doesn't even come up when
 I open Taskbar properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this changes if I make the external monitor my primary monitor. In that case, I can put the task bar on both monitors, the only problem being that I'm required to keep the clock and related goodies on the bottom-right corner of my primary monitor and
 I was hoping to keep those items on the laptop for consistency when I'm undocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps other people experiencing this difficulty getting the multi-monitor sub-menu on Taskbar settings have similar configurations, with lower resolution on a secondary monitor.</p>

<h2>            how to stop my cursor from jumping around while I am typing on surface pro 2017</h2>
                    while I am typing an email, if I pause for a second, the next time I type I will be on a different area of the page typing somewhere else.&nbsp; Also, it often quickly highlights a few lines of typing and deletes it, while I am going along typing a paragraph.&nbsp;
 It happens very frequently and is very frustrating.

                    <p>Hello Xbox Community &amp; Xbox Moderators:</p><p>I have received my Halo Wars Definitive Edition Promo Code from pre-ordering Halo Wars 2 Ultimate Edition, but it keeps giving me the classic "Sorry, an unexpected error has occurred. The error has been recorded and we will investigate. Please try to redeem your code later. " I am unsure if we are supposed to wait until we given a message saying it's OK to redeem or if the servers are getting flooded which causes the server to kick mine out because it can't handle so many at once. Is anyone else having this issue? Is Xbox aware of this and are trying to fix it? Or finally am I probably right and the servers are flooded which is resulting in too many players trying to redeem their codes?<br /></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If so, this the
<strong>"new" </strong>Skype for Windows 10 devices and it's different from</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Skype for Windows Desktop.</strong> You can manage to change its theme by going into Setting

<h2>            Using Recovery Disk to reinstall Windows 10 to change from MBR to GPT</h2>
                    <p>My computer came with Windows installed on a MBR partition and because of this I am unable to install the Anniversary Update (1607) for Windows 10 (see screenshot), it also appears that no further updates are being installed. If I create a recovery disk
 will Windows allow me to delete the old partition, create a new GPT one, and restore Windows 10 from the recovery drive on the new partition? If I can, will I need a product key as Windows came pre-installed on my system?</p>

            Hi nikua,<br />
<br />
According to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Lexmark Z13 Inkjet Printer&amp;v=Lexmark&amp;uid=16000&amp;pf=3&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Printers %26 Scanners&amp;sc=Ink-Jet Printers&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Lexmark%20Z13%20Inkjet%20Printer&amp;v=Lexmark&amp;uid=16000&amp;pf=3&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Ink-Jet%20Printers&amp;os=32-bit</a>&nbsp;the Lexmark Z13 is 'compatible' with
 Windows 7 therefore the default drivers should be sufficient.<br />
<br />
Obviously this model is no longer available so Lexmark won't be providing Windows 7 drivers. If you can't get your printer to work then it may be time to think about buying a new one.
