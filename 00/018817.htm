<h2>            Is it possible to have an invisible note indicator in the text&#63;</h2>
                    Two sequences of notes within one displayed series aren't so bad, assuming a need to present annotations and textual notes on the same page. &nbsp;(The idea came from this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/can-word-provide-a-2nd-level-of-footnotes/f49406ed-aa3d-4da3-939e-ec2ed2702fa4">
thread</a>.)&nbsp;A great deal can be done to separate the series visually, although not geographically on the page. E.g., the textual notes can be in a different typeface as well as being given different indicators. Whether the custom indicator in the text is always
 the same or whether it has a little series of its own is independent of the indicator in the second series of actual notes. The indicator in the notes can be even be deleted and yet the note remains! In this case it might be desirable to substitute something
 else, e.g. a line number. Here's an example of 2 sequences within one display series. I wouldn't really mix the custom indicator * with the line number or &nbsp;blank indicator alternatives shown below.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>57</div>
<div>*</div>
<div>58</div>
<div>59</div>
<div>**</div>
<div>60</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[blank indicator]</div>
<div>61</div>
<div><i>25 [line number substituted for indicator]</i></div>
<div><i>62<br />
</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried unsuccessfully to use an invisible custom indicator in my text. Fixed spaces aren't accepted. Is there such a thing as an invisible indicator in Word? I seem to recall that it was in another program.</div>

            You can use any note reference mark you want and format it as Hidden. It will still work just the same. This is the technique used to combine reference marks in text (when you want to have notes numbered 4, 5, 6, 7 but show "4-7" in the text).

            <p>Hi ScottHickey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in responding to your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please be informed that by upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox. However,
 if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before rename, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages
 yourself. Please go to&nbsp;the link below for on how to recover lost/deleted messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Deleted email messages</span></b></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you
<b>– ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’</b> You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will
 be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another possible reason&nbsp;</span><span>why some users aren’t able to see old emails after rename is that their account was hacked and the
 hacker had already deleted the&nbsp;emails in their account before they renamed the account.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If for some reason you're&nbsp;</span><span>you still cannot see your emails,</span><span>
 please go to the<b> Private Message </b>tab. We need to ask details&nbsp;to&nbsp;help facilitate our actions regarding your issue. Please sign-in to this website in order to see the Private Message tab. We also&nbsp;need you to reply back to this post if you've

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, but will answer on the private message as non of the above describes my situation. I log into hotmail 10x daily. Any mail that was older than 7 days was being deleted.</p>
<p>I have move away from outlook.com and back to hotmail. Mails now seem to remian. Apart from the fact that I don't know how many mails I have lost as a resutl of transitioning over to outlook.com.</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I access my mail with a variety of devices, desk-top internet, tablet&nbsp;app and mobile-phone app.</p>
<p>My phone carrier is just providing the connection, my mail app. whatever i use just sits on top of the connection so it's not accessing my mail-box.
</p>
<p>Basically I am doing the same as I have done over the last xx years with my hotmail account. All this only strated only after transitioning over to the new outlook.com - no change in devices or my access habits (which is why it's so difficult and frustrating
 to find out what has gone wrong and where all my mail are)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks - but like i have said in my first post and my other posts&nbsp; - the mails are not in the Deleted folder - so I don't need to restore from deleted!! They are not in any folder.
</p>
<p>Ayyway - just to be sure i did the restore deleted emails and it only bought back email I have actually delted (but only those from the last 3 days!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again - the issue:</p>
<p>I receive the emails in my inbox</p>
<p>i open &amp; read the emails in my in box</p>
<p>i leave the mails in my in-box after reading</p>
<p>i don't not move the mails out of my in-box</p>
<p>I sometimes open and read the mail again</p>
<p>after 7 days (now after 4 days) the emails are no longer in my in-box</p>
<p>the emails are also not in any other hotmail folder i have</p>
<p>they have dissapeared.</p>
<p>I assume they have not been deleted becaise logically they would be in the Deleted folder - but they are physically not there. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>BTW:</p>
<p>about a month ago when this started (after i moved to outlook.com) then i double checked all the settings and noticed i had to change the POP settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I chenged to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thnaks for your response. This was one of the settings I checked when I first noticed my inbox mails dissapearing a few months ago and indeed I did have to chage the setting.</p>
<p>So for the last 2 months the setting has been:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; •Don’t let another program delete messages from Hotmail. (If your other program is set to delete messages from the server, we’ll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won’t be deleted.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>just to make sure one of the mail apps wasn't causing problems. So for a month this has been set - but the mails keep dissapearing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep track I sent myself a test mail - with date and time (Tuesday 18th 15:55 CET) and left it in the inbox. I will see at what point this dissapears - i assume after 4 days like everythign else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also check the folder TRACH/POP - and the only mails that are there are ones from before i changed the old POP setting. Any mails I've lost since after that change are no where to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am accessing mails also from a mobile phone running&nbsp; WIndow 7.5 - is there any settings there i need to double check? Although at a glance I can't&nbsp;see any settings&nbsp;that suggests it would move or delete mails.&nbsp;</p>

Plus, "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem" when I click on the red icon...</div>



<div>Do you have a solution ?<br />
In "sound, video and game controllers" (in Device Manager) I have 2 things :</div>

<div>- IDT High Definition Audio CODEC (No drivers are installed for this device and when I click on "update driver" it says it found a driver but couldn't install it because "a device attached to the system is not functionning")</div>

<div>- Intel(R) Display Audio (drivers are up to date)</div>

<h3> fiona fjd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel - what formula do I need to calculate age groups based on a range of DOB&#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All Excel wizards!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. I'm trying to add age groups to a spreadsheet for our local sports club, but these don't relate to their exact age but if their DOB falls within a range. For example if born between (day/mth/yr) 1.9. 2003 and 31.8.2005 they fall into the U13
 category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added a look up table with the age groups - where col A is Age Group; Col B earliest DOB, Col C Latest DOB. But I don't know what formula to add to get it to compare the actual DOB of each athlete with the range of DOB from the table and then tell
 me the age group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On line I have found lots of tutorials for VLook Up tables but these seem to only compare the data with one piece of information - like their actual age and then report back what group they are in - but I need the function to look their DOB and compare this
 with a range of dates. Should I be using VLOOKUP or some other function like IF or can I combine both? &nbsp;</p>

You don't want anyone to ruin their daily use device for a single software update. One must know what he/she is doing with their device because these updates are not stable.

    <title>Formatting long numbers to display correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h. pelletier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting long numbers to display correctly</h2>
                    I am downloading data from an online source. Some of the numbers are 17 digits long, or longer. When viewed in Excel it shows like this, 2.68435E+17 The only way I can get Excel to display the number even close is to format it as text. I need to upload
 this data into another program and it needs to read the info as a number. Is there a setting or something that allows me to store long numbers accurately, and as a number?

<p>If you are downloading a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file...try this:</p>
<p>• Save As...Change the name from: MyFile.CSV to MyFile.TXT<br />
• Import that file to Excel...it will trigger the Text Import Wizard.<br />
• Using that wizard, you'll be able to designate that column of values as TEXT...and it won't be converted.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>that can happen with poor signal strength with mobile connections. Try a different location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local Wireless connections can be affected by building walls or steel reinforcing in buildings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some connection plans are limited to a certain amount of downloads... once the limit is reached the connection/download speed is limited... contact your ISP to discuss your account limits... (tip: many connection plans are now a lot cheaper than they were
 a few years ago... you have to ask for things... nobody is going to give it to you..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's about the only two possibilities why connection speeds would slow down...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>occasionally.... high traffic volumes or network outages may slow things down, but with ADSL2 and mobile connections there is plenty of capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<h3> jayme grzesik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home &#38; Business 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    I purchased a subscription for Office Home &amp; Business 2016 for Mac, downloaded the software, installed it onto my Mac and have activated the product. However, the "Belongs to:" section when clicking on "About Microsoft Word" states that the subscription
 belongs to my student Office 365 account, rather than my personal email address for the subscription I purchased from a retailer. When I activated the Office Home &amp; Business 2016 on my Mac I signed in using my personal email address, not the Office 365 student
 email address. What can I do to correct this? I have used some of the advice given on similar questions, though this has not been helpful in my case.

<h3> samantha armstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you create a private or confidential email using the Outlook App on a mobile device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to mark an email as confidential or private when creating an email on my android phone with the Outlook App and I don't see any options to do so. When you are on your PC, there is a setting that you can go to and mark the email as Confidential or
 Private, where is this setting on the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company logs emails with Exchange sync and it will automatically not log emails if they are marked as 'Confidential' or 'Private'. There are some private emails that I want to send from my phone and make sure that they don't get logged through the exchange
 sync, but I can't find the setting on the app to mark emails as 'Private' or 'confidential'.</p>

<h2>            How can I adjust the column width in Excel for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Excel for Mac 2016. I have used 2011 for years and I am having issues with column and row sizes. In 2011 I was able to set the column width or row height using inches. When I open old 2011 files with 2016 the sizes change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I open a worksheet in Excel 2011 the column width in 1inch. When I open the same file with Excel 2016 the column width is 11. Eleven what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I able to change the preferences to display this in inches? I have looked around and have not been able to find a setting for it. I do have my rulers set to inches in the preferences.</p>

<p>Phillip is correct that 2016 is a change from 2011 (and prior), but he should have stopped there :-) The change was made to conform to the system used on the PC version of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 values shown in a tip box when you manually adjust the column width:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Excel 2016: the first value is the number of <em>characters</em> (in hundredths) followed (in parentheses) by the number of
<em>pixels</em>.</li><li>In prior versions it was the number of characters (in hundredths) followed (in parentheses) by the width in inches by hundredths.</li></ul>
<p>Despite what is displayed in the tip box the column width in inches can be specified by going to Format&gt; Column&gt; Width then entering a value such as 1.5" (including the "). If you don't specify inches the value will be interpreted as characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Note that <em>character</em> means a single width character such as the letter
<em>n</em> or <em>a</em>.]</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58; Search and Advanced Find don&#39;t locate Calendar and Contacts in iCloud</h2>
                    Outlook 2010 (Office 2010) on Win 7.
<div>
<p><span>I have all of my Contacts and Calendars in iCloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Contacts Pane.</span></p>
<p><span>Ctrl+E and enter a first name.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No matches found.</span></p>
<p><span>Ctrl+E, Search Tools/Indexing Status - 0 items left</span></p>
<p><span>Search Tools/Locations to Search - all items are checked including iCloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Search Tools/Advanced Find/ enter first name - there are no items to show.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Same thing happens in Calendar.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>In Search Tools/Advanced Find I go to the Look For... In ... line and click Browse.</span></p>
<p><span>The Calendar folder under Personal Folders is checked. I uncheck that and check the Calendar under iCloud.</span></p>
<p><span>A Find Now in Advanced Find will now find the items correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>If I exit Outlook and restart Outlook, the setting in Advanced Find remains set to iCloud.</span></p>
<p><span>However, it appears that after rebooting Windows and restarting Outlook the setting in Advanced Find returns</span></p>
<p><span>to Calendar under Personal Folders.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I upgraded from Office 2007. I had iCloud integration there as well. Don't recall this behavior.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas?</span></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>In order for search feature to work, the data file type should be *.pst (Personal Data File) or *.ost (Offline Data File).
<br />
iCloud integration with Outlook does not create neither PST or OST file format, due to which Outlook can index the file format for the search feature to work with the iCloud Contacts and Calendar.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you synchronize the Contacts and Calendars through iTunes, it will sync with the default data file. This will allow you to use the search function,

            Hi, Srinivasu!
<div>Thanks for helping me out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>OK, couple of things:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. This search function for Contacts and Calendars in iCloud worked in Outlook 2007. Is this<br />
something that changed with Outlook 2010?</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. When I do the iCloud Control Center setup for Outlook a .pst file does get created.&nbsp;<br />
File/Info/Account Settings/Data Files shows my data files. Here is the one that iCloud added: &nbsp;C:\Users\rwdesktop\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Outlook2(4).pst</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. The search feature actually does work.</div>
<div>Ctrl+E/Search Tools/Advanced Find/Search for the Word ...... &nbsp; will find my iCloud Contacts<br />
and Calendar entries just fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The part that doesn't work is what I believe is called Outlook Instant Search.</div>
<div>A search using Outlook Instant Search never finds the iCloud entries.</div>
<div>However, the Instant Search WILL find a contact in the 'My Contacts' folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here's my guess as to the problem. Advanced Find only allows one selection to be searched.</div>
<div>When I set Advanced Find to Search in Contacts under iCloud, Advanced Find has no trouble finding the entries. My suspicion is that Outlook Instant Search is not obeying the search location set in Advanced Find. Outlook Instant Search is defaulting to
 searching only the 'My Contacts' entries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At this point I'd be reluctant to contact Apple about this. It would be difficult for me to articulate</div>
<div>why Advanced Find works fine and Instant Search doesn't as an Apple problem to solve.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know what you think or what I can try.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Worksheet tab management - Frustration and possible product improvement suggestion</h2>
                    <p>RE: Worksheet tab management</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in a few other places that this is possibly the best way to suggest a product improvement to you fine folks at Microsoft. For Excel, I use a lot of data that result is a LOT of worksheets. For many years I have been frustrated with everything around
 the functionality of the worksheet tabs once you have more than you can fit on the space allocated to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Idea #1: Expand like the Windows Taskbar when it's unlocked (ie. multiple rows can be expanded). This would allow the viewing of more than one tiny strip of worksheet tabs and be so helpful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Idea #2: Scroll functionality. Kind of like how you can use your mouse-wheel to go through the ribbons in the Office suite of products, have it so when you mouse over the worksheet tabs area at the bottom of Excel, you can use your mouse-wheel to scroll
 left or right for faster access ie. no more really annoying arrow clicking or bar dragging (which is super annoying if you've shrunk the size of the bar to better be able to see the worksheet tabs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this isn't the correct place to put this feedback, please let me know how to send it on to the developers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you - I love your products!</p>

            <p>This is not meant to comment on your suggestions, but in case you are not aware, you can right click on the VCR controls on the left side of the tab bar and get a list of all your sheets (with the ability to scroll with your mouse wheel then click on a sheet
 name to go to that sheet).&nbsp; Anyway it is an easy way to manage a large number of worksheets.

<h2>            Bigger contact picture in My Phone&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello everyone!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I'm trying to get help for the first time. I have a "problem" (actuality&nbsp;this is a question, not a problem) with My Phone service.</span></strong></p>
<p>I have <strong>HTC T8585 (HD2)</strong> mobile phone with installed last version of My Phone service. I'm using this without problems, but...</p>
<p>When I set an image in phone (or via web portal) for some contact, it is in resolution<strong>94 x 94</strong>. My cell phone has a resolution
<strong>480 x 800</strong>, which means that this resolution of picture (<em>94 x 94</em>) is a too low. When this contact is calling me, picture is so pixalizated that it is too&nbsp;annoying. When I set an image for contact via some third party shell for WM (I
 can't remember the name of program/shell, because this program expired me), I have max. resolution for picture of contact<strong>320 x 320</strong> which is great!</p>
<p>When I synchronize Web and my address book from phone, pictures in&nbsp;<strong>320 x 320</strong>&nbsp;stays in that resolution&nbsp;untouchable.</p>
<p>My question is: <strong>How can I directly on Web (or with some Windows/Windows Mobile tool), set much bigger pictures and synchronize it with Web/address book?</strong></p>
<p>I know that I can add for everyone Facebook account and link it, but after all, synchronization do not applies on FB profile images, and all my contacts do not have FB account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I called Microsoft support in Belgrade (0700 300 300), and they did not&nbsp;solve&nbsp;my "problem".</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Nemanja</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am unable to select any text for spell check, grammar check or copy and pasting. Word keeps telling me that "this is not a valid selection" and I haven't been able to find any information else where online. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Office,
 but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try opening word in safe mode and see if the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type winword /safe
<br />
<br />If it worked, disable any suspicious add-ins.

<br />
<br />If that does not work, uninstall office but this time use this tool:
<br />

<br />Install it again and see if the issue persist.

<p>
</p><p>Hi, thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, neither option worked. Opening in safe mode showed no active add-ins, only a few that are inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the tool to uninstall Office then I reinstalled from the Microsoft website, but I had no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had this issue before, it only began last month when I renewed my subscription. Pretty odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>That is not possible, you need to uninstall the Office Professional Plus 2010 trial restart your computer and install the Office Professional Academic 2010 edition.</p>
<p>You cannot convert Office Professional Plus 2010 to a full version. It is a volume license product intended only for evaluation purposes only.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you Run the Fix it tool mentioned in the article below to uninstall Office 2010:</p>
