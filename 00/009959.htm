<h2>            E-mail Drafts discarded using reading pane show up in Deleted as Trash</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a bit of a finicky question, but as someone who HATES unread messages, this one has really started to irritate me. Here's the setup; using Outlook.com e-mail account configured in Outlook 2013 as IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm in my Inbox (or any folder), I have the Reading Pane up. I click on "Reply" and begin to type&nbsp;a message.&nbsp;If I&nbsp;then decide that I want to delete that draft and click "Discard" at the top, the deleted draft goes to my trash and is marked as unread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,&nbsp;if I don't use the reading pane, or if I&nbsp;click "Pop Out" and draft my message in a new window, if I then attempt to close that message, Outlook will ask if I want to save changes, and if choosing "No," will delete the draft, with no record of it in
 my Deleted folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, what I want is that if I happen to hit "Discard" at the top of an e-mail to which I'm replying in the Reading Pane, I want the draft to be deleted, just as if Outlook asked me if I wanted to save it and I declined. In other words, no unread message
 in the Deleted Folder.&nbsp;Is there some way to change the behavior of this button? Some setting I missed? Or at the very least, some rudimentary macro I could write which would do the same thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bill</p>

    <title>N900 dead - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noraaron  say:</h3>
<h2>            N900 dead</h2>
                    
<p>Please excuse me if this topic was already discussed, but i have followed these other ones and none of them was exactly my case:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/discussions/board/message?board.id=topfaq&amp;thread.id=168</p>
<p>/discussions/board/message?message.uid=589647#U589647</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received this week my new N900. Everything superb until last Friday when I was in my car listening music through the A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth), received a call, was using also 3G and all this meanwhile the N900 was plugged to the car charger
 (borrowed from a N97). That was quite usual with my HTC Diamond. But suddenly when I left the car the N900 bricked, so I restarted but since then the only thing I could see is the NOKIA logo with the white wallpaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later at home i tried to remove the battery, put it back again, plugged to the adapter and i could see a small usb logo on the right top corner. Then I followed the guides found here to flash und update the firmware (flasher-3.5 and so on, with my windows
 7 pc). First I reinstalled the latest firmware file (.bin) and it seems to be OK, with no error comand. Then I rebooted the N900 but the result was the same, it stopped 30-40 segs later and switch off. I though it was also necessary to do the eMMC, so i repeated
 following the new steps, but in this case i found these messages from the flasher:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-USB not found</p>
<p>-USB raw data transfer EP found at EP2</p>
<p>-SU_GET_UPDATE_STATUS_REQ terrminated with error code 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what do they mean but the case is that now I can see no usb logo on the top when I plug the usb adapter (either USB or AC), so it is now impossible to comunicate with the pc. I have tried again to remove the battery, even in a Nokia center
 with another battery from the 8500 which i didn't know was the same, but no result. The most strangest thing is that the N900 refuses to be charged as once it is plugged to the AC, a yellow light appears and on the screen I can only see the nokia logo on a
 dark backlight (as I said, with no usb logo now), but 30 segs later it is continously switching off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am already mentally prepared to ask Nokia for a replacement, but I still resist to accept there is no solution to revive this little but complex device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I know that many on this board favor the manual method of flashing the device.... but the NSU (Nokia software updater) does it all in one step.&nbsp; I know you say that the device can not connect to the pc.... but have you attempted NSU?

            Thanks for your suggestion but I'm afraid that the NSU doesn't work on Windows 7. Anyway, I think that could not have been possible as there is neither USB communication nor power through AC from my N900.

<p>I think from the sounds of this your battery is flat..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N900 does not behave well with a low battery.. After a while you find that it won't even start to charge a flat battery.. I've helped 5 or so people who have had a device that did not appear on USB and would not enter the "flashing" mode.. all of them
 were fixed by replacing the battery..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know someone with another N900 or 5800 or 5230? They all use the same battery. You will be able to charge your battery in their phone and like wise use their battery in your N900 in order to get it started..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few threads here detailing how to recover an N900 that isn't booting.. but this covers about 99% of what you need to do</p>

<p>That's correct! I think this is because of the flat battery and for this <em>stupid
</em>reason we cannot flash ourselves the device. If this is the case, as I don't know any friend with the 5800 or 5230, I will buy a battery charger and try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it can solve it. I think once I can see the usb logo the steps to flash and recover are quite similar to the threads you mention, with the difference of doing the whole process with a fully charged battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks cpitchford for your suggestion. I will let you know the result.</p>

<p>Ok, now you have a fresh battery, does your device boot up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if it boots but some functions wont' work (like installing packages) it means you'll be able to keep that battery charged..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're having problems flashing under windows, it is possible to flash under Linux and usually with more sucess.. I helped someone download and install Linux onto a USB key (you need 2gig flash drive) then you can boot off the USB drive and flash your
 N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know where you're at and I'll try and help</p>

<p>It'll be a bit more complex with a live CD.. but we can give it a go..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See this post for an outline..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>/discussions/board/message?board.id=maemo&amp;message.id=2465#M2465</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Carry out steps 4.5.6.7 (ignore steps 1,2,3)
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of making the flasher os emmc and deb directories on a USB key, create them on your c:\&nbsp; so c:\flasher and c:\flasher\emmc c:\flasher\os c:\flasher\deb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy the files into those directories..<br />
<br />
Now, when you boot into mint, your c: will not be in /cdrom as the post suggest.. instead it will be somewhere else.. I can't tell you where as I've not used mint on a system running windows as the primary OS..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can cross that bridge when we get to it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have another machine spare? If not, you'll need to get mint set up to connect to the internet so you can check and post to this forum</p>

            I have followed all your steps and everything is done until the eMMC flash. I don't know the reason but i get the message on the linux mint terminal "Suitable USB device not found, waiting". Of course I removed and inserted again the battery, pressing
 "u" before connecting the USB. And also the USB logo is present on the N900. What is now the problem?

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm creating some shortcuts to customize my Excel for mac, because I'm used to them (in Excel for PC).&nbsp;</div>
<div>My problem is that I coundn't find the function "remove duplicates" in the following place: &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>View --&gt; Toolbars --&gt; Customize Toolbars and Menus --&gt; Keyboard --&gt; Data (all the other data functions are here) &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>However, this function appears in the menu "data". &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Does anyone knows if it's possible to create this shortcut I want? &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you! </div>

<p>This looks like a simple oversight. Use Excel's Help menu and choose Send Feedback to display the suggestion form. Fill in the form and suggest to Microsoft that this command be added to the keyboard shortcut options.</p>

    <title>Unable to access Live.co.uk incoming emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to access Live.co.uk incoming emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use Windows 7 and Windows Live Mail as my email client and I have a problem accessing emails on my .....@live.co.uk account. I can send a test email from this account to one of my alternative email accounts but cannot receive emails from any source to
 my .....@live.co.uk account. If I view emails in my Outlook.com page, the test emails are all present. Also, I use 'Mailwasher' to screen my emails to all my accounts and the emails to my ...@live.co.uk account, are visible in Mailwasher.
</p>
<p>Also, my Live account emails are received OK on my mobile phone, so it would seem that there is a problem with my Windows Live Mail program. All my other email accounts work OK.</p>
<p>Having done a search on the Internet, I found the following :</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
In a few weeks, we will be making some changes to our email services that might impact your @outlook.com, @hotmail, @live or @msn email account. These changes will prevent your email from being delivered to the Windows Live Mail 2012 application that you use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
In order to continue using Windows Live Mail 2012 to send and receive email for your account, you need to install the latest update published&nbsp;<a href="http://communication.microsoft.com/Key-6859401.C.hcR1.N.K4.-.nC1rR8D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">here</span></a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It refers to a file called d-Mail.msp" which I downloaded and executed, but it has not solved the problem.....</p>
<p>Looking at the settings for my ...'live.co.uk account in Windows Live Mail, the server is configured as follows :&nbsp;https://mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/sync.aspx &nbsp;- which is the setting I have used since installing Win 7 and had no problems until
 now.</p>
<p>I would appreciate some help in fixing this problem.....</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            Yes you can its a program called BlueSoleil and can be found at <a href="http://www.bluesoleil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
With the latest version of Bluesoleil that seems to work very well with Vista.<br />
<br />
Just access the phone, mine is an N95, through the pc and drag and drop the files you want moving anywhere you want, phone or memory card.<br />
<br />
by the way Robert, i've seen you blog on rotateme and was wondering if you could send me a signed copy?

<p>Gmail is suddenly and inexplicably unable to fetch mail form the 365 server. Zero settings have changed, however gmail presents this message when trying to route mail from the Office 365 server:&nbsp;Error fetching mail. Mail cannot be retrieved from this account

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. What do you mean by "Gmail is suddenly and inexplicably unable to fetch mail form the 365 server"? Can you please tell us the detailed settings?</p>
<p>2. If you delete the account from Gmail and re-configure it, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>3.Do other users in your organization have the same problem?</p>
<p>4. Do the emails work proper in Outlook Web App (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>)?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>

<p>1. I get an error message that gmail cannot recover all or some of the messages form the 365 server.</p>
<p>2. I did delete the account and readded it but the problem persists.</p>
<p>3. I haven't heard from others yet given that it's a weekend and our IT department won't answer emails then,</p>
<p>4. The emails work properly using the Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>I found a temporary workaround, which was to select the option for gmail to leave a copy of the message on the server. That is, under my old settings, gmail would route the email straight to my gmail inbox, and no copy would remain on the 365 server. However,
 that appears to no longer be a functioning option. When I do not select that option, gmail cannot fetch mail from the 365 server. However, allowing a copy of the message to remain on the 365 server, the issue is temporarily resolved. Unfortunately, this isn't
 ideal since I do not want emails that have been forwarded to gmail to remain on the 365 server.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>It seems that you configured your Gmail account to receive emails from an Office 365 mailbox using POP3. If anything is misunderstood, please let me know and describe the situation with more details so that we can assist you further.</p>
<p>If it is the situation, as OWA works fine, it indicates the Office 365 service has no problem.
</p>
<p>If you want to use your Gmail account to receive the emails sent to Office 365, I suggest you contact the Gmail support for dedicated help. This forum mainly focuses on Office 365 Business/Enterprise Online services. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For some time now I have been getting an "Unexpected error!" when I submit a reply to a post. Sometimes&nbsp;the&nbsp;content is posted anyway. Sometimes it isn't and I have to resubmit. I have recently started to click on Submit a second time when I get the message
 and it transmits OK but ... my post appears twice.</p>
<p>Any reason you can think of why this happens? I only started to notice it after the recent site maintenance.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For some time now I have been getting an "Unexpected error!" when I submit a reply to a post. Sometimes&nbsp;the&nbsp;content is posted anyway. Sometimes it isn't and I have to resubmit. I have recently started to click on Submit a second time when I get the message
 and it transmits OK but ... my post appears twice.</p>
<p>Any reason you can think of why this happens? I only started to notice it after the recent site maintenance.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Sharon</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>So, grin and bear it, eh? I never had that problem until the recent maintenance. Fix one thing and break another, I guess.</p>
<p>You actually answered more than I asked ... I've been pulling my hair out recently while using Search Forums&nbsp;(or should saying "trying" to). I have been searching with criteria that I *know* exist (usually my own posts&nbsp;when I want to copy and paste to respond
 to another). It's rare I get anything useful.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;resigned myself to the fact that Search doesn't&nbsp;work and have resorted to another method. Shame though.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Sharon</p>

            Hi Wally19 
<br />
<br />Select all those cells, right click and choose Format Cells
<br />
<br />Set Border to None, to clear those red lines
<br />
<br />Then set the color to Automatic and click the two icons indicated below:
<br />
<br />Your dialog on a Mac will be slightly different, but will have the same options . . .

<p>What DaveM121 has had you do is change the Border color of the cells which may or may not be the actual solution... It depends on whether the color is the result of a Border being applied in Numbers or whether the color actually is a property of the Gridlines.
 Essentially, Borders overprint the actual gridlines of the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Borders isn't the solution, you might try going to <strong>Excel&gt; Preferences - View</strong> to set the
<strong>Gridlines</strong> color preference to <em>Automatic</em> (or any other color in the palette).</p>

<h2>            Excel has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few of my colleagues are getting the "Excel has stopped working" error when they go to use an excel spreadsheet. It happens when they go to use a macro but it doesn't happen all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at the add-ins and there doesn't appear to be anything active. The software is up to date and including the latest patches for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do next? As it seems to happen when they start using a macro (userform) is there a way for me to understand at what point the error occurs? I personally don't see the macro being at fault because I never get the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

In some instances, Excel may stop working if it's not updated. The first thing to check before doing any troubleshooting is to make sure that your Excel program is updated.

    <title>Can clients securely upload forms to an Office 365 E3 user&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobe7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can clients securely upload forms to an Office 365 E3 user&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently migrated to Office 365 on E3 licenses.&nbsp; Now that the transition is done, I'd like to cancel our Citrix ShareFile subscription but want to ensure we're able to replace certain features, namely the ability for clients to securely upload files to
 our employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used to have a link in our email signature that allowed a client to securely upload a document to ShareFile and the designated employee would be notified.&nbsp; Is there a way to provide an upload link to OneDrive or a SharePoint library in our email signature?&nbsp;
 If so, would the upload of that document be secure?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently use a policy trigger to encrypt emails to domains outside of our company's domain.&nbsp; We are sending a secure email to clients and request that they respond to the encrypted email when delivering sensitive files to us.&nbsp; This works, but it's cumbersome
 compared to what we used from Citrix and seems to require more client education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts you're able to provide are appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Upload to Sharepoint Library from iOS OneDrive App from Apple Photos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upload to Sharepoint Library from iOS OneDrive App from Apple Photos</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello. I am using OneDrive app on my iPhone tied to my Office 365 E3 account. I have a SharePoint document library which I access on my iPhone by using OneDrive. I can upload files and photos using the OneDrive app by clicking on sites in the bottom left
 then selecting my Team site and then the folder I want to upload to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the ability to upload photos from the Apple photos native app. The option to send a file/photo to OneDrive shows up but then when selecting the destination it only lists the OneDrive personal account, I can't select my SharePoint document library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that you are planning on changing to make it more user friendly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jason</p>

<p><span>Hi </span>JasonSTS<span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Curently, </span>as announced at Ignite on 9/24/18, Camera Upload is now available for iOS for OneDrive for Business accounts's library, but it is still not available for SharePoint library.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is mainly because SharePoint library is designed for team's collaboration.&nbsp;</span>The photos on our phone mainly belongs to our own life.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the feature to support this, I would suggest you submit your idea via

<h2>            Unable to uninstall some Apps&#47;Widgets in my Nokia E5.</h2>
                    
<p><font>A few months earlier I went to Nokia care because my phone had an issue. The problem was not fixed, and my phone was replaced by another Nokia E5. In this phone whenever I try to uninstall some apps an error message "Removing
 cancelled" is appeared, and the app is not uninstalled. Following seven apps are problematic:</font></p>
<p><font>1. Twitter</font></p>
<p><font>2. MySpace</font></p>
<p><font>3. Bloomberg</font></p>
<p><font>4. AP Mobile</font></p>
<p><font>5. Chat Apps</font></p>
<p><font>6. Hi5</font></p>
<p><font>7. Friendster</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I uninstalled these apps in my old phone without any problem. I have reset the phone many times, and I have the latest version of the firmware. Please help me resolve the issue.</font></p>

<p>Hi Obaidfarooq,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to do a soft reset on your phone first by dialling *#7780# and enter the default security code 12345 if not changed. It will only restore the settings back to default one without deleting any data on your device. After doing so, try again to
 uninstall the applications/widgets on your phone by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Select Menu </li><li>Go to Ctrl. panel </li><li>Open Data&nbsp;mgr. </li><li>&nbsp;Select App. mgr. </li><li>Scroll to a application package, and select&nbsp;Options &gt; Uninstall. </li><li>Select Yes to&nbsp;confirm. </li></ol>
<p>Br,</p>

<p>What type of reset did you perform on your phone? If you haven't done hard reset, you can do this by dialing *#7370#. Default code is 12345 unless otherwise changed. This reset will delete all data saved on the device and will return settings into its default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: When creating a backup file, exclude phone settings and applications, just to make sure. If these are not pre-installed apps, it will be removed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the outlook client, it's easy to change the properties to view the number of items in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On outlook.com however, I cannot figure how to do this. It only shows the number of messages that are unread in each folder but what I want to see how many messages are in a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we do this in outlook.com?</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When an account is upgraded to Outlook Mail, the only way to&nbsp;view&nbsp;the number of emails in a folder is to select all emails and then to mark all as unread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the check box to the left of the folder name at the top of the message pane will select all items in view.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1765518f-1954-494e-ae5c-22e482b0ebc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1765518f-1954-494e-ae5c-22e482b0ebc4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have the option to Select everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4eae87c-9f36-4555-a186-729bedb35caf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4eae87c-9f36-4555-a186-729bedb35caf" /></a></p>
<p>This changes to show that everything in the folder is selected instead of showing how many emails are selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2185c06e-b4c0-4b5f-88dd-9a2b2f665623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2185c06e-b4c0-4b5f-88dd-9a2b2f665623" /></a></p>
<p>Now that everything is selected, right click on a message and select Mark as unread.</p>
<p>The unread count will be the number of emails in the folder.</p>
<p>Right click on a message, Mark as read.</p>
<p>Click on Clear all check boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is needed is the actual count of messages selected.</p>

Now if only someone could figure out how to write an email rule that would actually work and a way to get the search feature to work like it used to I would be a very happy lady.&nbsp; I've spent hours searching for help on this and other forums and your solution
 is the only one I can find so far.</p>

            Had already read and followed the instructions at that link Mohammed.&nbsp; The problem started when I got switched from outlook.com to outlook.live.com.&nbsp; It is impossible to add a new rule that actually works.&nbsp; Luckily all my old rules are still working, it
 is only the new ones that do not work.&nbsp; I am not alone, there are many others with the same problem going by the number of threads on the subject in the forums.<br />

<p>We understand that you want audible notifications in your Microsoft account so you won't miss out on any if the urgent emails you received from your contacts. However, the feature you are looking for is currently not availble in Outlook.com. As a workaround,
 you can configure your account in an email client like Microsoft Office Outlook or Windows Live Mail so you can setup an audio notification for your incoming emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will use <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2735989/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Open .mdi file or convert to another format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinlavelle_uc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open .mdi file or convert to another format</h2>
                    An instrument I work with will only export images using the .mdi format, which it appears is not supported in Office 2011 for Mac (or any other version of Office for Mac for that matter).&nbsp; Is there any way to either open this file on a mac or convert to
 a format which will open on a Mac?<br />
<br />
Preferably a solution that would involve freeware, or at least not running bootcamp or parallels just to run Windows and install the Windows version of Office 2003.&nbsp; This is the only solution I have seen offered in my Google searches, and I feel like there
 must be an easier way.<br />

here</a> for more information<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am just wondering if there is some sort of app or utility available to convert these files into a more common format available for Mac.&nbsp; The only solutions I have seen so far involve expensive Adobe software packages or running the Windows version
 of Office using either Bootcamp or Parallels, as mentioned in my previous post.<br />
<br />
In order to solve my problem I had to open in Microsoft Office Document Imaging on a Windows machine running Office 2003, then copy the image and paste it into paint, and finally resave it as a .JPEG file.&nbsp; Although it was an option to resave as .TIF in Microsoft
 Office Document Imaging, when I did so, I was unable to open the file in Mac OS, even when using programs that normally open .TIF formatted images with no difficulty.<br />
<br />
Even though I have solved my problem for now, I would still love to know about it if there is a less roundabout solution available since I wasted probably 4 hours out of what could have otherwise been a productive day getting this to work.<br />

            which means that if MDI is all the instrument is capable of producing, Kevin will have to do the conversion in Windows (whether under Bootallelafusion or natively).

            <p>Sorry. I should have qualified my quotation with the advice to check the settings on on the device that is making the MDI files and see if it also supports making multi-page files in another format. Dealing with the problem at the source of the problem is
 sometimes an option.</p>

<p>I could not find a free software (but I didn't check every possible candidate) solution. There is this site that offers a converter:</p>

<h2>            bugs in outlook.com</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've found some bugs in outlook.com and fixed at 2nd or 3rd attempt. I assume this is due to javascript<br />
<br />
1. If you have multiple alias/additional account. When composing/reply/forward, the from address only show the main microsoft account. At 2nd/3rd attempt, it will show all my alias/linked account<br />
2. When forwarding email with attachment, sometimes it doesn't attach the file. At 2nd/3rd attempt it will attach<br />
<br />
I really like outlook.com but this bug is very annoying when using from browser.<br />
<br />
Please don't tell me to "optimize" my browser as it happens randomly (but quite frequent!) and it happens to all browser that I tried (safari, firefox, chrome).<br />
<br />
I hope you recognize this bug and fix it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this issue?<br />

            I always use latest browser, and the issue is intermittent regardless of which computer/OS that I use<br />
<br />
I use chrome, firefox, IE8, safari.<br />
<br />
If you bother to test it yourself, I believe you can find this bug. <br />
<br />
Try to add non microsoft account to your outlook.com at your account section, eg: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
I believe from time to time you will encounter this issue<br />
<br />
I didn't make any changes<br />
<br />
I report this bug to get solved permanently, and the issue is definitely not in my side/specific account as it's working on the 2nd or 3rd try.<br />

<p>2. JPG</p>
<p>3. APP troubleshooter doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>4. The Photo app and all other apps are updated.</p>

            Hi Steve<br />
<br />
To my knowledge (xl2003), a control use a font formatting which is general, meaning you cannot change the font/style for a single word or letter but only for the entire content.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
JT<br />

            <p>I think you would need to use conditional formatting on your cell that has the data validation dropdown applied.&nbsp; But I don't think you will be able to get different formatting in the list items when the dropdown is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if your data validation is applied to cell E5, you could use this formula in the conditional formatting:</p>
<p>=OR(E5="xx",E5="yy")</p>
<p>and apply the formatting as required.&nbsp; The above formula will trigger the cf if the user selects either "xx" or "yy" in the dropdown in cell E5.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

<h2>            Formatting Issues &#40;Word 2010 -&#62; Word 2007&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I would not have thought there would be any issues from Word 2010 to Word 2007, but occationally I have encoutered a change in formatting when opening a file made with 2010 in 2007.</p>
<p>When I create a document in Word 2010, I will send it to staff with Word 2007. The document looks great on my computer, but when they open it, it looks terrible.</p>
<p>This is also happening to a number of my students. They will create there document in Word 2010, and when the person opens it in Word 2007, the formatting is completely off. I have seen this happen frequently when the student is using Tab Stop in the ruler.</p>
<p>Is there any fix to this? I have suggested my students save their Work as PDF when sending their resume out, but I am wondering if there is any other kind of fix. Or any method to test a document before sending.</p>

<p>The way in which the document appears, will be dependent upon the printer that is active.&nbsp; If appearance is important, then using pdf is the best option.</p>

<p>Please describe exactly HOW the document looks terrible. Investigate to see if you can find specific features that cause the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A possibility is that you are using 2010 features that are not supported in 2007. The most obvious one is Home tab / Font group / Text Effects command. In theory when you read the file in 2007 the effect should simply not be displayed.</p>
<p>It is a sad reality that moving documents between versions of Office is not a sure thing. Depending on the specific Word features you use, sometimes problems like those you describe happen. Another problem that can arise if you both edit the document is
 eventual file corruption. Neither of you will be able to use the file.</p>
<p>Just thought of another option. Create an empty file in Word 2007 and save it. Use the blank doc as the base to create new documents in 2010. In explorer, just copy the blank file, then open the copy in 2010 to create the doc. 2010 will open the 2007 file
 in "Compatibility Mode". That is OK, it just means that only 2007 features are supported.</p>
<p>Another option you can try is saving the files in RTF format. It is a slightly more portable format, but even that is not a guarantee, many years ago I tried it as a workaround and it only worked for a short while.</p>
<p>I think it is a minor failing of Office 2010 that the apps cannot create 2007 DOCX formatted files (as it can create 2003 DOC files), files that will run in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Save as PDF IS the best answer for sharing finished files, especially resume's.</p>
<p>To expand on Doug's suggestion. If you both don't happen to have the same printer, decide on a common printer and make sure that you both have<strong>exactly</strong> the same printer driver installed. If the printer driver is the problem, even if one of
 you don't can't use the printer to print, just selecting it may be enough to allow viewing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thought, when you are sharing files, if you only need to read them, not edit or mark them up MS has 2007 and 2010 viewers that you can download to read the files. That may be enough to avoid the formatting problems you see.</p>

I am NOT "MS". I am someone between jobs with too much time on their hands.<br />

Do you have a better alternative than PDF? MS doesn't seem to think PDF is a "different product" since they have built in saving / printing to PDF format.<br />
