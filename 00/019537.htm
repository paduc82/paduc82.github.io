<p>Assuming you mean the number of fields in the data source, and not the number of Merge fields you have placed in your document (AFAIK the limit for that is either "available memory" or very large indeed), then</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. as Doug says, it depends on the data source. But it can also depend on how Word connects to the data source. For example, if you connect to an Excel data source, there are at least 4 ways Word might do it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- converter (obsolete - you can still try it if you have it, but I wouldn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- DDE (basically obsolete, but can sometimes still be used)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- ODBC (obsolescent since Word 2002, roughly)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- OLE DB (the default in Word 2003 and 2007)</p>
<p>For DDE, ODBC and OLE DB with Excel there is a limit of 255 (or 256, I forget) columns. With Excel 2007, which supports many more columns, the mailmerge limit is still 255/256 columns. Personally, I have sometimes experienced a more sever limit on DDE connections
 to Excel in 2007 &nbsp;- AFAICR in 2003 there was no problem with 255, but in 2007 I have sometimes only been able to use about 70-75 (that might be something to do with the version of Windows and/or performance factors).</p>
<p>AFAIK all the "desktop database drivers" (except possibly the SQL Server one) impose a 255 column limit. The desktop database drivers are used for ODBC and OLE DB connections to Excel, Access, and via Access, to some other types of data source such as dBASE).</p>
<p>When connecting to delimited text files, Word may connect using the Access driver/provider, in which case there's a 255 limit, or using its internal text converter, in which case you may find that you can use 1000 columns or more. However, that seems to
 be limited more by the line length and perhaps complexity of the file than by the column count itself, and the limitations may well be more severe in Word 2007 than Word 2003. I've never found a formula to predict this.</p>
<p>With SQL Server sources I believe that with the right SQL Server+provider you should be able to go well beyond the 255 limit, and perhaps up to the maximum number of columns in a SQL Server table. (The same may well be true of other Server databases such
 as Oracle).</p>
<p>One other limitation is the number of field names that Word will display in its dropdowns (e.g. in field picklists) and the number of columns it will display in Edit Recipients. Those may be limited to a fixed number, or in the case of Edit Recipients, AFAICR
 there is a fixed maximum, but record size may reduce that. (There's also a maximum row count in Edit recipients.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many possible limits. (Number of columns, number of rows, and so on). Can you ask your co-workers precisely which limits they are hitting?</p>

<p>Well, I don't really have anything to add. The chances are that the users want to add more columns, and the limit on the mailmerge column count (i.e. the number of columns you can use from Excel) is 255, maximum, as I said earlier. Office 2007 won't change
 that. The only reasonably simple way that you /might/ gain in Office 2007 would be to use more columns in Excel, then export the data as a .csv format and try to use that as the data source. However, if you want to try that I would recommend that whatever
 approach you try, you</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. determine how many more columns your users are likely to need</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. test the scenario very thoroughly with as much real data as possible before even thinking about committing to an upgrade.</p>
<p>The problem is that it would typically be very difficult to move away from a solution based on Excel, i.e. something that everyone knows how to work with. Personally I would favour an approach based on SQL Server, but if you don't already have SQL Server
 facilities that's a huge change, and I don't personally know of a data entry tool that could easily replace Excel (unfortunately, although it is possible to use SQL Server facilities to import Excel data, or link to Excel data, I believe they suffer from the
 same 255 column limit.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that they need more than 255 columns, but they don't need more than 255 for any one merge. e.g., they might store all the data in one workbook, and they might need 300 columns to do it (you'd need Excel 2007 for that). But then merge
 "A" might only need 20 or them and merge B might need 30 (say). In that scenario (pretty unlikely is my guess) you could consider keeping the 300-column version as your "master data" and using VBA or perhaps Excel spreadsheet functions to extract the columns
 you need for each merge.</p>
<p>Best I can do on the available information!</p>

            <p>I don't think you <em>need</em> multiple MSA's but you might <em>want</em> to use multiple accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you sign into the preview with an MSA, you connect to services like outlook.com, OneDrive, etc. So if you use your normal account the preview software could mess up your live data. People who prefer to keep a test environment completely separate probably
 would use an extra account 😉</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It's still unclear how the free upgrade from Windows 7/8 works, especially if you need to reinstall Windows 10 at a later time. From some remarks it seems that the upgrade license is somewhat connected to the MSA used during the upgrade, but AFAIK Microsoft
 hasn't spilled the details yet. I'd keep an eye on that and use an account for the upgrade to who ever might have to reinstall Windows will have access to.</p>

    <title>Before Update Not Sufficient Control For Child Fields - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robnetco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Before Update Not Sufficient Control For Child Fields</h2>
                    Friends,<br />
<br />
For almost any record on my input forms I use Before_Update event to check for missing values and duplicates. This is a common and effective way to prevent updates with bad or missing data. However, I would like to create a simple control on a parent record
 to check for information in the child record, but, with this more complicated dynamic, I'm having some issues.<br />
<br />
In Form-A, with addition of Record-1, I want to make sure values in the subform are not null before I update. The problem obviously is, once I move to input values in the subform, focus leaves the parent record, the before_update is run, and the control cannot
 be met. If I enter subform values first, before a new parent value the link wont be made between the two, in the parent child relationship.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to extend the Before Update control to updates to the Child/Subform records, essentially treating them as additional fields of the same parent record?<br />
<br />
OR...<br />
<br />
A work around I'm tinkering with is with OnCurrent. A far as I know, OnCurrent event acts when you switch to another record. Maybe I can set a control on the Parent Record values with Before_Update, THEN set a control for the Child Values in On_Current? However,
 I cant figure out how to narrow the On_Current control to executing&nbsp; ONLY when there is a New or Updated Parent record. I don't want every time I go from record to record for it to execute my control. Suggestions?<br />
<br />

            Firstly, what you are asking for, i.e. that a row in a referenced table only be committed to the table if all constraints on rows in a referencing table are satisfied, is impossible in a correctly designed relational database.&nbsp; In a relational database
 a row in the referencing table must exist before a matching row can be inserted into a referencing table.&nbsp; Consequently you cannot enforce any constraints in the referencing table before the row in the parent table is saved.<br />
<br />
In a form/subform, where the relationship type between the form's and subform's tables is one-to-many, the above is reflected by the fact that, as soon as focus is moved from the parent form to the subform, the data in the parent form is committed to a row
 in the referenced table.<br />
<br />
What you have to do to replicate a constraint that no row can exist in a referenced table if any row in a referencing table fails to meet one or more constraints, is prevent the parent form moving off the current record, including by closing the form, until
 the constraints in all rows in the subform's table which reference the parent form's current record have been met.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This cannot actually be done per se, so has to be replicated by doing the enforcement when the parent form moves to another record, i.e. in the form's Current event procedure.&nbsp; This will execute when the form moves to the next record, including an empty new
 record, so if the constraints are not met the parent form is immediately moved back to the record whose referencing records do not meet the constraints.<br />
<br />
An example of this is illustrated in Families.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
In my case the only constraint is that at least one matching row should exist in the referencing table, so the code for the parent form's Current event is relatively simple:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Form_Current()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const conCRITERIA = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NOT EXISTS(" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT * " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM FamilyMembers " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE FamilyMembers.FamilyName = Families.FamilyName)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varFamilyName As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varFamilyName = DLookup("FamilyName", "Families", conCRITERIA)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(varFamilyName) And varFamilyName &lt;&gt; Nz(Me.FamilyName, "") Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "A row for family " &amp; varFamilyName &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " must be entered in the Family Members table."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.RecordsetClone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "FamilyName = """ &amp; varFamilyName &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .NoMatch Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Bookmark = .Bookmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strMessage, vbExclamation, "Incomplete Data"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
You could adapt this to establish and loop through a recordset of all rows in the referencing table, and, where any violation of a constraint in a row in the referencing table is encountered in a row, immediately exit the loop and move the form to the record
 in the referenced table which that row references.&nbsp; However, this would raise the question why such a row exists in the first place, rather than the insertion of a row into the referencing table via the subform being prohibited until all constraints have been
 satisfied.&nbsp; This would then mean that the only uncovered constraint would be that at least one referencing row exists per parent record, which is what my demo enforces.<br />
<br />
The similar code to enforce this if the user attempts to close the from without a row existing in the referencing table goes in the parent form's Unload event procedure as below:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const conCRITERIA = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NOT EXISTS(" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT * " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM FamilyMembers " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE FamilyMembers.FamilyName = Families.FamilyName)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varFamilyName As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varFamilyName = DLookup("FamilyName", "Families", conCRITERIA)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(varFamilyName) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "A row for family " &amp; varFamilyName &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " must be entered in the Family Members table."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strMessage, vbExclamation, "Incomplete Data"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.RecordsetClone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "FamilyName = """ &amp; varFamilyName &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .NoMatch Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Bookmark = .Bookmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
The other approach illustrated in my demo is to use an unbound form and insert rows into both the referenced and referencing tables simultaneously in a Transaction.&nbsp; This makes for rather clumsy interface, however.&nbsp; The above approach, using a bound form/subform
 is more intuitive for users.<br />

            Thank you Ken,<br />
<br />
I will sparse your public Family DB and your code recommendations when I have some extra time. Sounds like what I was thinking -- i.e. using On Current.<br />
<br />
At the moment I have a few deadlines, and wanted to counter your elaborate example with my attempted solution/work around wich is a bit more contrite.<br />
<br />
I created a solution using Form_Current procedure&nbsp; where I create a Recordset from the Child table, filter it by the ID in the Parent table,, to create a FilteredRS of Child Table that should match Parent record selections<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
IF Parent record value = FilteredRS.Field.Value Then <br />
'Nothing: blank to blank okay, match to match okay<br />
Else<br />
'Value to blank: message<br />
Response = MsgBox("Please enter Child Values", 0, "TEST", 0, 0)<br />
End If<br />
<br />
This seems works accept for one thing, OnCurrent tests the record I'm going to, not which one I;m leaving from. In that case, they are all match to match between Parent.Value and FilteredRS (Child/subform).Value. How can I adjust to fix? If there is no quick
 solution, I'll read through your db a bit later. Thank you again.<br />

            The Current event procedure executes when the form moves <em>to</em> a record, not when it
<em>leaves </em>one, so I think the only solution is to navigate back to the previously selected record, which is what my demo does.

<p><span><span>Unfortunately, due to the nature of bound forms, AND that of relational databases, you have to ALWAYS add the parent record first, and then start adding child records. This is a basic
 requirement of ALL relational databases. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, you really can’t skip above.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are two ways over the many years I used to solve this problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first approach is a real mess. That approach is to either attempt some un-bound (disconnected recordsets). A real pain.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The next possible approach is to pull the data from the back end, and fill some local tables, and edit that way (and thus either commit/update the data, or bail out). But this can be
 a pain because you have to deal with rows added, deleted, and edited.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A lot of systems allow you to “edit as a whole” the master record, and sub recodes, and then have one submit button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, because access uses a bound forms model, then ANY TIME you break free of this model, then things become rather nasty.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, over the years, the best and most simple solution was a post flag column added to the main record.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What I then do is allow the user to freely edit. Perhaps even close the form, go for coffee or do other tasks.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, then what I do is have a post button. And I say the user is entering a batch of dentations, then they enter the user, time of day, the event, and then start entering their
 work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the end of the work flow, I then provide a post button. This routine checks all the data, and if criteria is missing, then they are prevented from posting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, my screen looks like this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a11dd08f-5981-4530-826f-6bb5a8386c06?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a11dd08f-5981-4530-826f-6bb5a8386c06?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note the post batch button. It simply does not allow the posting status to become true until such time that the data meets the criteria I want.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In above, we have a classic QuickBooks type of distribution for a given check (donation). The amount is entered, and then they can enter several accounts to distribute the amount(s)
 over several accounts. And of course, the total has to MATCH the total donation amount. If the totals don’t add up, then the posting routine will inform the user of this issue, and they are not allowed to “close” or post their run of work.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course, the post button does not really post anything but simply checks the data, and if good, then the post status is set = True.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The OTHER big advantage is once posted, then users are prevented from editing or modifying the data.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And note how I even have conditional formatting go “green” when your balance matches.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, users are free to enter nice and fast, free to sip on coffee, and this speed up data entry rather fast, and if the phone rings, then they can exit, go enter or look up data, and
 then go back to their posting event.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In effect, what I am suggesting is you allow the data to be entered, and either like above, allow them to post their whole session of work, or perhaps you could provide a post button
 on the main part of the form. If they hit the post button, then you check the data to be correct, and then set the posting status = true, and you can also then thus prevent further editing based on this status. I even have a special admin password to by-pass
 this posting flag and allow the accountant to un-post if further editing is required, but only the special user has this ability.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Because we can’t wrap the main one record, and the many child records in a transaction, then the above “fake” of a posting concept works rather well. You then as a developer are free
 to build up a nice user interface and experience, and the additional step of posting is a final check of their work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, your form might not be like the above in which you have a "work run". However, adding some kind of post button often will get around the Access limitation of not being able to
 edit a master + child form as a "single" object or thing which of course you, and your users are thinking of when they hit "save" or now a "post" button.

            Ken, after looking at this a little more in depth, Unload works great! If "childless"&nbsp; active parent record does not meet your criterion of -- essentially being "childless" --- closing or navigating somewhere else is canceled.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Current procedure however, I'm still a little lost. I cant see exactly how you "navigate back" to active parent record in the face of the Current event procedure, which moves forward and seems to set the Critereon to the NEXT record. I don't even see a
 Cancel event, which would seem necessary to holt the movement of one record to the next upon criterion failure. What am I missing?

            Thanks Albert. Seems like a fair enough work around. But the post update Boolean value in the parent record is nominal only. In my DB having the parent records (Customers) reference one or more child records (Reports) accurately and in real time requires
 just more than a visual identifier/checkbox.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to opt for Kens suggestion in testing the relationship between parent and child before exiting the parent record, whether that is with Current, RecordExit, Unload, Deactivate or whatever. Thank you though. I'll keep this solution in mind.<br />

            Also, what about RecordExit even procedure. It seems like it would be perfect for this, but I cannot find it in the Form Event properties tab. Yet I've seen references to this event before, including here..<br />

<p>You must forget about trying to validate rows in a referencing table before the row in the referenced table is committed to the table; it’s a hiding to nothing.&nbsp; It's fundamentally impossible in a database in which referential integrity is enforced, and
 referential integrity must be enforced if the database is to be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>The Current procedure however, I'm still a little lost. I cant see exactly how you "navigate back" to active parent record in the face of the Current event procedure, which moves forward and seems to set
 the Critereon to the NEXT record. I don't even see a Cancel event, which would seem necessary to holt the movement of one record to the next upon criterion failure. What am I missing?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>As far as navigating back to the previous record is concerned, the term 'previous' is only accurate here in terms of the user's perception of what happens.&nbsp; Because the routines in my demo force the deletion of any row in the referenced table which does
 not have at least one matching row in the refencing table before the form can, from the user's perspective, 'leave' that record, there can only ever be one record to navigate back to.&nbsp; This is done by applying the following subquery as the criterion&nbsp; for a
 DLookup function call:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const conCRITERIA = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NOT EXISTS(" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT * " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM FamilyMembers " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE FamilyMembers.FamilyName = Families.FamilyName)"<br />
<br />
BTW, I should perhaps point out that I've used family names as a key in the demo for simplicity.&nbsp; In an operational database this would not be done of course, as family names can legitimately be duplicated, so are unsuitable as keys.<br />
<br />
If the DLookup function call returns a Null the form is moved to the relevant record with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.RecordsetClone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "FamilyName = """ &amp; varFamilyName &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .NoMatch Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Bookmark = .Bookmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
<br />
Enforcing a constraint through the interface is not bulletproof of course.&nbsp; Rows could be inserted into the referenced table by some other means, thus subverting the constraint.&nbsp; I've not tried it, but I think it would be possible to enforce the constraint
 completely if (a) the rows are inserted into both tables in a Transaction via an unbound form, and (b) a CHECK CONSTRAINT is applied to the referenced table, Families in my demo.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom has it that a Transaction must be 'atomic', which means
 that constraints are not implemented immediately.&nbsp; Chris Date has lot to say about this, and argues, against the conventional wisdom, maintaining that all constraints should be applied immediately, which would of course rule out the constraint you are trying
 to apply.&nbsp; I suspect that Access, and probably all relational database products, adopt the principle of atomic transactions, however.&nbsp; When I have the time I'll try it with my demo.&nbsp; I'd have to add a second set of tables for this of course; the CHECK CONSTRAINT
 would undermine the bound form solution in my demo otherwise.<br />

            This makes a little more sense. I'm going to tinker with this, but this all seems like a lot for a simple parent to child validation. Some of it is a liitle over my head, but that's good. We have enough Access level projects here where I should brush up
 on some more of these complicated solutions.<br />

<h2>            Cannot login to outlook account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following issue: When I did the setup of my Lumia phone I create outlook.com account and used some dummy phone number like 12345. I forgot also my password. Now&nbsp; I need to sing in in order to download apps from the market, but I cannot confirm
 my Microsoft (outlook) account because I don't know my password. When trying to reset it, I cannot use the dummy phone number, so I did it the other way, with secret questions providing contact names from my skype account etc, tried it 9 times and every time
 I get the message, that the info is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Now I want to avoid my password, so is there any other way how to reset the password so that I can login in the microsoft account?<br />

            I think your only option is to reset it go to the about setting and tap reset make sure you have reset protection of if you have it and backup first after the reset you will need to set your phone up again make sure you set it up as a new device and don't
 use a dummy phone number

    <title>No OneNote Mobile Sync option on WMDC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricardo gon&#231;alves99  say:</h3>
<h2>            No OneNote Mobile Sync option on WMDC</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody, this is my first post so please don't joke if I get anything wrong. ;D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all the information required:</p>
<p>Phone Manufacturer: Ndrive</p>
<p>Phone Model: S400</p>
<p>Mobile Operator: Vodafone P</p>
<p>Phone OS: Windows Mobile 6.1</p>
<p>Phone Mobile Office: V12.0.4518.1055 (Office Mobile 2007 I guess)</p>
<p>Zune: Doesn't have it</p>
<p>Computer OS: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 X64</p>
<p>Computer Office Version: Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>1. I've already had a huge problem with Windows Mobile Device Center today that was crashing everytime I would start it I will leave my solution below.</p>
<p>2. When&nbsp;I choose the options I want to synchronize with my Windows Mobile Device I do not have the One Note option, so I'm not able to synchronize my Computer Notes with my device and vice-versa. This problem I wasn't able to fix I've already tried various
 solutions from multiple forums and still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution to my first problem:&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Reinstalling the Windows Mobile Device Center isn't enought, you must delete the WindowsMobile folder in "X:\\Windows\" and then reinstall Windows Mobile Device Center, this&nbsp;should do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping for answers</p>

            Unfortunately, I believe the OneNote implementation on windows mobile is fatally broken.&nbsp; I've never been able to sync OneNote files between my computer and windows mobile device even after spending several hours trying to make it work.&nbsp; I eventually gave
 up and continued using the Notes application I had been using all along (<a href="http://www.phatware.com/index.php?q=product/details/phatnotes/windowsmobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PhatNotes)</a>,&nbsp; which syncs beautifully to my computer.<br />

<p>It's not broken I have a Netbook with Windows XP SP3, Office 2007 and Active Sync 4.5 and it does work.</p>
<p>There must be a fix for this&nbsp;I hope</p>

<h2>            Bing Ads account  support</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am new to Bing and I created an ad about 10 days ago. It was all working fine but now my account has been closed. I have contacted the chat help, but they can't tell me as to why? I have just received a follow up email saying my account will remain closed!
 How can I correct the issue ( whatever it may have been ) if I am unable to log back in? I have tried to set up another account with the same Email address and it will not let me.
</p>
<p>What do I do to get this resolved please?</p>

<h2>            Deactivate Product Key &#38; Reactivate</h2>

When I have gone into my account on office.com it is not listed however so I am unable to deactivate it.<br />

            We need to know exactly what version of Publisher you bought.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have the Office Publisher 2013, 1-computer retail license, then you do have the right to transfer it to a new machine.&nbsp; Since you are getting the too many activations message, you will have to do a phone activation.&nbsp; When you phone in, don't reply to
 the initial prompts, you'll just get the same error. Instead, wait until you are offered the option of talking to a live service rep. Explain the problem including that you have already uninstalled from "old" machine. They should allow the activation to go
 through.<br />
<br />
You are getting this message because while the activation system is smart enough to recognize that you are installing on a new machine, MS never made any automated accommodation for license transfers. The Uninstall process does not actually notify the MS Activation
 site that you have uninstalled. They just assume that you will be re-installing on same machine.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have Office Publisher 365, then you should be able to use the My Account page to deactivate the current installation.<br />

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. We would like to confirm if you were able to perform the steps provided on the given link. Additionally, we suggest that you perform the troubleshooting steps below to isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Verify that your account user name, password, and other settings are correct in Account preferences.</p>
<p>2. Your ISP or network has a firewall that blocks connections to your e-mail service's outgoing mail (SMTP) server. Check if your ISP or network administrator can provide an alternative SMTP server to use for your IMAP account.</p>
<p>3. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, etc. feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us and let us know the result.</p>

            <p>Hi billyboy141,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply open up your zune software and then go to Marketplace. Select Apps for Zune HD and start downloading. After that sync them to your device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to see apps for Zune HD Players, that means you are signed in with a Windows Live ID that is set to a country where no Zune Players are available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How To Connect to Internet Using Your Mobile - Nokia&#39;s Answer</h2>
                    Further to my earlier posts on this subject I now have Nokia's definitive answer to connectivity problems. The full text of their answer to my query is below.<br />
<br />
Although it refers to my model E65 I am sure it applies to other models. Hope it works<br />
<br />
Vic Blake<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
Nokia Care.<br />
<br />
Ensure that you are using the Nokia PC Suite's 'Connect to the Internet' option to use your phone as a modem. The Nokia PC Suite is available for download at the following link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4144905</a><br />
<br />
In order to use your Nokia E65 as a modem for your laptop, please refer to the following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Network access: an operator agreement for your Nokia E65 that includes GPRS or 3G data transfer.<br />
<br />
2. A compatible Windows - based laptop with a USB port.<br />
<br />
3. A Nokia connectivity Cable CA-53.<br />
<br />
4. Install Nokia Pc Suite software on you laptop and do not connect the USB connectivity cable before or during the Pc Suite installation.<br />
<br />
5. When the Nokia Pc Suite installation is finished, Nokia Pc Suite will automatically launch the Get Connected Wizard. The on screen instruction will guide you to connect the USB connectivity cable to your laptop and to your Nokia E65.<br />
<br />
6. The default connection setting will appear on your phone screen. Select Pc Suite.<br />
<br />
7. Nokia Pc Suite will install the cable drivers. This installation may take a few moments and you may be asked to accept the multiple driver installation.<br />
<br />
8. Once your Nokia Pc Suite have been installed, you can connect to the internet using "One Touch Access"<br />
<br />
9. Start Nokia Pc Suite on your laptop.<br />
<br />
10. In the Pc Suite main menu, click on connect to the internet. This will open the "One Touch Access"<br />
<br />
11. Click connect on the "One Touch Access" screen to establish internet connection.<br />
<br />
12. When the "One Touch Access" appears on your laptop, make sure that the Nokia USB modem is selected under "Connection will be established using" and that a green G is displayed next to it. If Not you may refer to the following:<br />
<br />
1. Click Setting<br />
<br />
2. Select the Nokia USB setting for your Device from the menu<br />
<br />
3. Click Next<br />
<br />
4. Select your network operator from the list or configure the connection manually. For manual configuration kindly refer to your network provider for the configuration.<br />
<br />
5. Click finish.

<h3> markhaefner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing booklet in Word -  blank pages</h2>
                    <p>Anyone having trouble in the last week printing in booklet mode from Word? I didn't make any changes that I know of and now booklets that used to print fine, print with even pages blank, except for the last page. I have tried changing settings, but nothing
 seems to help. I can export to PDF and that works fine. It does the same thing on different printers. It just seems to be a problem with booklet mode.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also just discovered this problem. Documents that we printed a week ago without any problem, suddenly won't print properly with a booklet fold. Glad to know it isn't just us. In the mean time, we're converting the document to a PDF and printing it from
 there, but I will be very happy when Microsoft fixes it, as we use this function on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Thanks. I had figured out how to export to PDF and print a booklet there. It works, but the quality is not quite as good. Hopefully they will get this problem fixed soon. I, and others, use the booklet print multiple times a week.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I save attachments by right clicking on them and "save all attachments".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since each e-mail is normally a separate task, I make a new directory during the save process, and then save the attachments to the new directory.&nbsp; Occasionally, when I review the attachments, I realize they need to be moved to a different location, and/or
 the directory needs to be renamed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would normally close all of the attachments and try to perform the move or rename.&nbsp; Even with the files closed, MS Office does not want to "let go" of the files.&nbsp; While this happens most frequently with Outlook, it has also been known to happen with Word
 and Excel sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that I normally have multiple windows and files going at one time, so that requires me to save everything, close the files, and exit the programs, just so I can move the new directory (if I wait until later, sometimes I forget).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice&nbsp;if the MS Office programs would simply release the files.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried both, and the problem remains. &nbsp;I even did a complete uninstall/reinstall on MS Office with no change in the way it works.</p>
<p>The Microsoft office programs simply do not release the files when they are closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is a fairly significant flaw with the system.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you tried No Add-ons mode as indicated above? Did you run BhoRemover (its called<br />
SpyBHOremover now).<br />
<br />
Run malwarebytes to see if there is anything detected.<br />
<br />
McAfee may have a role and the only way to test (after doing the check in the troubleshooter<br />
above first) is to uninstall it since merely disabling it will still allow it to load pieces of itself.<br />
Uninstall McAfee and run the McAfee Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants from<br />
being left behind. Below are recommendations to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />
<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />

Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> averawc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using portrait and landscape slide orientation in same presentation</h2>
                    
<p>The MS help and online help must leave out some small detail on how to do this as I have tried every one many times and have gotten no where.</p>
<p>It seems that after selecting the "Other PowerPoint Presentation" in step 1.3 of MS PowerPoint Help, step 5 asks to select the slide to use; however, the only slides offered are the ones in Presentation 1, not the ones I want to link to in Presentation 2.</p>
<p>If so, how do I get there?</p>
<p>If not, what am I doing or not doing to make this work?</p>

<p>When you choose another PowerPoint presentation you will only see the "Select Slide " pop up dialog if there are more than one slide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know though trying to use portrait and landscape slides in one presentation doesn't really work the portrait slides will still be the same height as the landscape slides either on screen or projected. You can get the same effect by placing two black
 rectanges over some slides to create a letterbox effect.</p>

</p><p>however, every time I try to use file/save as/save database as/package and sign, I get a dialog to confirm certificate</p>
<p>
</p><p>but accepting it just brings up a message that says "this certificate is explicitly marked unfit for code signing. &nbsp;please choose another certificate"</p>
<p>
</p><p>this never happened with Access 2007; I do not know where the existing certificate came from</p>

<p>
</p><p>It appears the rules for digitally signing a database have been tightened, and from the error message it appears your cert is specifically marked not to be used for digital signing.</p>
<p>You *might* be able to create a valid cert using selfcert.exe, or of course you could buy one from a Certificate Authority.</p>

            <p>Tom, thank you for your response</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that selfcert.exe was on my PC; I was able to use it to create a certificate that Access 2016 would accept for signing, so I'm past that issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was disappointed to read about the Packaging Wizard being eliminated with Access 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now need to figure out a way to package up and distribute my application [I actually have several that previously easily packaged with the 2007 Wizard]</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, that would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>

            <p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now successfully used SSESetup to make functioning installers</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my experiences so far, the SSESetup seems a little unstable, and it tends to lock up its own created folders if it encounters a packaging error; otherwise, it does get the job done</p>
<p>
</p><p>one issue remaining is the security warning when installing and launching the installed accdr file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did make a certificate using SelfCert, and was able to use MMC to export that certificate</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the SelfCert certificate is a Px7, and it seems that SSESetup requires a Px12?</p>
<p>
</p><p>so it looks like I'll have to live with the install/launch security warnings unless anyone knows of a solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked into buying a certificate, but for my purposes here, the cost seems ridiculous as my intended distributions are very few and very private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I have added the [required] install folder to the ACCDR's trusted locations, but that does not seem to work on the installation system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have verified that my Access 2016 accdr works OK using Access 2013 Runtime; but I found that I had to use the 32 bit version of the Runtime</p>

            <p>You can have SSESetup created Trusted Locations for the folder the app is installed to, which should eliminate the security message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest problem was that Chrome would not allow the download at all, and IE gave a warning that the file was from an unknown vendor. A digital Signature would eliminate that.</p>

            <p>Thanks Scott; I'll look into the SSESetup trusted folders and see if I can figure that out</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had tried using Chrome; got the same as you; installer would not download at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did use IE but saw same warnings as you</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUICK UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made an updated installer with SSESetup; this time I set Access2013 as a prerequisite and this then also allowed me to specify the trusted folder solution; a quick test verified that the security warning on app launch was gone</p>

<h2>            Issue with upgrading to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Caught between Tech Preview and Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I installed Windows 10 Tech Preview. It was a clean install rather than an upgrade, as I also added a SSD at the time and installed onto that. After I was satisfied it was working, I deleted the Windows partition on my old hard disk. Now the
 licence on my preview is running out, I followed the instructions to upgrade. the first time, the upgrade crashed irreparably, so I had to do another clean install of the preview. Now the upgrade wants a product key from me, but the only key I have is the
 one on the preview ISO, which it won't accept. So now it looks like I have no way to go back and no way to go forward!</p>

            you can go forward, just skip the product key twice. Windows 10 does not require a key like before

<p>It's not your internet settings as they don't affect memory, it's the cookies and saved searches, passwords etc that build up as you use the browser, every so often you need to clear your privacy data which will give you some space back, in browser select
 options, clear privacy data, clear all !</p>

            <p>Hi Efrain, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information I want to say that build 10049 is the recent build from us. I would request you to update to the recent build and check if the service takes 50% of RAM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists even after updating to the build 10049 then you can perform a scan with Microsoft Safety scanner and check if it helps in getting the issue resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run the
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> in full scan mode, and remove all the threats that get detected by it and see if the issue persists.</span></p>
