<h2>            I want to download all of my email folders from hotmail.com</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new laptop which came with windows 10. &nbsp;I was always using hotmail.com. &nbsp;However, it changed recently to outlook.live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked this question several times on the past few months. &nbsp;Unfortunately, every answer has not helped me. &nbsp;I'm not completely computer illiterate; however, I'm not technically support either. &nbsp;I usually can follow directions. &nbsp; Anyway, I'm enclosing
 what my email looks like, because some of the answers rely on a ribbon across the top, which has file, and other tabs, (which I use to have before windows 10); therefore most of the answers weren't helpful at all as it started off my instructing me to click
 on file!!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd7762ed-8d72-4eba-b0ce-87802fa0a0c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd7762ed-8d72-4eba-b0ce-87802fa0a0c6" /></a></p>

<h2>            Office Outlook Marking Emails as Spam</h2>
                    This week I had a problem with my business emails not being sent and being marked as spam. I determined that is was Outlook blocking me from sending emails/replies that contain my signature (I get an email from "System Administrator" that says the email
 was determined to be spam and would not be delivered). The signature has graphics and hyperlinks, and I've been using the same one for awhile now, so I don't know what Outlook suddenly doesn't like about it. I turned the signature off and I'm able to send
 without it. I want to be able to use the signature - as I said, this is a business account - so what do I need to do to be able to use it? I tried taking out the hyperlinks one by one to see if a particular one triggered the block, but that didn't work. Please
 advise.&nbsp;

            I got an answer! I finally decided to call the guys I use for tech issues - I try not to bother them with small problems but this was driving me nuts - it was the way I had our phone number formatted in the signature. We changed the format and now it works.
 I guess the spam settings have been changed to flag phone numbers in a certain format? Who knows, but now it's working! Thank you for trying to help me.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook, IMAP and contacts</h2>
                    <p>Never got an answer a few months back so I'll ask again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some new IMAP mail accounts and have them linked into Outlook 2010. When I click on "to," though, I don't get my contact list from my main pst file, it seems stuck in the IMAP file. How do I get access to the same contact list for all my IMAP accounts?</p>

            <p>A little confused by "...it seems stuck in the Imap file". In O'2010 - there would be no contact folder created for an Imap account - or to be more specific&nbsp;- there would be no contact folder showing up in the Imap Root.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In '2010 - when an Imap account is configured, two PST files are created by default - one &lt;Outlook Data File&gt; which contains a complete list of folders but the purpose is for the default contact/calendar folders. This PST file would be designated as the
 "default" &lt;Data File&gt; for the profile. Any additional Imap accounts configured would also use the same Outlook Data File for contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ergo - if your AddressBook (which is what would be opening when you click on the To/CC/Bcc) contains more then one contact folder - it means that there are other contact folders configured in this profile - either manually created or via some other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change which contact folder opens up by default in the AB </p>
<p>
</p><p>- open the AB (either manually or by clicking on one of the email To/CC/Bcc buttons</p>
<p>- from the AB menu --&gt; Tools --&gt; Options </p>
<p>- from within the Addressing window that opens up --&gt; select &lt;Custom&gt; and then pick which contact folder you want to have open by default</p>

            <p>The phrase "I don't get my contact list from my main pst file" in no way says there's a contact folder in email sections of each IMAP account. It's a request to understand why 2010 seems to want to find on in the IMAP account and won't show the one that
 exists is the one in the main pst file, I'm asking how to make sure that when I create a new email using the IMAP email account, the main contact folder is available for to, cc and bcc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that, what's AB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a new email and click on "to" I get the "Select names: Contact" dialog. It has no file menu. No options. It has a drop-down list box labeled "Address book" and it lists the email account, though it has no address book, and "suggested contacts"
 which shows nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to add the pst contacts via that dialog. I've also perused the email account's options and not found anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need specific responses that address IMAP and 2010.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no right-click ability in the data files tab in Outlook 2010. All that can be done is click settings and on that dialog there's only the General tab, not a Outlook Address Book tab, and no selection for showing the folder as an address book.</p>

            I wasn't explicit enough in my description, it seems.&nbsp; I didn't say to right-click the data file while viewing the Data Files tab of the account settings.&nbsp; I said use the account settings to determine which data file is your default data file because that
 one is where the Contacts folder Outlook uses when addressing a message will be.&nbsp; Then in Outlook's main window where you can see the Navigation Pane and your folders, right-click the Contacts folder that is in the data file you determined was the default.&nbsp;
 The tab I described is there.

<p>
</p><p>I followed the suggestions that were made in the conversation chain.&nbsp; I selected the check box in my Contacts folder that says:</p>
<p><em><strong>Show this folder as an email address book</strong></em></p>

</p><p>When I initiate a new message, and click on the<em> <strong>To</strong> </em>box. I can see the name of the Contact Folder.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If I understand your question correctly </p>
<p>&nbsp; - you are clicking on the TO button</p>
<p>&nbsp; - the AddressBook opens with a contact folder with no contact items displaying</p>
<p>does that sum it up correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going on the assumption that the answer to the above is &lt;yes&gt; then </p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Would it also be correct to assume that you have more than one contact folder in your profile</p>
<p>(click on contacts in the Nav Pane and all contact folders will be listed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Have you checked the AddressBook to ensure that the folder that contains your contacts is set to display by default when you open the AB? (from the AB Menu --&gt; Tools --&gt; Options --&gt; set the contact folder that opens by default if more than one folder
 comprises the AB)</p>

            <p>Hey Karl - thanks for getting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the Contact tab there are two folders:</p>
<p>Suggested Contacts and</p>
<p>Contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggested contacts is empty, Contacts has lots of entries - I can easily see them</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Contacts folder has the checkbox set to display as an email Address Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When composing a new mail, I can see the contacts folder name in the Address Book dropdown box.&nbsp; But when I select it - - I see nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; hmmmmm.....</p>

            <p>Since a corrupt Outlook profile can't be discounted - suggest that you try creating a new Outlook profile and setting that as the default just to eliminate this as the possible cause.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just for some background info</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Was this an "in place" upgrade? (i.e. O'2013 installed on a machine where a prior version of Outlook exists(ed))? If yes, is the prior version of Outlook still installed? When the O'2013 click-to-run version is installed, it will co-exist with the previous
 version whereas if the .msi installer is used (available only via a MSDN subscription or corporate volume agreement) - only one version of Outlook can be installed on a system at one point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - If answer to above is no and involves a new machine - was something like "Easy Transfer" used to move from one machine to another? If the answer is yes, that is known to result in corrupt Outlook profiles which need to be re-created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - SInce you only have one Contact folder which doesn't include (This computer only) in the description (and ignoring &lt;Suggested Contacts&gt;) - what type of email account is involved (POP, EAS or Exchange)</p>
<p>If not sure - can be easily determined by going to O'2013 menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; account type shown in the second column of the info shown on Email tab window</p>

<h2>            inward emails bouncing</h2>
                    <p>When I access my regular e-card web site and prepare/send an e-card to someone (birthday eg), some cards go through, and others bounce.</p>
<p>I can send to myself from Outlook account to Microsoft account, but not the other way round.</p>
<p>Message received&nbsp; states "e-card sent bounced. Recipient domain rejected this address". Which is my own email address.</p>
<p>I have checked the settings in Outlook mail for safe senders, and the e-card site is listed there, and not blocked.</p>
<p>Google Chrome also has the site set to allow cookies as well.</p>
<p>My ISP says nothing in my settings with them is the cause.</p>
<p>Can anyone throw some light on this, and why some e-cards and emails from this web site come through, and others do not?</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate this case, can you please provide the steps on how you are sending the e-cards from your e-card website? Also, is the issue also happening when you send the e-card to other email domains like @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, etc.?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>
        </p>

<p>To send e-card, I log into www.123greetings.com. Select card and send.</p>
<p>Sometimes cards go through, sometimes they bounce.</p>
<p>www.123greetings.com advised me the bounces are caused by my email domain (@netspace.net.au) rejecting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send to my Microsoft email account no problem.</p>
<p>When I try to reverse and send from Microsoft to my netspace.net.au in Outlook, they are rejected for the same reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>123greetings told me to ensure that *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is added to my safe senders list in Outlook, which I have done.</p>
<p>I do not use gmail or yahoo.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If you've already added the email domain to Safe Senders list in Outlook.com and still having deliverability issues, I highly suggest that you fill out the&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/8ad563e3-288e-2a61-8122-3ba03d6b8d75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sender
 Information for Outlook.com Delivery</a></strong></em> form. Once submitted, the information will be reviewed and Outlook.com will typically allow the affected domain to be whitelisted.</p>

<p>Hi again Jomel.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I cannot send an ecard from my Microsoft account to my own email address @ netspace.net.au in Outlook. They bounce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tried sending 2 test cards from Microsoft account to a friend, and they both went through perfectly.</p>
<p>No connection with my Outlook account @netspace.net.au</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it must definitely be a problem in my Outlook mail only.</p>

            Thanks for getting back to me Palcouk. &nbsp;The answer to both questions is yes. &nbsp;Before I ever even installed win10 I ran the comparability program and supposedly it was good to go.

            <p>I've read it many times and it is bookmarked in Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had much professional experience with program/project management. Things like PREVIEWS should be planned for and even a novice program manager is weary of biting off too much, something which MS has done. There is no excuse for the paucity of updates
 we've seen. Although from a business pov it would be desirable to develop and release Windows 10 in an Update, one reaches a project size and complexity that exceeds resources and simply the time to communicate about the changes. MS obviously has reached that
 limit and Windows Update users are suffering very badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gabe is being pushed too hard by the business people. The entire Windows 10 schedule is out of wack.</p>

<p>Is this your first "beta" testing experience?</p>

<h2>            MSN games and other sites are telling me they&#39;re not secure</h2>
                    <p>Besides that, I can't enable Adobe Flash Player on any of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to play games on these sites a few days ago. I spent about an hour listening to Spotify and all of a sudden, I'm having this problem.</p>
<p>I've heard people say Spotify will load your computer with malware.&nbsp; Is this true?</p>

</p><p>I just updated to Office 15.41 as you suggested and have responded that the footnote numbers are now the proper size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I type the font is Arial, even though I want Times New Roman.&nbsp; I try to change the font to Times New Roman but it remains Arial. I can change the font to Garamond and Calisto, but the journals I publish in demand Times New Roman.&nbsp; Times New
 Roman is not working in my new updated Word.</p>

            <p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Office and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not possible to change the flag text or set start dates and due dates if you are using an IMAP e-mail account. Refer to the
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span> under the section
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/track-e-mail-messages-that-require-follow-up-HA001229901.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/track-e-mail-messages-that-require-follow-up-HA001229901.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as a workaround, you may refer to the suggestion by MMegan in the following thread link:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/adding-reminders-to-flagged-emails-in-outlook-2010/b2b90f80-1911-453d-b2ba-4c5d7096b9ca?page=2"><font>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/adding-reminders-to-flagged-emails-in-outlook-2010/b2b90f80-1911-453d-b2ba-4c5d7096b9ca?page=2</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion is helpful. If you have any other Office question, post in our community and we will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>How to print A6 in Powerpoint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waltjabsco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print A6 in Powerpoint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have PowerPoint on my MacBook Pro, connected to a HP Photosmart 6520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to correctly print A6 cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can select A6 in "Page Setup" but the problems seem to be when I try to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Print box, I go to "Paper Handling" and "Destination Paper Size" is greyed out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then click on "Scale to fit paper size" it allows me to access the box and then I can select A6 (or A6 borderless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I then print onto A6 paper, the print is significantly reduced and sits well within the A6 page (even in borderless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems, therefore, that it's been scaled down when it prints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the process I need to follow to successfully print A6 in Powerpoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I'm afraid I can't reproduce the issue here so all I can do is describe the procedure I'm using;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In <strong>File&gt; Page Setup</strong> click the <strong>Options</strong> button</li><li>Confirm that your printer is selected in the <strong>Format For</strong> list</li><li>Select A6 as the <strong>Paper Size</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> in both dialog windows</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When you Print you should not have to change any settings. Although the <strong>
Paper Handling&gt; Destination Paper Size</strong> is dimmed it should reflect A6 as the
<strong>Suggested Paper Size</strong>. IOW, you should not have to select A6 there, nor should the Scale to Fit box be checked. Also, on
<strong>Copies &amp; Pages</strong> if you click the <strong>Page Setup&gt; Options</strong> button you should find that A6 is specified there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a different result the most common cause is a matter of updates. Verify that;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your installation of OS X is fully updated</li><li>Office is fully updated [14.4.2 is current]</li><li>Check the HP web site for an updated to driver/firmware for your model &amp; OS X version</li><li>Run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions after installing any updates followed by a restart of your Mac.</li></ul>
<p>It's also possible that you may have to Remove/Install the printer.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know if we can connect our mobile handset - E63 with the desktop and have access to Internet on E63 using the internet connection active / available on the desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eg: I have an image or a word file on my E63 that I wish to e-mail using the Internet browser. I would like to connect my E63 with my desktop / laptop using the data cable or bluetooth dongle and use the Internet connection available on the desktop ( when
 I do not have internet available on my E63) and then e-mail the image or Word file using the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, please let me know the complete procedure for the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            That's not 100% true but The phone was not intended for this. I've heard of a software called GNUbox, search for posts by Psychomania with that word in them. Even Psychomania doesn't say much about it besides that it's difficult to set up. I'm sure there
 is more software out there that can do this. You just have to know where to look

<p>I've done it through WLAN. My Mac is connected by cable to the internet and I just set it up to share the internet connection via Airport (Apple's Wireless Network). Then the phone detects it as WIFI and off it goes. (a bit slow, though).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I'm thinking you mean connecting to a PC via data cable. I've heard someone do this with a Windows Mobile smartphone. Not sure if the S60 can be tinkered enough to make it work. (have a look see at

<p><span>Hi BballG,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the error message, the issue may be related to several factors, such as connections, network or connectors. To better help you, I’d like to collect
 the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue only occur when sending emails from cloud to on-premise users? What about sending emails to external users or on-premise users send emails
 to cloud users?</span></li><li><span>Did you get any error message when running Hybrid wizard (HCW)? If so, please try re-run the HCW. If the error persists, can you provide a screenshot of
 the error message?</span></li><li><span>Did the mail flow work before?</span></li><li><span>Do you use the Exchange 2010 or 2013? Do you have any NLB?</span></li><li><span>May I confirm whether you get the error from the SMTP log? If not, please let me know the details.</span></li><li><span>If the issue only occur from cloud to on-premise, please provide the following PowerShell results to narrow down the issue.</span></li></ol>

<h3> vsquaredx5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Calendars in Outlook To-Do Bar&#59; Office 365</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I mostly live in my Inbox with the To-Do Bar and calendar visible on the right side of the window. Both my personal and business accounts &nbsp;are hosted in Exchange 365 and configured in Outlook and I manage
 two separate calendars associated with these accounts. I administer Exchange for my personal account. Again, I use the To-Do Bar to keep an eye on both of my calendars. Unfortunately, Outlook does not pull content from both active calendars to render the To-Do
 Bar. I have searched for native solutions to this situation with Outlook with no success. I have attempted to use third party solutions to synch calendars so both are visible in the To-Do Bar and found them only somewhat reliable.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)"><br />
Just curious if anyone else finds this to be a glaring missing feature and if there are any reliable work arounds. &nbsp;

            You might try first restarting with Shift key down If no change:<br />
<br />
IF you used Migration Manager to bring over your apps:<br />
<ul>
<li>First try with Office apps not running (quit):<br />
locate the following items in Home(user) &gt; Library &gt; Preference:<br />
<ul>
<li>com.microsoft.word.plist, com.microsoft.excel, com.microsoft.powerpoint.plist<br />
and if there is one, com.microsoft.outlook.plist. Also the com.microsoft.office plist.<br />
Finally the Microsoft folder within Preferences.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
&nbsp; Now try the office applications. If that doesn't help its time to punt:<br />
<ul>
<li>Remove, reinstall, re-update Office.<br />
follow the directions given here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            10030 sound is not working and audio playback troubleshooter fails with error 0x80070057</h2>
                    The update for 10030 installed this morning and the sound no longer works. I checked the device manager and drivers are up to date, I disabled and enable them to no avail. I ran the troubleshooter and it fails with error 0x80070057. I checked start up
 and Smartaudio Conexant Systems,Inc. is set to yes. This is on my Lenovo G500s Touch, Intel&nbsp;I5, 6g ram. Any ideas?

    <title>Problem with calendar share permissions after upgrading to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janneeee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with calendar share permissions after upgrading to Office&#47;Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our university has a Exchange 2010 Server and our institution is using this server as our main mail server.</p>
<p>Our users run Office 2010 or 2013 and we make heavy use of shared calendars in our organization.</p>
<p>It may not be best practice, but for shared calendars for meeting rooms and work Schedules we give our users "Full Access" permissions so that they can add or edit meetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are about to introduce Office 2016 to our organization and we are testing it on a couple of employees.</p>
<p>The problem is that for those users (Office 2016) the shared calendars are inaccessable.</p>
<p>They have Windows 10 but we have also tested on Windows 7 and get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they use Office 2010/2013 access to shared calenders work but not on Office 2016. It also works when they use webmail.</p>
<p>On Outlook 2016 they get the error "You do not have the permission to view this calendar" (the same error for creating a meeting or trying to view properties of the calendar)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They get this error even if they have the highest (Full Access) permission on the mailbox.</p>
<p>We have also tried with this shared calendar permissions: Editor, Publishing Editor and Owner. We try with each of these settings set for the specific user when we are testing, but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the shared calendars work in office 2010, 2013 and in webmail this has something to do with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

                    I have to track some of my messages with the full&nbsp;date and time.&nbsp; In Outlook 2013 and earlier version of Outlook&nbsp; I could copy the full date and time sent shown in the message and then paste it in excel.&nbsp; Now it only shows day and time, no year,&nbsp; or in
 older messages just the date but no time. &nbsp;I do not see a settings to change this.

<p>I have exactly the same problem, the bottom line is Microsoft have been aware of this problem for months and wont address it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason they wont address the problem is they want to force people to upgrade their OS and I refuse to do so.</p>

<h3> michael.dennis42  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive using Excessive bandwidth &#40;3.72Gb in 30 days&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10, with all available updates ad have been using OneDrive for years. &nbsp;I'm also an O365 user and have 1Tb of file storage available. &nbsp;I've been storing roughly 90-95 Gb for the past year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also a Comcast (Xfinity) customer and on 11/1 that imposed data limits. &nbsp;1Tb/month or they will charge overage fees. &nbsp;I was informed by them a few days ago that I had already exceeded my 1Tb limit and this was on the 13th of the month. &nbsp;I checked their
 site and it showed for August 2.1Tb, September 1.6Tb and in October a whopping 3.9Tb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at my Router and it showed similar bandwidth utilization of about 100Gb/day on average. &nbsp;For reference everything in my home is connected via my router and not Comcast's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought I had some Malware, virus etc. &nbsp;Nope nothing. &nbsp;So I started disconnecting devices from the Router. &nbsp;I isolated it to my main desktop. &nbsp;Then used Win10's Settings app Network and Internet and then "Data Usage". &nbsp;It showed 3.8Tb of usage
 from this single machine in the last 30 days. &nbsp;Usage details showed that OneDrive.exe used 3.72Tb</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdf5f62-b78e-4f3e-9d92-94cdba3e0685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdf5f62-b78e-4f3e-9d92-94cdba3e0685" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of change to the files that are syncing is very, very small. &nbsp;For now I have turned off Sync, though seems like the max is for 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could cause this kind of errant and run-away behavior?</p>

            <p>I have found the culprits, but do not understand why. &nbsp;I'm hoping that someone can provide an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw 3 files in OneDrive that where trying to be sync'ed:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e859655d-7bb4-4c09-af9c-060ef12299d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e859655d-7bb4-4c09-af9c-060ef12299d4" /></a></p>
<p>These three files are archive .pst files. &nbsp;They are collections of old emails, in case I need to access them. They were connected to my Outlook but I have not even accessed them in last 9-10 months. &nbsp;These files are between .5 and 2.3 Gb in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspecting that maybe Outlook was modifying them and causing OneDrive to constantly try and sync 'em I removed them from Outlook. &nbsp;That made No difference in the bandwidth utilization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then moved the 3 files to local storage and immediately OneDrive showed syncing to be up-to-date and my bandwidth utilization went back to normal. &nbsp;About .14-.21 Gb/hour. &nbsp;Vs. the 4+ Tb/hour previously.</p>
