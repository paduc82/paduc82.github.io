<h2>            Ovi Store</h2>
                    
<p>If anyone from Nokia reads this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contact Us section of your website does not work (it keeps on telling me fields are not filled out when they all are), and you don't provide a direct email contact so there is no way for me to report that I have been charged twice for an item because
 your stupid store keeps screwing up. I am also trying to purchase another application and it keeps on saying there's a Card Error even though all the details entered are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty disappointed with just about everything to do with the store at this point. Please contact me via PM or email (my username for the discussion board is the same as for the Ovi store).</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to help but that is the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not send a message; it keeps on telling me to check fields marked with red and will not send the message. Not only are no fields marked in red, but I have filled out every field with a red asterix, and also tried filling every field available. The
 message just flat out will not send. It was an $8 app. and I'm not too happy about being double charged for it and having no way to point out the problem to anyone except via this discussion board which as far as I know is not monitored by Nokia staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if anyone does read this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was double charged for these items:<br />
<br />
8C1UTM8MEHWH<br />
FJADQKCXNP49<br />
<br />
The first time the transaction failed and I was told to try again, so did so, and was charged twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved the other problem by using a friend's credit card as mine flat out refused to work for no apparent reason. Seeing as it was a $33 app. you'd think Nokia would want my money enough to have a functioning store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see from looking through this board that people are experiencing similar problems frequently. It's dissapointing that not only does the store seem to be malfunctioning left, right, and centre, but that there is NO avenue for customer service. Would it
 hurt to provide an email address instead of a form based system that does not work?</p>

<p>Hello bryza47,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried it out, and I&nbsp;successfully sent a message by going through the link provded by user "phonehacker."&nbsp; What internet browser are you using?&nbsp; I'm curious if other users are having the same type of problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe the phone number you are looking for to get help with your specific problem&nbsp;is 1300 366 733 according to

<p>I have exactly same problem. Charged twice for the same app (first try said time out, so I tried again)&nbsp; and I cant fill the contact us form because the language dropdown has only one option called "Select" and I can't move on because this field is mandatory.
 I tried both FireFox and IE8 to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted my local (Turkey) Nokia team and they've told me that they can't reimburse this and I am quite furious to suffer for a server-side problem. I've been living off the internet (online shopping/buying/etc) and now they tell me I may have clicked
 twice, after I told them that I had to re-enter every piece of information, because Ovi Store within my phone told me the transaction has timed out and left me with only the option of buying it(again!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I reach some proper support on this issue? Any help would be apprecaited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hi Unsu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following weeks of the incidence, Nokia contacted me saying my money will be paid back. It was not paid back, but it least I felt better, since the corporation has accepted their fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks later,&nbsp; just by pure luck a friend of mine got assigned to supervise / train Turkey call center and when they were looking for a case study of problematic customer, they picked my situation.They've called me again and guarenteed the money will
 be refunded, which in 5~ days went to my credit card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem is solved, but not without raising some ruckus. Although I'm happy about Nokia's latest response, I have to say that the call center guys need to be trained better before launching the call center, telling them they are there to solve CUSTOMER's
 problems not to protect Nokia against customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Deleting Spam Emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancyferguson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting Spam Emails</h2>
                    Since I now have Windows 10 on my new computer, Microsoft Edge automatically became my new browser.&nbsp; In Windows 10, to see both my msn.com and gmail.com emails (I have 2 email accounts) all I have to do is click on the windows icon in the lower left hand
 side of my screen, this opens a new window, and all I have to do is click on "mail" and it takes me to both my email accounts.&nbsp; However, my msn.com email account has a ton of spam emails in it daily.&nbsp; Since it is extremely inconvenient to delete, as you have
 to do each email one at a time, is there a setting to change so that I don't get any spam emails, or that they are automatically deleted as they come in?&nbsp; I'm tired of cleaning up this spam folder every day!!!

            <p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description it appears that you are using Windows mail app to access MSN.com and Gmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does this issue occur on Gmail.com account?</p>
<p>2) How do you access the Emails? Are you trying to access it on Web or Windows mail app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Windows mail app to access the account, then there is no option or settings to delete all emails at the same time but you can select each mail and then delete all at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply to us with more information for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Windows mail app.</p>

<h2>            Apple&#39;s &#34;Continuity&#34;, can windows 10 do that&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Apple introduced one concept called "Continuity", however which focuses on bridging iPhone, iPad and Mac, a very different concept with "Continuum"&nbsp;of windows 10. Even though Windows Phone 8 (WP) will be&nbsp;replace by Window 10,&nbsp;just&nbsp;as MS claimed that
 one OS for all devices,&nbsp;nevertheless,&nbsp;users still need to exchange their apps, data and information between&nbsp;various&nbsp;devices they owned.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left"><span><strong>"Continuum" solved the conflicts&nbsp;between desktop&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metro UI&nbsp;on&nbsp;single device,&nbsp;however it has nothing to do with multi/inter-devices.
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><span>It&nbsp;is no shame to learn or steal this concept from Apple, see&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/continuity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/<strong>continuity</strong>/</span></a>&nbsp;,

            <p>I agree, no wrong in copying this concepts, that's why all major OS's use windows, there's also the goal of standardizing good ideas and make them default across platforms.</p>
<p>The goal of course should be always to improve on them and not just copy, so the other's can later take advantage of it too, and the community, indeed humanity, gains from all.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>in fact, with universal apps windows could do even better, bringing not only first party apps like office into sync, but all universal apps ever written. It would be so nice if you could start editing a picture on your phone you took, come home and open
 it on your surface or pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be awesome if this was implemented in the universal apps and it would give microsoft an advantage over the thin first party app support in apples continuity</p>

            <p>Honestly i see this becoming more of an reality sooner than later. Microsoft has already added some of this ability to stand alone apps including Skype and their default Modern Apps. Apps can sync data, conversations, IE can sync bookmarks and history, passwords,
 forms, etc. Skype can sync messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to see this evolve to include Windows Phone App allowing similar functionality to how the OVI Desktop App allowed for users with Nokia phones to send texts, picture messages, and files to others without touching their phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow apps at least default apps to tap into the phone and other devices that are signed in to allow sharing of information and picking up and continuing where one has left off from a previous session&nbsp;</p>

            Microsoft's clear path is to allow iPhone/iPad users to escape IOS slavery by replacing IOS on their Apple devices with Windows 10 Mobile.&nbsp; But first Microsoft has to eliminate the deadwood that has accumulated clogging the pathways of imagination and
 innovation.&nbsp; How about cutting development staff at Microsoft to one third of what's there now, and letting the others go on to other enterprises for which their more conventional, sluggish approach to the future is more adapted.&nbsp; If Microsoft is smart, it
 will form them into an Alumni group, as the big four accounting firms do, so that they will become the Microsoft experts in the new companies and in government where they will land.&nbsp; Microsoft can then recover its preeminence as the lean, mean, development
 machine that it was when Bill Gates's hyper-competitiveness was driving the organization.&nbsp; Dump the bureaucracy; free the entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Bring back the Microsoft of yore.

<h2>            Wi-Fi Setting - Forgot</h2>
                    Please be so kind as to add a "forget" option to the Wi-Fi options in action center. Currently you have to go digging in the advanced Wi-Fi settings to forget a Wi-Fi password. Our companies Wi-Fi password changes every week and it really is a pain to
 set forget for a Wi-Fi connection.

<h2>            Add Flags to the Follow Up Menu</h2>
                    <p>At one time, I had no use for additional follow up flags in Outlook, so I removed most of them, but now I'm unable to add them back again. Does someone have a solution to add dated flags into the follow up menu? The flags are missing throughout Outlook Mail
 tab regardless of email account, and can only be seen in Contacts&nbsp;and Tasks. Please see images below.</p>

<p>Unfortunately none of these ideas worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to add that I&nbsp;discovered one email account that has all the flags, but I can't figure out why. It's the Archives account - the one where all my older emails go. I was reading that in Outlook 2013 there was an issue&nbsp;with flags regarding whether
 it was a .pst or a .ost data file. In my case, I have&nbsp;3 .pst files, 2 .ost files, and 1 .aplzod file.&nbsp;One .pst file is the archive, and another is&nbsp;an Internet&nbsp;calendar subscription (which doesn't apply to the mail portion here), and the third is the Outlook
 Data File. Unfortunately, I <strong>don't</strong> have the complete range of flags in the ODF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another odd thing: If I customize the ribbon to include a new tab with the follow-up flags, they remain grayed out in the mail accounts that&nbsp;aren't working. But if I make a Quick Steps for each flag, I'm able to add Today, Tomorrow, and other flags.</p>

            Is there a difference between Office versions that would cause this issue? For example, at work I have the full range of flags, but at home, I don't.

            First you need to check your pc has driver for your Bluetooth hardware, most of hp has same issue when they upgrade to windows 10, but i resolved it, first check your Bluetooth icon is show in system tray, if yes right right click on it and search for
 new devices you can connect Bluetooth modem, speakers etc, and Bluetooth icon is not show in system tray now you have driver issue , search for driver in your pc manufacturer site or download driver pack solution and can be buy from eBay if unable to download,
 at last alternately you can download bluesoliel Bluetooth software great software lot of function download it and contact me further for activation of the software *** Email address is removed for privacy ***

    <title>Office 365 Word extremely high CPU usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jblockley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Word extremely high CPU usage</h2>
                    <p>For the past month or so Word has been needlessly using the CPU - without even opening a document the utilisation hits 30%, having one or more documents open can cause peaks of 50%. This is obviously not right, it is wasting system resources, wasting power,
 and needlessly running my PC's fans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>About Word</em> dialogue box reports I am running Word MSO (16.0.9330.2073) 64 bit, I have a Core i5-4690 (3.5GHz), 16gb RAM, and a GTX 1050 Ti. None of these are underpowered parts, and Word is up to date, so there is no reason for it to waste CPU
 time like this. The GPU utilisation is practically nil though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running Word in safe mode, disabling GPU acceleration (made it slightly worse), and closing other programs. I'm also running Win 10 64bit, up-to date. I can't figure out why Word is running so miserably.</p>

<p>Alright, I have determined what the problem is and fixed it:</p>
<p>The Office telemetry service was going haywire due to my Pi-hole blocking it from dialing home. I changed my settings to connect to my ISP's DNS and suddenly Word started behaving properly. So I have disabled telemetry in group policy and now all is well
 (I hope).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar &#40;Holiday &#38; Birthdays&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone - I have two Outlook 2016 (desktop) calendar questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Holidays. When I do not have the US Holidays Calendar checked and merged with my regular Calendar, only some holidays appear. Even stranger, these holidays appear in pink, and they are on the wrong date. How do I get rid of these holidays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Old Data. After I synced my outlook.com account with Outlook desktop, I went into many contact files on the desktop and deleted many birthdays. But when I turn on the Birthdays calendar on the desktop, the deleted birthdays are still there. How can I
 get rid of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Teri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Outlook cloud version. However, if you are already subscribed with Office 365, your Outlook data files should synchronize between devices. You only have to make sure that your email server protocol should either be IMAP or Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IMAP</strong> or Internet Message Access Protocol is a standard email protocol that allows the end user to view and manage messages, calendars, and contacts from multiple devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exchange</strong> offers the same email syncing function as IMAP, but it also gives the end user the ability to sync tasks, contacts, and calendars with co-workers.</p>

<h2>            Why on Earth does Outlook client have to be open to send a delayed message&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Several months ago, I used the "Do not deliver before" function in Outlook for Desktop to send a delayed email.</p>
<p>I normally use OWA from portal.office.com - I like to be web based, especially when I have to use SharePoint.</p>
<p>Well, today I logged in to outlook for Desktop for the first time since then and my delayed email that was supposed to be sent months ago
<strong>just sent when I opened the program.</strong></p>
<p>1st - I now have a really big problem at work because of this.</p>
<p><strong>2nd - Why does this feature work like this? If I was able to have my computer on and Outlook open, I would have just sent the stupid email when I wanted it to go out. The whole reason I used the&nbsp;Delay&nbsp;Sending function was because I needed to send
 an email when I wouldn't have internet access. (The Outlook and&nbsp;OWA apps are terrible and unusable, so mobile access isn't ideal)</strong></p>

<p><span>based on your description, i understand that when you close your outlook client the delay emails are not sent out.</span></p>
<p><span>i did a test from my side to reproduce the same result but failed.</span></p>

<p>hi allisonmckillop,</p>
<p>sorry for the misleading. <br />
the delay delivery is a client feature and there isn’t such a setting on exchange online.<br />
but i reproduced the situation you described. actually, the "delay delivery" action is performed by outlook instead of the exchange online server (when sending emails while outlook is working offline, the emails also go to the outbox folder. based on the point,
 we can see that the emails in the outbox folder haven't arrived at the server).<br />
however, i do think it would be nice if we can send the delayed message when outlook is closed. therefore, we suggest you submit feedback to our relevant team via the send a smile button in the upper right corner in your outlook.<br />
thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
poppy</p>

<p>Hi AllisonMcKillop,</p>
<p>Sorry for the misleading. </p>
<p>The delay delivery is a client feature and there isn’t such a setting on Exchange Online.</p>
<p>But I reproduced the situation you described. Actually, based on my knowledge, the "delay delivery" action is performed by Outlook instead of the Exchange Online server (When sending emails while Outlook is working Offline, the emails also go to the Outbox
 folder. Based on the point, we can see that the emails in the Outbox folder haven't arrived at the server). So I doubt that keeping Outlook open is also needed for the delay delivery.</p>
<p>However, I do think it would be nice if we can send the delayed message when Outlook is closed. Therefore, we suggest you submit feedback to our relevant team via the Send a smile button in the upper right corner in your Outlook.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>Forgive me for not being more accurate on this response, but we did get this to work on our Outlook 2010 clients. It required a Office 2010 SP2 and a couple of Hotfixes from Microsoft. &nbsp;I don't have the Hotfix KB numbers, sorry.</p>
<p>I believe what ended up doing is stripping out the Office 2010 installation (clean uninstall; make sure you backup your PST data), reinstall Office 2010 SP2, then the Hotfixes.</p>

            <p>I had this same issue.&nbsp; Check if your using online or cached mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delayed delivery options are client side in cached mode and server side in online mode. So, when using Cached Exchange Mode, Outlook must be connected and open at the assigned delivery time for the delayed delivery message to be sent.

                    Hi,<br />
I have deleted my e-mail account, so it is gone from account picker, and now I'm trying to re-create it.<br />
But I'm getting "That name is already assigned to another account. Enter a unique name and try again".<br />
I can not use different name (sync with thunderbird) and I can not find account settings anywhere.<br />
<br />
Where should I look for any old setting left after removing account? Any workarounds?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

            I advised you perform a hard reset to restore your device to factory default. You will lose data and software you installed. Make sure you backup your data. To perform a hard reset on your device, press and hold the power button. Insert the stylus in the
 reset hole and release the power button. Follow on-screen instructions.

<h2>            bluetooth sync problem still not solved... help has left me hanging.</h2>
                    
<p><span>MY ORIGINAL POST:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have a blackjack 2 phone that is running WM 6.1, and WMDC on my vista desktop PC.&nbsp; The PC has a plug and play USB bluetooth device that seems to be working.&nbsp;
 I am able to transfer files to my device via bluetooth so&nbsp;I know that they are talking to each other, however I cannot sync via bluetooth.&nbsp; The sync works fine when done with a USB cable, but&nbsp;I don't want to have to dig the cable out in order to sync every
 time my calendar and contacts&nbsp;need updated.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried everything i can think of, spent all day on the&nbsp;phone with samsung and iogear with no solution.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NUNO REPLIED:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all you must first enable Bluetooth syncronization in WMDC by going to the Connection Settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>Next, be sure to enble Bluetooth on both the PC and the Windows Mobile Devices, and put them on discovery mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, from the device, go to the Bluetooth Settings and add the computer, it then must find the "Activesync" service in order to sync.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the partnership is setup, you must go to Activesync (on the device) and go to "Menu, Sync via Bluetooth".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If all goes well, It will start to sync almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards</span></p>
<p><span>Nuno</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;MY REPLY TO NUNO:</p>
<p><span>The phone won't "find my computer"... the error reads;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cannot find an existing bluetooth partenership with a PC that supports ActiveSync.&nbsp; Would you like to set up a partenership now?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I pair it then, try it again and it will do the same thing.&nbsp; Over and over again.&nbsp; I think the problem may be in my computer.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I go to control pannel&gt;bluetooth
 devices&gt;options&gt;click on allow bluetooth devices to find this computer&gt;OK then an errors reads;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An error occurred while windows was saving&nbsp;your settings.&nbsp; The bluetooth device might be unplugged. (it's not) The following settings were not saved, discoverability
 settings and connection settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That is why&nbsp;I think it is my computer, although like i said it will transfer files and everything else... just not sync.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any other ideas?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>You're right&nbsp;I don't see "activesync&nbsp;services" as a checkable option when pairing the device... all&nbsp;I see&nbsp;for options that&nbsp;I can check is "Serial Port"&nbsp; "Stereo Headset" and "Headset" on my device
 after&nbsp;I have paired it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When&nbsp;I go to control panel and try to add a COM port like you are saying it tells me that my bluetooth adapter is not plugged in and to connect my adapter and try again.&nbsp; the thing is though
 that it is plugged in and it is working, the thing will transfer files onto my phone with no problems at all.&nbsp; I just won't sync.&nbsp; That’s what&nbsp;I am troubleshooting here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Everything in my bluetooth devices in my control panel is blank... it won't let me add a com port or a device because&nbsp;I think windows is not recognizing the bluetooth device that I am using.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>WHOA...&nbsp;hold the phone...&nbsp;IT WORKED!&nbsp; YIPEEE... thank you thank you thank you!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FYI I actually created the com port via my phone then went to WMDC and set it to communicate through that same com port (COM 4 in this case) instead of bluetooth under the connection settings
 &gt; allow connections by one of the following tab.&nbsp; But your directions led me that way.&nbsp; Thank you... I will mark this as solved.</span></p>

            That Windows error saving your settings is a little weird but may be related to the COM port that you are using not being properly configured. The COM port you are using is not supporting Activesync services. That's why you get that "Cannot find existing&nbsp;partnership
 supporting Activesync...blah..blah.."&nbsp;When you pair the WM device and the PC the WM device should list "Activesync Services" as a checkable option. I don't think you see that, do you? Do you know the Bluetooth stack that the USB BT device is using? You can
 try using some other COM ports in the "Connection" setting in WMDC. The best thing to do would be to make a new incoming&nbsp;COM port with all the required services. That is in Control Panel&gt;Bluetooth devices&gt;COM port&nbsp;tab&gt; add. Add a new incoming COM port. Take
 note of the number and use that to sync with in the "Connection" setting is WMDC. Remove all previous pairings prior to doing this. Then when you pair and make the partnership, you should see "Activesync services" and check that on the WM device.
<span>Once the partnership is setup, you go to Activesync (on the device) and go to "Menu, Sync via Bluetooth". It will go through and open the COM ports and then sync.

                    <p>Hello everybody!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regulary browsing the Forum up and down, I noticed that a few users were meeting issues with installation of .NET Framework 4.5.2 requested by some softwares. ( perhaps Visual Studio 2013, update 4, I'm not sure!)</p>
<p>I've tried to be helpful stating a few solution like Web or Offline installer, some CMD command prompts, Activating features of Windows,....., But always it's shown a pop up message that it's already installed. I checked just in case again in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Programs and Features</span> but there's only until 4.5.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to determine which .NET Framework versions were installed on Windows Technical Preview (Build 9879)&nbsp;

                    I have a student trying to get 365 free at&nbsp;https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education (the same way I did) but now any email I type in with my domain @wixxxn.edu it says it's not a school address. I tried chatting with Microsoft Support

    <title>Sharepoint 2010 OOB approval workflow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l hardcharger l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint 2010 OOB approval workflow</h2>
                    <p>I have created a custom task which has 4 columns one is for the persons name for the overtime, one is the requesting division with a dropdown selection then a start date column with a date selection, then a stop date selection and the last column is a number
 column with the total hours requested. &nbsp;I then linked the approval workflow with content enabled. &nbsp;When I send a request it works well it sends myself an email with the request and the approver and email with a link to approve it. &nbsp;When the approver clicks
 the link he can approve it and it does change the status in a column but it does not change the overall progress it still states "in progress". &nbsp;Now from what I can tell the link from the email that the approver gets doesn't direct him to the actual link needed
 to complete the approval workflow and send a completion email to the person that sent the request. &nbsp;You can go into the workflow itself and it will work properly but the emailed link is not the right one. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi </span><span>l HardCharger l,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, when the end-user upload a file and select check-in to upload the file on SharePoint online Library, then he can start the workflow by clicking the workflow name.</span></p>
<p><span>And the column stats is In Progress.(see the following screenshot).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33c371cb-0972-44bb-8cb4-08816fb8248c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33c371cb-0972-44bb-8cb4-08816fb8248c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Then the workflow approver can view the column stats is In Progress. And approver can click the In Progress to go to Workflow Status window.</span></p>
<p><span>Under the task section, approver can view the end-user’s approve request. And the approver can click approve to approve the request and finished the Workflow.</span></p>
<p><span>Then both the approver and end-user can review the column status is Approved under the Library.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d0500aa-a625-44c1-88e1-5b2d22a337d3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d0500aa-a625-44c1-88e1-5b2d22a337d3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, please provide the following information to better assist you:</span></p>
<p><span>1)Provide the related screenshots about how you created the Workflow.</span></p>
<p><span>2)Check if the Workflow need to be approved by multiple approvers. You can go to Workflow settings&gt;click the Workflow name&gt;at the assign to column and Order column.</span></p>
<p><span>Then check if you assign to multiple approvers and the order is One at time. More details please refer to

<p>Virgil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of my employer I cannot take screen shots but let me try to better explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) I have created a custom list with a few columns.</p>
<p>2.) I then added the sharepoint OOB approval workflow 2010 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I selected content type all</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-I selected the OOB approval workflow</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Task list was left at "Tasks"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-History List is left at "Workflow History"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Start Options that are checked are "Allow this workflow..... and "Start this Workflow when a new item is created"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-On the next page i the approvers section I select the supervisor and leave the order to one at at time (this is because there are only certain&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;people who can request overtime ((and only those people can see this page)) and there is only one
 approver.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Expanded groups is unchecked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Request is blank</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Due date and duration are both blank</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-CC is blank</p>
<p>That is the setup.&nbsp; So, when an authorized person that can see the page goes on and clicks the overtime request under the Lists on the left side of the page it pulls up the custom list that I created.&nbsp; They answer a few questions and click submit.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Once they submit it, they receive an email stating that they have submitted a request along with a link to view the progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Also once they submit it it likewise goes to the supervisor which was named as the "approver" in the initial setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-The "Approver" gets an email stating to complete this request click here:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-The approver clicks the link it comes up with a page and at the top there are choices starting with alert me, then approve/reject/ then&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the workflows button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Once you click the "Approve/Reject" button you get three actions, Approved, rejected, pending then a comment section.</p>
<p>Up to this point everything seems to work great.&nbsp; There is a column on the custom list that is now in the approved status and everything seems to be great but here is the issue.&nbsp; The workflow status is still "In progress" so that means that the workflow
 isn't completing and thus no email is generated to the requestor stating that the request was completed.&nbsp; Now I can go and click on the in progress column for that particular request and it will let me approve it and then it sends the email to the requestor
 stating that it was completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, from what I'm seeing the workflow is sending the wrong workflow link to the approver.&nbsp; That is the best I can come up with.&nbsp; I have been trying to get this what seemed to be the perfect solution to work for a week now.&nbsp; Thanks for any assistance on this
 matter.</p>

            The version I purchased was 365 Home Premium.&nbsp; is there any way of me finding out what was the outlook e-mail address I initially used when bought the subscription?<br />

<p>I solved this problem by running the microsoft office diagnostics
which found 2 errors in my office setup and fixed them. This resolved the problem. Now my phone syncs with outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if you try and sync a phone with outlook and any office product and get a "not installed" error I would try this first.

            Hi Rev Linda Cherry,<br />

    <title>Problems with outlook opening new instances while pinned to taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with outlook opening new instances while pinned to taskbar</h2>
                    Here's my scenario:<br />
<br />
For my taskbar options i use "combine when full" so i get the full names of windows and they don't group up unless it's getting crowded.<br />
<br />
I use outlook 2010 beta (same thing happens with 2007)<br />
<br />
I pinned outlook to the taskbar + startmenu<br />
<br />
With my outlook i like to use hide when minimized so I can hear when my IMAP email gets something new. Also so the outlook icon doesn't have a name after it taking up space on the taskbar. however, after minimizing if i click the outlook icon on the taskbar
 it'll open up a new instance of outlook instead of using the existing instance.<br />
<br />
I've already tried adding /recycle to the "start in" part so it looks like this ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\OUTLOOK.EXE" /recycle" (on my start menu i have the same problem but i also have the options to click properties)<br />
<br />
Help please I've been googling this for a week and it's driving me crazy.

<p>Hi Sfork,</p>
<p>a. Is the issue when a program is pinned to taskbar only with respect to Outlook?
<br />
b. Do all the other icons (programs) pinned to taskbar function properly?</p>
<p>Let’s first delete the Outlook icon from the taskbar and create a new instance of the same and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Right-click the Outlook icon and select <strong>Unpin this program from taskbar</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may also delete the Outlook icon from the following location to make sure corrupted taskbar icon is deleted:</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\[User-Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar
</strong></p>
<p>After the icon is unpinned from the taskbar, you may pin the program again to the taskbar.</p>
<p>Refer this article for more information to pin a program to the taskbar:</p>
<p>Pin a program to the taskbar<br />

<h2>            outlook 2010 rules keep changing on my Win8 system</h2>
                    I recently performed a clean install of Windows 8 x64 on my Lenovo W700 laptop. Office 2010 x32 pro was installed, I used my Outlook PST file from my Windows 7 x64 system. Everything seemed to be OK and after a day or so I got a message that a few of my
 rules were failing. I then reviewed my Outlook rules and corrected all issues and made a test with a few of the rules. Then after a day or two again I see the message that rules are failing. I again looked at the rules and was surprised to see that all of
 the rules I had corrected had reappeared. When I corrected the rules, some were deleted when I found a rule that no longer applied, some were moving emails to specific folders (these were the failing rules). The only way I could get the rule that was moving
 emails to specific folders was to first select another folder, e.g. not the real target folder and then again select the target folder. I then ran the rule and confirmed that it was correctly working, now the rule has again failed. A

            I think I lucked out and fixed the issue or currently it seems so. Following is what I did.

<ol>
<li>I have numerous backups of my PST file plus I have several that I made when rebuilding a system.&nbsp;</li><li>I opened outlook and made one of my PST backups the default. I then looked to see if the rules were OK. If they were not I continued to look for a PST file that did not have rules issues.</li><li>Finally when I found a PST file with no rules issues I exported the rules from this PST,&nbsp;</li><li>I then defaulted back to my current PST file, deleted all of the rules and imported the rules using the latest export (the above step)</li><li>I then closed Outlook and ran ScanPST as many times as necessary to produce a run with no errors.</li><li>I then opened outlook and looked at the rules and found two errors. Looking at them in detail I discovered that they were for one of my special email accounts.</li><li>I then looked at the email account and realized that it was not correctly setup. I corrected it and so far I don't have any new issues.</li></ol>
