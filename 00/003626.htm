<h2>            The hotmail sent messages in my sent box on my phone are no longer there</h2>
                    <p>In my hotmail&nbsp;sent box on my phone (the one I have an icon for - sorry not very tech..) there are 72 messages but only 3 of them are showing so I can't see any recent sent messages. When I log into Hotmail normally the sent messages are there. This is something
 that has happened recently.</p>
<p>The phone is a Samsung 7 so fairly up to date. Ditto messages in my draft box. Can anyone help (bearing in mind Im not very tech..). Thanks.</p>

            It sounds like you have the font size set to 11, but you're zoomed in.&nbsp; Look at the very extreme bottom-right-corner of the Word window, and make sure that's set to 100% size.&nbsp; If it's larger, it will make everything look too big.

<h2>            Nokia N8 Belle - Truble with turn on my phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Please! Help me!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia N8 and I use it for more than 5 let. Belle system. Should the screen lock. There was no damage. I decided to change the SIM card. Turn off the phone, I pulled out the SIM card and turn it on again to see the map. But the phone is not turned
 on until the end. It turns blue-violet screen and if you put in the lock, then you can see the normal screen, time, date. But disable the lock does not work. With the SIM card is the same, only more PIN requests. The phone has a lot of important information,
 and I'm afraid to do re-flash. How else can you turn on the phone? There's a lot of important information. Last backup was in August 2016. All the important information on the disk D. I would like to restore contacts. And indeed turn the phone on. It is an
 excellent camera and map.</p>

<h2>            &#91;WMDC 6.1, OL 2007&#93; WMDC keeps syncing every few minutes. Any way to stop it&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>I have 2 computers – one at home with Vista Ultimate and another
<br />
business laptop with Vista Business. Both have new SP2 and WMDC 6.1. I <br />
use HTC Touch Cruise with WM 6.1 to sync between them. <br />
<p>Home computer syncs fine. Business computer, however, keeps on <br />
synchronizing until I stop it. Sometimes it stops and says sync <br />
completed successfully, but then it starts syncing again even though I <br />
have not made any changes in either Outlook 2007 or on the mobile. <br />
<br />
Maybe it syncs every few minutes or so because I have MS Exchange as <br />
my work e-mail? And work e-mail gets checked every few minutes. <br />
However, when I initially set up partnership I chose not to sync with Exchange and I
<br />
sync everything (Calendar, Contacts, Tasks) except for E-mail <br />
<br />
Is there any way to stop it syncing every few minutes?</p>

            <p>I don't believe that Photo Album gives you that kind of control over image placement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you could add content or image placeholders on the slide master/layout where you want the images to appear, then add slides based on that layout as needed; click the placeholder on the slide to open a dialog box where you can choose the image to
 insert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or use PhotoAlbum then use the Hammer tool on my free PPTools StarterSet add-in.&nbsp; Once set up, it'll let you resize each of the images in a single click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look here to learn how it works.</p>

 and unsafe, and they advise us not to use it. Windows 10 mobile, on the whole, is atrocious.&nbsp; I cannot even add language keyboards to mine now.

    <title>Outlook.com SMTP settings problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanf_795  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com SMTP settings problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own domain which is hosted through Heart Internet UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up this account with no problems using Microsoft Outlook 2007, and also on my Android phone and on my iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I want to use Outlook.com so I have the same platform on all my devices, and can access archived mails from anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to set up the SMTP settings, unless I choose to use outlook.com as the sender, rather than my domain. The problem with this is that the outlook emails look unprofessional, and show me (the sender) as being a long convoluted email address on behalf
 of my own domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions from my provider are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Theoutgoing mail server is called:</span></li><li><span>mail.'yourdomain.com'</span></li><li><span>Where 'yourdomain.com' is the domain you have set up a mailbox on.
</span></li><li><span>To use it you'll also need to tell email client that the outgoing mail server requires authentication, some may ask to specify the username and password for this - just enter the same as
 the incoming mail server login. SMTP ports can be either 25 or 587. We recommend 587 as some Internet service providers block port 25 unless using their servers. Encryption such as SSL or TLS would need to be disabled in order to connect successfully.<br />
</span></li></ul>
<p>These instructions seem simple, but repeatedly end up with an SMTP failure error. (Using same settings for POP are fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue that the email provider requires authentication? There is no option that I can see on Outlook.com to authenticate the SMTP (but there is in Microsoft Outlook's SMTP account settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with this? I've searched the community and not found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alan</p>

            <p>Hi Arvind!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for helping!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I'm talking about web-based outlook.com and I've used the 'add a send and receive account option. &nbsp;I've mostly succeeded - I've successfully imported all my emails from my MS Outlook on my PC, and I receive emails to my outlook.comWeb account with no
 problems. It's just sending them that's the problem as it won't accept my SMTP settings using my server's details - only if I select the send using outlook.com which then looks messy as it sends my emails on behalf of me via a long outlook address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello again Arvind, and thanks for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the answer re two-step verification process - that means nothing to me, so I am trying to find out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have both POP3 and IMAP account details, but it is POP3 that I've tried. The POP3 (incoming) mail bit works fine, it's the SMTP that seems to not want to work. I did try setting up via IMAP but couldn't work out how to do that - the only instructions
 on outlook.com seemed to involve importing an IMAP Yahoo account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Chrome (latest version) on a Windows 8.1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Arvind!</p>
<p>The error code attached to the undeliverable mail receipt that I get is as follows. Although it says invalid username or password this isn't the case, as I use the same username and password for the POP3.</p>
<p>I notice that when I use MS Outlook (the programme, not web-based outlook.com) I have to authenticate using my ISP (which is btinternet.com) settings, but again those don't work in outook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm not clear what you mean bu this Zig Zag!</p>
<p>I'm currently using Microsoft Outlook (part of the MS Office programme) so therefore using this as an email client. This works fine, and I can send and receive emails with no problem, but once they are downloaded onto Outlook I can't access them from a different
 device away from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am wanting to change away from this to use outlook.com, which is obviously a browser (web) based email service. To set up the account on outlook.com it requires either POP or IMAP settings. I have set up using POP, which is what my email provider
 has given me details of. The POP works and I can receive emails fine using outlook.com. However, the problem that this thread relates to is sending emails via outlook.com, which doesn't appear to accept my SMTP settings. I notice that StephanieHP seems to
 have the same problem, and she has also noticed that outlook.com doesn't seem to have the abitlity to authenticate the SMTP. I don't know if this is what is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alan</p>

</p><p>Your situation is very different and I am not sure it is doable.&nbsp; You POP works because it is incoming.&nbsp; SMTP does not because you are trying to send via your domain through outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For outlook.com the smtp server settings are these</p>

<h2>            N70 Calendar and To-do reminder field access</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
Just wanted to check if anyone knows of a way to access the Calendar memos and to-do reminder fields on this phone. These were accessible on my old nokia 7210 but not on the N70????!!!<br />
<br />
Is it anything that was fixed in later firmware versions? Speaking of which... How do I check my firmware?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any good Symbian software that synch's more calendar and to-do fields with outlook such as categories etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

                    <p>Hi ...I have my 3rd party mail account configured to my outlook.live.com . The mails have been synced and so did the folders(including sent items) , however whenever i try to send mails from outlook.live.com ,using the account which i configured , the mails
 are sent without any issues but the mails are not saved in the sent items of my outlook.live.com. &nbsp;I then checked the mail settings of my 3rd party provider and they do have the settings set properly for saving all the messages to sent items."Copy Email Messages

            The way I see it, if you have a connected account configured to use POP (or IMAP, for that matter), then your outgoing mail isn't using Outlook.com's SMTP server to send the message. It's using the connected account's SMTP server, which means the Sent
 folder on that remote service should have a copy of the outgoing message. Your Outlook.com mailbox won't even see the outgoing message and, hence, won't have a copy in the Outlook.com Sent folder.

    <title>Office 2010 Something weird with quotation marks key only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylkay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 Something weird with quotation marks key only</h2>
                    I am trying to type quotation marks but I get a capital E with an accent mark above it... so I'm getting an incorrect symbol for " marks.<br />
What do I need to do to clear this?&nbsp; When I type a single quote mark I get an odd looking different font single quote mark?&nbsp; Something is<br />
up with that one key.&nbsp; All others work fine? Windows 7 or Vista... not sure. <br />
<br />
thanks Cheryl<br />

<p>I can't get into the account because this person has removed my ability to access, and has their contact details listed as the primary contact.</p>

    <title>Minimum date from an array but excluding blanks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonbailey1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minimum date from an array but excluding blanks</h2>
                    <p>I am using an array to return the earliest date appearing for a set of data with a common characteristic of "batch numbers".
</p>
<p>=MIN(IF($A$4:$A$10000=$A1,$C$4:$C$10000))</p>
<p>where A is the list of batch numbers and C is the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However some of the entries in C are empty. I am getting the value 00-JAN-00; so I guess that its returning the blank as the min value. I want to exclude these. I tried using SMALL(array,2) but it doesnt seem to work - perhaps because there are multiple
 blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion - but it doesn't seem to work. I'm still getting 00-JAN-00.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use my initial formula above I can successfully return the MAX date in the range - which is why I think the MIN is counting the blanks and causing my issue.&nbsp; But when I use your suggested formula it doesn't work for MAX or MIN.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong><span>I have 3 browsers, This problem effects all 3, so I think it might be in the computer settings itself. Windows
 7 home premium edition, I have windows security center disabled, and windows firewall, (I thought the firewall might have caused it)<br />
IE8 with all critical updates completed, Firefox 5.0, &amp; Chrome 5.0<br />
<br />
Whenever I try to go to "My Dashboard" on playlist.com, or if I try to f-connect with facebook at buyearnplay.com. There are a few other sites as well but these are the important ones. The page keeps refreshing over and over again at a rate of about 2 refreshes
 per second.<br />
<br />
This computer is only 1 month old, and it has done it since I got it, what could be wrong? I did a spyware scan a couple weeks ago and had spyware but it is gone now. I had PornPopUp and fastclick, I also found &amp; removed a digsby messenger which I never knowingly
 installed. After I turned off restore and ran spybot it successfully cleaned it up! But still same problem, NO SPYWARE!</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>These are the programs I installed since I bought it: Avast home edition, Spybot S&amp;D, Spyware Blaster, Critical
 updates for Win7 </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>and as I said above I have Chrome &amp; Firefox as well</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Hey Lizzyhock,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sounds like your system may still be infected with malware. Did have an antivirus installed and updated when the first infection occurred?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Also please enable your Windows Firewall and antivirus if your computer is attached to a network and/or the Internet.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For now, please go through the steps provided in this thread:</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In your reply please provide a history of your security software. Be sure to list from when you got the computer (if any trial/free security software was installed)
 to current any security programs that were installed/uninstalled in that time frame. Also how long was it between you connecting the computer to a network and installing an antivirus.</span></span></p>

    <title>Upgrade to Windows 10 from windows 10 preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalepoblenz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 from windows 10 preview</h2>
                    <p>I have read the information posted about upgrading from Windows 10 from Windows 10 Preview.. &nbsp;I have a couple of questions as I am sure many people do about this upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally got Windows 8 PRO and installed it on my older computer. &nbsp; I was a fast machine ( only 2 GB of memory) but something about the processor ( it was missing something to install the 64 bit version) I installed the 32 bit version very easily. &nbsp;Then
 I tried to upgrade to 8.1 and it was a bear after several day of trying different things I found the solution after reading several on line community discussions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was elated I now had Windows 8.1 up and running. &nbsp;I wanted to try Windows 10 Preview so I installed it on a different Hard Drive. &nbsp;It worked just wonderful after several tries to install the 32 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here if Microsoft gives a SER# &nbsp;( I assume they will) to install windows 10 pro to the Windows 10 Preview users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I be able to install Windows 10 on a new Hard Drive with a SER# from Microsoft. &nbsp;I installed it ( Windows 10 preview) on an old Hard Drive and If I am going to use it for a main Desktop I would like to reinstall it on a new Hard drive. &nbsp; Or
 will I have to install it on top of the Windows 8.0,8.1 upgraded machine. &nbsp;That could be a problem if the machine crashes I would have to reinstall Windows 8.0 then 8.1 Then 10.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As a tester of Windows 10 preview I am very happy with its performance it is wonderful compared to Windows 8.1. &nbsp; I normally Install two hard drives on my desktop machines one as the boot "C" drive and the other as the DATA drive. If the "C" drive crashes
 I can recover my data.</p>
<p>

            <p>In order to qualify for the final release, at least make sure you joined the Windows Insider Program and you are running a Preview version.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>When asked if there would be a cut off date for Insiders before Windows 10 reached RTM, Microsoft's Gabriel Aul stated that preview builds would continue being delivered up until the final release. "We expect to keep flighting builds to Insiders all the
 way up to RTM. More details to come, but no cutoff planned."</p>

<p>
</p><p>The idea of downloading the ISO for the final release and installing on a blank hard disk does not seem like a possible scenario since there would be no means of knowing if you had a qualifying version or not.</p>

            <p>I'm not really sure how Microsoft intends to handle this...but if you have Win 8.0 and the key you got when you purchased it, you should be able to
<strong>download an 8.1 iso</strong> from a variety of sources including Microsoft (8.1 is a free upgrade for 8.0.)&nbsp; Do that now...;)&nbsp; Since you anticipate using a bare HD, you *may* have to install 8.1 first, depending on how Microsoft does this--will Microsoft
 ask you to "insert Win 8.1 Dvd in a drive" as they used to do long ago with upgrade versions?&nbsp; I don't know, but If they do you will still need your 8.1 DVD disk (download the iso and burn it to disk.)&nbsp; If Microsoft requires that 8.1 be installed, then you
 can do that with a blank HD and your 8.1 DVD on the bare drive.&nbsp; So you are going to need that 8.1 DVD/iso image no matter what, I think. Since 8.1 is free to 8.0 owners there is no reason you cannot do that--should have done it long ago, actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you still have your Win7 install DVD disk then you could install/insert that, of course.&nbsp; I kind of think you should go ahead and use your 8.0 key to install 8.1, though, just to have your bases covered.

            I have Win 7 SP1 and am running 10TP in Virtual Box. When the time comes I want to do a clean install of Win 10 and not upgrade the 7 install. With what you just said it sounds like that is not possible. Or am I misinterpreting? I read somewhere before,
 and I believe it was you Andre, that said an ISO would be available.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When opening a PRT file in Office 2016, it does not show the wizard and opens without formatting.</p>
<p>But, when I go to File -&gt; Open -&gt; File.PRT, it opens it with the wizard no problem...</p>
<p>Is there any way that the wizard can open when I click the file on the desktop?</p>

<p>Excel is set to use system settings.</p>
<p>I have an excel file from USA with different regional settings that does not work.</p>
<p>The problem is that for some reason vba does not use semicolon as list separator but comma.</p>

            Your question is too inaccurate to give a clear answer.
<br />
<br />VBA "speaks" English by default, but depending on what you use and address in excel there are differences.
<br />
<br />Therefor Excel supports the International function to let you determine the settings:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>  Dim Sep As String
  Sep = Application.International(xlListSeparator)</code></pre>
<br />
<br />And in your code you have to use Sep instead of a hard coded comma.
<br />

I was recently given a number of organization charts in a variety of formats...some of which were done using Smart Art.&nbsp; I was able to right click on most of the images and "Save as Picture" but the images in Smart Art could not be extracted individually.&nbsp;
 I ended up w/ a png or jpg of the ENTIRE Smart Art figure.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a way around this?&nbsp; We curently have a request out to send the images to us individually, but I'm looking for a long term solution that I can do myself.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Christine</p>

<p>So I pinged a contact, and Kathy, we're both losing it. :-)</p>
<p>SP2 for Office 2007 added the ungroup capability to SmartArt. You can right-click and ungroup SmartArt if you have SP2 installed. If you don't, you must cut/copy the diagram, paste as EMF/WMF, then ungroup the metafile.</p>
<p>An alternative is to select the shape in the SmartArt diagram, copy it, then click away from the SmartArt and paste. You'll get the shape, complete with adjustment handles. I find this handy, especially for some of the swoopy arrows.</p>
<p>Convert to Shapes was introduced in PPT 2010. Oh, how they all run together after awhile. lol</p>

<h2>            Nokia520&#47;Windows 8.1 - Here Maps and Here Drive not working</h2>
                    <p>I have used Here Maps and Drive for a couple of years with great&nbsp; success after an initial problem was overcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few days I have updated the maps for UK/Ireland/Italy - after which neither Apps work.&nbsp; After tapping the relevant icon to open either of them, only the Title screen opens and freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled both apps and reinstalled direct from 'Store' to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got any ideas???</p>
<p>
</p><p>FOR INFORMATION</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 23 Feb. I contacted <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://help.here.com'
</span>by email and sent the same data above --- within a couple of hours both apps were working as normal and did not have to do a thing.&nbsp; Now that is service.</p>
