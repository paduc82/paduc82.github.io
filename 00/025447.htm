<h2>            Internet Explorer set as Default browser on Outlook 2013 or 2016 will often be struggling saying &#34;LAST UPDATED XX&#47;XX&#47;XX &#35;&#58;&#35;&#35;pm - CONNECTING&#34; down in the blue line just above the Task Bar.</h2>
                    <p><span>I'd struggled with this for months since I like Internet Explorer way more than any other browser so I've always had it set as my Default browser.&nbsp; A Microsoft employee tech helper over at the Microsoft Answers Desk
</span><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu</a><span>&nbsp;figured it out today when he reset my default browser to
</span><span>EDGE </span><span>and Outlook started up like a bullet.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever it is doing this, I'd see a little yellow "?" on the Outlook Task Bar icon.</span></p>
<p><span>In my case, I've had Outlook 2013 set up with only my outlook.com email address using the Exchange Activesync settings so that my Windows 10 Nokia Lumia 950-XL phone could share everything to make my life simpler.</span></p>
<p><span>During this support call, we upgraded me to Office 2016 Home &amp; Business which includes Outlook 2016 and this darned "CONNECTING" delay kept happening. That's when, after some messing around, he discovered that switching Outlook from using my default
 browser Internet Explorer to EDGE sped it up a ton </span></p>
<p><span>He was able to set Outlook to use EDGE as its default browser for Connecting to their server&nbsp;but he was able to keep my Default browser set to Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>With it set this way, even links in emails in my Outlook Inbox will open automatically using Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe I should divorce Internet Explorer? But I Like her SO much. ;-)</span></p>

            Hi Heather,
<br />No, you cannot get the document's actual created date when you save it from email. Depending on the document type, the actual created date is not included in the metadata, so you can't discover it at all. It is on Word and Excel files, but that is a document property, not a windows file property. 
<br />
<br />In this screenshot example, the Excel sheet has been sent back and forth by email for 6 weeks. (I created the PDF here.)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1e7cba6-5e9e-48db-b26e-97e09d72850b?upload=true" />

            Thanks for your help. I had looked at a question posed, answered and closed last year so wondered if there had been any new developments with this problem which only occurred when our work system was&nbsp; upgraded. Previously had automatically saved the date
 the attachment created/sent.

            Did it save the created date for all attachments or use the received date?  Some older versions of Outlook/Windows used the current date for messages and attachments saved to the hard drive and the received date for messages and attachments that were older. (I recall the switch was at about 2 months - I'll look for my notes.)
<br />
<br />Now the messages and attachments are all saved with the current date - if you want to use the sent/received date, you need to use a macro to either add the date to the file name or set the properties (filenames are easier to do than the file properties). 
<br />
<br />If you have a link to the old threads, I'll take a look at them.

<p>Hi Diane</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry , I'm not technical enough to understand all of your reply. I save the attachments then up load the data they contain into another system so once uploaded the attachments are then deleted. It's just the period of time when I have saved them to our
 file before uploading to our other system that is the problem. for example today I have saved attachments form last Thurs, Fri and yesterday ready to upload to our LMS but all look as if they came today. I have run this by my company's tech people who haven't
 been able to help. Guess it is something we will have to live with.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yeah, that is a problem but there isn't much you can do, expect save the attachments daily when possible. 
<br />
<br />If they are office documents, the Content created field may be useful - but only if the file was created and sent the same day.

    <title>Freezing A Cell Value Within A Formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanstayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing A Cell Value Within A Formula</h2>
                    <p>Here is my scenario,</p>
<p>I have a chart in iTunes that is my trending 100 and I update it manually each week. To solve for the top songs of the year, I rely on an inverse point system that I also update manually. But to account for songs who may not retain their peak position but
 still last many weeks on the chart, I devised a multiplier system to which you would multiply the points earned that week, by the number of weeks on the countdown divided by 52, and add them to the initial value. The formula resembles =(p*(n/52))+p. (where
 p is the points rewarded and n is the number of weeks). Now my problem starts to arise when for 2016, I want to devise a system that updates automatically, all I need to do is enter the p value. But to make my spread sheet clear and uncrowded/easy to maneuver,
 I create 12 additional sheets, one for each month so I can easily access the 100-120 songs for that month only. To find the value n in my formula above, I could use the count function, summing the counts for various sheets together.The issue is that, the count
 function would update every week and change all my previous values recorded at the week before. So is there a way to freeze the formula in the cell, so it feeds off the cell value one time only and doesn't update automatically?</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<p>Method to freeze a cell value in a formula while the cell value updates, the formula will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this was hard to follow, I've been devising this system for almost a year now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help you have to offer!</p>

            <p>I'm not exactly sure what yu are trying to achieve. But, you can set calculation to manual in Excel preferences. Then the formula will only be calculated when it is initially entered.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another method is to edit the formula to replace the cell reference with a value. You can do this by highlighting the reference in the formula bar and pressing F9. then click the green arrow to enter the formula s it appears n the formula bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not what you want, you'll have to explain further.</p>

<p>I didn't delay or say anything. I don't work for Microsoft, neither do most people in this community.</p>

    <title>Problems downloading apps Nokia Lumia 625 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lhallan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems downloading apps Nokia Lumia 625</h2>
                    I've been using Spotify Premium for some time without any problems. A couple of days ago it was not responding so I deleted to reinstall (I also did the same with Facebook and Messenger which worked ok). I have not been able to reinstall Spotify. I reach
 a screen saying Attention Required. Tap here' and it then says Unable to install. Check for updates. I don't have any updates pending. When I switched my phone on today, it said it was scanning the SD card for errors but none were flagged. I have tried installing
 Spotify on the phone and the SD card. I've also reset the phone several times. Today when I click on my Calendar, it doesn't open and switches immediately back to the home screen. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

<p>Hi,&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7EB4BE2C-97AB-4EEB-BF83-D47685F7B73C">luluall</a>. Thanks for participating in the community. Can you
 download another app to see if you will encounter the same error message? Have you tried using another connection to download and install this one? Try using another WiFi connection to further isolate the issue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>BTW, how did you reset the phone? Is it via Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone? If no, you can perform this step after creating a backup file:

</p><p>Why can't I see the uninstall option when right-clicking an app? What other alternatives are there to uninstalling an app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this has nothing to do with Anti-virus software. I only have Windows Defender and I have it turned off. So, please don't bother mentioning that.</p>

            <p>This is because these apps, where the uninstall is missing, is are a part of Windows, and they can't be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why have you deactivated the Defender, when you don't have another antivirusprogram? Please, turn it on again - it is only nessesary to deactivate it, if there is some update, the PC don't want to eat...</p>

 to Word 2013, 2016, and 2019). If you've already done all of that, starting with a list style, then you can go to Section 6 of the article about how to edit the numbering. If you haven't adhered to the whole procedure, then start again at Section 3.</p>

<p>Thanks! I also found an instructional video on youtube that walked through this step by step... I got it fixed but this is crazy that Microsoft would build such a non intuitive function in word.</p>
<p>

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install VLC player and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try clicking on the

            Thanks for trying to help. I already tried re-installing. I also tried Window Media Player and it behaves the same way. Strange enough, videos work properly in MediaMonkey. Guess I'll have to use that until this gets fixed.

            <p>probably the crash is related with your video drivers, because now the new version of VLC come with hardware acceleration enabled in automatic mode, and if your video drivers are not fully updated or not installed properly, then it could be causing the crash.</p>

            I noticed that the video drivers specific to my video card have been updated at least twice in the past couple of weeks, the last one just days ago. Since videos still work correctly in MediaMonkey (but still not VLC or WMP) then the video drivers have
 to be working, right? And how can video drivers be "not installed properly" if I simply use the&nbsp;automated update function in W10? &nbsp;I can't understand how updates make W10 worse rather than better. All my apps worked a week ago and now updates destroy rather
 than help. Even HERE Maps don't work. Why go backwards? (I'm sure there is a good technical answer to that.)

As Windows 10 Technical Preview is a new operating system, the drivers for all the hardware might not be compatible. I would suggest you to uninstall all the video card drivers and try installing in compatibility mode.
<br />
<br />
Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows<br />

            Thanks, but no thanks. Why would W10 give me a specific driver update that is not compatible? I've already installed, re-installed, built and rebuilt my system several times. I'm thankful for a new, better Windows and the chance to be involved and learn
 the&nbsp;OS early.&nbsp;But, unless more apps quit working I'll wait for an automated fix via update or new build.

<h2>            Unable to enable device encryption on 8.1 phone since reverting from Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    Hello, I recently reverted from Windows 10 Mobile back to 8.1.&nbsp; Since then, I have been unable to push activesync policies requiring device encryption to this phone.&nbsp; I am using Office 365 Business Essentials exchange admin center to push out mobile device
 mailbox policies.&nbsp; Before the upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, and during the time I was using Windows 10 Mobile, I was able to push&nbsp;policies requiring device encryption.&nbsp; Has the ability to enable device encryption through activesync policies&nbsp;been removed from
 Windows Phone 8.1?&nbsp; I am using a Microsoft Lumia 735.

            <p><span>Hi Jj735,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No, the ability to enable device encryption through ActiveSync policies is not removed on Windows Phone 8.1.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the problem you met, I’d like to collect some information</span><span>：</span></p>
<p><span>1. As you mentioned “Before the update to Windows 10 Mobile…,” do you mean it worked well on Windows 8.1 before?</span></p>
<p><span>2. If possible, use a Lumia 735 with Windows Phone 8.1 (not reverting from Windows 10 Mobile) and confirm whether you can enable device encryption.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, I’d like you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Restart your Lumia to see whether you can successfully enable device encryption.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Reinstall your Windows Phone 8.1 system and check whether the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Choose the option in the Exchange admin center.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Login to your Exchange admin center with your admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Navigate to mobile -&gt; mobile device mailbox policies -&gt; choose your policy.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the “Allow mobile devices that don’t fully support these policies to synchronize” option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope the above information helps. Let us know any updates when you have time.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>Yes, it worked&nbsp;well&nbsp;on Windows phone 8.1 before the upgrade to Windows 10 mobile.&nbsp; I do not have access to another Lumia 735, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the message I get when I try to sync the&nbsp;office 365&nbsp;account on the phone:&nbsp; 'We weren't able to apply the security policy that's required by outlook.office365.com. Contact you company's support person to fix the problem.&nbsp; Error code: 86000C2B'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I uncheck 'Require device encryption' in the mobile device mailbox policies, it syncs without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have tried to set 'Allow mobile devices that don't fully support these policies to synchronize', but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jj735,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the error message you provided, this issue may occur if an Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policy was implemented that uses parameters that the Windows Phone-based device cannot completely enforce.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue, please take one of the following actions:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Change the existing Exchange ActiveSync policy to apply only to supported policy parameters.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Create a new Exchange ActiveSync policy that applies the supported policy parameters that Windows Phone devices can implement. Then, assign this policy to Windows Phone users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem persists, please feel free to let us know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Barry</span></p>

            <p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to have the phones encrypted.&nbsp; Device encryption is supported by both Windows phone 8.1, and the Lumia 735, so I don't understand what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to submit this issue as a bug report.&nbsp; If you could please forward this post to your software developers, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I have once again upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile on my Lumia 735&nbsp;so that I can&nbsp;enable device encryption through activesync policies.&nbsp; It works with Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather run 8.1, so I hope this problem is fixed in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not the only one having this problem:&nbsp;search for post titled&nbsp;'Unable to encrypt the phone after reverting from windows 10'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Based on the research and the suggestions from engineering team, the issue could be related with the cache on previous version or a known issue with storage encryption on Windows 8.1 device. You can have a try on factory resetting the
 device which could fix the issue caused by the cache remained from previous version, but you can wait for the engineering fix in the near future if it is not a proper action for you.”</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Installer is triggered when an e-mail is received by Outlook 365 &#40;Microsoft Store version&#41; if Junk E-mail setting is set to Low</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please bear with me here as I'm not sure if this is reproducible elsewhere (checked on two different PCs) but I've noticed the following:</p>
<p>When using Outlook 365 from Microsoft Store along with Outlook.com account in Cached Mode (set to download all e-mails) or any IMAP/POP3 account with PST and when Junk E-mail settings is set to Low (default is None) then Windows Installer will be triggered
 and will always fail with:</p>
<p><em>Beginning a Windows Installer transaction: {90160000-000F-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}. Client Process Id: 11912.</em></p>
<p><em>Ending a Windows Installer transaction: {90160000-000F-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}. Client Process Id: 11912.</em> (these process IDs are from Outlook.exe)</p>
<p><em>Detection of product '{90160000-000F-0000-0000-0000000FF1CE}', feature 'ProductFiles' failed during request for component '{0B00104E-DE7F-4A05-AAEB-3ACD632A6F6A}'</em></p>
<p>(entries from Event Viewer -&gt; Application)</p>
<p>Additionally, Windows Installer window briefly pops-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on a Process Monitor trace (available if anyone needs it), when a new message arrives (from an e-mail address that is not in Contacts or is not my own e-mail address) and if Junk E-mail filtering is set to Low, Outlflt.DLL gets loaded by Outlook.exe
 process and that triggers Windows Installer to start to install/repair something. Every single time.</p>

            Hi Emkay,
<br />
<br />I will try to repro it on my store installations, but note that it probably won't be (intentionally) fixed as they are discontinuing the store version. A future update could fix it though.  (They will continue to release updates for the store version.)

            They were supposed to be the future, but it's apparently not ready for prime time. 
<br />
<br />Specifically for outlook, there are issues with com addins, scanpst. My major complaint is **everything** is in the package folder (except pst files) - and a repair wipes it all out. It's not a problem for me - i have exchange accounts, but it is a big problem with imap accounts and 'this computer only' folders.

<p>Well, then I have shot myself in the foot by deciding to go Microsoft Store version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fun part is that I can't find a way to export Outlook profile settings from the registry container for the UWP application so I could then import them to ClickToRun version of Office 365. While that's not a problem for Outlook.com account, I believe
 it is a problem for POP3 account. As far as I recall new POP3 profile in Outlook would mean that all the e-mails would be redownloaded (if they are present on the e-mail server) even if the same PST file is used.</p>

<p>It seems that you actually can look at the registry for Outlook Microsoft Store app. The registry files are here:</p>
<p>c:\ProgramData\Packages\Microsoft.Office.Desktop_8wekyb3d8bbwe\<em>user's SID</em>\SystemAppData\Helium\</p>
<p>You can use Process Monitor to trace Outlook start and filter by RegLoadKey operation - svchost.exe responsible for AppInfo Windows Service will load the keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it's a matter of closing Outlook, copying User.dat, User.dat.LOG1, User.dat.LOG2 files somewhere (to avoid editing the files that are actually used in Outlook), running regedit.exe, clicking on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive or HKEY_USERS hive, clicking File
 -&gt; Load Hive and pointing to the copied User.dat file (naming the loaded hive key "Test" for example).</p>
<p>And we get access to the registry used by Office 365 Store version:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e63efeaf-c713-4b9c-ba47-167d16a60490?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e63efeaf-c713-4b9c-ba47-167d16a60490?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards, the key should be unloaded by clicking on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Test (or whatever name was given during load phase) and using File -&gt; Unload Hive</p>
<p>Whether the exported registry entries with the profile would work in ClickToRun version is another story (after adjusting the registry paths in exported reg file)...</p>

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I'll test it. I think it will work about half - the problem is the exchange and imap data files won't be found at the expected path and that could corrupt the profile. It should say 'oops can't find the files' and create new ones in the default location - this will sometimes corrupt the address book though. 
<br />
<br />The big problem is the average user won't be comfortable getting the reg keys.  :(  To the best of my knowledge, Microsoft is working on something to aid in migration - i'm assuming it will move everything back to the standard app data paths and to the registry location C2R uses. At least I hope that is what it does. 
<br />
<br />I used an app to record the profile location as I set up a profile but didn't take the time to figure out where outlook/windows stored them when not loaded.  Thanks :)

<p>If you have Outlook set to send immediately, you can try&nbsp;to stop it&nbsp;by clicking on Outlook then select "Work Offline". There might be other ways, but this gives you a chance to catch it in the Outbox.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            OneNote is not syncing on MacBook Pro with error 0xE0000007</h2>
                    OneNote has been working fine on my MacBook Pro for at least a year but in the last month I have had numerous syncing issues (reporting error code
<p><span>0xE0000007)</span><span>. I have been through all of the recommended
 steps to fix it but the issue is still present. It does not happen when I use a browser, on my iPad or on my Android phone. I have even uninstalled and re-installed the application, which initially seemed to fixe the sync issue, but it started happening again
 within a week. I can open my notebooks from OneDrive and they open without issue, but refuse to sync when I make changes.</span></p>

            According to a OneNote engineer the error 0xE00000007 most of the times means, that there HAS BEEN a syncing error some time ago. But this error is cached, so the message may remain for quite a while (he said something about up to 30 mins). When you see this error, I would recommend that you check, if your notebook is really not syncing. For example apply any change and login to www.onenote.com using a web browser. If you can see the change in OneNote Online, all is good (except for the annoying message). The dev team is currently looking up for ways to clear this message sooner or another solution to this irritation.
