<h2>            Accidentally deleted my &#34;sent mail&#34; folder. HELP</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook (NOT Outlook Express) and when Charter webmail, which I never use, told me I had too many folders and needed to delete some, I accidentally deleted my "Sent Mail" folder. Aside from sending a bcc to myself every time, I have done everything
 I can to reinstate this folder. I am not that concerned about ones already sent, although I would like to know where in the heck they are going but I would like to at least get the folder back so I can start saving them now. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks so much</p>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you have lost your Sent folder on Outlook.&nbsp;Let me see how can I help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I may ask, is it Outlook.com or Microsoft Office Outlook that you are using? Also, do you&nbsp;have&nbsp;a Microsoft account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, I would suggest that you access your account using the web browser to check if the same issue persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Account UPN change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shannonlievens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account UPN change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Description:</p>
<p>After upgrading to Windows 10, I have experienced numerous problems with my email account. I use my email address to login to my system. At some point, I believe I may have somehow converted my sign-in email - ONLINE - from an MSN account to an Outlook account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary:</p>
<p>I can no longer login with my MSN credentials, as it says my account does not exist. I am able to login to my new email account, and can still see all of the previous emails from my old account. I am no longer receiving email sent to my old address, but
 can receive emails sent to my new account. I believe this is due to the fact that none of the websites that I subscribe to (e.g. Facebook, Pinterest, Amazon, etc.) are configured to send emails to my new email address. When a test email is sent to my old account,
 it results in a failure (because the account does not exist).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: </p>
<p>Is there any chance that the User Principle Name (UPN) for my previous account was changed to that of my new account? If so, can this change be reverted?</p>

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a project where all tasks should be auto-scheduled but the total duration of the hours comes to 633 hrs when it should total up to 1053 hours (58+122+364+361+148). For some reason the "Design Software" task is totaling up to 511 hours when
 it should be 725 (364+361). Is there something wrong with my calendar or have I not assigned tasks properly?<br />

<p>Hi Emanuel,</p>
<p>You may need to refresh your understanding of "Duration" as opposed to "Work".</p>
<p>For a summary task:</p>
<p>- Work is the sum of the work of the subtasks.</p>
<p>- Duration is the difference between the early finish and early start of the summary task, computed according to the applicable calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While your at it, I'd suggest removing the logical relationships on the summary tasks - both predecessors and successors. &nbsp;Not much good and a whole lot of bad things are associated with them, and they are considered bad practice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, tom</p>
<p>
</p>

            Emmanuel, like Tom says, duration is the span from the start to the finish. Also, like Tom says, never use the summaries as predecessors or successors. There are so many reasons why this is a bad scheduling practice but perhaps the most important is that
 circular references are almost a certainty. While we are at it, never assign resources or costs to summaries either.<br />

<h2>            Pinned files missing from Excel</h2>
                    <p>Workbooks I use all the time have begun disappearing from the pinned files list. I pin them again only to have them disappear. The Excel splash screen shows the pinned files for a second, but then the screen refreshes and they are gone. All the files are
 stored on OneDrive (locally and remotely) and I am connected and signed-in when this happens. The files all have a shortcut beginning with https://d.docs.live.net/...</p>
<p>The Excel splash screen has the file list on the left with this text:</p>
<p>Excel</p>
<p>Recent</p>
<p>Pinned</p>
<p>...file list of 12 entries (all .xlsx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens many times per day for the past week and, needless to say, it is very annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't locate a solution so thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi PCUser_749,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate this, kindly access the Excel application in safe mode. This would help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing the problem.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your <strong>Office</strong> application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click Yes when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>safe mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When running in safe mode and the pinned documents are still missing, let's go ahead and run a repair for your Excel program. You can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps. If running repair didn't help, you may proceed with using the
<em><strong>Easy Fix tool </strong></em>to completely uninstall Office. The download link for the tool is provided on the same article.<br />

<p>Thanks for the suggestion but it didn't work. This is what I observed:</p>
<p>Started Excel with CTL double click. Confirmed safe mode start message box.<br />
No splash screen.<br />
Clicked File Menu: No recent list appears. Message says "You haven't opened any workbooks recently".<br />
Closed Excel.<br />
Started Excel normally and the problem persists. My most recently opened workbook this morning lost its pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate a reply about why this is happening instead of workarounds. I have always trusted Excel not to lose my work and this is unsettling.</p>
<p>I have no add-ins or extensions except those that are part of Excel.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Just to confirm, is your Excel application up-to-date? To check, you may refer to this

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried replicating your concern here on my end by pinning a workbook that is saved in OneDrive and restart the application. The pinned workbook is still showing on the Pinned section and I also unchecked the
<strong>Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open</strong> in OneDrive Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Repair Office didn't help, I suggest that you use the <em><strong>Easy Fix tool</strong></em> provided on the same article above to uninstall Office and reinstall it afterwards.

<p>I do not have a business subscription. This is what it says under my product information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Personal<br />
Share Office with up to 5 others and install on all your devices<br />
1 TB of OneDrive storage<br />
$69.99 per year</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the splash screen for Excel just changed yesterday. The pinned file list has moved from left to right and there are fewer items in the list. Some of my pinned files are still missing and must be added manually each time I open them.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving! Thank you for standing by. Since all the files are stored in OneDrive, can you please try to move just one folder/file to your computer's drive/File Explorer and try pinning it in Excel. This is to further isolate if the problem is caused
 by OneDrive synchronization. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience. Kindly update us on the result.</p>

            I have been testing pinned files since my copy of Excel received an automatic update a couple of days ago. No pin has been lost in my recent tests. It is probably too soon to say that the issue is fixed, so I will do some more testing in a normal week.
 Here is a capture of the new Excel splash screen. I erased the file names before uploading the capture.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1826e212-aadc-498f-9f2b-a9531b78a44b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1826e212-aadc-498f-9f2b-a9531b78a44b?upload=true" /></a>

            Best guess: your account was compromised and a hacker created a rule ot forward your mail to another address. 
<br />
<br />go to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/inboxrules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/options/inb...</a> to delete any rules in your account.

<h2>            Use Access to send email from data in a table</h2>
                    <p>We track production hours in a reporting database on a daily basis. I have created a make table query to identify which people have not completely filled in the necessary hours.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to create an email that will send out a reminder based on the table I created., using the&nbsp;data in the table to complete&nbsp; the "to:" section and complete a text&nbsp;string message... &nbsp;What code will let me send emails to only the people in the table and
 not to everyone on a daily basis? </p>
<p><br />
Also is there a way to automate this function so the email can be sent at a certain time?</p>

            <p>There are several ways around this.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the free Outlook Redemption code library (<a href="http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/home.htm</a>); this lets you work around the security warnings. This requires a complete rewrite
 of the code, though.</li><li>Or you can use the free utility Express ClickYes (<a href="http://www.contextmagic.com/express-clickyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contextmagic.com/express-clickyes/</a>) to automatically click Yes for you.</li></ul>

<p>You have to substitute the name of the table and of the relevant fields, and you can modify the strings as needed, of course.</p>
<p>You could keep a form open all the time, set the Timer Interval to (for example) 3600000 (the number of milliseconds in a day), and create an On Timer event procedure. In the procedure, check if the time of day is - say - between 9 AM and 10 AM, and if so,
 run the SendMessages procedure.</p>

<h2>            E66 WPA&#47;WPA2 vs Opera mini</h2>
                    
<p>I have security settings activated on my router.</p>
<p>Finally figured out how to use them with E66.</p>
<p>I am in the main menu -&gt; select Internet and within seconds I am online BUT</p>
<p>When I open Opera 5 mini... a list of possible connections popup and there is no point that I had set up.</p>
<p>If only I could get it to the list - I'd be home...</p>
<p>If only I could change the default browser - same story...</p>
<p>so far to no avail..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who's got any ideas?</p>

<p>the snag is... no wlans are accessible..search ends with zero results..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried this:</p>
<p>GPS -&gt; Maps -&gt; only one access point popped up since I had deleted all the unnecessary ones and... works like a charm..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so how to make Opera work for me? I could use Opera mobile... but it's a tryout version, sadly.</p>
<p>+ Skyfire-S60 acted alike, couldnt find wlan.</p>

<p>add your home acces point in menu&gt;settings&gt;connections&gt;destinations&gt;add new acc. pt. than try the opera mini .</p>

<p>why do you suggest adding another access point if it's already there?</p>
<p>it's also set as default in internet settings</p>
<p>and thats the name of the game - if it's there, if i can connect with the default browser and GPS, why can't I connect using Opera? why my access point is not listed as expected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or am i getting confused here...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <em>could easily update</em> the dictionary whereas updating quickoffice fails...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit//added a new acc point, just to see if it would get listed... guess what? it's not there...</p>

            It seems that you are allready connected and opera want to use this connection whitch is in use by another app. Hold the home key for a few seconds, to see whitch progs are still active. Turn of security settings WPA/WEP of the router or AP and phone to
 check your connection.

<p>If I changed them I might not be able to get them back cause usually my cousine sets it up for me ;)</p>

<p>how can anything be active w/o my permission?</p>
<p>what apps can it be?</p>
<p>I only installed a few themes, Opera, energy profiler and those are not open/active...</p>
<p>It's still a bit confusing for me how it works and how it SHOULD work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>one thing I noticed... the <strong>icon </strong>that stands for: available WLANS shows up from time to time even though WLAN scan has been disabled in the main screen...</p>
<p>how to disable WLAN completely then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yesterday </strong>I finally got out of the house and went to work..I only had a few minutes to spare but that was enough to see the freakish WLAN icon appear on my screen, so I went to Installations, opened Opera 5 and.. for the first time ever
 a WLAN was found! Too bad it was also protected lol but the upshot of the whole story is... the settings of
<u>my</u> router prevent my cell from connecting by means of opera,&nbsp;</p>
<p>or am I wrong? ;)</p>

<h2>            Defender Turned Off By Group Policy - gpedit.msc DOES NOT work</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a serious problem turning back on Windows Defender. Before I got a virus it worked fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran various commands (gpedit.msn, etc.) to open the Group Policy Editor -&nbsp;none worked.
<a href="http://www.rushinformation.com/windows-find-gpedit-msc-error-windows-78-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This site</a> provided a link to install Group Policy Editor but when I ran it my unpacker (unzip app) didn't work. I wasn't sure if it was safe so I tried to install the Group Policy Management Console from the Windows site (I have a Windows 10 operating system).
 Windows did not allow me to install it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!&nbsp;My computer is&nbsp;currently unprotected. </p>

            yes it should work with no problems. n85 comes in a box with a 8gb card. in theory n85 should be able to support cards for up to 32gb tho, these do not yet exist.

            <p>Except the OS is not completely broken. It is only part of the Store that is broken and that part is the link between the store, the user and their apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the rest of Windows 10 works. Everything else except OneNote mobile login and Store browse, buy and library works well with my MS accounts - OS login, Office Mobile, OneDrive, Edge, Groove Music, Film and TV, Mail and Calendar, Office 2016 - even the
 Store for Music or Film and TV or updates to already installed apps. It is just the ability to browse in the Store, buy or reinstall in the Store or look at my library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall the whole OS every time&nbsp;the Store and OneNote Mobile lose their ability&nbsp;to maintain proper links to their remote accounts and databases is extreme and it no solution for the ordinary user. The simple answer is MS must fix this or people will not
 use the store but will still be able to use all their normal apps, so people will not use apps on the store and people will not develop for the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question still stands - were is the fix that Elise [MSFT] requested information on for MS to develop?</p>

</p><p>Just like last time, I can't remember if it was during 10122 or 10130, the store just recommenced working, no local reset of the cache or the OS, no OS clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your advice and for a OS issue it sometimes the only solution. If this was not fixed from the server side by launch then I intended to follow your advice (and still might do a clean install soon after launch)

<p>Hi Artichunter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Skype version are you on? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, the last 30 days of your conversation history should still be accessible when you're signed in to Skype on any device or platform&nbsp;as&nbsp;the past 30 days of your conversation history&nbsp;is stored in the cloud.
</p>
<p>

<p>Were there any changes made to your computer? If there are and the Skype folder on your device has been deleted, it can cause your conversation history to be deleted. Once messages have been deleted or removed from the app, I'm afraid there is no option
 to recover them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, your conversation for the past 30 days is stored centrally in our cloud. You should see them when you sign in to

<p>That recent changes made on&nbsp;your device&nbsp;might have resulted to the deletion of your conversations. I'm afraid that if your conversation history is no longer showing up on the app, there's no way we can get them back.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I know some people actually like it but i hate bing, please stop forcing it on us, windows 10 will fail if you keep forcing things&#33;</h2>
                    <p>title pretty much says it all, i dont like bing, and i dont want microsoft to continue forrcing it onto our computers, its a violation and its wrong, its fine if you want it, its even fine for a default, and im not suggesting that people should not be able
 to have it if they actually want it, but please please please dont force it on people that dont want it, please give us the choice of which search engine to use with windows 10 search and cortana</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason i dont like bing is mostly because it keeps being forced at me, here there and everywhere, and now in windows 10 its being forced at me again, bing feels like a virus to me because i never want it yet there it is . I automatically strongly reject
 anything attempting to force me against my will to do anything i did not implicitly ask for, its just wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>windows 10 will fail</strong> if you FORCE people to use bing instead of their preferred search provider</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the categories to post this are severely lacking, i did my best to file this appropriately</p>

            They are not<br />
&nbsp;forcing you to use Bing. You can uninstall the Bing Apps (Food &amp; Drink, Health &amp; Fitness, News, Sports, &amp; weather). You can even turn Cortana off if you don't want to use it. Right click an empty area of the taskbar&gt;search&gt;disabled. Wala! You no longer have
 to be forced onto bing. But it's default in internet explorer - you can change that. You should know how to do that. However, what you are mentioning and if you are using Windows 10, they will replace IE with a browser called Spartan.<br />

            I think the Recycle Bin feature only works for OneNote 2010 notebooks. Which means you will have to convert your notebook to the OneNote 2010 format in order to enable Recycle Bin.<br />

<h2>            Word Won&#39;t Close</h2>
                    <p>After the last Microsoft Office update on Mac Yosemite (OXS 10.10), the red button in the left corner of Word disappeared. &nbsp;So - trying to close a document, I used the Command W function. &nbsp;Sometimes it works. &nbsp;Most of the time, it crashes word. &nbsp;I've sent
 so many error reports to Microsoft that I am frustrated.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Restart you computer and then before opening any Office applications Repair Permissions on your primary drive using the Disk Utility application that is is the Applications/Utilities folder on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that is done, restart you computer again which will allow the permission changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: After any software update you should do the above. In the computer software world its called "Preventative Maintenance".</p>

<h2>            Q&#58; Converting Publisher docs to InDesign</h2>
                    We've switched from Publisher to Adobe InDesign. How can I convert my docs?

<p>Part of your question is best asked over on the Adobe site, where other users may be able to share their experiences. However, one easy way to republish&nbsp;fully-formatted Publisher docs is to print your publisher docs to one or more files as PostScript, using
 a PostScript printer driver and the print to file option from within Publisher. Then, use Acrobat Professional's Distiller (or a free alternative such as "GhostScript") to process the PS (or .prn) files into PostScript-valid PDF or EPS files. (Don't use "PDFwriter"
 -- it creates less efficient code that can cause printing quality and font-substitution problems.) Then, place the converted files into InDesign. If you use Acrobat Pro, you can edit the files, as well.</p>

    <title>Syncing Profile Picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#225;ire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing Profile Picture</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to change my profile picture across all of Office 365. It has synced in most places; however, Outlook and Skype for Business are still showing the old photo in the thumbnail. Delve is also showing the old photo, but when I click the carmera icon
 to change it, the new photo is already uploaded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the source of the problem might be the "My Account" page (https://portal.office.com/account/#personalinfo). On this page, I click "change photo", which opens a pop-up window. I upload a new photo (224kb) in the popup, crop as needed and save. This
 appears to be successful and tells me that my new photo will be displayed across Office 365 shortly. The new photo is displayed as long as I remain on the page. I can open the other settings tabs and change and save settings. However, the new photo disappears
 and it reverts to the old one when I navigate away from the page or refresh. Any other settings I change are maintained (e.g., do not revert). I have even deleted the photo altogether and the old one still reappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this?</p>

<p>

            Hi, unable to see additional contact details like mobile2, work2 and home2 phone numbers in the Microsoft OUTLOOK Android mobile APP – people section.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is applicable to all of my outlook contacts and this issue is not recent. This gap in the Microsoft OUTLOOK Android mobile APP since it was built initially.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft OUTLOOK Android mobile APP version 2.2.66&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have suggested this as a feature in Microsoft OUTLOOK Android mobile APP couple of years back but it seems it has been ignored and solution not deployed yet.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So as a temporary solution I'm exporting all of the contacts from my account (https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people) into CSV file and importing them into my GOOGLE account – so that my phone gets updated with all contact details.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When will you bring this feature and make entire people data visible in the Microsoft OUTLOOK Android mobile APP?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards..
