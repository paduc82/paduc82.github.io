    <title>Truncating an oversized .pst file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Truncating an oversized .pst file</h2>
                    My&nbsp;outlook&nbsp; is no longer working due to an oversized pst file (I use Outlook 2007 on Windows Vista). &nbsp;I have found answers that require me to truncate the file and then run the scanpst.exe tool which is fine and I can manage all this. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But my question is, when I truncate the oversized file, what happens to the data that has been truncated (i.e. cut from the oversized .pst file to make it the correct size)? &nbsp;I will obviously want all the data in my oversized pst file to be available to
 me in Outlook so I can delete/ archive it. Does the truncate tool create two (or more) files that can be imported into outlook following repair? &nbsp;Or is what has been truncated lost to me forever?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>Outlook 2003 and up can use PSTs that start with a maximum size of 20GB but can be adjusted to allow growth beyond that limit.&nbsp; If you ran into a limit, it's because you are using a PST carried over from Outlook 2002 or earlier.&nbsp; You should have recreated
 that PST long before now.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you truncate, the data is lost forever.&nbsp; You will not be able to recover it.</p>
<p>There are third-party commercial PST repair tools that may be able to recover a little more data than the truncate-and-repair method you describe.&nbsp; You can start here to see if you can find one:

http://www.slipstick.com/problems/repair-a-damaged-personal-folders-pst-file/</a>.&nbsp; The very first ad on that page shows a tool that claims to be able to recover oversized PSTs.</p>

<h2>            Connect android phone to windows 7 and windows 10 for office remote</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I am trying to use Microsoft Office Remote to do PowerPoint presentations.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I have office remote installed on both the computer and on the device – three devices actually!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My problem is that when I first attempt to pair the device and computer they are paired but the Bluetooth Peripheral Device drivers are not found. The only drivers found are Audio/Video Remote control and Standard Modem over Bluetooth link.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The pairing then allows me to browse the phone folders, play music and synchronism PIM data with phone book access.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I do attempt to connect the two using Office Remote I get the message that the phone cannot connect to the computer and to check thqt the devices are in range (right next each other) and that Office Remote is installed and running on the computer
 – which it is.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have tried this with a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 (8”) which is my preferred device for this work, a Samsung Galaxy S6 and a Hisense E76.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>All give the same problem.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by device problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest restarting both phone and the PC and see if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you connected previously, but now receiving error messages, try the following:<br />
<br />
1. Quit and restart the app on your phone and close and reopen the files on the PC. When you reopen the files, check the Office Remote tab of the ribbon to make sure that Office Remote is still on (<strong>Office Remote</strong> &gt;
<strong>Office Remote</strong> &gt; <strong>Turn On</strong>).<br />
<br />
2. Try resetting everything. Remove the phone from the PC Bluetooth settings and delete the computer name from the phone. Turn Bluetooth off and back on and try pairing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>TIP:</strong>&nbsp; To delete the computer name from the phone, go to your phone's
<strong>Settings</strong>, tap <strong>Bluetooth</strong>, tap and hold the computer name, and tap
<strong>delete</strong>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

<p><span>Hi </span>André,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you’re experiencing with pairing your Android phone to your Windows PC so you can use the Microsoft Office Remote app can either be
<span>settings or compatibility related</span>. We need additional details to isolate your concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When you mentioned that you have not been able to connect at all, does that mean this is the first time you’re trying to use the Microsoft Office Remote?</li><li>Which version of Office are you using? Click <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> for instructions on how
 to find your Office version.</li><li>Have you tried checking the system and app requirements before installing the application? In case you haven’t, here’s an
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/store/p/office-remote/9wzdncrfhx5h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> that you can use as a reference. Check the

<strong>System Requirements</strong>.</li></ul>

<p>Ok I apologize for the delay in responding, have been busy and not needing to use Office remote. Am again now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Firstly on app requirements the article specifies only windows phones, BUT Office Remote is available on Playstore and has installed on my Android Samsung tab S2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open it it runs but cannot connect to the pc, I believe because the Bluetooth peripheral drivers are not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 - Powerpoint 2016. Office remote is installed on both the pc and the tablet, and is activated in Powerpoint on the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pdf document showing all the screen shots of what happens when I attempt to connect the tablet to the pc via Bluetooth but don't see where I can upload it to this site. I could share it via a dropbox link if that would work.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong>Office Remote </strong>works as a wireless transmitter from a mobile device to a computer. This serves as a remote for making presentations. In order to connect it, you need to make sure that your devices were paired properly.
<span>To ensure that we can provide the appropriate resolution for your concerns with this application, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">winver</span>
</em>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer before you experienced this issue?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>What is the version of <strong>
Office</strong> are you using?</span></li><li><span>Have you already updated your Bluetooth drivers on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you already updated your mobile device firmware?</span></li><li><span>Have you already checked if there are updates on this application across your devices?</span></li><li><span>Some devices are not plug and play. Have you already installed the PC suite of your mobile device?</span></li><li><span>Did you receive any error messages?</span></li></ul>

<p>Ok to answer your questions in order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; I AM NOT USING A WINDOWS DEVICE!! Even the title of the original post refers to an android device. The device is a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 running on Android Version 7.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; there have been no recent changes - this problem has been from the start - in other words I have not managed to connect between the two using Office Remote</p>
<p>3&nbsp; I have attempted to run this with a Samsung Galaxy S6 also running Android 7.0 and a Hisense E76 Android running 6.0.1</p>
<p>4 yes I have updated Bluetooth drivers - and checked repeatedly</p>
<p>5 I have checked - and reloaded the ap</p>
<p>6 What PC Suite is there for Android phones. the only ones I find are for keeping my mobile phone data synchronized with the computer, which is not what I am looking for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error messages I receive are </p>
<p>1 After pairing the computer attempts to download and install the peripheral device drives and I get the message "Bluetooth peripheral device drives not found</p>

<p>Each brand and peripherals have its own design or way on how does their product work. Most devices work best if the manufacturer provides the necessary driver updates to run on
<strong>Windows</strong> computers. <strong>Microsoft</strong> has already had the capability to automatically detect if the device is compatible with your computer or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using a third-party device, this feature will only be limited and works best only with devices made by
<strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your mobile device is having hardware issues, we suggest contacting your manufacturer’s support team for appropriate assistance regarding Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you still need help with our products and services.</p>

<p>Thanks. I have talked to the Microsoft support over several hours today and it took a very long time to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, an in-place Upgrade of Windows which took several hours solved the problem.</p>

<h2>            Disable tabbing&#91;tabbed browsing&#93; in ie11</h2>
                    for sight impaired users of various programs like Jaws, the tabbed browsing&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;be turned off, like all of the previous versions allowed. Also many people just don't want to use tabbing. Can't you put the disable feature back in? The previous registry
 tweaks will no longer work. Does anyone know how to defeat this awful tabbing?

<h2>            Sharepoint Permissions keeps reverting</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to set up a site to house ISO documentation where only the ISO coordinators can edit documents posted, and everyone else in the company can view and print the documents. Everyone should have Read access. When I set everyone except external
 users to 'Read' access, it reverts the next day. The people viewing the documents are very likely to accidentally alter something, which is why it's very important for them to have read only access.</p>

<h3> aprilsan miguel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact Management using Outlook 2016 use CRM or Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I'm a sales rep and have lots of data for each of my customers I want to track and have easy access to when I'm in the field calling on accounts. &nbsp;With my other jobs they provided CRM systems &amp; something like Salesforce would be great. &nbsp;However since I would
 have to pay for hte SF account &amp; it's out of my budget that is not an option for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm already paying for Office 365, so I really would like to use my office applications to manage my customer contacts/information. &nbsp;I've tried many "free trial" CRM systems and they are great but just way to expensive!!! &nbsp; I like the Outlook business cards
 in 2016 - but some of the fields I don't necessarily need some of the default fields - How can I user define the fields to help&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across a few posts in regards to Business Contact Manager - I'm not sure I fully understand what this is?? &nbsp; I'm open to any suggestions... I'm currently using an excel spreadsheet but would love to have all the information I need in a contact card
 or something better than excel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Asha 302 Software issue told by nokia care Wifi is not working</h2>
                    
<p>I had purchased asha 302 at 16 march and it shows WiFi sign,&nbsp;connects the device but does not browse with wifi&nbsp;&nbsp;and it does not working properly. I contacted with Nokia Care and&nbsp; they have told me that it is software problem and you have to wait for 8 or
 9 days until a new update will fix this issue?</p>
<p>Please tell me is there is any issue about Asha 302?</p>
<p>Nokia Care has showed me other asha handset having the same problem.</p>

<p>The Asha 302 of a friend has the same problem. The phone is connected with WiFi, but it's not possible to use the internet, store or any other online applications. There is always an "error 006"-message. Thankfully until now, my Asha 302 doesn't has this
 problem. Will there be soon an update available to solve this WiFi-Problem?</p>

<p>I had experience the similar issue with My Nokia Asha 302.</p>
<p><br />
Initially Social Networking application (Facebook) and email clients (Gmail/Yahoo) are working but CAN NOT use built in Nokia Web browser for Surfing using WIFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally It got fixed, by visiting nokia Care Center, In Sh-e-Faisal Karachi. Right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per them, They had refreshed the software and Setup the Access Point settings. NOW Every thing is working normal...</p>

                    <p>I've been using Onedrive with my accounts: outlook.co.jp and live.jp. I think it's after Office365 appeared thou, it's got disabled to login with my accounts on my Onedrive app, in my MBP, even with my Win7's. When I open Onedrive app, it shows "Office 365".
 When i type my live.jp/outlook.co.jp account,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>Invalid ID or password Malformed id Username not found Malformed id (DOMAIN\alias format) Invalid domain name (not guests)</span></p>
<p><span>live.jp isn't in our system</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you typed your email address correctly. It usually looks like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>but It is sure that i'm using Onedrive on the web. I can access on Internet browsers, upload/download files. Additionally, i'm even paying 50GB plan for one account. Now it seems that Onedrive desktop app usage is restricted for only Office 365-ers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to solve or have same situation?? probably you have ***.com or ***.co.uk/fr etc.</p>

<p>Glad to know the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>And the screenshot you provided is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can use both Microsoft account and work or school account to sign in Microsoft OneDrive.</p>

<p>When we sign in a Microsoft account, we will get the following window:</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t the Cortana live tile look like it does in the Promo&#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every promotion screenshot for Windows 10 shows Cortana giving you a greeting:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97db3bbb-13cb-48b8-aecd-50c47f1b08f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97db3bbb-13cb-48b8-aecd-50c47f1b08f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it has NEVER done that for me or any Windows 10 installation I have ever seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just Microsoft trying to make Cortana look more attractive in the Promo by showing a feature that doesn't even exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my Cortana live tile is failing to show anything most of the time, and when it does show something it's just text of the weather.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments?</p>
<p />

<h2>            desactivar Windows Defender</h2>
                    <div>Hola:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dispongo del windows ultimate, tengo configurado el update para que descargue y yo elegir cuando y que actualizar. Desde hace algo mas de una semana &nbsp;se me descargó una actualización del windows defender y me da error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.141.2892.0)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Detalles del error: Código 8007007E</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Por lo que he leido tiene algo que ver con los antivirus, el mio es el Panda 2012 y para solucionarlo conviene desactivar el windows defender.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;El problema es que no veo que yo tenga instalado este programa o si lo tengo, no se como desactivarlo.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Probe a ocultar la actualización, para que no la instalase y buscase las actualizaciones del sistema posteriores, pero aun asi, me dice siempre que esta actualizado el sistema, para al dia siguiente volver a ver el error de la actualización.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Alguien me podria decir o dar algun consejo para solucionarlo? ya que tengo el software original en todo el equipo, para estar seguro y tranquilo, pero aun asi nada de nada.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Muchas gracias</p>

                    <p>I have a spreadsheet that has multiple rows of information about the same account and I'd like to combine them into one row without having to retype everything.</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community. I'm glad to assist you with your concern.<br />
<br />
I'd like to ask a question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
What do you mean by folder structure? Are you referring to Outlook data file (*.pst)? If yes,&nbsp;follow the steps mentioned below and see if it helps:
<br />
<br />
1) You may right click on the POP3 email account's data file in navigation pane and select
<strong>Close </strong>&lt;<strong>Name of the data file</strong>&gt; to remove it. <br />
<br />
2) If the POP3 email account's data file is set as default, create a new Outlook data file by going to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt; click on
<strong>Data Files</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Add</strong> &gt; <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
2) Set the new data file as the default by selecting it from list of data files available under
<strong>Data Files</strong> tab and click on <strong>Set as Default </strong>&gt;<strong>Yes</strong> &gt;
<strong>Close</strong>.<br />
<br />
3) Now close and re-open and follow <strong>Step 1</strong>.<br />
<br />
Hope you find the above information helpful. If you have further questions related to this issue, please let us know.<br />

Thank you replying.<br />
<br />
Deleting a POP3 email account won't remove any mail folders. You must close the data file manually as mentioned in my previous reply.<br />
<br />
As per the screen shot, it looks like you're connected an Exchange server email account in Outlook 2007.<br />
<br />
Please provide more details: <br />
<br />
1) Are you working on Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2007?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2) Check if you have any email account configured in Outlook and also specify whether its POP3 or Exchange server email account.<br />

Reply with necessary information to help you further.<br />

Thank you.</span></p>

Your camera is okay lol.<br />
We are talking aboit <b>zooming a picture </b>.<br />
The more we zoom the more the pic gets blurry.<br />
It also depends on Pixels. Like on your PC, whenever you zoom aover the original resolution (like 1600*1200) the pic gets blurry.

            This doesn't work the repair function returns the "something went wrong message" - from all the comments I'm starting to believe that what went wrong was buying a Microsoft product!&nbsp; MS should be ashamed of themselves for releasing software this BUGGY!

            <p>Hmmm. Are you replying to or forwarding an email message that you received in plain text format? I ask because Outlook uses the format of the original message in a reply, even if the
<strong>Compose messages in this format</strong> option is set to <strong>HTML</strong>.

</p><p>Unfortunately, with the new Skype, the audio settings is no longer available. I will take this as a feedback and will surely let our developers know about this. I am hoping that the next Skype update will address this issue.

            Is the paper in question a sheet of labels, an individual label, a strip of labels, or what. Are you creating labels using Word's
<strong>Labels</strong> dialog? The only type of printer I would expect to have paper sizes for individual labels would be a dedicated label printer. You can create a custom size on the
<strong>Paper</strong> tab of <strong>Page Setup</strong>. Some printers handle custom sizes better than others, however.

            <p>sorry for not providing enough information, the paper in question is regular a4 paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as shown on the picture, where it said A4, A5, Legal, Letter is missing, instead only the measurement is shown. So it kinda hard to make sure that I've chosen the correct paper size based on the measurement only.

</p><p>I've also tried updating my gpu drivers but it doesn't fix the problem.</p>

            I am 99.999% certain that the information for that dialog comes from the Printer Driver so you might see if there is an updated driver on the HP website.

            I'm of course not that familiar with A sizes, but the screen shot was confusing because the size that appeared to be selected was 10,01 x 14,81.

            <p>i've tried reinstalling the driver, even delete the old driver located on windows folder but still won't show up. Also tried sfc /scannow, though not really sure if it's helping, but still doesn't fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>wether the printer offline or online didn't make any different unfortunately, as&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Doug Robb</span>&nbsp;said, what's missing is the label/type that said A4, Letter, Legal, etc, thought the size is there, the
 label/type is not. Thus making it rather difficult when chossing the right paper size.</p>

            <p>If you select the Microsoft XPS Document Writer as the Printer in the Back Stage Print view and then display the paper sizes, are the labels then present?&nbsp; If so, that isolates the problem to the Printer Driver refreshing your PC will not help.&nbsp; You also
 need to be really sure what impact "refreshing" your PC will have on the applications that you have installed (that might need to be changed to "had installed") and also on your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is rarely a need to change the paper size in the Back Stage Print view.&nbsp; It should be set in Page Setup dialog under the Layout tab of the ribbon.</p>

            <p>I guess this problem is solved now. I also installed the printer on my notebook, yet everything's fine. Then I noticed the version is different, the one on my notebook is 32bit, but on my desktop is 64bit. I reinstalled the 32bit version and everything's
 fine as shown in the picture:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Maybe there's a bug or something in the 64bit of office? Or is it possible that the printer driver incompatible with 64bit office?</p>

            Your version of Office is unlikely to be 64-bit even if you have 64-bit Windows (Microsoft recommends installing 32-bit Office unless you have a need for one of the specific capabilities offered only by the 64-bit version), but that should have nothing
 to do with the printer driver, which should be selected according to the version of Windows.

<p>Hi Rodney,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
From your description, I'd like to confirm the following information for further investigation:<br />
1. Could you let us know the method you deploy Office 365?<br />
2. Please share with us the screenshot of the error message you get when you try to install Office.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
please try to install Office in a different network environment to see if the issue is related to the Internet connection</p>
<p>If you are using Office Deployment Tool to deploy Office 365, could you provide the .xml file with us?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To upload screenshots, please click <strong>Use rich Formatting</strong> in this thread and select the<strong> Insert Image</strong> icon.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>i'm installing right from the office 365 admin envirinment and from the users option to install. i get the same result from every machine so i'm relatively sure its the hardware firewall (as my topic suggests) . i've followed the removal instructions and
 disabled the windows firewall to no avail</p>
