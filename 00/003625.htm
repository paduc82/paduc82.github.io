<h2>            Table of Contents in a template</h2>
                    <p>Grand Canyon University has a template created that we students are to use as a part of our dissertation. I am having trouble working with the Table of Contents. The TOC is styled and it tracks our page numbers. But when I go in to add my particular sub-titles
 the leader dots are a different size and I think this is why my newly added page numbers are not justified on the right hand side?</p>

    <title>I recently bought a computer and Microsoft Office Home and Student but - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjg55  say:</h3>
<h2>            I recently bought a computer and Microsoft Office Home and Student but the registration process went wrong and the product key email went to the wrong email address</h2>
                    I bought the computer and product key card from the Guildford PCWorld store on 4th February.
<div>I tried to install it on the 4th but was unsuccessful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no idea what went wrong. &nbsp;I first tried to create an account using my AOL address - but was told that already existed. &nbsp;I tried to open this account that I don't ever remember creating and was told it did not exist. &nbsp;I then tried to create one using
 my Gmail account &nbsp;but that wasn't successful. &nbsp;I finally created a Hotmail one -- which was successful and exists and has their welcoming email and everything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However when I tried to click on the email account your website said it had sent the product key to, I noticed that was in fact a different hotmail account one letter shorter. &nbsp;This is not actually my email address and I have no idea how it got there,
 as I only remember typing the hotmail address in once - when I created it - so your email should have gone to that one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not only is it not my account (when trying to open it I came across information that clearly belonged to another person) but it is also defunct - I've tried emailing it and just get an error message back "mailbox not available".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have absolutely no idea what went wrong. &nbsp;I have no idea what "Windows Live" is so don't really understand what might possibly have gone wrong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been on the phone constantly today to Microsoft and PC World. &nbsp;Microsoft says it can't do anything because it didn't sell me the product, PC World says it can't do anything because it doesn't issue the product key. &nbsp;I even went back to the store
 but they found they could not exchange my card for a new one because my card had been "activated". &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I paid £70 for a program, not £70 for one chance to win a program - it's not a coconut shy where you walk away if you don't win your teddy bear! &nbsp;If I'd had ANY idea of the risks involved I would never, never have bought the program.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whether I am to blame, the card is to blame, your system is to blame or there's a stuck key on my keyboard should not matter - there MUST be a way of making good an error when one happens. &nbsp; Your system will have received the same error message from the
 email account &nbsp;that I got so you have proof that no-one has made use of that product key and this is not a scam.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I see it it's a simple matter of you issuing a new product key. &nbsp;No physical item has gone missing so there's nothing of intrinsic value to be replaced. &nbsp;I have paid my money to PC World for a program, they issued me with a card which they said would
 enable you to activate this program, I followed the instructions as best I could but I have no program. &nbsp;Of all the three parties in this only I have fulfilled my part in the bargain by handing over my money, you have failed to activate my program and PC World
 has failed to compensate me or replace the faulty item. &nbsp;I leave it to you and PC World to fight over who is responsible for this, but can you please please please issue me with that product key!!!!</div>

<h2>            Nokia 6300 Predictive Text Dictionary</h2>
                    Anyone know why the phone doesn't save a new word when the predictive Text Dictionary is on? This is not my first Nokia phone and til now it has never given me any problems when I saved a new word. I just bought Nokia 6300 and it just doesn't save them
 even when I have click "Save". Have to rewrite those commonly used words every time I text a msg. It's extremely annoying.<br />
Appreciate your reply.

I have only ever owned Nokias and no other one of these previous phones have had this issue.<br />

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I had this problem too.&nbsp; There are other threads which offer a solution (it worked for me):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to make sure your phone or memory card has a folder called "Dictionary".&nbsp; If not,&nbsp; add one yourself:</p>
<p>Gallery &gt; Options &gt; Add Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [the folder will be in phone memory]</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Gallery &gt; Memory Card &gt; Options &gt; Add Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [the folder will be on your memory card]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then type "Dictionary" and press &lt;OK&gt; to create the folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's up to you whether you want all your custom words to be stored in the phone memory (less space) or on your memory card (larger, but if you switch memory cards you'll have to recreate the dictionary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

<h2>            Erratic Keyboard Dell Insiron Laptop Caused by Media Direct&#47;PCMSservices.exe  Dell&#39;s Quickset fix is ineffective in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Howdy Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this old Dell Inspiron Laptop that I just love.&nbsp; It's been with me for a long time and still performs very well.&nbsp; A special thanks to you Microsoft coders for the Aero desktop which I enjoy very much.&nbsp; I feel much better knowing that I am not alone
 after reading so many comments over at the feedback&nbsp;domain.&nbsp; I can admit it now.&nbsp; I liked XP and will always miss it.&nbsp; Hey, I liked&nbsp;the&nbsp;unbelievably frequent female encounters I had in the 80s too&nbsp;however reality is nothing remains the same, except for&nbsp;human
 nature.&nbsp; We are very&nbsp;predictable creatures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a&nbsp;much needed&nbsp;advancement that I&nbsp;really appreciate being able to evaluate prior to the release date.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am familiar with the problem rendering my device useless right now.&nbsp; I have had to solve this whenever I re-formatted and re-installed.&nbsp;
 Somehow I always forget that it exists.&nbsp; One thing I do remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of laptops over the years that have been affected by this defect&nbsp;is&nbsp;the huge.&nbsp; I am certain there will be others and I have already encountered some here as evaluators</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key board on the Inspiron becomes sluggish and / or erratic.&nbsp; The problem&nbsp;was well known but it continued for many years and affected many models.&nbsp; At first we all turned off features.&nbsp; Instant Office and Media Direct.&nbsp; The file I would disable in msconfig
 is mediadirect/PCMSservices.exe&nbsp; &lt;----kill that and the problem is gone.&nbsp; Dell eventually created a patch&nbsp;that's in the&nbsp;QuickSet files.&nbsp; It's still available at Dell Drivers &amp; Downloads but it appears to be ineffective with Windows 10.&nbsp; Just like ever&nbsp;other
 system change I attempted without administrator privileges, Ha! that's a&nbsp;joke.&nbsp; Well at least most of us get&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see the PCMS file either&nbsp;maybe it's in a different folder.&nbsp; If someone more familiar with&nbsp;Windows software&nbsp;could provide a solution I
 am certain there will be many grateful people.&nbsp; This is a feature that looked great on paper and excited the engineers but&nbsp;most users&nbsp;don't care or don't even know what&nbsp;it is for.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it&nbsp;was&nbsp; erased nobody would even notice.&nbsp; As it is now there is no point
 in continuing with that machine.&nbsp; It is basically useless to anyone.&nbsp; Here are a few pages that I found that could help.&nbsp; One is Dell's patch and the other is just an msconfig&nbsp;stop&nbsp;start&nbsp;that worked&nbsp;&nbsp; until some someone or some program would change the&nbsp;settings.&nbsp;
 I remeber having to reset it often before the patch was released.</p>

 in device manager fixed it; the issue persisted since early builds of 10 and I've never encountered it with 7/8.1/2012 on the same machine.. I've been too lazy to report it though&nbsp;- seems to be gone too :))</p>

<h2>            userform disappears when i set showmodal to false</h2>
                    I have a userform that i need to keep on top of the worksheet it is called from.&nbsp; I also need the worksheet it is called from to continually update (it has several DDE links to stock data) when the userform is open.&nbsp; When I set the userform showmodal property
 to false and call the userform from the worksheet the userform&nbsp; blinks quickly and then disappears.&nbsp; I am not sure how to solve this as I have searched the internet all over and cannot find an answer.

            I guess your own code closes the form, anyway, if you say "the form disappears" means for me the form (the window) is closed.<br />
<br />
Search your project (the whole code) for the word "Unload" and place a breakpoint on each line that you can find. Then try again.<br />
<br />
Did you know that a macro continues immediately after showing a form? <br />
If not, make a new file, add an empty userform and run the code below from a normal module.<br />
<br />
Andreas.<br />
<br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; 'Show the form<br />
&nbsp; UserForm1.Show vbModeless<br />
&nbsp; 'This code is called immediatly<br />
&nbsp; Unload UserForm1<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "Hello 1"<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'Show the form<br />
&nbsp; UserForm1.Show vbModal<br />
&nbsp; 'This code is called after the form is closed<br />

<h2>            PowerPoint 2010&#58; insert audio file, no playback controls appear</h2>
                    <p>When I insert an audio file onto a slide (drag an mp3 to a slide or choose Insert / Audio / Audio on my PC), the audio icon appears on the slide, and I can click to play (in presentation mode -- the Preview / Play button does not seem to play the file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is no bar of playback controls underneath the icon such as I see on screen shots from other users, e.g.:</p>
<p>http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/invisibly-control-when-a-sound-plays-on-a-slide/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the playback controls to appear for my audio file so I can play/pause, and ideally scroll to another point in the audio file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to Slide Show / Set Up Show and confirmed that "Show Media Controls" is checked.&nbsp; (also toggled on/off and no discernible difference).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some special way of inserting an audio file in order for the playback controls to appear?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<h2>            When I click on a windows &#34;metro&#34; app, such as feedback or Store, they app crashes immediately</h2>
                    <p>I'm hoping for a simple solution, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current version: Windows Technical Preview, Evaluation copy. Build 9841</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since yesterday or the day before all of the metro apps that I've tried to open up have crashed on opening. &nbsp;They remain in the taskbar, but the window doesn't open up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the window flashes quickly on the screen, then immediately minimizes, and can't be restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated, as this makes the software impossible to work with, I'm stuck using all legacy apps/programs instead.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Raymien, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if some services or security settings are blocking the apps from opening. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing
 this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may temporarily disable the security software and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: If you have to temporarily disable the antivirus to install other software; you should enable the antivirus as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a
 network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to virus attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several
 programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the game. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows</span></strong><span>:
 (Applies to Windows 10) </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(17, 34, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, you may perform SFC scan and check the status.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may also run the SFC scannow tool if the issue persists. SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the
 tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press
<strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Command prompt (Admin)</em></strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command:
<strong><em>sfc<span>&nbsp; </span>/scannow</em></strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

            <p>The same thing happened to me but only with Microsoft apps like Calendar, Mail and People. The other apps like Facebook, Yahoo Mail and Weatherflow seemed to work just fine. I rebooted my computer and they seemed to be okay although with a slightly different
 looking interface. Not sure what exactly happened; possibly they were being updated?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Links in OneNote may appear in dashed underline when they are links to other places or location in OneNote. This will direct you to invalid, non-existing, and empty target pages. Whereas, links in solid underline will only mean that the given page is valid
 and fully functional.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AFAIK Outlook doesn't support that feature.&nbsp; You might be able to use font size as a work around (or browser zoom)<br />
</strong><br />
</p>
<div><strong>In Internet explorer you can use these shortcuts.&nbsp; Other browsers are similar.</strong><br />
<em>CTRL +(plus)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoom In<br />
CTRL + (minus)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoom Out<br />
CTRL + mouse scroll wheel</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To change font size used in composing Hotmail email (using browser)</strong><br />
<em>1. Login to Hotmail and go to your Inbox.<br />
2. Click on Options then More options.<br />
3. Under Writing email click on Message font and signature.<br />
4. Select the font size, font type and formatting you want at the top of the Message font box (you can see what it will look like on the sentence beneath).<br />
5. Click Save.</em></div>

<h2>            Hyperlinks won&#39;t save</h2>
                    I have an 80.9 MB presentation with many buttons hyperlinked to locations within the presentation. The program will not longer save new hyperlinks. The buttons save but the link does not. Can it be the file is too large? Any ideas? I am using 2003 version.

            <p>It's not the size of the file, but more likely the number/size of hyperlinks.&nbsp; This gives you some background to the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lost hyperlinks, hyperlinks link to wrong place, hyperlinks stop working<br />
<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00401.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00401.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Links to slides within the presentation include the entire slide title.&nbsp; One way to minimize the amount of link space is to&nbsp;Duplicate the title text.&nbsp; Drag the original title off the slide and change it to something short:&nbsp; "Sld12" for slide 12, for example.&nbsp;
 Leave the duplicate in place; it looks the same as the original title but isn't a title.</p>
<p>You may have to re-create links to that slide to get PPT to reset them to the new shorter title, but if too much link text is the problem, this'll fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look here too ... might save you a lot of manual clickyclicky:</p>
<p>Convert slide titles to shapes to solve hyperlink limit problems<br />

The reason is that for the price that i paid i expected a lot more, but i am verry happy with the E60i. Do i miss the E90? Yes i do, but i will get later on, when the price drops and this time in Red. by then hopefuly Nokia might update some of there featuers
 by then ;)

            I couldnt bare not having the E90, so i bought it again. That was a huge mistake selling it in the first place. I felt really lost with out it :( Even though it has some missing little things, i am hoping Nokia will fix these issues as they have done in
 the past, so i am willing to wait :)

<h2>            The battery won&#39;t hold a charge</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>I have Lumia 532 and when I plug it in the charger, the indicator shows that it's charging but when I come after some time, the battery is still the same or less. And when it does charge, it's charging really slow and the battery is waning really fast. Do
 I need a new battery? </p>

            Exactly the same problem. Every time I start the app, crashes and closes. &nbsp;All about one and a half seconds from opening the app. I'm running an iPhone 1X on 11.3. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling twice, still no joy.&nbsp;

<h3> oonaceder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging old with new microsoft Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I tried to transfer/merge my Skype account with the new Microsoft version of skype. I can again access the account, but I have lost my whole history and my actual Skype contacts (syncing with my phone address book did not restore most of my skype contacts
 (many of whom are students I skype with as part of work, so they are not my private contacts, and others are non-work friends in other countries whose phone numbers are not in my US-based cell phones address book). Is there anything that can be done to retrieve
 my history (saved chats) and previous skype contacts? My old account worked well across all my devices (iPad, iPhone, PC) and it would be nice to have continuity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Danida,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. I followed the steps to merge the old and the new skype account and registered the same email I used previously (my gmail address). I can log in with it, but it looks like a new account as the history is gone. It offered synching
 with my phone address book, but as I stated in my question, a lot of my skype contacts are not in my personal phone account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I am not able to access my old account on my iPad and iPhone (meaning when I log in now, the history is gone, etc.).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your assistance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oona</p>

<p>Hi Oona, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the merging of the account was successful, you should be able to login using either your Skype Name or the associated email address. As you stated, "<em>No, I am not able to access my old account on my iPad and iPhone</em>", what exact happens when you
 try logging in using your <strong>Skype Name</strong> instead of your email address?

            You do get used to the change pretty quickly, but unfortunately it takes AGES to access the page now and sometimes I can't even get a connection to see my mail.&nbsp; Hotmail used to load up really quickly...now I have to try 4 or 5 times before the page loads,
 if at all. Sometimes it sends mail in the middle of a message without me touching anything - freaky. People have been getting half messages! Come on Microsoft!<br />

            <p>If you are trying to&nbsp;sum the hours are greater than 8 for each alternative&nbsp;cell in D4:N4:</p>
<p>=(D4-8)*(D4&gt;8)+(F4-8)*(F4&gt;8)+(H8-8)*(H4&gt;8)+(J4-8)*(J4&gt;8)+(L4-8)*(L4&gt;8)+(N4-8)*(N4&gt;8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's look at (D4-8)*(D4&gt;8): this first part (D4-8) find the hours over 8, the second part (D4&gt;8) returns 1 if D4 is greater than 8 or 0 otherwise, this stops us counting negative value. So this gives 1, for F4 we get 0.6, for H4 we get 0 becuae H4 is less
 than 8, for J4 we get 0,6, for L4 we get 0,5 and for N4 we get 0. These total 2.7</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative formula is </p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(ISEVEN(COLUMN(D4:N4))),--(D4:N4&gt;8),D4:N4-8)</p>
<p>We need columns D, F, H, J,L and N - these have even column numbers. We are interested only in value that exceed 8. We want to find each amount that exceeds 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied row 4 from your Excel screenshot and my screen shot shows the result.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It appears that you are having challenges with coming up with the correct formula in Excel. We just need to know where the 28 and 23 came from. If those are just test numbers, you can use the formula below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(W4&gt;=100%,R4*28,Q4*23) If W4 is equal or greater than to 100%, multiply R4 by 28. Else, multiply Q4 by 23.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Apart from this, I found there are more than one autocomplete .dat file under

            Hi Ian.Z,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />For this problem I recommend
<br />1. Update the address book
<br />In the Send and Receive session&gt; Send / Receive group&gt; Download Address Book
<br />In this way you will update the address book.
<br />
<br />2. Create a new Outlook profile and add your email account and check if the problem persists from the new profile

<p>How many accounts and profiles do you have configured in Outlook? You'll have one for each profile and may have one for each account in your profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the file sizes, it looks like either you reset the autocomplete list or Outlook did&nbsp; (because it was corrupted).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good spot, I will check how many profiles and accounts configured in Outlook on that machine later.</p>
<p>It is true that the Outlook reset the autocomplete list and create 1 or 2 new auto complete .dat files everyday. However, it only happens 2-3 weeks a time that cached recipients gone when I typed.
</p>
<p>At this point I won't reset the whole Outlook profile but want to try more possible solution.</p>

    <title>Word 2007 referencing a specific numbered item within the same - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2007 referencing a specific numbered item within the same document</h2>
                    
<p>I have a numbered list of questions and need to refer back to a prior question by its number in a subsequent question.&nbsp; My list will be renumbered when it is added to a larger group of questions.&nbsp; Is there any insert or link function that will make sure
 the question number being referenced will update if the list number values are changed.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Read all the rules before starting this project.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Go to the warehouse and pick up a project box.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Open the project box.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Empty items in project box onto the table.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Assemble the items in order&nbsp;as listed in&nbsp;the instructions.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; If the instructions were not included go back to Qustion 2.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The instructions are not included in any project box and the items can not be assembled.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; If you are reading this you may go to the employee lounge.</p>
<p>Since Question 6 refers back to Question 2, if the number value for Question 1 is changed to 10, then Question 2 will be renumbered as 11.&nbsp; Is there a way for Word to automatically update the reference in Question 6?</p>

<p>Sure, no problem if you use the numbering feature.</p>
<ol>
<li>Number your list </li><li>enter your support text ie "See step: " </li><li>Insert tab / Links group / Cross-Reference to display Cross-Reference dialog box</li><li>Select your "Reference Type:" you want "Numbered Item" and the "Insert Reference To", you want "Paragraph Number"&nbsp; (these should be defaults)<br />
Select the numbered item you want to&nbsp; refer to from the list displayed </li><li>Click on Insert button </li></ol>
<p>A new field will be inserted with the list number. If you adjust the list, just select the cross reference field (or&nbsp;whole document,&nbsp;&lt;CTL A&gt;) &nbsp;and update it by pressing &lt;F9&gt;</p>
