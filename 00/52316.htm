    <title>keyboard fails to respond - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danidorresteyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            keyboard fails to respond</h2>
                    <p>I was gifted a new HP laptop. It has a touch screen and removable keyboard. My issue is the keyboard stopped working after the laptop was inundated with 223 updates. I had told the laptop to shut down and the unwanted updates started. After an hour it was
 still installing updates so I left it and went to bed. This morning I booted up, the upgrades finished doing whatever had to be done, then the password screen came up and I found the keyboard would not respond. I am using my external mouse and the touch screen
 keyboard. I checked all the device drivers and all are reported as working properly. Which is bunk because the keyboard does not work. The touch pad is also not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else should I try? I have tried full reboots, restarting, etc, and nothing works to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how do I find out the make/model of this laptop? I need to know this so I can go online and download an owner's manual as there are other tings I would like to know how to do. But right now my priority is getting the keyboard/touch pad fully functional
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Dani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issue description that you have provided, it looks like your drivers need to be updated. Usually, having the latest driver for your device is the best policy because it has all the latest fixes for your device. To check for driver updates automatically:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Start </strong>
</span></span><span><span>button, type</span></span><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>, and select it from the list of results.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Update Driver Software</strong></span></span><span><span>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand
 the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Display adapters</strong></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>category, right click your graphics card and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Update Driver Software</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>

            <p>I forgot to mention in my original note that I did all that and the report came back that I already had the most current drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the whole thing is mute now anyway.&nbsp; Around noon yesterday, I shut the computer down and decided not to think about it.&nbsp; Got up about an hour ago and now everything is working, keyboard, touch screen, mouse, everything.&nbsp; I guess this will just be one

<h2>            Dell Venue Pro 3845 upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded my Dell Venue Pro 3845 from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Now my tablet touch screen does not work at all. When I connect a mouse, or keyboard, they do work. But my tablet was not meant to only work with a mouse and keyboard. I really want to restore
 touch screen capability. Which drivers do I need to reinstall or install? Also, my tablet screen does not rotate, when I rotate the tablet. I would like to restore that capability as well. Other than these issues the tablet seems to be working well with Windows
 10. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can correct this? I would very much appreciate any assistance you may have to offer. Thank you.

            The best I have found to date is the scrabble on Facebook. Its a licensed version, well presented without too much advertising and, perhaps most importantly, there are plenty of players around. It's the only reason I have FB.

                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am searching for a fingerprint scanner and I prefer to find one sold by Microsoft.&nbsp; No longer are the scanner's sold in the Microsoft company store and the only Microsoft Fingerprint scanner's I have found thus far seem to be outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if Model 1033 is compatible with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro?&nbsp; If not model 1003, does anyone know if there are any other Microsoft models.&nbsp; Currently, none are for sale to Microsoft Employees or Alumni in the Redmond Company store.&nbsp; If none
 available, any other recommendations either facial recognition or fingerprint password protection.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jakub,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such issues could occur due to conflicts in the software from the factory reset. We suggest that you perform a system repair using a Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive. Initiating repair from CD/DVD may have different results. To download a bootable file
 or an installation media, click <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Then, proceed with these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.</li><li>If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from the DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB.</li><li>When you see the Install Windows page, click <strong>Repair </strong>your computer to start the Windows Recovery Environment.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced Options</strong> and click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li><li>In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the <strong>Choose an option screen</strong>, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we'll be glad to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Display Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravimiglani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Display Issue</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro works fine for about an hour at a time, then the screen starts going messy. Some images freeze and then the windows become semi-transparent and I can see the frozen images of one window in the other window, and then it all becomes unreadable.
 If I turn off and then leave for 15 minutes and start again, it is fine for an hour or so, and then the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the simple things like latest updates, refresh, reset etc.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is a software issue or a hardware issue. Since it comes up after about an hour of use, I am wondering if it is a hardware issue caused by heating?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem that the other users reported may be present on your device. It's best to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install Surface and Windows updates</a> to resolve the issue. It may also help if you perform a two-button reset to make sure that the software packages are properly loaded on your device. Here's how it's done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switch off your Surface.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds.</li><li>Release both buttons and wait for about 10 seconds.</li><li>Switch on your Surface normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Come back if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>My Win7 file structure includes a folder called "Searches". The space this folder takes up&nbsp;is hugely enormous, with hundreds of sub-folders and many gigabytes of file space. Can/should these files be deleted? If I can't delete them, my hard disk will soon

<p><span><span>The search is saved in the Searches folder (located in your personal folder under Computer).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may delete the user account specific searches folder. However, deleting the contents of the searches

<h3> ryanbacon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsof Family Features</h2>
                    <p>Recently, Microsoft has somehow blocked me from opening any browser other than their stupid edge browser. A Microsoft family feature popup is telling me that I must ask for permission from an adult in my family before I can use other browsers. As I am over
 18 and technically an adult, I find this infuriating and just another attempt to get me to use an inferior browser. I tried leaving the Microsoft family that I was already in and now whenever I hit the "ask by email" button it results in an error. I have lost
 all respect that I had for Microsoft as it shows me how they will force you into using their product no matter what. Here are the error codes I am getting, any and all help is appreciated:</p>
Ask for permission
<p>You'll need to ask an adult in your family if you can use:</p>

<p>Also tried with livelinux USB drive, also works with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, once windows starts loading, i loose power to all usb ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager, the following errors occur:<br />
</p>
<p>"Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)<br />
<br />
Object Name invalid."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue here is that windows sees "Object Name Invalid" thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:<br />
- Uninstalling driver</p>
<p>- Installing driver</p>
<p>- Installing driver from ASSUS</p>
<p>- Playing around in RegEdit and removing LowerFilter and UpperFilter values</p>
<p>- Installing HP drivers (weird but i tried this solution also)</p>
<p>- Installing Intel USB Hub, threw error that my device doesn't meet minimum requierments</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last resort i see is a fresh install of windows since i strongly believe is a driver software problem and not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Setup:<br />
OS: Windows 10 Education 64Bit</p>
<p>Processor: Inter Core I7-4750HQ</p>

<p>Hello Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do understand that you've almost tried every possible steps to resolve the said issue. In this case, we would recommend to run the Check Disk from the Command Prompt, it performs an analysis of the disk and returns a status message regarding any problems
 it encounters. Refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, search for <strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> and right-click on it.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong><em>Run as administrator</em></strong>. Type in the command below and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>chkdsk /f /r</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please provide us the result of the scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we recommend to perform a System Restore for a temporary fix while we further look into this issue. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when
 you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>restore point manually</strong></a>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Start</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button, type<span>
</span><strong><em>Control Panel</em><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em><strong>Recovery</strong></em>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<em><strong>Recovery</strong></em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong><em>Open System Restore</em></strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em><strong>Next</strong></em>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<em><strong>Next</strong></em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em><strong>Finish</strong></em>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>:&nbsp;<em>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, and then select Recovery &gt; Configure System Restore &gt; Configure and
 make sure Turn on system protection is selected. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Can I link two microsoft accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I have two separate Microsoft accounts. One was set up ages ago and one I set up for my Xbox. I would like to link them together since one is used on my desktop and one on my Xbox. All the post I've seen about linking them are from 2012 and have no help
 what so ever.

<p>That's weird that you are getting that issue by trying to redeem a 1 month card. That error has to do with something completely different......It's late at night, I might be missing something here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Anyone Else Having Issues Since The Last Update for Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod352  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone Else Having Issues Since The Last Update for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just curious if anyone else is having major issues since the last Windows 10 update. Windows 10 has given me headaches since the day I upgraded to it from Windows 7(and I curse the day I did it), but since the last update, the problems are piling up, and
 they're not small ones. About a week and a half ago, my laptop updated itself and restarted without asking me first to do so(which it normally does). For it to just do it on its own was a nuisance and inconvenient, but there didn't seem to be any issues so
 I didn't give it a lot of thought. Now I'm thinking about it a lot! Just some examples;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm losing use of the internet every couple of days. I'm not losing connection to the internet, just use of it, and I have to restart to be able to use it again. And once I click to restart, it takes about 15-20 minutes before my laptop is usable again.
 10-15 minutes of blue screen with a circle spinning above "Restarting", and the 5 minutes of black screen with a circle spinning before the password screen is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My laptop is turning itself on from sleep mode when it's closed. Used to be when I closed my laptop, everything would shut down and that would be that. Now, after being closed for approx 5 minutes, I can hear the fan start and the lights on the side are
 blinking showing activity. When I open it up, everything indicates that it's on, but there's nothing on the screen. The keyboard and power button are illuminated, but there isn't even a faint glow from the screen, and I have to do a hard restart to get anything
 to happen. Once again, another 15 minutes before it's usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There's issues with the speakers. When I use a media player, or iTunes, the sound quality is just as it always has been. But when I play something from a browser, it sounds like one of the speakers is missing. And if I keep listening to something like
 that, the speaker(s) start screaming and now matter what I do, I can't get it to stop until I'm forced to do a hard restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just a few of the more glaring examples of the issues I'm having since the update. There's more. Is anyone else having similar problems? Have you found solutions to any of them? Please let me know if you have. It would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes the last update caused it to not recognize my HP4L printer any more and said it didn't support it any more--and did other things I can't remember but one was I was suddenly being bombarded with junk email (I use Microsoft Edge) that quit after I did&nbsp;the
 following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first&nbsp;removed the latest Windows 10 KB update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>REMOVE A PROGRAM:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>right-click Windows icon bottom left</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>pick Control Panel</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>pick Uninstall a Program</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>or after Control Panel pick Programs and Features, View installed updates (on left)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I created a new RESTORE POINT and hopefully allocated more room to save restore points:</p>
<p><span><strong>CREATE A RESTORE POINT:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>right-click the windows icon (bottom left)</span></p>
<p><span>pick Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span>type in the search box (top right corner): restore point</span></p>
<p><span>under System, click Create a Restore Point</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not sure which one of these is affecting me not having enough space to store more restore points but I did read your paging space can be too small.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CREATE MORE ROOM TO STORE RESTORE POINTS:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>right-click on the windows icon (bottom left)</span></p>
<p><span>pick Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span>pick Recovery (in first column)</span></p>
<p><span>click Configure System Restore</span></p>
<p><span>click the tab: System Protection</span></p>
<p><span>click Configure</span></p>
<p><span>My current usage was 9.49GB (maximum usage 18%), so I moved the blue arrow</span></p>
<p><span>up to 32% (291.81GB).</span></p>
<p><span>Click Apply</span></p>
<p><span>click Ok</span></p>
<p><span>Then under the Advanced Tab </span></p>
<p><span>under Performance I clicked Settings and then the new Advanced tab.</span></p>
<p><span>Then under Virtual Memory where I had let Microsoft (or whoever) decide what is right, I instead clicked in the circle: Custom Size</span></p>
<p><span>then I typed in 4000 in each box</span></p>
<p><span>clicked set</span></p>
<p><span>clicked OK</span></p>
<p><span>Then it prompts you to restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So hopefully it will save more restore points.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I made another RESTORE point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I turned off automatic updates - they gave me no choice.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>TURN OFF WINDOWS 10 UPDATES:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Turn off Windows Updates in Windows 10</strong>. You can do this using the
<strong>Windows Update</strong> service. Via Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools, you can access Services. In the Services
<strong>window</strong>, scroll down to <strong>Windows Update</strong> and <strong>
turn off</strong> the process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I recreated another RESTORE point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere inbetween doing all this I changed the time for automatic updates from 3-4am (which I always have my computer turned off.&nbsp; I think I did this before I turned off automatic updates.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Start button</strong> (the windows icon bottom left)</p>
<p>then select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>
Windows Update</strong>, and then select <strong>Change active hours</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose the start time and end time for active hours, and then select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the way I removed HP ePrint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I STILL get notices in the bottom right-hand corner box every day that my computer needs to Restart and will do it not during my normal usage.&nbsp; Someday it may just do it on it's own and I'll have to do the same thing all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get it to stop wanting to RESTART would be appreciated.</p>

<p>That scanner is on HP's list of devices not supported on Windows 10 (<a href="https://support.hp.com/ie-en/document/c04635838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click HERE</a>) - they do not supply a driver for Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is to follow Zedrick's instructions and see if you can install a legacy driver in compatibility mode, however users have reported the latest driver supplied by HP was for Windows Vista and compatibility mode worked on Windows 7, but not
 on Windows 8, so I doubt you will get your scanner running on Windows 10 . . .</p>

<p>Unpack setup_basic_3770.exe via WinRar (or other).</p>
<p>Install driver direct via Devices Manager.</p>
