    <title>Meeting Requests Disappears in Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Meeting Requests Disappears in Calendar</h2>
                    
<p>Hi:</p>
<p>I have a problem having my meeting requests disappeared from my Calendar.</p>
<p>Actually the problem is from the secretary of our department. She manages the meeting request in MS Outlook 2003 for her boss - the manager, and several other colleagues. I can see she is having 4 calendars in her MS Outlook. She has set recurring meetings
 and she also create other individual meetings very often throughout days and weeks. She organizes everything on the calendar, her boss never manage it, he just takes a look of what meeting he is going to have.</p>
<p>Her boss has been experiencing the disappearance of these meetings very often. Even she has assigned the meeting request on her and the manager's calendar in Outlook, the meeting requests might stay for a while, let's say a day, then disappear without a
 reason. Some other users(their calendars shared to the secretary) also experience the same problem.</p>
<p>Is there any fix for it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lomen</p>

            Is a smartphone syncing with the calendars? Especially an iphone or windows mobile device?

            Yes, the manager got both Blackberry and iPhone 3GS syncing with the calendars. I also guess these 2 devices might have some effects on this issue, aren't they?

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, everyone.&nbsp;The Outlook&nbsp;team has fixed the&nbsp;issue where file attachments didn't show up in plain text messages.&nbsp;This fix is&nbsp;in the latest Office 2016 update (version 16.0.6366.2056), which started rolling out to customers earlier this week. If you don't
 have the update yet, open any Office application and choose <strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong>Account</strong>. (If you're using Outlook, choose
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>). Then, under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose
<strong>Update Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Update Now</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, let us know. Thank you for your patience!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying to setup an account with Track and Protect app and I never received the SMS confirmation. &nbsp;I've sent several emails to support and never got a reply. &nbsp;I went to the website and they don't have the N9 listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if they support N9 and is there a solution on how to create an account for N9?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That service no longer works either. Another in a long line of services, software and plugins that are failing on the N9 and that Nokia refuses to fix even though we are still in the 2 year EU warranty period. Lets go thru the list off the top of my head:</p>
<p>1. Integrated Dropbox no longer works - official Nokia stance is they will not fix it. They will tell you to find an alternative in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Evernote plugin - official Nokia stance is they will not fix it. You can still download it but it's of no use.</p>
<p>3. Track and Protect - doesn't work and forget about Nokia addressing it.</p>
<p>4. Google MfE - can't sync contacts anymore. Nokia will breathe a sigh of relief as they have nothing to do with this as this is a Google decision.</p>
<p>5. Battery bug where the battery will just drop down to 4% - Nokia has know about this one since the beginning but nada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know, I could go on and on but you get the drift I'm sure. Don't expect any help, support or even an acknowledgment when you send a support email in. I sent one just for the heck of it a month ago and never got a response to it all. Unless you have a
 junk Lumia they could care less about your issue.</p>

<p>Trackandprotect still works for me. Actually, I just purchased a new N9 as spare and one of the first things I did was activate this trackandprotect. No problem activating and using it. My son also has trackandprotect on his droid and it actually helped
 to retrieve his phone after theft. It's a solid solution and available as OEM in many ountries and phones, recently including for Huawei P series. I heard a story that Nokia stopped paying for the sms needed to operate the service due to Nokia abandoning Meego
 OS in certain countries. For some countries the company that developed trackandprotect had a special agreement for the sms delivery. I think the issue here is because of Nokia killing Meego support agreements and it is not to blame the company that made it
 for nokia (klomptek.com) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Corrupted memory card on E61i</h2>
                    here's my problem... I'm using the default Nokia 256MB microSD card<br />
Last night, I charged my phone - I plugged it in, and turned it off - then this morning I noticed all my apps were gone, it turns out my card is corrupted.<br />
I safely removed my card and put it back in, and everything was fine.. I decided to back up my gallery just in case, and it backed up fine.. But when I reboot it again, it is again corrupted.<br />
So I finally decided to format it on the phone, but after rebooting again, it is still corrupted!

            You need a fresh start badly. First, format the MMC on PC.<br />
Second, back up your contacts, messages etc by PC Suit to your PC.<br />
Then hard reset the phone by*#7370#. Then install the apps, put the meida files etc again and observe if the MMC behave according to its order. If itmakes it again the apps disappear, I think you should get the MMC replaced.

            yeah that's what I did.. did a hard reset and formatted the card through the phone. it's working fine now. I hope it doesn't happen again.. what could have caused this?<br />
btw, how do I format the memory card through the PC without a card reader?

<h2>            Outlook Microsoft Office 2013 cannot verify the license .. but ...</h2>
                    <p>Hello Board .. any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>This is a very common problem and one which is still on the 'known issues' board for Outlook 2010.&nbsp; Go figure why it doesn't get a priority when communication is pretty important.</p>
<p>After loading Windows 8, I installed the Office 2013 Professional package (over the 2010) and all the programs work fine (Word, Excel .. ) except
<strong>Outlook 2013</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When entering here I&nbsp;get the following error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft Office cannot verify the license for this product. You should repair the Office program by using Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose OK and the program shuts down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK .. so this is what I have done.&nbsp; Not in this order but just some of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Office and reinstalled [no change]</li><li>Repair Office through Control Panel [no change]</li><li>Looked to find if there was an Office Software Protection Plan or folder (none that I could see)</li><li>Restarted any number of times</li></ul>
<p>Then I tried to activate on line (known issue) using "cscript ospp.vbs /act" within the Office folder.&nbsp; Aaahh .. took a screen capture from the split-second time it was up there ..shows that
</p>
<ul>
<li>OfficeProPlusR_Retail Edition .. ends with C343D .. &lt;product activation successful&gt;</li><li>OfficeProPlusR_Retail Grace.. ends with 27GXM .. &lt;... the license is not installed&gt;</li></ul>
<p>I have no thoughts on where to go to remove&nbsp;that Grace&nbsp;license code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Programs and Features .. only shows Office 2013 (and I never did trial a version of this product or the Beta)</li><li>Mr. Fixit doesn't recognize Windows 8.</li></ul>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for asking. The Office 2013 preview installation might be corrupt hence you are unable work with the program.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When you download Office 2013 preview it will be mentioned whether Office is an MSI edition or Click-To-Run edition.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Office 365 Home Premium preview is a Click-To-Run edition. You may follow the steps mentioned below to uninstall Office 2013 preview completely from the system and re-install it.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
Deactivate Office 365 Home Premium preview installation and then try to uninstall Office and check. Refer the link mentioned below and check the section

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
Once you have deactivated Office 365 Home Premium preview, browse to the location mentioned below and rename Office 15 folder to Office15.old.</p>

<p>
<p>
Win7 64bit: </p>
<p>
<p>
</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went ahead and deleted anything that looked like Office15.&nbsp; Gone.</p>
<p>I have never used Office 365.&nbsp; I only use the Professional version of the software going back as far as I can remember.&nbsp; I have never used a preview.</p>
<p>I re-installed the&nbsp;Office&nbsp;2013 using my valid license.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can use Word, PowerPoint, Lync .. you name it.&nbsp; These all work and they are fine accepting the license code.&nbsp; No problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>I cannot use Outlook at all (get the same error message) and when I take the screen shot I still get the 'Grace' line.</p>
<p>I have no idea where to turn to next and Outlook is pretty important to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help? Please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Save the fix it to desktop and then try to run.. there seems to be some registry corruption since all applications work fine except outlook.<br />
<br />
Hold the Windows key and r, type services.msc click ok<br />
<br />
look for office software protection service and enable it<br />

<h2>            &#34;Expand All&#34; Paragraphs for Printout by Default</h2>
                    <p>The "expand" and "collapse" feature in Office Word 2013 print layout is very helpful and makes document navigation, readability, and editing much simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I print I want to be sure all paragraphs are expanded before printing. Otherwise, a collapsed sub-paragraph buried deep within a document will not print. I tested this today by printing out a collapsed paragraph--the collapsed sub-paragraphs
 were not printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked but haven't found a setting in "Options" that automatically expands all paragraphs before printing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting that expands all paragraphs before printing and I missed it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I submit a request to add this setting to "Options"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Expandable/collapsible headings are a new feature in Word 2013. Perhaps more options will be added later on. Note that you can make suggestions for future versions in the form at

This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM.

<h2>            Calculate a discounted value</h2>
                    
<p>OK - I KNOW I shouild have been more attentive in Grade 9 Algebra ...........&nbsp; but I wasn't!</p>
<p>I need a formula that will calculate a discounted value when the grossed amount and discount rate are known.</p>
<p>The scenario is this:</p>
<p>I need to calculate a value that will display the value of a charged amount AFTER a commission has been deducted.</p>
<p>In (say) cell A1 I have the greossed up value (e.g. 23.94)</p>

<p>Hi USAOz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cell C1 type the formula : =A1/(1+B1)</p>
<p>The formula will return the value to 23.52826</p>
<p>Now if you add 1.75% commission to this amount i.e 0.411744&nbsp;you will get the value in cell A1 : 23.94</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

            I think that the formula I gave is correct.&nbsp; It conforms to what he said he wanted (apply discount to gross price to get net price).&nbsp; It also gives the result that he worked out using his calculator.

<p>I agree that it is a matter of interpreation.</p>
<p>IMHO, the OP presented contradictory information.&nbsp; He/she wrote:&nbsp; "I want to see in cell C1 what the value would be BEFORE the commission was applied to the value in A1 (where a1 includes the value of the product PLUS the amount of commission on that value)."</p>
<p>On the one hand, the OP says that the commission "was applied to the value in A1" (gross sales price).&nbsp; In that case, I agree that your formula is correct.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the OP says that A1 "includes the value of the product PLUS the amount of commission on that value".&nbsp; What value?&nbsp; Based on rules of good English grammar (proper antecedent), one interpretation is:&nbsp; "the value of the product" (in C1).&nbsp;
 In that case, the formula provided by georgejabr and my explanation are correct.</p>
<p>And here, I might be influenced by the word "commission".&nbsp; Normally, I believe commission is based on the net sales price, not the gross sales price.&nbsp; There is good reason for that:&nbsp; net sales price is usually set to ensure a certain profit based on production
 or wholesale cost.&nbsp; Additional cost of sales such as tax and commission is usually charged to the customer directly.&nbsp; Otherwise, if we set the gross sales price, then deduct a commission, which might be a variable rate, we lose control over the profit margin.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it is really up to the OP to decide what he/she wants.</p>
<p>If the net sales price is $23.52 and the commission on that amount is 1.75%, the gross sales price should be 23.52*(1+1.75%) = $23.93, not $23.94.&nbsp; Ergo, if the gross sales price is $23.93, the net sales price would be 23.93/(1+1.75%) = $23.52.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the gross sales price should indeed be $23.94, the net sales price should be $23.53 so that 23.53*(1+1.75%) = $23.94.</p>
<p>But if the gross sales price is $23.94 and 1.75% of that amount is to be allocated to commissions (i.e. 23.94*1.75%), the net sales price would be 23.94*(1-1.75%) = $23.52.</p>

            Aside.... I wrote:
<blockquote>If instead we set the gross sales price, then deduct a commission, which might be a variable rate, we lose control over the profit margin.</blockquote>
<p>But if we want to ensure a net sales price of $23.52 and 1.75% of the gross sales price will be allocated to commissions, we could ask:&nbsp; what must the gross sales price be?</p>
<p>The answer would be:&nbsp; 23.52/(1-1.75%) = $23.94.&nbsp; The Excel formula would be:&nbsp; =ROUND(C1/(1-B1),2).</p>
<p>But that is clearly not what the OP is asking.&nbsp; Famous last words ;-).</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>USAOz Wrote</p>
<p>I want to see in cell <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">C1</span></strong> what the<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">value</span></strong> would be<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BEFORE the commission was applied
 to the value in A1</span></strong> (where<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a1</span></strong> includes the value of the product<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLUS</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the
 amount of commission</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on that value</span></strong>).</p>
<p>This mean that the commission rate is added to the amount in C1 and not deducted from A1. Hence&nbsp;the formula will be&nbsp;C1=A1/(1+B1) as I mentioned in my previous answer.</p>
<p>If USOz is willing to deduct the rate from cell A1 the the formula in C1 will be A1-(A1*B1)</p>
<p>The value&nbsp;in C1 won't be the same. USOz has to decide what to choose&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;calculation way he is&nbsp;following.</p>

<h2>            Lumnia 640 XL</h2>
                    <p>Hi here is my story so far for my Lumnia 640XL</p>
<p>10th April - phone will not charge and so eventually batteriry dies and I'm not able to switch it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>13th April -&nbsp;log into my account and&nbsp;is sent for repair to Hungary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>20th April&nbsp;- phone returned and switching on with a new battery, phone starts to randomly restart usually when you try to use it but even when just sitting doing nothing. I though just needs latest updates so after restoring my settings and get fully updating
 this makes no difference phone still randomly switches off / on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6th May - send it back for repair comes back one week latter with message no fault found again it's back to factory settings but phone still shows same problems plus now some programmes don't open and phone messages cant be heard both ways until I reset,
 so go back through the update in the hope it might work but no it doesn't. </p>
<p>
</p><p>few days latter - I then go back online to live chat who recommends I send it back, ok one last chance I try to send it back and&nbsp;cant as it says there is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;pending repair. after a long search and pushed in wrong direction numbers eventually speak to
 someone who cant understand why this is happening as he says it shouldn't be saying I'm wrong, but send a screen shot to them of the web page saying pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 week latter I receive email to say there is a page problem and they will sort it but will take around 7 days takes over 10 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>13th June resend phone comes back 1 week latter saying no fault but it's still randomly on off&nbsp;and app opening problems so yet again upgrade and no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So &nbsp;10 weeks without a working phone I just want to know who I can send this to or speak that can explain why this should happen as even if I wanted to I cant resend it back as again it says repair pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now going online to get a Samsung phone as having been a loyal Microsoft customer since 95 this is not a loyalty they wish to give back.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>1a) Do those issues happen after adding your Microsoft account? Or</p>

<p>2. Did you try via your retailer (point of purchase) or went your retailer out of business?</p>

<p>Just to avoid any misunderstanding, but Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/2115357c-0108-4469-abc7-0428b9e37bf8?threadId=55ddbe68-21fc-4f55-8110-feede6fa69f4">channel</a>. Why ever. Therefore here, such feedback drowns in the Internet
 swarm. You are not the first with that experience, especially with that pending repair status. I wonder why that status happens – (A) if that is the fault of the webpage, (B) whether there is a timeout, or (C) if that is the fault of the technician.

PhilSkot</a> created a new Microsoft account to cicumvent that. Does that help in your case as help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue is fascinating as well, because I do not understand why the technician does not see your mentioned faults. Do you have any clue why that could be?</p>

<h2>            MathType 6.7 &#38; Office 2010, Win7 Ultimate x64</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot determine what the heck I'm doing wrong with MathType 6.7 with Office 2010 on my Win7 Ultimate x64 system. After installing I see the add-in on my toolbar, I select the MathType tab, click on insert equaton and start to type my equation and it does
 NOT appear correctly in the MathType window. Example:</p>
<p>(x + y)2 is what I type I expected to see the 2 as a subscript (the style is Math) but I see exactly what I typed.</p>
<p>x/y is what I type, I expect to see X on top of a horizontal line with y on the bottom but I see exactly what I typed.</p>
<p>I've watched various tutorials and I cannot reproduce what I see in the tutorial. What I type is not being converted to math equations.</p>
<p>I tried the Math Input Panel and using the graphics pad in my Lenovo W700 most of what I write is converted into junk but yet in the videos I've seen it is suppose to convert it to a math equation.</p>

 and it does NOT appear correctly in the MathType window. Example:
<p>(x + y)2 is what I type I expected to see the 2 as a subscript (the style is Math) but I see exactly what I typed.</p>
<p>x/y is what I type, I expect to see X on top of a horizontal line with y on the bottom but I see exactly what I typed.</p>
<p>I've watched various tutorials and I cannot reproduce what I see in the tutorial. What I type is not being converted to math equations.</p>

<p>JGT, you didn't say whether your Office 2010 was 32-bit or 64-bit. Many people assume that if they're running 64-bit Windows, they need 64-bit Office. Others figure if 32-bit is good, 64-bit must be better. Both assumptions are wrong, and in fact even Microsoft
 doesn't recommend running 64-bit Office unless you <em>really really</em> need it (and 999 people out of 998 don't really need it). See our article titled<a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/office2010_64bit.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"So
 what's the story with MathType and 64-bit Office 2010?"</a></p>
<p>BTW, I really am pretty good with numbers, and am aware that "999 out of 998" means no one needs it. That's not literally true. The article explains.</p>
<p>BTW #2 -- Doug, I'm still here, but normally only check the Forums once a day. Quite often by the time I get here, some sharp, on-the-ball MVP has already answered the question. That's all right; I'm comfortable with that role.</p>

<p>Glad you found the tutorials. Really, the first 3 tutorials (in the Basic Tutorials) section should be enough to get you going. The video you watched (not ours) probably showed people using keyboard shortcuts instead of pointing &amp; clicking to create the
 math. There's no central list of shortcuts for MathType, but if you point to something with the mouse pointer, the lower left of the MathType window will tell you what it is you're pointing to, and what its keyboard shortcut is. Shortcuts are also customizable
 -- via the Preferences &gt; Customize Keyboard dialog.</p>
<p>MathType should work with the graphics pad on your laptop, though I'm not familiar with that exact configuration. It works in conjunction with the Windows 7 Math Input Panel. There are some instructions in MathType Help &gt; Using MathType &gt; Working with the
 Windows 7 Math Input Panel.</p>

 to protect my pc from it about 200.00 a year. I won't pay it just to do banking, shopping and play spades at msn.com. If its that expensive the pc is not worth it. Can you help?

    <title>Why does it take a long time to switch between any two Word documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorgeolenewa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does it take a long time to switch between any two Word documents in OS X&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
Switching between two open Word files (my art files are separate from the text) remains. It takes a long time when I switch to the active Word document window, before I can continue to edit the file. The beach ball takes a few seconds to show-up, Word does
 not respond, then it can take 30 seconds or longer before I can continue editing the file.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
With 8 GB of RAM, many, over 100 GB of free space on the disk, few or no other applications running and unused RAM, it is indeed puzzling that this happens. This does not happen in Windows, so I am wondering if there are any application configuration parameters
 that can help improve this situation. Nothing on Microsoft's Technet site regarding this problem.&nbsp;In addition, I also noticed that the more times I switch between the two documents, the longer the switching appears to take.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I often have to work with two or three documents open. These files are not very large (the largest is about 65 pages maximum) and do not contain graphics. There does not appear to be any file corruption. Only two or three fonts are used in each file. Track
 changes is on, but by the time I get to work with the two documents simultaneously, there are very few entries, and only a handful of notes.&nbsp;This is a very time-consuming and annoying problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated,</div>
                </div>

            Hi Jorge:
<div><br />
<div>If this is happening soon after re-starting the computer, then it's definitely tracked changes and not fragmented memory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you use Compare Documents, your editor will get what looks like Track Changes. &nbsp;In fact, "Compare" is simply an automated way of accurately applying change tracking, the result IS tracked changes,&nbsp;simply&nbsp;automatically applied.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mac Word and Windows Word are not related: different factory, different designers, different programmers, different architecture, different code. &nbsp;In a complex GUI application such as Word, the Operating System is doing 80% of the work. &nbsp;80 per cent of
 the CPU time is spent in Mac OS X code, not in Word code.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Obviously there's a bit of cross-pollination&nbsp;between Word PC and Word Mac, and consequently you get lumps of code that were designed to call Windows functions now calling Mac functions. &nbsp;The two sets of functions are not exactly equivalent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And of course, Office for Windows has literally 100 times more people working on it than Mac Office has. &nbsp;Yes, Windows Office is bigger, but not THAT much bigger. &nbsp;It is, however, more expensive :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            I can&#39;t either open, unistall, even install the program. Kernelbase.dll problem on Office 2013, Help&#33;</h2>
                    I have no idea what happened to my computer lately. I once tried to open Word 2013 (It happens on other office 2013 programs too), but as soon as initializing started, the program crashes. Soon after it asked me to open in safe mode. I tried, But it crashes
 immediately too.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then i tried to re installing the program, and i got an error message "Microsoft Setup Bootstrapper has stopped working"</div>

</span>ce2f384331d5d25295966e7bb7addc8d</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then i tried using "Microsoft Fix It Install Uninstall" and still having the same problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, i can't open all office programs because of "The action is only valid for products that are currently installed" Error message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As far as i remember what happened to this computer before, 4 days ago, This computer was infected by Z.Bot Virus and they're mostly infect dll files. That virus is dead now, i believe. But i dunno if the antivirus itself remove the dll.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second to that, i remember replacing d3d11.dll on system file due to "Hitman: Absolution" Game fixing. I hope this one has no effect on the program itself.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both those two things above is most likely the cause of it. Since before those two, office 2013 works perfectly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to update the drivers, repairing .NET Framework 4.5.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh anyway, i can't seem to do "sfc /scannow" on command prompt. I get this "Access is Denied" message. But this account is clearly an administrator.</div>
<div>My friend tell me that Kernelbase.dll program is mostly due to user account. So i make a new account, and open the uninstaller using the other account, and still no luck, and getting the same message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't update the directx 11 since i don't know how.</div>

            Thanks alot for the tip.
<div><br />
<div>I actually found out the way myself.</div>
<div>Most of my dll files are corrupted (Thanks to the virus)</div>
<div>So i download and instal Windows 7 SP1 Upgrade</div>
<div><br />
<div>It also repairs my dll. I think ^^</div>

    <title>Still cannot shutdown properly&#8230; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel del norte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Still cannot shutdown properly&#8230;</h2>
                    <p>Ah well, I tried. Ever since 9841, the Tech Preview has failed to properly shut down the Sony VGN-AR51J. Still present in 9926; happens even from the installation DVDs; booting up and going into advanced
 troubleshooting -&gt; Turn Off Your PC, the power-off fails. We're left with a flashing loop from the hard disk, and the power still on (requiring a forced power-off); that means sleep is not usable, which I use a fair bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Anyone else had this sort of prob, and found a fix? I know it's not drivers or hybrid shutdown or any obvious things.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't look as though it will be fixed at all (only occurs on a minority of machines), so I won't be able to install W10 on this old but still reasonable lad -- it runs W8.1 perfectly well. Newer
 hardware (even really cheap) is just not an option for the foreseeable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've left a small bundle of feedback, on half a dozen or so other issues too (and two pats on the back). But enough outa me.

            <p>Howdy. Thanks for all the suggestions, but I went through
<em>all</em> this and more back in October (over several days), before I realised that something deeper was wrong.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem manifests right away with a totally clean installation -- no amount of safe or clean booting makes a difference. But more than this: boot from the ISO DVD --
<em>before installation </em>even -- and run the "Repair Your System" option, through to "Turn off your computer", and that should power the thing down cleanly, yes?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But no. Even that fails. Same behaviour with 9841 and 9879. Annoyingly, a truly ancient machine that's even older (late 2005) works, if only&nbsp;just, and powers down perfectly. It seems likely that it's
 an issue specific to this laptop&nbsp;model,&nbsp;and maybe some others. As I say, it's unlikely to be resolved, but I live in hope. All sorts of hope. Cheers anyway squire,
</p>
<p>

            <p>I've had the lack of your same .. no way to off the dang things, no sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than holding the power button in a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Now this current build 9926 I'm getting 'unknown hard error' on safe mode.. which equals, no safe mode too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus getting tired of installing clean, into unallocated, into formatted, into new partitions, and doing refreshes and resets and repair installs...
 etc etc trying to fix just a couple of things -quite important things though :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not worth the trouble anymore I think..&nbsp; I'll go back to 8.1 until the next build temps me maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had my three month or so of playing with 10... &nbsp;I'm experienced and fast doing fresh installs :)&nbsp; Even bought an overpriced SSD to make those installs
 faster.. the newest build is like 5 minute to desktop.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Morning all. I'm here purely because Microsoft sent a follow-up email asking if the issue has been resolved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a word, No. I doubt that it will be; I suspect it only affects a very small number of machines, and probably old ones at that. Just to reiterate, it's not an issue with sleep or hibernation
<em>per se </em>(so Mr Kurmiskurmis has an entirely different problem). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way to test it is simply to boot from the installation medium (DVD or USB), go through Troubleshooting and straight away try to shut the machine down from that. If that fails, it's the same thing.
 So it's manifesting even at the most basic level of system interaction, <em>before</em> any installation occurs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the W10 is dual-booting from another partition, I'll keep updating and see if there's any change in the next few builds, but I think it's unlikely that there will be. Personal sidebar: it all becomes
 moot if I can get paying work this year, since I can then get newer hardware (however basic). Otherwise, I won't survive next winter anyway (a whole 'nother story), so also moot.<span>&nbsp;In case anyone wonders why I don't "just upgrade".&nbsp;Bye for now,
</span></p>

<p>I know that in Excel, there is a VBA method, expression.IfError(Arg1, Arg2), that will tell the program to return a specified value if the result of the first argument is an error.&nbsp; Does Access have a similar function or method?&nbsp; And if so, what is the syntax?</p>
<p>Much appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a string of code in the Control Source Property of textbox: txtHXRShellWall:</p>
<p>=DLookUp("[Shell Wall]","[tblSSPipeSizes]","[Pipe OD]=" &amp; [cmbHXRShellOD] &amp; " And [tblSSPipeSizes]![SS Schedule]='10S'")</p>
<p>Everything works fine if the user selects a choice from the dropdown list of combobox: cmbHXRShellOD.&nbsp; But I also want to allow the user to input a custom number in this combobox.&nbsp; If I do that, the Dlookup function returns a #Error in txtHXRShellWall because
 it cannot find the value in the Pipe OD field of table: tblSSPipeSizes.&nbsp; I would like the code to return a zero value ("") if the Dlookup returns an error.</p>
<p>IsError() just returns a boolean value if there is an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Just change your control source to this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=<strong>Nz(</strong>DLookUp("[Shell Wall]","[tblSSPipeSizes]","[Pipe OD]=" &amp; [cmbHXRShellOD] &amp; " And [tblSSPipeSizes]![SS Schedule]='10S'")<strong>,"")</strong></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 takes 20-30 mins to open</h2>
                    <p>These are the steps I have done so far:</p>
<p>Started in safe mode disabled all addons</p>
<p>Uninstalled - reinstalled </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other programs all open no problem, and Outlook 2013 opens fine in safe mode.</p>
<p>But if I try to open normally it takes 20-30&nbsp; mins but works fine after that. </p>

    <title>Adding a colored rectangle to the header of a document based on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding a colored rectangle to the header of a document based on whether a Heading 1 style is applied</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a requirement for a Word document where I would like top of the page to have a colored rectangle if the top of the document is styled with a Heading 1 style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out to have a page break whenever I apply a Heading 1. However, what I would like to have is the text that I applied with Heading 1 to appear in the header of the document and also have a colored rectangle show up there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to do this? Essentially I'm looking for conditional headers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

<p>I do not think that there is anyway to set that up so that it would automatically happen for each instance of a paragraph to which the Heading 1 style is applied. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you could start a new Section of the document each time you insert a Heading 1 style paragraph and you could have a first page header in each Section that contained a StyleRef "Heading 1"field, which will display the text of the paragraph to which
 the Heading 1 style is applied, and the colored rectangle. &nbsp;The Headers in each Section of the document, will, by default, be linked to those in the previous section, so that it would only necessary to set that up for the first Section.</p>

<p>Use the WDRT tool and revert back to Windows phone 8.1.</p>
<p>The Lumia 525 is not supported for any windows 10 mobile build, insider or public release.</p>
<p>The 525 has been excluded since the first official release already.</p>
