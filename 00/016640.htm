    <title>Outlook 2016 Inbox not Updating, yet activesync devices do update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Inbox not Updating, yet activesync devices do update</h2>
                    <p>We have Exchange 2010 running on premise on WinServ 2008R2 and Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I have noticed that my Outlook inbox will not update in a timely manner(30 minutes or more). Yet my Ipad running ActiveSync receives emails immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested a Surface connected via 4G and was able to see emails coming into OWA just fine. The Ipad and Surface seemed to stay in sync with inbound emails. While the desktop running Outlook 2016 received nothing in the inbox.&nbsp; I tried running Outlook in safe
 mode and no change. It does seem to bring in recent emails whenever I first launch Outlook. But then nothing else comes in after the first round.&nbsp; I also just changed the send/receive interval from 30 minutes to 10 minutes to see if it changed anything. So
 far, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone&nbsp; help with this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick</p>

<h2>            Access 2016&#58; &#34;Price Comparison&#34; Template - How do I remove &#34;script error&#34; pop-up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today is the first time I've attempted to use Microsoft Access. I'm exploring the "Price Comparison" template but I'm stuck with an issue I'm desperate to fix. In the "FindProducts" form, I've added about 20 websites but more than half of them have an annoying
 "script error" pop up. It makes it difficult to navigate the website through Access which defeats the purpose of the cool feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing some research on how to remove it, but unfortunately as a beginner I don't know how to fix the problem on my own. I am unfamiliar with VBA code or creating Access macros. But from what I've read, it seems I may have to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, can anyone help me figure out how to remove the script error issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Audrey,<br />
<br />
You can restart the PC as I suggested to see if there’s any improvement. As you’d like to customize codes to hide the message, here are some suggestions:<br />
1. Press Alt+ F11 to input the code.<br />
2. For the example code, please refer to: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff821347.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Form.Load Event (Access)</a>. For how to check the macros, click Create &gt; Macro (e.g. Main.OnLoad).<br />
<br />
For how to generate the code, I would suggest you post this thread on Access &gt; Microsoft Office Programming &gt; Office 2016 category for expert help. We’d appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Jim

<p>This intrusion was very costly to me. I was waiting for a time sensitive email and did not realize it had been unauthorizedly place in the "Other" tab. &nbsp;I did not notice the Other tab until days later. And when I did notice it, I did not know what the heck
 is was for or how it operates. I still do not have a definitive answer as to how or why my email is separated. &nbsp;Very presumptuous of this company to assume they know what my focus is and what should be considered "OTHER".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what control do I have over it if any control at all. This was carried out in a very rude manner. No notice, no permission, and no respect. &nbsp;I truly expect better from Microsoft.</p>

No joy.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 &#47; 365 Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kbenhoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#47; 365 Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook and the MS Office suite for going on 20 years now, and I am an IT professional so Outlook, and it's functionality are not new to me. &nbsp;I am, however, fairly new to Outlook 2016 (was using 2010 previously) and I feel like it has been
 extremely, intermittently, buggy. &nbsp;Just this week, out of the blue, the indexing of emails just stopped working (no search results returned). &nbsp;I tried every fix on the Net, from rebuilding the index file, to various other tricks and tips to get it to work
 to no avail (at least not right away). When I tried it the next day, it was magically working again. &nbsp;Then, it only worked if I searched a particular folder (instead of "Current Mailbox"). &nbsp;Now it is fully working again. &nbsp;No rhyme ore reason to why it stopped
 or started again. &nbsp;This is all on my local machine, and I've disabled auto-updates, so I really have no idea WHAT is even changing on my computer to make things work/not work intermittently. &nbsp;I am scheduled to have a call from MS phase 2 support on Tuesday,
 regarding this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While that fiasco is going on, today, again for no rhyme or reason, my Rules all disappeared - and the button to "Add new rule" is grayed out. &nbsp;But then wait, I just went in to File &gt; Rules &amp; Alerts and they're back! &nbsp;Great! &nbsp;Wait, just went back in, they're
 gone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 20 years, throughout all of the various versions of MS office/outlook that I've owned I've never ever had issues with them. &nbsp;Now it seems to be a fun surprise every day as to what bug or glitch I'm going to be dealing with. &nbsp;Honestly, I'm ready to downgrade
 back to 2010 at this point. &nbsp;Is anybody having similar problems? &nbsp;Does anybody know why software running on my local computer would be having "intermittent" issues that come and go? &nbsp;For a little extra info - I download email from POP accounts - I'm not using
 an Exchange server. &nbsp;I am using the current version of Outlook 365 - 64 bit. &nbsp;Any help, particularly from an MS associate, would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I spent 2 hours on the phone with a Microsoft level 2 tech yesterday, and the issue got resolved (but not solved). Not solved because I never did get an explanation for what happened, however the resolution was quite simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I basically had to create a new Outlook profile, however, I was able to point it to my current Outlook data (PST) file, so all of my emails, rules, etc. were still in tact. &nbsp;I just reconfigured the 2 POP3 email accounts and pointed them to my old PST file.
 &nbsp;Problem solved. &nbsp;Rules were back. &nbsp;I think there are still indexing issues that are known bugs in the current Outlook 2016 release - so I have Outlook unchecked at as indexed location (File &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Indexing Options &gt; Modify &gt; uncheck MS Outlook).
 &nbsp;Searching through emails takes longer - but at least thing aren't left out of the search altogether. &nbsp;Tech said this is the current workaround for known searching issues in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE FIX:</p>
<p>To create a new profile, but not lose any of your saved email, rules, folders, etc. Just do the following:</p>
<p>

    <title>nokia n95 and video playback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fantasticlees  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia n95 and video playback</h2>
                    perhaps ive read something wrong when looking at specs but the nokia n95 records video at 30fps and 640x480 res which is the same as the n93i. the n95 can use a 2gb micro card as opposed to the 2gb mini card of the n93i. my question is ,have i made an
 obvious mistake and is the nokia n95 comparable to the n93i for video recording??<br />
(i know it doesnt look like a small camcorder (like the n93i) but i look at the specs and see no difference though video recording time has a dash through it in specs on the n95 which i dont understand as it can take a 2gb microcard??) sorry if theres an obvious
 answer

            Sorry not obviously but quite surely N93i should shoot videos better than N95 because according to another thread I learnt N93i has stereo speaker while N95 has mono.<br />
N93i is equipped with digital image stabilization which I guess is absent in N95 to produce better videos.<br />
N93i also has 3X optical zoom which N95 lacks.

            n93i also has an option to automaticaly autofocus when recording but the only draw back is the *click,click,click* sound from the motor. The sound from what i've been reading can only be resolved with a bluetooth mic instead of using the internal mic to
 recording

I disagree that N93i records zooming noise. use N-93i. They have moved the mics to the top the camera console. The noise is absent

The number of speakers for sound output has no correlation whatsoever to how good or bad video recording a device makes.<br />
<br />
Also, the N95 has two speakers.

            i did a search for n95 manual in pdf and found it and on page 52 and page 53 it mentions the n95 having digital stabilisation and also there is mention of video zoom though it doesnt say if it is optical or digital so to me the n95 looks the same as the
 n93i for video recording.

            Hey all.<br />
I wish I could delete the above stated post.<br />
All I said was wrong except for 3X OPTICAL ZOOM.<br />
About audio recording I found a statement where it was said:N95 records audio in mono while shooting videos.But it was wrong, it also records audio at STEREO AAC. Well, to me 3x optical zoom is not so important for me.<br />
I checked all other specs sheets given below:<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
N93i:<br />
Video resolution up to VGA at 30 fps<br />
Audio recording AAC stereo, 48kHz<br />
Video Stabilization<br />
Video clip length Max 60 min per clip<br />
Video file format .mp4 (default) , .3gp (for MMS)<br />
White Balance Automatic, Sunny, Cloudy, Incandescent, Fluorescent<br />
Scene Normal, Night, User selectable<br />
Color tone Sepia, B&amp;W, Negative, Flicker cancellation.<br />
Zoom (optical/digital) 3x / up to 8x<br />
<br />
=========================<br />
N95:• Video resolutions: up to VGA (640x480) at 30 fps<br />
• Audio recording: AAC stereo<br />
• Digital video stabilization<br />
• Video clip length: limited by available memory<br />
• Video file format .mp4 (default), .3gp (for MMS)<br />
• White balance: automatic, sunny, cloudy, incandescent, fluorescent<br />
• Scene: automatic, night<br />
• Colour tones: normal, sepia, black &amp; white, negative<br />
• Zoom: (optical / digital) 1x / up to 10 x (VGA up to 4x)<br />
<br />
==========================<br />
<br />
Moreover N95 has 10X digital zoom.<br />
<br />
It has 5 mpix lense.<br />
My question:Will it increase video recording quality?

            video quality ie no sticking is the same n95 in videos is a bit sharper9not really visible unless you recored the same video at the same time and pause both devices at the time at the same point during playback you can then marginally see the differences
 where the n95 edges out the n93i<br />
but to the unobserving eye you wont be able to tell

            N93 (and I guess the N93i as well) has stereo Microphone (two microphones actually) so it can record video with stereo audio and it actually works.<br />
<br />
The N95 uses the phone microphone (mono) to record audio and if I'm not mistaken it's recorded at lower sample rate than the N93.<br />
<br />
In terms of overall resolution and bitrate, I don't have files to compare but Roterth or someone else that has both devices can probalby confirm if the N95 records at higher bitrate than the N93 (I don't think so personally).<br />
<br />
Let's ask this from someone that owns an N95. I'm almost certain that there is no stereo microphone in N95, and the information on websites (re. specs) have been known to be incorrect in the past.

            i own the n95 production model as well as the n93i<br />
what i can say is that nokia have shifted the stereo mics on the n93i so during playback the sound isnt as top notch as the n93 its not as loud as the n93<br />
about the n95 having stereo mic i think you are right it is mono but let me double check that

            Yeah.We don't see whether N95 records audio at lower bitrate than N93i or not.But it should,cause that is not hard.<br />
Thanks loco,He finds out a point that at what bitrate N95 shoots videos.This thing usually aren't stated in spec sheet.<br />
How could we know this?

<h2>            Outlook hangs contacting server</h2>
                    <p>I cannot make outlook 2013 work successfully despite multiple chats with Microsoft support.&nbsp; The people are enthusiastic and helpful but I don’t get results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. “contacting server for information”, it happens about half the time that I use the program, it eventually hangs and has to be stopped by task manager.&nbsp; Of course when I am under the control of the support agent it has worked.&nbsp; It
 seems to be tied to emails with a lot of HTML instructions but that is my interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Despite setting the parameters correctly the program does not display graphics in the email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The search function in Outlook simply doesn't work. It consistently does not find emails or contacts that I can navigate to.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last chat session person did a re-index and an office refresh.&nbsp; Outlook is currently hung. I will try to get help with this post and then I will uninstall 2013 and go back to 2010.</p>

            I find this problem occuring repeatedly due to the Password Pop-up window being hidden in the background. There is no way to bring the window in foreground. I have to repeatedly keep killing outlook or reboot machine to get around the issue. It is a big
 wastage of time. Started happening couple of months back. Have tried all options nothing works.

            <p>I have done searches for this problem several times. I had to try again because I was staring at "connecting to server" message longer than I was getting work done. Today I ran into this thread. On one hand, I want to thank Microsoft support for their help.
 What worked for me was repairing the .pst file. The behavior seems to have stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, it is just blasphemy what Microsoft has done to an otherwise great email client BEFORE Outlook 2013. This version is horrible! I will not waste everyone's time describing all the problems as it is all over the web! I have never been able
 to do LESS with my Outlook 2013 client compared to any previous modern versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Although the hanging problem has improved, it is not gone after all. There is not ryhme or reason I can offer for what triggers it. Sometimes I'm just checking emails, other times I am in another folder reviewing emails. The only thing which is consistent
 is I have to wait for the message to go away before I can continue..</p>

            Like many others I have been struggling with this irritating problem for years (it's been known about for over 10 years) and I can accept that there are many reasons for the "Contacting Server" window to pop-up, thus many different solutions......what
 I cannot accept is that the "cancel" button in the same window does absolutely nothing. It's a disgrace that MS have done nothing about this. Customer Service ? Customer Contempt more like.<br />

            <p>I am having the same issue. And like yourself it seems to be only a few emails newsletters that are creating these issues. One is Google Analytics. I get this email and go straight to Contacting server. there must be some tracking code in there somewhere
 that requires a connection back to their server. I have my emails set to not download images. So not sure why this is still happening.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Updating multiple worksheets from a master sheet</h2>
                    HI everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a series of worksheets that pull data from one master worksheet. &nbsp;The problem that I'm running into is that when I insert a new row into the master sheet, it is not updating the other worksheets (i.e. the formulas in the other worksheets skip the
 newly inserted row). &nbsp;Is there a way that I can insert a row so that it will automatically insert that row into another worksheet? &nbsp;Any help is GREATLY appreciated.</div>

            <p>If you're very, very lucky, and have accumulated lots of good karma... maybe. But in reality, probably not. See
<a href="http://www.granite.ab.ca/access/deletedata.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.granite.ab.ca/access/deletedata.htm</a>&nbsp;and references therein.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the lurkers, backing up your database (the backend if it's split, as it should be) is
<strong>absolutely essential</strong>. The only databases that don't need to be backed up are ones that you're willing to either reenter manually from scratch, or discard without regrets.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            IF ... you have done a Compact and Repair since the deletion, then no.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, if anyone can do this, it would be Wayne Phillips<br />
<br />
http://www.everythingaccess.com/accessdatabaserepair.htm<br />

This shows how to recover objects that have been (flagged for) deletion - IF - no C&amp;R has been executed.<br />

<p>I don't think retrieving deleted records is ever possible. Once there is a commit, it's a done deal. Objects are another thing because the MSysObjects table holds the items until the DB is closed or compacted.</p>

            I guess if the size is the same those records might be lurking somewhere. You could make a lot of money if you found out how to do a big Undo at that point. [smile]

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to rename an existing meeting room display name in&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;365. I know that I need to change it in our AD as the name is synchronized to AD. I changed display name in AD but it didn't change meeting room display name in the cloud. Below are

    <title>How can get an update for Windows Moble 5 to 6&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> code_merk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can get an update for Windows Moble 5 to 6&#63;</h2>
                    I currently own an cingular 8125 Smart Phone which has Windows Moble 5 loaded up onto it. Due to some of the newer programs requiring WM6 to be loaded up for it to run, I have been trying to download it with no luck. I read on this site that the only way
 to get the program is to download it from your service provider. When&nbsp;I looked into that, their was only a few phones listed that they said could download the WM6 update. Of course none of of those phones listed were the 8125 and those listed were nolonger
 being produced. So, if you can't get the download from your "service" provider, where else can I get it other than from some virus infested web site? (Not an option).<br />
<br />
Also, is their an update for Power Point Moble that will allow me to make and edit the powerpoints I have?<br />
I&nbsp;appreciate any kind of help you can give.

<br />
That is correct.<br />

<br />
If there is no upgrade offered then your device most likely cannot handle the increased functionality of a newer OS.&nbsp; Even if there was a "hacked" ROM available, it would probably not work very well.&nbsp; The 8125 is a good device but I think it might be time for
 a new device if you want the increased functionality.<br />

There are no updates for Office Mobile available for download

<h2>            &#34;File in Use&#34; notification message is missing&#33;</h2>
                    We have some Excel files on a share drive. We want these files to be such that if one person is using it, and another tries to open it, they get a message that says "File in Use." I know Excel is supposed to do this. But in our case it is not happening.
 Why? Instead, it allows both people to open and edit it, and then it becomes corrupted. Not good.

            <p>Gina's questions are right on the money.&nbsp; If you want them to export the entire database you'll have to create a procedure to loop through all the tables, one by one, and export them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To export tables, queries, to Excel there are a few techniques.&nbsp; You can:</p>
<p><span>DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet method</span></p>
<p><span>or you could use Excel automation, like:</span></p>

<h2>            How to Block &#40;Junk, rule, however&#41; incoming non-English e-mails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using W7Prox64SP1, OfficePro2013SP1, have maybe 20-30 accounts rolling into about 6 in Outlook 2013 (various types).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting a bit of SPAM in one in various foreign languages (location not apparent from e-mail addresses - i.e., some in Russian but .com not .ru address).&nbsp; Getting Russian, Portuguese, Turkish, Spanish &amp; French - started when mods&nbsp;became able to move threads
 to other language forums (but I don't want to think about those implications).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't figure how to add rule that says "If email not in English, then move to junk (or even delete)."&nbsp; Is there a way or is it truly not possible as it seems to me at this point?&nbsp; Any workarounds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I've not contacted email provider yet to try to block from there, but that's next unless y'all can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kosh</p>

            <p>You can't really but you can create a rule to scan for specific words and if they are not in there, you delete the message. For instance, move all emails to Junk except when they contain the words "the" or "you".</p>

            <p>Are they available in Word? Remember that fonts like this replace the standard keyboard letters with symbols so you need to look for a collection of strange symbols around the letter 'K' in the drop-down list of fonts.&nbsp; If you select a blank cell in Excel
 then select the font from the fonts list, anything you type in the cell will be formatted with that font.&nbsp; You can also press F2 while clicked on a cell and then highlight a selection of characters if you want to apply a different font to part of the cell
 only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using the Aire River Desing true type knitting font and that worked fine in Excel.</p>
