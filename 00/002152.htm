<p>Hi Christy,</p>
<p>Different Exchange Online plans have different archive mailbox size limits. Please refer to<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx#StorageLimits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Exchange Online Limits
</a>for detailed information.</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm which plan you are using. If you are using Exchange Online Plan 1, the primary mailbox and Archive mailbox share 50GB storage. I suggest you change to Exchange Plan 2 or buy Exchange Online Archiving for unlimited storage in the archive
 mailbox. To buy Exchange Online Archiving, go to:<br />

<h2>            How To&#58; Transfer my custom workouts to Fitbit Versa&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK. Microsoft killed the band long time ago. My band 1 is still functional (and love it) but the coating has worn out and I'm getting bad allergic reaction from the exposed metal. With no hope for another band on the market, I have to switch. I purchased
 the new Fitbit Versa, which sounded promising. Of course, it's a disappointment in many ways. The built-in functionality is minimal (unless you were shopping for a monthly subscription to motivational videos), and third party apps are few and pretty worthless.</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft abandoned us so quickly, wouldn't that be nice if they would write a fitbit app that could use the custom training programs we already created for the band? It would be a nice parting gift.</p>
<p>Am I expecting too much?</p>

    <title>X3-00 re-flash with different language possible through Nokia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> halabund---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            X3-00 re-flash with different language possible through Nokia service&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My X3-00 died recently, without having received any mistreatment whatsoever.&nbsp; It displayed "sim card registration failed" when I connected to the internet, and after turning it off, it wouldn't turn on again (*it showed the Nokia logo, then a white screen
 flashed 3 times before it turned off).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was fixed at a certified Nokia service by re-flashing it.&nbsp; This phone had the Chinese version of the software (version 8.50).&nbsp; The local Nokia Service Point said that nowhere in Europe is it possible to re-install the original Chinese software for this
 phone, so they installed European version 8.54.&nbsp; This means I lost the ability to either display or enter Chinese characters.&nbsp; (Furthermore they didn't accept the still valid warranty that was given for this phone in China ... )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it really true that Nokia Service Centres in Europe cannot install the original Chinese version of the software on the phone?&nbsp; Is it true that Nokia won't provide this version for them?&nbsp; Furthermore is it true that the warranty is only valid where the
 phone was purchased, not in other countries?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loss of Chinese functionality is very annoying.</p>

<p>One of my worries is that even if previously it would have been possible to install the original Chinese software, not this won't be available anymore because only version 8.50 is available in Chinese while now I have version 8.54 (European).&nbsp;&nbsp; I read that
 Nokia phones have a security mechanism preventing downgrading software.&nbsp; (BTW this phone was purchased unlocked, not bound to any carrier).</p>

here</a> ...Not sure about the non-availability of region specific Firmwares in other countries. The downgrading of firmware is not possible at user end..but Nokia Care MAY ( repeat MAY..) do that for some genuine reasons..</p>

<p>Also: It is usually the case with consumer electronics that the warranty is only valid in the country where the product was purchased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.e., if you buy a phone in Italy, but live in Finland, you have to return the phone to Italy for warranty reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That doesn't really make sense from a consumer's point of view, if it is still the same manufacturer that is responsible for the warranty repair costs (fixing the device or replacing it), but that's still how they operate (how laws and regulations in countries
 permit the companies to operate).</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your assistance. That's very kind of you.</p>
<p>About the topic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-I'm referring to those default settings which are inside of, for example, File menu &gt; Options. There are many menus (like General, Formula and ect.) out there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- The issue has laid here. I'm trying to get the settings back to its default when I make changes and some troubles occur and after that I can't remember which one was the cause of that trouble to undo that, so, I need to do the default settings operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed that link and tried the Fixit tool (I don't know why people think that app can revert the default settings of Excel!) and also tried the registry solution but no one solved the problem. I even tried the Uninstalling method. Same outcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether my problem is clear or not. But for any part, I'm ready to make it more clear, if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I stop another program using Outlook on Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timmy5686  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop another program using Outlook on Startup</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded my Vista computer to Windows 7. After the upgrade to Windoes 7, I uninstalled Outlook 2007 and installed Outlook 2010. Since then, I placed a shortcut in the startup folder (which has since disappeared) and Outlook starts on boot up of
 my computer (I have no problem with it starting by itself but would like to know where the shortcut has gone!)</p>
<p>Everytime it opens, the icon on the taskbar has a little blue dot on it. If I hover over the Outlook icon, it says something along the lines of "Another program is using Outlook. To stop this, right click and select exit now".</p>
<p>I therefore have two questions:</p>
<p>1. How I do I find out what program it is that is "using" outlook? and</p>
<p>2. How do I stop it as it is defeating the object of having Outlook start by itself!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            A phone connection can do this.&nbsp; If I start my PC's bluetooth connection and have some of the services start automatically, Outlook starts.&nbsp; I disabled the Serial line services and the contact/calendar services in bluetooth and Outlook no longer starts.

    <title>Yahoo Email Account 2-way Synch with Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pault_1106  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yahoo Email Account 2-way Synch with Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased Office 365 and installed it on my laptop PC.&nbsp; I have a YAHOO email account which hosts my email, contacts, and calendars.&nbsp; I want to use Outlook (now installed via the Office 365 license) to access my YAHOO account information (email,
 contacts, and calendar).&nbsp; I set up an Account in Outlook client&nbsp;to access my YAHOO account using IMAP settings to access the information.&nbsp; It seems to have worked for the emails as I now see my emails and my email folders.&nbsp; For contacts, I did an export in
 Yahoo into a CSV file and imported that into Outlook contacts and that seems to have worked as well.&nbsp; However, Outlook is not able to access my Calendar information from YAHOO.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My real goal is that I want to be able to make changes to email, contacts, and calendar in the&nbsp;Outlook client and have those changes reflected in the Yahoo account and my other devices (iphone, ipad).&nbsp; I also want the reverse to be true, where I can make
 email, contact, or calendar changes via Yahoo web access (i.e., mail.yahoo.com) or via my iphone/ipad and have those changes reflected the next time I go into Outlook on my laptop PC.&nbsp; In other words, two-way synchronization between Outlook and my YAHOO account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some investigation on the web but I do not see where there is a simple solution to this pretty simple request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Ok, that tells me that I am correctly using the IMAP server settings to access my Yahoo mail inbox and mail folders.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you are telling me that IMAP does not sync the Contacts and Calendars between my Outlook and my Yahoo account.&nbsp; I was able
 to "export" my contacts from Yahoo and "import" them into my Outlook client, but that is just an import/export exercise and will not provide ongoing synchronization.&nbsp; Which means if I add a contact to Outlook, I will need to add the same contact to my Yahoo
 in order to keep it in synch manually (and vice versa).&nbsp; It seems like by now someone would have a tool to synch the Contacts and Calendars between Yahoo and Microsoft Outlook using IMAP or some other add-in tool.&nbsp; That being said, can you at least provide
 me the process to "export" my calendar from Yahoo and "import" my calendar to Outlook?&nbsp; It would be the same situation where I would have to manually keep them in synch, but at least I would have all my appointments loaded to Outlook as a starting point and
 could manually synch them going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know the best way to export my calendar from Yahoo and import to my Outlook client.

            This is absurd.&nbsp; You're basically telling me that Outlook IMAP is useless to me and I will have to find some other email client for my new PC.&nbsp; HELLO!&nbsp; Many of use iOS devices and Microsoft needs to play in that world.&nbsp; I formerly used iCloud to sync my
 contacts and calendar with Outlook POP on my old PC.&nbsp; <strong>Will iCloud work with the Outlook IMAP client to do this?&nbsp;</strong> Apple seems to have no problem syncing their devices with YAHOO calendars and contacts.&nbsp; My Apple Mac friends keep telling me
 how easy life is in their world...&nbsp; <strong>PLEASE -- tell us Microsoft has a way to sync these disparate systems.&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia E61 not detected by PC suite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdogger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E61 not detected by PC suite</h2>
                    What version of Windows is being used?: Windows XP SP2<br />
What version of PC Suite is installed?: 6.83.14.1<br />
What is the connection method: USB cable<br />
If you are getting an error message, it would be a good idea if you could let us know the exact error message you are getting: No error message<br />
<br />
Context: I am a BES administrator and have previously successfully configured Nokia E61 phones (SIMless) to use Blackberry (Orange network) SIMs in Tokyo (Orange do not provide Tokyo Blackberry support). Now, for no apparent reason, our only two Nokia E61s
 cannot connect to the PC Suite, which means I cannot configure it for user's who want to use it in Tokyo.<br />
<br />
Problem: a Nokia device is recognised by Windows when connecting the USB cable- all drivers and components are successfully installed and hardware is reported as ready to use, but the PC Suite does not recognise the device and sits on the connection screen
 with the egg timer and eventually a troubleshooting screen pops up, but none of the troubleshooting advise works.<br />
I have tried uninstalling all relevant software, using a cleaning tool too, re-installing the software. I have tested the Nokias on a different PC and used different logins/profiles but the problem persists.<br />
I have waited on the phone to Nokia support for 114 minutes but did not get through to an engineer!<br />
I have seen this problem in this and other forums but none of the advise has helped.<br />
Any advise greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

            hi pdogger<br />
<br />
With reference to uninstalling PC Suite 6.83 rel_14.1 it removes core application, but cable driver portion remains.<br />
<br />
You may need to get Windows Installer Cleanup Utility "msicuu2.exe" from Microsoft.com and run this. You need to select "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" and "PC Connectivity Solutions" programs. After running this utility they should now uninstall.<br />
<br />
Reboot your PC.<br />
<br />
This should now enable a clean install of PC Suite.

            Hi pdogger,<br />
<br />
When you connect phone to PC, does Windows show any indication that a new device has been connected?<br />
After installing PC Suite, open Device Manager? Do you see any question or exclamation marks? If you do, please uninstall those, disconnect and re-connect the cable. This will re-install drivers.<br />
<br />
Does these help?

            Hi,<br />
I ran the Nokia_PC_Suite_Cleaner_3_6.exe which did not help (having uninstalled all elements of the PC Suite). Installing and running the msicuu2.exe did not show any reference to the PC Suite- only references to other installed programmes that I need to keep.
 I have installed and tried to connect PC Suite on another PC and get the same problem. Maybe this is pointing towards a problem with the device/device software? I have hard reset it but still get no joy. The version of software on the device is up to date
 I believe: 3.0633.09.04.<br />

            Hi,<br />
Windows picks up the device fine- all wireless elements are visible in Device Manager- no visible conflicts whatsoever. Installation looks perfect- but the PC Suite simply does not detect the E61. I have also tried re-installing the cable driver manually with
 the the latest driver downloaded from Nokia- no joy.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a support number for Nokia- one that actually has an engineer on the end of it! I ring 08450455555 and hang on the line forever (114 minutes last time!).<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<h2>            Slow, Spinning wheel - Huge CPU usage OS X 2016 Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Anyone else having issues with this product just been very slow and using up huge amounts of CPU and often spinning wheel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed. Went through all the steps to remove Office 2011 - With 3 accounts it was unusable - could type 4 -5 words then wait 10 seconds type a few more. Often over 200% CPU usage. Even when not doing anything it would be slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So deleted identity and started again but only loaded up two email accounts (main one and a small one leaving another one off).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left overnight (It crashed on its own it seems while machine was sat doing nothing except having outlook open).</p>
<p>Its a bit better now but still sluggish and often using 150 - 200% CPU. &nbsp;Right now its in the background not synchronising or doing anything yet its using 50 - 150% in the background !</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me this really looks like a bad product that seems very CPU hungry. Just clicking on the window &nbsp;gets it using lots up.</p>
<p>Seen few other posts around this issue but nobody fixing it properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I cant recommend this to our customers based upon my testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else getting this and anyone know if it can be fixed or do we wait until its patched properly.</p>
<p />

            <p>I've reverted back to 2011 especially since we have the El Capitan bug as well - Goes to show this thing just isn't quite ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tested this on two machines with 10.10.5 and got same results - The databases aren't huge but are over 10GB which is very much average (actually average is more like 20GB but..) So slow even on new machines with loads of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will wait for next patch or two see if it fixes.</p>

    <title>Link and use destination format does not remain a functional link - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodwellsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link and use destination format does not remain a functional link after the document is saved.</h2>
                    <p>I am linking individual Excel cells' data into my Word document using the copy ≥ paste special as link ≥ unfomated text into the Word document. It shows the link are live and even when i change the data in Excel and save it the linked data in Word will allow
 me to update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I save the Word document, close it and then reopen it the data is thres but the linked data is now an object. The code to the link is quite visible when I Alt-F9 but it doesn't function. Fact is, when I right-clink on the Object that shows
 as a result of the link, it says the Object is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this because of using Office 365?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't&nbsp; run my Office 2010 on my new PC. Please help!</p>

<p>Yes, I do see that now that I pasted some tables from Excel as well. The single cell links that I pasted last evening with the Paste Special - Link - unformatted text are no longer Links but Objects that are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These numbers are to be updatable links to the cells in Excel file. They are Objects after reopening the file. a Right-Click on these number reveal they are objects instead of links and the Object is corrupt.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfb16579-8d70-4747-95be-f74d826cc7bc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfb16579-8d70-4747-95be-f74d826cc7bc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just see this message for the first time. By the way, why did the pasted tables create a new file with the word "Editable" at the end. That new file is next to my Desktop file but is givig me less options to paste from as it is online Live?</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF POSSIBLE TO DO ANOTHER WAY? I will be grateful for the instructions. My document needs 41 linked numbers from the Excel workbook.</p>
<p>

            Based on the message that you received in Excel, it would appear that there is an issue with the clipboard, which is a Windows facility, rather than an Office facility.

            This error happens when you data contains at least once cell which is not in the right format. In your case, there is a cell somewhere in your data range which is not Date. 
<br />
<br />Check for this. If there is still a problem -
<br />
<br />I need to have a look on your workbook to provide you the right solution.
<br />
<br />Request you to please prepare and upload a sample / dummy file sans confidential / sensitive data to Onedrive and share the link? It will help me to give prompt and high quality solution.

<p>This is the code related to the 3 buttons, note that the facebook one is not hosted on our site, but even doing it, the problem still remain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you need the full code, let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

            Ok, so its not the css - the icons are actually different colors. I don't know why they look the same when you compose - but the png files are different colors.  
<br />
<br />You really should resize the facebook icon on the web server rather than using a larger icon and resizing it via css. It's quite a big larger than the other icons.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cb0f8f3-39c9-4875-89cb-22bb10b758e4?upload=true" />

<p>Just to be sure that I understood,&nbsp;so the problem is that the colour is different from the file?

            I opened the two icons and overlaid the browser window so they were side by side then checked the color codes (using an eyedropper tool to see the color codes)  - facebook is predominately #E5A028 (there are some pixels of similar colors), the others are D39D38.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715c2e2e-9e84-42fb-807c-5b3488fa26df?upload=true" />

            it could be a cache issue - the "bad" icon is cached in the client and reloaded. As long as the picture you link to is correct, it will use it. You could try changing the filename - leave both on the server and change the link in the signature to use the new filename.

            The color should be web safe as it works for the other icons - resizing can affect the color, so make sure its right-sized - don't use CSS to resize it. Save it as 30 pixels square.

<p>Searching for the problem I have done the following, checked File/options/mail Compose mail in HTML format, also tried in Plain text, neither worked.
</p>
<p>Also checked that convert to HTML was as recommended for rich text.</p>
<p>The Outlook has only one email address associated with it. Looking at the sent message in Outlook shows the attachment as sent, it just does not arrive.</p>
<p>I am not as far as I know using recent items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many pages showing this problem, is there a solution?</p>

<p>The problem would appear to have been resolved, how I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Today I added another account to Outlook and tried sending an attachment with that to an internet account with the same result ie. Winmail.dat</p>
<p>I then looked at the mail in Outlook.com. The attachment was in the sent message in the correct format. I orwrded the message from Outlook.com and the internet account received the attachment.</p>
<p>Back to Outlook 2016 and tried multiple attachments, all arrived intact.</p>
<p>Deleted the added account and all was still OK.</p>
<p>The wonders of Office! It appears that going to Outlook.com has solved my problem.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 650 problems</h2>
                    <p>First I tried to use the features on the phone to transfer all my contacts and pics to my new 650</p>
<p>for some reason this just won't work.</p>
<p>so then i just spent hours copying all the contacts that i wanted(gave option of a clear out)</p>
<p>then I thought maybe i could get all my pics from my phone via my computer</p>
<p>I uploaded the ones from the old one just fine</p>
<p>But when I got to the 650,it shows no files at all-nothing!</p>
<p>consequently i couldn't transfer files that way either.</p>
<p>when i plug in the 650,it recognises it's presence but when i click 'browse files',there is just a blank space</p>
<p>****?</p>

<h2>            Problem With Post-Install Login &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, I downloaded the latest version of OneNote (2016) from the MS website.&nbsp; The filename was "setuponenotefreeretail.x86.en-us_.exe" and downloaded an installed without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It issue came in after installation.&nbsp; If I try to run the program, it wants me to log into Office365.&nbsp; I've tried my OneDrive login but it immediately says that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"mydomainname.com isn't in our system.&nbsp; Make sure you typed; your email address correctly.&nbsp; It usually looks like...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone out to Office365, but it looks like you don't get a login without buying a subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I've missed something, but I thought that OneNote was now free, but if it is, I can't figure out how to get past the first screen.&nbsp; HELP!?&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about your concern, kindly clarify the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the email account that you were using with your OneDrive a Microsoft account?
</li><li>You mentioned "mydomainname.com," do you have you own personal email domain?</li></ul>

</p><p>To better isolate your concern, we would like to verify few things: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you logged-in to OneDrive, was that on the OneDrive desktop app or onedrive.live.com?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The downloaded OneNote program might be needing an App password, this is separate from your email password. We suggest that you try checking if your two-step verification is enabled. To do this, visit the link below:&nbsp;

                    <p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have observed issue with Action Button in O365 ProPlus edition. We&nbsp;have&nbsp;added path&nbsp;of&nbsp;excel/image file&nbsp;in action button but when we click this in presentation mode nothing opens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We added same action in office standard 2016 and office standard 2013 it works. In these edition if we click action button security warning window popup&nbsp;and once we click on Enable it opens the&nbsp;file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can we &nbsp;resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Hi Akshay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tested Action button Go forward or Next with hyperlink to a local workbook and picture on the PowerPoint version 1809 Build 10827.20138 Monthly Channel, but can not reproduce the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you create a new presentation, does the issue occur? If yes,</strong> then we can conclude the issue is related to your PowerPoint application. I'd like to suggest&nbsp;below methods.</p>
<p>1. Please press the&nbsp;Windows + R keys at the same time, type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold"> powerpnt /safe</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>&nbsp;to start PowerPoint in safe mode.
<strong>Note: there is a space before the /.</strong></p>
<p>2. Go to control panel &gt; programs and features to perform quick repair for your Office. If quick repair does not work, please perform online repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, to better assist you, could you please provide the below information?</p>
<p>1. Where is the workbook or picture located? Please share with us their path.</p>
<p>2. If you create a new slide with the same action button with the same hyperlink path, does the issue occur?</p>
<p>3. Detailed steps and related screenshots about how you create Action button and then encounter the issue.</p>
<p>4. Your exact Office version ( File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information). Please capture a screenshot to show the subscription, version, build and channel information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Tina</p>

<h2>            Messages being rejected and not showing up in sent folder on server</h2>
                    <pre><p>Since this past Wednesday, December 10) I have been having issues sending some emails from Microsoft Outlook from my computer.  All messages appear in my sent folder within my computer software but none show up in the sent folder on Outlook.com.  However, some messages transmit fine others do not.  For those that do not transmit, sometimes I receive an error message and for others I do not. Even when I send a message</p><p>from to myself, it bounces back. Sometimes the error message is that it was treated as spam, sometimes it says there is a configuration error, and there are different error messages even for the same e-mail address but on different attempts.</p><p>All test connections from my computer appear fine. </p></pre>

    <title>Conditional Formatting on a Popup form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liz penna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting on a Popup form</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this is a problem in my database or just a bug in Access 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form, which contains a subform, that is set to be a pop up. When I right click on a column on the subform and try to create a conditional format for the column, none of the options to format the applicable cells will open to allow me to choose what
 color to make the text/fill the cell with. However when I use the conditional formating when my form is not set to pop up, everything works fine. I'd like to be able to keep the form as a popup and use the conditional formatting capabilities, but I have no
 idea how to fix this problem, if it can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Liz - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working with your database and find that, now that I understand exactly what you're doing, I can reproduce the problem in both Access 2013 and Access 2010.&nbsp; I hadn't realized -- though I should have -- that your subform is in datasheet view, so
 the only means to directly call up the Conditional Formatting dialog is by right-clicking the column header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue appears to be a bug in Access, specifically related to the display of the color-selection dialog.&nbsp; When the form is displayed as a popup, the color-selection dialog is not displayed properly.&nbsp; On my system, there's a little "blip" at the bottom
 of the color-selection button when the selection dialog ought to be displayed;&nbsp; see this screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e85b9f8-256c-4651-a0f2-5a8d1285c79e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e85b9f8-256c-4651-a0f2-5a8d1285c79e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see the tiny blip that the (crudely drawn) arrow is pointing to?&nbsp; When the form is not in popup mode, the proper color-selection dialog is shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dff5d50f-fac2-4fb7-8791-4c9c480c6c84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dff5d50f-fac2-4fb7-8791-4c9c480c6c84" /></a></p>
<p>This happens regardless of whether the datasheet is a subform or a main form.&nbsp; Clearly, the problem is with the display of the popup color-selection dialog when the form is in popup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can think of two workarounds for this.&nbsp; The first, and most straightforward,&nbsp;is to create the conditional formatting rule when the form is in either Design view or Layout view.&nbsp; In those views, the form not in popup mode.&nbsp; In both of those views, the conditional
 formatting dialog is available via the Format tab on the ribbon.&nbsp; In Design view, you can also get to it by right-clicking the control, though this is not available in Layout view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That approach won't work if you want your users to be able to set these conditional-formatting attributes on the fly, at run time.&nbsp; In that case, the only other workaround I can think of -- until Microsoft fixes this bug -- is to use VBA code to create the
 conditional formatting conditions.&nbsp; But that would involve creating an elaborate supporting structure to allow the selection of colors and other attributes, so it would be a pain to implement.</p>

I can't view pictures in my received emails. I've had this problem since day one. Microsoft is driving me crazy, first with Windows 8 and now with 99 million

            <p>There's only 1 version of Outlook. Are you thinking of the program thats part of Office? Or are you speaking of the replacement for Hotmail? Outlook is that part of Office, while Outlook.com is the Hotmail replacement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you mean Outlook.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as photo go, have you notice a line with a yellow box? It'll say that part of your email has been blocked. If you trust the sender, click the appropriate link and you should see the picture(s).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are you speaking of the photos of your contacts? If that's the case, it depends on which email they are using.

            <p>Hi again, cool. When you go to the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us</a> look down the page for Outlook.com. I have noticed that some people are using this thread for the Outlook program in error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the photo thing goes, Check your settings for senders. If you are on Outlook.com, in the top right corner you'll see a little wheel spoke. Click it, then look for filters and reporting. Make sure that in the last section down, show attachments
 is checked. then hit save at the bottom of the page. If that doesn't work, then you'll simply have to add them to your safe senders list, which is located in the settings under &nbsp;<span>Safe and blocked senders.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No -&nbsp;I haven't tried using another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am referring to photo attachments. They appear above the body of the email and I can click on and download them. But there are also spaces in the body of the email that are left blank where the pictures belong. The pictures&nbsp;are part of the "story" and
 should be automatically placed in their proper place above the appropriate &nbsp;sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the steps provided by <strong>rbasin </strong>on his last post, but I was already set up in accordance with his instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I reinstall Outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Since Outlook.com is a web based product, there's nothing to re-install. But, I think that Microsoft may be able to reset. I don't know how that affects existing emails, so tread lightly.
