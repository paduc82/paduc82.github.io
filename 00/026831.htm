<p>Hi all - After a day of chaos and no help from MS I finally pieced together the solution :</p>
<p>Java script is part of the problem but the main issue is Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Microsoft account login uses IE or the nightmare Edge exclusively regardless of what your default browser is set as.</p>
<p>Only IE 10 or above works properly</p>
<p>You need to update the 7 system to service pack 1 and update IE to 10 - 11 gives problems</p>
<p>I hope this helps those who still have Windows 7 systems ( the Best OS yet ! )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt MS will bother fixing this But it would be nice if they add this to the Login Problem Support Page&nbsp;</p>

    <title>All Hotmail contacts missing in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feltennova  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Hotmail contacts missing in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Like a lot of users, I was forced over to the dreaded Outlook.com from Hotmail.&nbsp; Boy, does Outlook.com stink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my contacts are gone.&nbsp; They were there in Hotmail.&nbsp; Now that I am in Outlook.com they are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me awhile to notice because when I compose a new email and start typing names on the 'To' line, people's email addresses pop up, as if it is pulling from my contacts.&nbsp; But when I go to view my contacts Outlook.com says, "We didn't find anything to
 show here." and has a stupid smiley face... :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...are all my contacts gone?&nbsp; Is there any hope of restoring the long list of family and friends?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, sometimes on a new email I can starting typing name on the 'To' line and email addresses will be suggested/show up for certain individuals, and sometimes they will not.&nbsp; Example, I want to send an email to my good buddy John Doe.&nbsp; On the 'To' line
 I start typing John and his email address is suggested.&nbsp; Pressing 'Enter' adds his email address to the email.&nbsp; Other times I'll type 'John Doe' and his email is never suggested, never shows up.&nbsp; Since I do not remember his email address, go to my contacts
 list...only to find it empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at Hotmail or Outlook.com please help?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your willingness to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I tried that before posting my issue in this forum.&nbsp; There were no contacts listed to restore or un-delete.&nbsp; My impression is that either none of them made it over from Hotmail to begin with, or (more likely) for some reason they do not populate
 when to select 'people' and try to view my contacts.&nbsp; I suggest the latter as when I type a family/friend's name on the 'To' line of an email, the suggestions (intellisense to borrow a term from the programming world) show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I reach someone at Outlook.com for help?&nbsp; I believe this issue will need to elevated in order to be resolved.&nbsp; At this point I'm anxious to get all my contacts back.&nbsp; I fear the longer it takes, the less likely they can/will be retrieved.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Extending a large chart whose data range is too complex to be displayed</h2>
                    <p>I have a chart displaying multiple Y values on a common X axis. The Y-value columns are noncontiguous, which I think is the cause of "The data range is too complex to be displayed", and prevents me from simply dragging the data range boundary to extend the
 chart after adding new lines of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I'm just selecting the data and manually editing each variable, but that's getting pretty tiresome. Is there a better way? I thought of adding additional columns to make the Y-values contiguous,&nbsp; but one of these charts is at 70,000 rows and climbing,
 and I'd like to keep the total size down. I can easily determine the last row number, but have so far been unable to automatically insert that value into the chart's ranges.</p>

<h2>            I am not getting rid of my local account.</h2>
                    <p>I'm going to offer some truly constructive criticism right up front. Some people like the Microsoft accounts, some people don't. It's fine to offer people an option. It's not fine to hide those options (Win 8/8.1) or force them into it (10 TP). I'm one of
 those who doesn't want it to replace my local account. I understand signing into the store, I understand the concept behind that. I understand needing to verify my status for updates. I'm not fine with it replacing my local account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats really messed up is that I've been trying to get a new, more professional account registered for about 4 months now. Nobody knows what's wrong, but it isn't working. You have a bug that won't let me register. If you could fix that before the heat death
 of the universe, I might use my MS account more often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm going to rant a little bit, because hell, why not? Maybe anger will get you to listen? I've been around about this for years and nothing has worked yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely zero **** reason to replace a local account with a Microsoft account to continue receiving updates. I can understand that there's an insider program going on, and I might have to verify my special&nbsp;<br />
"insider status" or whatever (that anyone can get). I don't mind signing in to verify that. HOWEVER...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I - DO - NOT - WANT - TO - USE - MY - **** - MICROSOFT - ACCOUNT - TO - SIGN - IN - TO - MY - DESKTOP</p>
<p>
</p><p>I - WILL - NOT - USE - YOUR - **** - TO - REPLACE - MY - LOCAL - ACCOUNT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get this through your thick **** skull. There are a lot of people out there who don't want your ****. I was (am) still pissed as hell. I went to get upgrades, got told I had to sign in. "ok, verify, got it" and my local account was replaced. Which made
 it all sorts of fun because my password manager, which I use for everything because people damn well should these days, is locked behind my account login screen which is now my Microsoft account. FUN DAYS LET ME TELL YOU WHAT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are actively pissing off the people who make real life decisions about where to spend their money. It being an insider preview, you also encounter a higher percentage of people who work in the IT field. Think about that, think about the people that have
 a choice between your product and the competition. Think really really hard because it takes you a really really long time to process things it seems like...</p>

            <p>Please excuse me if I don't understand your dilemma. Perhaps there are options you didn't think about.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to User Accounts and create a new account and designate it as local. Give it administrative privileges if you are comfortable with that. Keep your MSA (Micrsoft Account) for when you wish to use the Store, Feedback, Insider Hub,&nbsp;One-Drive, or when you
 wish to download new Preview builds through Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply log into Windows from the new, local account. Did I miss something?</p>

            I understand what you're saying, create two accounts (local and MSA) and just use one of them (MSA) for updates. If I'm having to create workarounds like that it's a sign Microsoft is doing things wrong though. Customers should not have to create multiple
 accounts as a workaround for Microsoft's policy. It shows bad design that it even needs to be suggested.

</p><blockquote>I understand what you're saying, create two accounts (local and MSA) and just use one of them (MSA) for updates. If I'm having to create workarounds like that it's a sign Microsoft is doing things wrong though. Customers should not have to create
 multiple accounts as a workaround for Microsoft's policy. It shows bad design that it even needs to be suggested.
</blockquote>
<p>I partially agree with you. My take is that Microsoft should not be pushing the MSA so hard and that Microsoft should make it&nbsp;easier during intial operating system setup to enter and log on with a local account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you and I aren't interested in One-Drive and other MSA-appropriate 'apps,' but I think it's legitimate for Microsoft to request an MSA for use of such features. I think there will be many users who will make very good use of the Microsoft cloud, but
 not you and I&nbsp;(I have other solutions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was initially wholly against using an MSA to log in. I do now, to keep up with Win 10 builds on the Fast Ring, but that's the only reason. My MSA will only be on my test rig, which I will keep on Insider status even after the RTM release is available.
 My other Windows computers, which I will probably upgrade to 10, will only have local accounts.</p>

            <p>You know the funny thing about them not even realizing they were signing in to Microsoft?&nbsp;I discovered the security implications of MSA accounts while recovering a password for a company. The employee who used the computer (small company, no real standards),
 used MSA to sign in. Physical access to the box, dumped the SAM and SYSTEM file, cracked the password. Realized that since it was an MSA account it was also the password to his personal email. Could have had access to all his emails, reset other accounts,
 bank credentials, who knows what. All because the password was now stored locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably wouldn't have mattered anyway given peoples password reuse habits. I'll give them that at least, still doesn't help matters.</p>

            I get the humor, but in all seriousness, that attitude is why I use Gmail, not Outlook. Chrome or FF, not IE. Android, not Windows phone. Microsoft had this attitude that nothing was better during the Balmer era. I feel like&nbsp;Nadella is turning a lot of
 things around, but unless they want to continue seeing OSX chip away at the OS market bit by bit, they have to turn around their attitude as well. There are some things people don't have a choice in, but it won't be that way forever.

            <p>I have a local and M$ account and am having lot's of issues too...I would not mind so much with the MS account sign in if I could create a Pin log in like always but this !0130 build won't let me...it's been a broken build from the start and should have
 never been let loose without a leash,,,</p>
<p>I tried to sign back to the MS account today and there is some confusion with Win 10 whether I'm on local or MS account...so I'm frustrated between the two of them because I'm not getting anywhere!?!?...still no new builds coming in either...and there is
 a LONG list of issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>But 'THIS' is just a Preview and a project in the works still...and it has'nt been going too well lately...</p>
<p>for me it's just for fun for now and just deal with the issues...it's not my main system anyways.*john</p>

<h2>            OneNote App&#58; Can Not create Notebook or connect with OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not at all use the OneNote App on my iPad Pro.</p>
<p>If I try to add anew Notebook I am only able to change its color. I can‘t change the name and I can‘t create it. I tried to connect with OneDrive but after the login there is no error notification but it didnt add OneDrive to my services in OneNote. I can
 however use the OneDrive App perfectly on the same iPad. How can OneNote NOT connect to OneDrive then? Even if I open the webapp for OneNote I‘m not able to do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried everything and searched the forum. It seems as I‘m not the only one woth this problem yet I can‘t find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hi MS249548,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenient caused by this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my test steps, please have a look:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Launch OneNote and then click my name&gt;Account&gt;Add service to connect to OneDrive.
</span></li><li><span>Click More Notebooks&gt;Open from OneDrive to open notebooks located in OneDrive.</span></li><li><span>I can also click the plus button to create new notebooks.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if this issue is related to your keychain, I'd like to suggest sign out your Office account from OneNote and your browser then relaunch OneNote and sign in your account to check if you can
 use OneNote normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still can't use OneNote normally, please move to Settings&gt;OneNote and click Reset OneNote to see the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please also share with me more info as below to let me have a clear understanding of your scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The version number of your iPad and OneNote(the bottom of Account page).</span></li><li><span>Screenshot of the page after you click the plus button and the page of Connected service.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for the quick answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of your suggested test steps, I deinstalled and reinstalled the app and logged out an back in again. All dead ends.</p>
<p>1. Add services didnt work. Again no error notification after successfully signing in. Simply nothing happend.</p>
<p>2. Open from OneDrive didnt work. I got the notification that the site cannnot be shown and elements cant be found.</p>
<p>3. After clicking the plus button i can only change the color not name or service as both of those fields are grey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of the above again after resetting OneNote. Same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version number of my iPad: 12.1 (16B92)</p>
<p>version number of OneNote: version 16.21 (190110)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I use the app in german)</p>
<p>Connected services: (doesnt change even after trying to add service and successful login)</p>

<p>Hi MS249548,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the screenshots above, the reason why you can't create new notebooks is not connecting to OneDrive. To check if this issue is related to your network, please use other networks such as hotpot from your cell phone to check if you can add OneDrive
 to your notebook service normally. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue persists, to troubleshoot this issue, I'd like to suggest sign out your account from OneNote and OneDrive then sign in OneNote first to add your OneDrive as a service to see the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also use other iCloud&nbsp;accounts to check if you can add OneDrive as your service normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue persists, please share with me more info as below to let me help you:</p>
<p>1. Can you add OneDrive as OneNote service normally before? What have you changed before this issue?</p>
<p>2. Screenshots of the error message "<span>&nbsp;</span><span>the site cannot be shown and elements cant be found</span>"</p>
<p>3. Can you add SharePoint as a OneNote service?</p>
<p>4. Reproduce video of this issue. To protect your privacy, please share with me your video via

<h2>            OneDrive sync error&#58; &#34;credentials needed&#34; when Sharepoint permission level &#34;delete items&#34; is taken away</h2>
                    
<p>We need to use OneDrive to sync files, from a Sharepoint folder, with a group of employees - for offline access. These employees should NOT be able to delete files. While these settings work great in SharePoint, OneDrive has a problem with it.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First off, setting the users to "Read Only" in SharePoint results in Sync Errors....so I wanted to isolate the problem.&nbsp;
</li><li>A user in the group "Members" has the default "Contribute" permissions.&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>With these permissions, there are no Sync errors. Everything Works.&nbsp; </li></ol>
</li><li>I went into the "Contribute" permissions and simply took away "Delete Items"&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>The result was: Sync Errors: Credentials Needed&nbsp; </li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>When clicking on "Credentials Needed" it simply loads the SharePoint&nbsp;folder in the browser, which the user has access to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is a diffrent way to sync/share files besides everyone syncing via SharePoint please advise, but remember there will be "owners" with full access, and "members" who can view the files but not delete or add additional files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
For your scenario, I have done the related test. On Windows 10 with OneDrive for Business 2016, I give a user Read permission and sync the file to the local without the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, could you try the following steps?</p>
<p>1. Exit all Office applications including the OneDrive for Business sync client.<br />
2. Reset IE settings and delete personal settings: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
3. Removing all the stored credentials in the credentials manager (Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt;Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials). (NOTE: This will remove your stored passwords.)<br />
4. Win + R &gt; Run <strong>regedit</strong> as administrator.<br />
5. From Registry Editor, browse to(If you user Office 2013,change the 16.0 to 15.0):<br />
<b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity</b><br />
6. Delete the Identity folder.<br />
7. Open OneDrive for Business to continue syncing. It will prompts you to enter the credentials again. Enter your account and check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Felix</p>

    <title>Cursor blinking in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jinglecam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor blinking in Excel</h2>
                    <p><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My dad installed the Fall Creators Update on both of his Windows 10 laptops, but one of them has an issue.</p>
<p>When he types in a cell in Excel, the cursor rapidly blinks between the "cross" cursor and the default arrow.</p>
<p>While I would not see this as a major issue, my dad says that he cannot stand the blinking cursor and wants a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHAT I'VE TRIED:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This problem started on Office 2007, which was unsupported before the release of the Fall Creators Update, so I tried upgrading Office 2007 to Office 2010, and that did not work.</p>
<p>2. I tried uninstalling the mouse driver and reinstalling it, but that did not work.</p>
<p>3. I tried using the touchpad, and that did not work. I then tried out another mouse, and that failed as well.</p>
<p>4. I looked on the Internet, but I could not find anything that was related to this issue.</p>
<p>5. I matched the mouse settings with another Windows 10 PC without the issue (Also on Fall Creators Update), and that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SYSTEM INFO OF THE PROBLEM PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make: Samsung&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model: RV520</p>
<p>OS:Microsoft Windows 10 (10.0.16299.15)</p>
<p>Office 2010 (Problem started on Office 2007)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be due to software conflicts to the Office application from the Windows updates. Just to clarify, is the issue only happening to Excel?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest that you perform an online repair. To do this, click <strong>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and follow the steps provided. Please note that when you get the prompt,
<em>How would you like to repair your Office Programs</em>, select <em>Online Repair</em>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you go back to the previous versions of Windows and check if the issue will still manifest.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

<p>Please see my comment below.&nbsp; There is more than enough evidence that the fall 2017 update is causing this.&nbsp; IT appears that all surface units are doing it (laptop or otherwise) and some non microsoft units as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix is to ROLL BACK but I am not willing to do that.</p>

<p>Yes, I had the same issue and I spent another month of my life trying to fix it and could not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is made worse when you have data being piped into an excel spreadsheet in real time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this I had multiple system crashes every day for a month with no mini dump file and nothing in the log. In the end I gave up on the latest Windows 10 'update'/virus and reverted to my pre-upgrade system image of 1703-15063..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I had to switch to the business ring in Win Pro and defer updates another 365 days to ensure I get some breathing space prior to the next 'feature' virus rollout.&nbsp; I have been using windows since Windows 3.1 and this is the worst yet.&nbsp; MS seems
 to have lost the plot and is releasing buggy software all the time like it is little more than an app store now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my reversion to 15063. Not a single issue or crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If when I am forced off this version the problems come back I will revert again and hack my installation so that Microsoft is unable to EVER send an update to me every again.</p>

<p>This problem is back for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hangs, crashes as well as this constant flickering cursor in excel I had to revert to the prior stable win10 version:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>1703-15063.&nbsp; I also change the update settings to 'business ring' and delay 365 days
 so prevent any upgrade for at least a year.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However a few months later, MS has force rolled out upgrades even to 365 day delayed systems 'for security reasons'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So now I am on the latest version 1709&nbsp; 16299.248&nbsp; and of course the constant excel cursor flashing is back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I see links on the web that MS believes it has fixed this issue with
</span><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">KB4054517.</span></p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Excel-cursor-flickers-after-updating-to-Windows-10-Fall-Creators-Update-v1709-94b30c81-52eb-4008-b932-8f2e6aa03d1b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>And I have tried to install that patch but it fails to install as it is for a&nbsp;<em>prior build</em> of win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have also tried other suggestions wrt pen device (I have none)</span></p>
<p><span>I have reinstalled nvidia GTX660 drivers with lates version.. no effect.</span></p>
<p><span>I have uninstalled printer drivers... no effect.</span></p>
<p><span>I have changed default printer to various... no effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So... anyone know when MS will fix this annoying issue with the cursor flickering constantly between the pointer arrow and the large white plus sign?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of note... this only happens when the Java api that is feeding live data into the spreadsheet is running, but this api has been stable for over a decade.&nbsp; The issue has crept in with the latest Win10 releases starting
 with fall creators update.</span><br />

    <title>Open Outlook on startup MINIMIZED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesbarlow88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Outlook on startup MINIMIZED</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to get outlook to launch with windows in a minimized state. Reason is that it is mostly a gaming pc, however I still want to get notifications in the background, just don't want a huge window opening at start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a shortcut in startup folder&nbsp;</strong>This works perfectly, but crashed 50% of the time, if there is any fix that you can provide to this then I think this would be easiest route.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a delayed task in scheduler&nbsp;</strong>This launches and doesn't crash, however I cannot get it to launch minimized or through a shortcut that is set to open minimized.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a delayed task in scheduler with command line /min </strong>Outlook doesn't accept /min as a command unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some searching and people talk about .bat files? However I am not 100% certain on how to create these and get the task scheduler to work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it may seem a little pedantic, but there must be a way to achieve this for convenience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

 restarted my device more times than can count, restarted my router multiple times and no change! the best Microsoft have done to remedy this is manage to download a setup file for the same thing which was done by the technician remotely today but unfortunately
 it was an .exe file! which he repeated three times before coming to the realization that .exe files do not work with osx!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening (after three hours at my computer watching technicians remotely access my computer) i have been told over the telephone (32minute call with approximately 20 minutes of that on hold) to go to my local internet cafe and check if i can download
 it there!! and that i will get a call back in the next 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarise i have been driven to this forum in the desperate desperate hope that someone else (other than so-called microsoft technicians) can help me with this simple task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're the one person who has got past this then PLEASE PLEASE let me know what is to be done as if i have to aimlessly stare at my laptop looking at someone remotely use it who quite obviously has not been shown how to use mac osx stumble around and
 eventually try the most basic tasks, i may be forced to pluck out my eyeballs!!!!</p>

</p><blockquote>I had the same problem today. &nbsp;It turned to be a DNS problem. &nbsp;The server officecdn.microsoft.com was not resolving. &nbsp;I changed my DNS server entry under TCP/IP settings to point to Google's public servers, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
 and the download worked right away. </blockquote>
Thank you very much for this answer, which solved the problem for me too. For others, it would be worth explaining that to change the DNS server entry, you click the Apple logo top left, then System Preferences, then Network, then Advanced, then the DNS tab,
 in which you click the + in order to enter the 8.8.8.8 (which was what I used), and then Apply. &nbsp;Before doing so, I made a note of the existing entry, which I'm now going to restore.

<h2>            If a cell contains &#34;closed&#34; another cell should have date of today</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Excel(lent) users,</p>
<p>If a particular cell (e.g. M1) contains&nbsp;the word&nbsp;"closed" another cell (e.g. L1) should&nbsp;contain the date of today (but not using a formula containing today(), as this date changes every day).</p>
<p>Can this be done using a formula? Or should I use Coding for that?</p>
<p>And if so, please provide me with the solution, which will be highly appreciated !!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jay</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>If I don't type in closed in M1, but make a new entry in say row 100:</p>
<p>I start adding data in A100, B100, C100, D100, etc (but not closed in M100). When I add something in A100 it is ok, but when I add something in B100, it deletes the entry in A100.</p>
<p>This might have something to do with the Else statument, the way I interpret the Else statement (be carefull I am a layman in programming) the else statement makes sure to delete all Target.Offset(, -1) if any cell is deleted, as long as Target.Column =
 13 is not equal to CLOSED. So always.....</p>

<h2>            Groove App on iOS &#40;iPhone&#41; won&#39;t download &#40;for offline&#41; purchased music from Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>I have been using xbox music/Groove pass for 2 years now and I have been downloading songs to my iPhone (recently) just fine. I decided to purchase the RHCP collection tonight and whilst I can now play those songs (not the 30sec demo) on my pc and XB1, I
 cannot download them onto my iPhone Groove app. It reads as a download error. I can stream them just fine once I add them to the collection on my iPhone app, but I cannot download for offline use.</p>
<p>Is this an error or just microsoft not allowing purchased music on iPhone</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply but unfortunately it doesn't help. This is basic information on how to use the app. I am aware how to use it. The download comes up with an error when for offline use is selected. Only the purchased album does it. I am using an iPhone
 but that shouldn't matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway my current solution is that I got a refund on the purchase. I will buy again once an actual solution is found. Until then I won't be purchasing music, just using my pass. I had every intention to buy music that isn't in the pass but not until fixed.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            To update this thread, nothing has changed. I find it interesting that Microsoft cannot explain this given I am a customer who is planning to ditch Apple for Groove. In other words buying a lot of music through Microsoft. Until this is actually explained
 I definitely won't be buying any music as I cannot download it on to my iPhone.&nbsp;

    <title>Organizational Shared Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielbarr6599  say:</h3>
<h2>            Organizational Shared Folder</h2>
                    
<p>What is the easiest way to have a shared folder that shows up in all members Onedrive automatically? &nbsp;I don't want to use the "Shared with Everyone" feature for this because it doesn't show up in a folder in their main window. &nbsp;When I create a new user,
 the first time they open up Onedrive I want them to see an "Organization Shared Drive" folder.</p>
<p>I'm guessing I could create this myself and then share the folder with my "all users" group, but I'm not sure if that will automatically show it in their drive. &nbsp;I also don't want to use up all of my storage space for organization shared files. &nbsp;I guess
 I could create a dummy user to create the main shared folder, but wanted to see if there was an easier way to accomplish this that most people use?</p>

<p>hi daniel,</p>
<p>from your description, the best practice for you is using the office 365 group feature. after you create this group, it will automatically display in everyone' onedrive for business and then all users can collaborate there. see the screenshot below.</p>

    <title>How do I turn off the ridiculous prompt when saving a CSV in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonsalazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off the ridiculous prompt when saving a CSV in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I save a CSV file in Excel, I am told that the file may contain features that are not compatible with CSV. I understand that our Saviors at Microsoft are trying to protect me, a lowly&nbsp;mouth-breathing troglodyte, from saving a file in this utterly
 worthless format. And truthfully, I was fine with the extra prompt the first 5034 times I saved a CSV file in Excel. I thought to myself, "Do I really need to save this as a CSV file? Can I just download the Python or R library to input Excel files to read
 one sheet of static data just so I can rid myself of this time-wasting prompt?" And I--wretched soul that I am--chose to save as a CSV anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the 5035th time, I decided that maybe I could do without the prompt. Maybe I can serve as a warning to all those who want to save as a CSV file without being prompted by the Great One much as a pierced corpse &nbsp;served as a warning on the road to Vlad
 the Impaler's castle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please, tell me how I may turn this prompt off so that others may learn the errors of my ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you, great sir.</p>
