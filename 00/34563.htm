<h2>            Windows Update Failure 0x800f0922 and Stuck at Download-Install-Fail-Backout-Repeat Cascade</h2>
                    <p><span>Windows 10 (Hewlett Packard laptop) computer is at the 1803 build and will not install&nbsp;</span><span>KB4343909 and keeps giving error&nbsp;</span><span>0x800f0922. Then backs out
 the update. Then retries the update. Then fails. Then backs out. Then repeats every day... Every install/backout cycle takes over an hour! This is totally ridiculous. I used the Troubleshooting wizard/app for Windows Updates. It indicated it found problems
 and fixed the problems. However this is not true. The </span><span>0x800f0922&nbsp;</span><span>problem persists. Furthermore, in the 1709 build there was a "Pause Updates" button to allow me to
 suspend this ridiculous behavior. But in the 1803 build the pause option is gone. So not only has Microsoft broken my computer, Microsoft has removed the only means for me to control the failure behavior and be productive!</span></p>
<p>Three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do I fix the&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x800f0922 failure?</span></li><li><span>How do I pause or suspend installation of&nbsp;</span><span>KB4343909?</span></li><li><span>Microsoft: what is wrong with your quality testing?&nbsp;</span></li></ol>

            Hi Geog.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a> 
<br />
<br />The error can mean there are operating system problems so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Check if any drivers are missing or in error with an !  mark in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  then Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, thanks for replying. My responses to each of your [...] suggestions:<br />

 list below is suggesting these too. Yikes!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[... install the Updates manually from this Catalog: <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 troubleshooter at least gives me the option to hide this update, but unfortunately, while I was downloading the troubleshooter and hiding it, Windows Update re-installed KB4343909 again and I must go through the hour-long update-fail-backout process just to
 get back to the troubleshooter. I have marked my WiFi adapter as metered to prevent another update, but the agony of the delay! Anyway, this prevents the cascade of misery. I've posted to Microsoft's feedback site that this tool should be included in Windows
 as a standard feature.</span><br />
<br />
[... error can mean there are operating system problems so go over this checklist&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>&nbsp;]

<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>[... Step 10 to check for damaged System Files ...] is already contained in your first guided walk-through previously mentioned and, no, the DISM did nothing and SFC found nothing<br />
<br />
[... Check if any drivers are missing or in error...] None. This is a pretty vanilla HP laptop with the HP support updater installed to capture all of HP's recommended driver updates and when it was brand new there were a couple driver updates from HP, but
 it has been almost a year with nothing new from HP.<br />
<br />

 I haven't gotten to this point, but hate to think I need to do this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

 only a real nerd could offer this advice. If I weren't a nerd I would be throwing up my hands at the first step in this long list and buying a Mac Airbook (my wife's idea). A Repair install is almost as drastic as the complete wipe-and-replace you are suggesting,
 and I can hardly believe you are suggesting this on the "answers.microsoft.com" forums!<br />

<br />
[... I'll keep working with you until this is resolved...] THANK YOU. I will likely need it. Luckily my wife has a spare laptop, and this looks like it is going to take a long time to get fixed. I can't believe Microsoft's cumulative monthly security update
 is so crippling to a mainstream consumer laptop.<br />

            Hi Geog.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A Repair is NOT as drastic as a Clean Install as it keeps your files, programs and most settings in place and reinstalls Windows in about an hour, which solves most problems. 
<br />
<br />I have been "suggesting" Clean Installs in forums for 10 years which several million people have completed without a single complaint.  Now most enthusiasts won't even consider running the inferior factory or Upgrade install but do the wipe and clean.  It may not be for everybody but for those who want to learn everything that works best in Windows 10 in one lesson, it is a great learning experience that makes you permanently the master of your PC because you know what's best and have applied it with your own hands.  If you don't want it then just skip it, but don't put down what's worked for millions of others and brought Clean Installs from only enthusiasts to the masses.

<p>Greg, Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I have successfully blocked&nbsp;<span>KB4343909 and I will wait until the September cumulative security update to see if next month's packaging is not in self-destruct mode. I have three other Windows 10 home computers
 and have installed&nbsp;</span><span>KB4343909 on those. Two installed automatically without a hitch. But one I was able to manually download and install from the Microsoft Update Catalog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><em>So
 a 50% success rate here. That is pretty darn poor.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you or Vijay answer the other questions in this thread while I await September's update? To recap:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>With precision what does error&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>0x800f0922 mean?</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Does a reset of the SoftwareDistribution folder occur during a run of the Microsoft Update Troubleshooter wizard?</span></strong></li><li><span><strong>Assuming I still have problems next month, will a reset of the CBS log and upload of that log to this site be helpful?</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><br />
[Finally, Greg, please I didn't mean to insult with my comments about being a nerd and suggesting a "wipe and reinstall" is too radical. I've done that myself, and yes, it is a means to rid a consumer computer of the adware/trialware marketing bloatware and
 perhaps in a rare instance also rediscover the correct drivers which may be slightly out of sync with the OEM hardware manufacturing process. But these "standard image" systems should be maintainable. The whole point to Windows Update in Windows 10 is to remove
 the human element (unlike Windows 7 or earlier editions, where a user who desired to do so could manage the update process). If Microsoft is going to pull the rug out from under me, their system must tolerate the OEM manufacturing distribution channel. We
 are not all buying Surface devices.]<br />

<p>As promised, I thought I'd wait until Microsoft released September security updates and see what would happen. Now the same symptom continues but for the new cumulative update KB4457128. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's both the August cumulative security update KB4343909 and September update KB4457128 that are failing to install, require a lengthy backout and restart process and then the whole painful episode repeats.</p>

<p>

<h2>            Error creating new incoming connection - Windows could not create your connection.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a tough time creating a new incoming connection on my Windows 10 pc. I'm trying to create a VPN so that my laptop can connect to a NAS drive on a LAN network, both in and out of the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the 'Allow connections to this computer' wizard, it comes up with the error message "Windows could not create your connection - Incoming connections depend on the Routing and Remote Access service, which was unable to start. For more information,
 check the system event log."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured the internet for fixes, including trying a registry edit that seemed to be a popular solution. However that was already implemented on my machine and did not help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried manually starting the Routing and Remote Access service but that just ends again when attempting to create a new connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that a brand new laptop, running exactly the same build of Windows 10 (version 1803, build 17134.523) managed to set up an incoming connection with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workstation in question is connected to two networks, one which is the office internet connection and a separate LAN network which has the NAS drives on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can help!</p>

            Hi JamieHovell,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

                    <p>I Have always used an email client software Outlook and outlook Express.</p>
<p>With Windows7, I can no longer use Outlook Express, and was led to believe that Windows Live Mail is the replacement client.</p>
<p>I am just trying to learn or understand the client. What is compact view?</p>
<p>Where is the online help for using storage folders?</p>

            <p>Click <em>Compact view</em> on the <em>View </em>tab and you'll see what it does. You can achieve the same effect by dragging the right-hand border of the folder pane to the left. Only folders that you've
<em>added to compact view</em> will be visible.</p>
<p>Storage folders enable you to store messages locally that you don't want to keep on the server. Moving a message from an HTTP or IMAP account folder to a user-created folder under storage folders will remove it from the server. If you remove an account,
 all its folders and their contents are permanently deleted. You can avoid the consequences of doing this by accident by saving messages in Storage folders.</p>
<p>The special folders that you see under storage folders are required for newsgroup accounts and some IMAP accounts. You can't delete them. The<em>Deleted items
</em>folder there is a temporary repository for items deleted in storage folders.</p>
<p>As for help, there's not much of it around. These forums may be your best bet, but you'll have to use the
<em>Find answers</em> box to search for the help you need.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compact View only shows the folders in Folder Pane when enabled.&nbsp;Usual&nbsp;folders on the&nbsp;lower-left side of Windows Live Mail such&nbsp;as Mail, Calendar and Contacts will be displayed as a smal folder without the label making it compact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you select Inbox or Sent Items as an example to <strong>Add to compact view</strong>, it will appear on the folder pane as a shortcut icon when the Compact View is enabled under
<strong>View --&gt; Compact View</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <span>I'm not sure what running MS Word has to do with what you've written (Word should open fine in a Limited User account), but here is how to fix your password issue.<br />
<br />
If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. If you don't have another account
 like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right
 menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you reset the built-in Administrator account's password in Home or have Pro and don't remember the password, use NTpasswd to change the built-in Administrator account's password to a blank. Download the bootable CD .iso, burn with third-party burning software
 such as Roxio, Nero, or the free ImgBurn . Burn&nbsp;as an image, not as data. Boot with the media you created. You may need to change the boot order in the BIOS or get a temporary boot order menu with a special keypress. NTpasswd will run. Follow the instructions
 carefully.<br />
&lt;removed&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Then go to the User Accounts applet in Control Panel and set passwords that you will remember and make other desired changes. WRITE THE PASSWORDS DOWN AND PUT THEM SOMEWHERE YOU WON'T LOSE THEM.</span>

            Check Device Manager and see if all components have correct drivers installed (should have no question mark or exclamation mark).<br />
<br />
Also check your keyboard (usually Function keys) if there's a WiFi manual switch that you need to press.<br />

<h2>            What&#39;s wrong with Windows 10 and WiFi connection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For me, the connection comes and goes since installing Windows 10 on my HP desktop.&nbsp; It's fairly new and had Windows 8 prior with no wifi issues.&nbsp; None of my other devices using other Windows or IOS are having this problem so clearly Windows 10 related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen many other post this same issue and none of the responses point to the real source of the problem...namely Windows 10.&nbsp; Why won't Microsoft fix this and issue a patch for everyone that is having this problem?</p>
<p>

    <title>Screen saver slideshow Dynamic control and photo information call-out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen saver slideshow Dynamic control and photo information call-out</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Pro. Current version. All updates applied. </p>
<p>I have screensaver configured to cycle through photos from my own large collection.
</p>
<p>It's great. Simple and works well. Also, I've discovered, by&nbsp;trial and error, that you can&nbsp;move backwards and forwards through the randomly displaying pictures using the right and left arrows. Great!!&nbsp;You can review again&nbsp;something you just saw.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's my question&nbsp;/ problem....&nbsp; (Other than the poor documentation of this feature!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a great photo come up that you really want to identify / look at further / edit / , how&nbsp;can you do this????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please&nbsp;add a feature, say by pressing the UP arrow, that overlays the picture with the location and&nbsp;name of the picture???</p>
<p>
</p><p>You press the UP arrow, The screensaver pauses, the&nbsp;name and location of the picture is displayed&nbsp;possible with the option to "Paste to clipboard"&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp; "Go to photo's location" in file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the Microsoft supplied WEB photos on the Screen LOCK feature has this for geographic locations. From the screensaver, you can shell out to the web&nbsp;and further investigate a featured geographical location. It's a great feature.
</p>
<p>So please add the same type of feature to the PERSONAL photos slideshow. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

<h2>            Cannot load anything. Will not boot up completely....please help</h2>
                    

<div>
<div>
<div>Since the last update my Xbox one has been useless, for the most part...</div>

<div>I've been trying for the last 3 hours to get it to boot up. after sitting for 5-10 minutes it may or may not pop up the Xbox splash screen. it'll then stay on the splash screen for 10-15 minutes and just stay on an empty black screen. then an error pops
 up saying "(program) is taking too long to load. (Error 0x8027025a) I can talk to Cortana but it say to sign in and she's still trying to load.
</div>

<div>Please note that this is only happening on the newer of the 2 xbox ones that I have. The older xbox, purchased the first 2 weeks from the release, is working fine.</div>
</div>

<p>Hi, there is some info on this error code in the link below.</p>

<p>Could you try pressing and holding the power button on the Xbox for 10 seconds, when the Xbox powers off disconnect the power supply from the mains power outlet and wait 5 minutes, reconnect the power supply to the mains power outlet and power the Xbox on
 using the power button on the Xbox.</p>

<p>I'm sorry. I meant to post the trouble shooting steps that I've taken. &nbsp;I've already tried the method that you provided. I've also done that and then when turning on the Xbox holding the power and eject buttons until I heard the 2 bootup sounds. &nbsp;Still won't
 load home, signin, or anything else.</p>

<p>Update...</p>
<p>Got the xbox to come up and I had 4 options. I tried to restore to factory settings, after an hour and a half of waiting "There was a problem." I retried, only this time I did a full system restore, erasing everything...2 hours later "There was a problem."
 Now I'm back to square one. Sitting at a blank screen for long periods of time.....this is so frustrating...</p>

<p>The reformat finally took. I started setting up the xbox, the time zone , instant on, etc. then "Home took too long to startup" and "Viveo took too long to start up" and It sat at a black blank screen. Now I'm trying to boot back up and it took 5 minutes,
 but the Xbox splash screen is now up and has been up for 10 minutes. It's not locked up, the dots under Xbox One are moving, just nothing else happening. &nbsp;</p>

<p>@McElroy: I am having the same issue. I have tried everything short of a complete system wipe, which I believe is the next step. It started with the delay error only appearing with Battlefield Hardlinemon disc, and then migrated to digital games and then
 the error appeares with my apps like Netflix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am similarly frustrated and want to throw my One out of my car at high speed. I was ready to buy the One S, but have to admit this problem has me reconsidering that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there PoW McElroy and Solon327,</p>
<p>Are either of you in the Xbox One Preview program? If so, you will want to post about this on the
Preview Program Forums for the best troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Factory Reset</a> might help resolve this issue as well, You can use the option that allows you to save your games and apps though. Give that a try next and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Yes, I am part of the Preview Program. &nbsp;I'll try posting in there as well. I've tried both options for factory reset and both failed. I went through the setup process after returning it to the factory settings and when it tries to bootup it says "home took
 too long to startup" </p>

<p>As in that thread try the driver (ATI HDMI Audio Device) in the following link from Realtek and see if that helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsCheck.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsCheck.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false</a></p>
<p>You could&nbsp;also&nbsp;install the Realtek&nbsp;audio driver (R2.63)&nbsp;from the same link rather than use the Microsoft driver which you appear to be now using.</p>
<p>The Realtek driver&nbsp;which may improve sound quality and performance.</p>

            <p>Hello AndrewMenzies,</p>

<p>I took a look at the dump file you sent and it appears that ks.sys may actually be the victim here.</p>
<p>Prior to ks.sys, atihdLH6.sys shows up in the stack.&nbsp; Since this is a minidump, I cannot read the unassembly, but we typically see a third party driver sending a bad parameter up the stack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atihdLH6 driver is fairly new- March of 2011.&nbsp; We should check with ATI to see if they have an update for it.&nbsp; If not, then we may want to revert to the driver that came out before this iteration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following is my analysis of the dump.&nbsp; My comments are in <strong>bold:</strong></p>

<p>Hi Lance, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're currently experiencing with your device could be a software or hardware-related issue. It is possible that the HP - HID class driver that was installed on your computer is not compatible with Windows 10 or could be that the touchscreen
 driver is missing. You may try updating the driver for your HID-compliant devices. Please check out
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update drivers in Windows 10</a> for the steps in updating the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the issue persists after updating the drivers, then we suggest that you get in touch with the HP support team for them to look into the hardware part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to let us know should you need further information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Surface Type Cover - Touchpad Clicks not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kmdn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Type Cover - Touchpad Clicks not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I use as my main working machine my Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I encountered over an hour ago and searching unfortunately hasn't led me closer to a solution:</p>
<p>My type cover's touchpad's clicks/scrolling don't work. In the middle of use, I noticed that scrolling suddenly wasn't working, then I tried the left click, didn't work either (nor did the right one for that matter). I didn't change any settings, so it seems
 weird for them to have changed mid-use.</p>
<p>So, what I've noticed:</p>
<p>-Left-Click doesn't work</p>
<p>-Right-Click doesn't work</p>
<p>-Scrolling doesn't work</p>
<p>-Type Cover's keyboard works</p>
<p>-Mouse cursor moves around fine and windows/icons under it seem to highlight</p>
<p>-Disabling and enabling the touchpad in the mouse settings ("Touchpad":ON/OFF)</p>
<p>-Upon enabling the touchpad again (as stated in the line above), the cursor acts as though it's dragging (noticed due to the button's switch slider following the cursor's movement). Same behaviour noticed on machine start-up on the upwards-sliding image
 part before the log in (I don't recall the accurate name for it)</p>
<p>-After I disabled tapping ("Allow taps in touchpad") and re-enabled it - tapping and scrolling now suddenly work, but actual clicking doesn't. By the time I finished writing this post, scrolling suddenly stopped working again. EDIT1: They stopped working
 again after I disabled and re-enabled it again trying to fix the scroll to work... EDIT2: They now randomly started working again after not touching my Surface for 2 minutes to answer a message on my phone.... this is becoming annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I've tried:</p>
<p>-Physically removing type cover and putting it back</p>
<p>-Reinstalling the type cover driver</p>
<p>-Multiple restarts</p>
<p>-Inserting a USB mouse - which luckily works and lets me work somewhat even if uncomfortably</p>
<p>-The Settings steps above</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to consistently fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Touchpad issues can be caused by several factors, and based on the steps you've mentioned, the problem should've been resolved. Something that works when not being used and don't work when you opt to use it is indeed annoying. Although, you may still haven't
 checked for driver updates, and we suggest that you follow the steps given by Oigobai on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfsearch/is-touchpad-two-finger-scrolling-not-working-for/ac4b7e1b-f31a-4d2a-abc6-ce4ec1e14129">
link</a>. Go to the <strong>Device Manager</strong> and see if you can find a triangle alert on one of devices concerning the Type Cover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your touchpad still works intermittently, we suggest that you reset your Surface. Click
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-ie/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-or-reset-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#resetW10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, and see steps under <strong>Reset your Surface</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: A reset returns the Surface to its factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A reset reinstalls Windows and apps that came installed on your Surface.</li><li>All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. For more information on backing up your files, click
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
</li><li>After a reset, you’ll be able to set up Surface as if it were brand new. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and if you have any additional concerns, please let us know.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I suggest you create a Windows 10 installation media on a USB flash drive (8 Go min) from this website after careful reading of the instructions on it. 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then connect the W10 installation USB flash drive to your PC, next start your PC and immediately press the required key (see note (1) at the end of the message) to access the boot menu and select the USB flash drive to boot on it. 
<br />You will choose Repair option.
<br />
<br />The access key to the boot menu depends on the manufesturer and model of your PC, look at the list below 
<br /><a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-get-access-bios-settings-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>

            Hi Adrian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models:

<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>   from the Command Prompt if necessary in Repair Mode:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt, Startup Repair or System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />Press the "Windows" + "R" keys. Write: wsreset
<br />Wait for the Store to close automatically and verify again.
<br />Finally run the problem solver for Windows applications which repairs several errors that can be found in the system.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />In case the failure persists, make a clean start, to check if it is a program that is affecting or intervening in the Store. To carry out this process, follow the steps of the following link: How to make a clean start.
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />As a recommendation, remember to keep the computer protected against possible threats of malicious software, performing an analysis with your antivirus. If you have Windows Defender active which would be ideal, you can verify the following information: Protect your computer with Windows Defender.

<p><strong>Hey!</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;This just started happening recently.... My desktop background keeps reverting to black. I choose a theme... after a few minutes or if i'm installing or working on something it reverts back to a black background without my consent. It's quite annoying
 because I have to right-click and go to personalization and change it again.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank You. =)</strong></p>

    <title>Windows 10 build 1607 Cortana search and Modern apps not allowing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentm_tech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 build 1607 Cortana search and Modern apps not allowing input from keyboard</h2>
                    <p>We have several computers that have been imaged with Windows 10 build 1607 with latest patches; the Cortana search box, Edge browser URL box, and any modern apps will not allow keyboard input.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can copy and paste text with a mouse into the boxes or apps, but the keyboard will not allow input.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The keyboard works fine in all other applications.&nbsp; We have been searching for answers but can't find any that work, similar issues posted from around 2015 but none of the solutions work.&nbsp; Nothing showing in the system logs as an issue, re-register Cortana
 and apps using PowerShell, checking the&nbsp;services service, running procmon to find anomalies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wondering if anyone is experiencing the issue or&nbsp;has found a solution to this issue.&nbsp; In our environment with several thousand PCs with the same image, it is random
 and not all of them affected.&nbsp; Thank you</p>

            Hi, we also had this issue with several of our devices too, where the Start menu and the Action center would not work.&nbsp; If you click on it, the system would do nothing.&nbsp; I ended up using Process Monitor to trace it to the ShellExperienceHost.exe giving
 access denied&nbsp;issues on the registry and found the "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES" group was missing in the registry for the HKCR registry hive and permissions not being set.&nbsp; We used Group Policy to push the registry settings to correct this particular issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Unfortunately for us, this issue is something different than the original Start Menu issue we had.&nbsp; This one I haven't been able to pinpoint what is causing it yet.&nbsp; Strange thing is that we can copy and paste text into the apps with the mouse, but we can't
 use the keyboard to enter text, almost like a security policy disabling input on modern apps.

            Unfortunately that is not the case here.&nbsp; I have some imaged from early October without the KB that are problematic and ones that do have it, which are also being problematic.&nbsp; It is frustrating though, given the number of blogs and posts with this issue
 that are on the web and Microsoft doesn't have a clear resolution.&nbsp; I did find when I boot to Safe Mode with networking support the Search/Cortana works.&nbsp; Thought maybe it was a Firewall issue but no luck there.

    <title>General Info about Pen Drive Use After Media Creation Tool Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> triohaydos  say:</h3>
<h2>            General Info about Pen Drive Use After Media Creation Tool Setup</h2>
                    <p>So I recently used the Media Creation Tool 1803 to create a Clean Windows Installation Drive in my Pen drive. At the end, it formatted my pen drive and put all the necessary files; no problems here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a lot of free space in my pen drive, so my question is:<strong> Can I use it
</strong>(without creating any installation problems in the future) <strong>or is that free space completely gone</strong> (and the only way to use it would be to format/delete the drive/files respectively)? If yes, then can I put all the windows installation
 related files <strong>in a new folder</strong> (Let's see, renaming it "Windows Installation Files") and will my computer still be able to
<strong>read that when I try to install Windows from the BIOS</strong>?</p>

            Hi Trio,
<br />
<br />What you can safely do is create a new folder on that drive and use that to store your files on that drive
<br />
<br />That new folder will not interfere with the bootable installation on that pen drive and should you ever need to boot from that drive, the new folder would be ignored and the boot process would be successful.
<br />
<br />You cannot move the Installation files into another folder, the pen drive would then not boot . . .

<p>Hi BittanSwerin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give us the <strong>exact </strong>Skype version <em>(not new, recent or latest)
</em>installed on your device? </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you can usually adjust the brightness, hue and other webcam settings using the program that comes installed during the driver installation. Just navigate to "Webcam Settings" and adjust the "Brightness," "Contrast," "Color Intensity," "White
 Balance" and other video settings of the webcam. The changes should automatically sync to your Skype app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Network visibility and access.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Why is it that both of my computers, a laptop and a desktop, can sometimes see the other and connect to it but at other times they cannot and what can
 I do to prevent the loss of&nbsp;access?&nbsp; I have a hard wired&nbsp;high speed Ethernet LAN connected to my desktop, Internet router, an all in one printer and two 1TB network drives&nbsp;and a wifi connection to my laptop.&nbsp; Both Internet connections generally seems to work
 and any failures are probably due to the Internet service providers server problems.<span>&nbsp;</span>Printing, scanning and FAX generally seem to work over the network.<span>&nbsp;</span>Both computers run Windows 7.&nbsp; The desktop uses 32 bit Professional
 and the laptop 64 bit Home Premium.&nbsp; I have set up all my files on both computers to be shared by all my LAN users and&nbsp;I have set up both computers with the same homegroup and with discovery turned on.&nbsp; I have also mapped all the network drive partitions&nbsp;on
 both computers&nbsp;and each computers drive&nbsp;partitions&nbsp;on the other. &nbsp;I have no public access files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use CA Internet Security but these problems seem to be unaffected if the firewall is turned on or off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both computers can see all the desktop drive partitions
 and all the network drive&nbsp;partitions even when both Windows Explorer screens claim not to see the other computer or the network drives under the Network section of Windows Explorer.&nbsp; The desktop can see all the&nbsp;laptop drives but cannot always access the root
 directory or laptop libraries.&nbsp; The laptop can generally access the root directory and libraries on the desktop.&nbsp; The only drives neither can see are removable drives&nbsp;when removed as one would expect.&nbsp; These drives are visible when installed, though the desktop
 often cannot&nbsp;see its own removable drive even when it is installed.<span>&nbsp;</span>What is going on?</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

            Hi Mike,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable the security software and the internet firewalls including the windows firewall on the laptop and try to access the drives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>NOTE: </strong>Do not forget to enable the security software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn Windows Firewall on or off</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also run the troubleshooter to see if it helps in fixing the issue.<br />
1. Click Start button, click Control Panel. <br />
2. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. <br />
3. Under Network and Internet, click Access shared files and folders on other computers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            It appears that there is no driver for any Windows version later than XP.&nbsp; You can try installing the driver in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
