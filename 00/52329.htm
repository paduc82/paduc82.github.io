<h2>            Canon Pixma MG2500 series</h2>
                    <p><strong>I would appreciate it VERY MUCH if anyone can help me with this issue.&nbsp; I'm getting so frustrated I could scream!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have Windows 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've been using this printer for over a year now.&nbsp; All of a sudden I get a new computer and it was working fine when I set it up on the new computer.&nbsp; All of a sudden, for some reason, I cannot imagine, it doesn't print.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SO, I proceeded to go to the Add A Printer put in all the right information, but here's my dilemma.....</strong></p>
<p><strong>The block came up and in the field where the printer was listed, it was a printer I had discarded and got a new one which is the Canon Pixma MG2520.&nbsp; MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THIS:&nbsp; I CANNOT GET INTO THE FIELD WHERE I CAN CHANGE THE NAME TO MY NEW PRINTER..
 &nbsp; Anyone can tell me how to do this is a smart one in my book.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks, Harriet</strong></p>

<p>Hi, Harriet.<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern regarding on how you will be able to change the name assigned to your printer, you will need to locate its own interface/properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access it will depend on the printer's make and model. The most accurate guide on how you can do this is by referring to the manual or contacting the printer manufacturer's support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All the bests. </p>

<h2>            &#34;Collecting info&#34; shut downs crashes. Am I the only one with this problem&#63;</h2>
                    EVERY new update brings the same thing...they won't install and shuts my computer down. I have to reboot over and over and over till it works again. Today it took 14 reboots till it worked again. I do the "hide update" thing for every update. Just about
 the time I get the machine running OK again...another update crashes it and the same problem starts all over again. NO...I have NO third party anything anymore because they all seem to conflict with 10. I'm pure win 10 now. So this problem makes no sense.
 Anyway...just letting you know.

            <p>Thanks for the reply. My "hide updates" is what I was referring to in your "fix problems." Yes...I have to do that with EVERY update. But the "collecting information" blue box crashing always comes with every new update. It would be OK if it actually did
 collect and restart but it never does. It only crashes my CPI and leaves me with no image so I have to hard boot sometimes up to 14 times before it clears and starts working again. Why can't the collecting info at least give you a warning so you can save work
 and then let it do what ever it is that it is suppose to be doing? It looks like this has been a problem going back to win 7. But I never had it till my win 10 install.&nbsp; This machine started with 7 and has had 8 8.1 and now 10. I did the complete install to
 try and fix it but it still does the same thing. I know all these power boots are hard on the system but this little E machine is one tough ****. LOL.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info but I have been doing this "fix" for about a year now. </p>

            Thanks Gino. But I have been using the troubleshooter after each new update that can never load...nun of them(I call it the hide thing) and I run the sfc/scannow about every other week. My 8.1 was corrupted and sfc/scan would not fix it. That was the reason
 I went to 10. Scannow has never found anything wrong with 10. I have found that I don't have the reboot problem if I use sleep mode. But the flashing on button is really bright (my putter is in my bedroom.) Oh well...I have been dealing with crap since my
 first 286...guess I will survive this also. I hope... <br />

<p>&nbsp;My error. The onscreen does work, but the touch screen minimizes after each letter is touched. &nbsp;This only happens in the citrix/epic environment. &nbsp;It works fine in all other apps. &nbsp;It was working for 2 months w/o a problem. &nbsp;I didn’t change anything except
 a windows update, which i reversed w/o it helping. &nbsp;Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Any other thoughts?</p>

</p><p>You mentioned that the D drive should default as a cdrom/rw/DVD/etc drive, but I've had D drives in the past that aren't DVD/CD drives. Just to clarify, the D drive is a second internal HDD.</p>

 Also, I'm not sure why you're suggesting I can create a new partition to C: I'm just trying to get my D drive to show up in the Recycle Bin Properties so I can delete files to the Recycle Bin. Unless I'm not understanding your instructions....can you please
 clarify?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question about Xbox One uptime. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Question about Xbox One uptime.</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Xbox One for two months, and so far I haven't had a single problem, no complaints here. I do have one question though, how long is too long for it to be on and in use? I use it all the time, pretty much all day. When i'm not playing games I use
 it to watch TV, Netflix, and all of the other video streaming services. I basically use it as a gaming device and a glorified cable box. Is it dangerous to have it on and in use so much, should I give it a break and just use my real cable box, or am i just
 being paranoid and need to relax?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not like it's a biological life form like we are. We need rest and breaks. Machines don't normally require it if they have good ventilation. Xbox 1 also has an energy efficient low power SoC micro-architecture AMD 8 core Jaguar APU. And it is designed
 big with lots of large vent holes and one big internal cooling fan to keep the console more than well ventilated. Tests also show that Xbox 1 uses less electricity and has a lower internal temperature when running multiple applications and a game, than the
 competition, since GDDR5 is more power hungry than DDR3. Turning it off before going to bed and when not in use does help save some money on your power bill. &nbsp;Microsoft even tested the Xbox 1's wireless controller. Each button on the controller is capable
 of being pressed 2 million times. It's in a Youtube video where Major Nelson shows you around Xbox HQ.

<p>If the hype is to be believed, I'm pretty sure there was an article before launch where MS said it was designed that it could be left on 24x7 for 10 years without hardware failure.</p>
<p>But that could just be PR, and not including hardware defects.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was designed to last for 10 years, even on the entire time, it's always a good idea to shut down your entertainment devices when not in use, and the Xbox One is no exception.</p>

                    I downloaded the "new Skype" yesterday and cannot access the share screen option.&nbsp; The additional list of dissatisfied customers on the blog makes it clear that this release was not completely tested.&nbsp; For a desktop application it is really slow.&nbsp; I use
 Skype throughout the day and trying to figure out what a developer thinks is logical is forcing me to go to Zoom.

            Hello Joel<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to retu

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hello, I understand that you are having some problems. You may need to try changing the default app for opening photos. Go to settings, go to Applications, and click on Default apps. Then find choose default apps by file type and find .png. Select that and click on paint. This should solve the issue. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

            Hi Vee.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like Explorer has been set to Dark Mode as shown here:  <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-now-has-a-usable-dark-theme-for-file-explorer-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg. My color scheme is already dark and changing it didn't have any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@RyoTakagi - I can see white background in Paint and Photoshop but that doesn't change the background color in explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many threads complaining of this issue, why is Windows not fixing it?</p>

            Ok I see your screenshot now, that it's the icon background and not Explorer as you'd said.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the icon cache:

            Next Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br /> -----------------
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<p>I have some more clues about this. Turns out the black background only occurs when the files are in OneDrive folder. If I move them to a regular folder they look fine. The images are available offline in the OneDrive folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar issue occurs with font files too. In OneDrive they don't show any preview ('Abg' text doesn't show) but moving them to any other folder shows the preview.</p>

<p>Hi Fositu,</p>
<p>Let's make sure you have the license of the game. You can go to this link below and see if you can see the license.</p>
<p><a href="http://account.xbox.com/en-US/MyGames?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.xbox.com/.../MyGames</a></p>
<p>If not, I'll assume that you're using an Xbox One with the latest preview version. You should go to this link below to check for further solution.</p>

<h2>            How do I bypass Windows Resume Loader&#63;</h2>
                    I have a windows 7 desktop pc. I use a Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse. Yesterday after finally getting my desk I unplugged the remote for the kb/mouse, plugged it back in &amp; it needs to be encrypted again.&nbsp; After looking on my sister's laptop to remember
 how, I'd manually turned off my pc since the keyboard doesn't work. When turned it on, the "windows resume loader" screen came up. How can I bypass this screen? Plz remember, I do NOT have a keyboard or mouse that works. Thx!!!

<p>Use a wired keyboard to get around your issue - going into Safe Mode possibly will fix it.</p>

    <title>Support in windows 7 for laserjet 6l - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxgunnerxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support in windows 7 for laserjet 6l</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've been trying to install my oldie but goldie printer which is a Laserjet 6L thorugh a Jetdirect 300x which is connected to my router via ethernet.<br />
<br />
I have tried to add the printer in via both the local and network route without success.<br />
<br />
The problem I seem to have is that apparently there should be a button labelled "Windows Update" on the popup, but no matter what I try I can never get this button to appear.<br />
<br />
I have tried going in as administrator, dropping security down etc etc nothing.<br />
<br />
Several web sites show pictures of this button, mine never appears.<br />
<br />
I have ran the windows upgrade option, windows states it is fully up to date.<br />
<br />
I have tried to download from HP but their site states that the drive is available thru the windows 7 update route, which it isn't.<br />
<br />
The driver does not appear in the known list.<br />
<br />
I have tried getting the driver through Microsoft update catalog route, I find a CAB file with a hplj6l.gpd file in it but have no idea what this is or how to use it?<br />
<br />
just to remind you i hvsve NO windows update button on my add printer dialog, either local or netwaork<br />
<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP ME!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            When it comes to Microsoft Properties, Google is second class. So, what you should be doing is adding Gmail as a connected account to your Microsoft Account. So, if you want to sign into Windows 10 with your Gmail account, you will have less frustration.

            <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on launch day and have had this same error code many...many...many times.&nbsp; I have updated all my drivers and software from the device OEM (Asus) and still the problem continues.&nbsp; It always happens when I am using the Wacom pen provided
 with the tablet (Asus Vivotab Note 8).&nbsp; Usually, this is when I am in Onenote, Bamboo Paper, and Book Creator.&nbsp; Never had this issue before and it is getting very annoying.&nbsp; Nothing worse than getting half-way through a lengthy note during a meeting and I
 get the blue screen followed by my tablet restarting.&nbsp; As a side note, I also did a clean install so there should not have been any issues with the install.&nbsp; Besides this, I am really digging Windows 10 even though I really did like Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Any suggestions
 or word on a future patch would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            BulldogXX's suggestion should work for you. But in case, it doesn't work, your Windows installation may need a repair. 
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run SFC Scan &amp; DISM

<br />
<br />2. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Turned out to have nothing to do with Microsoft, it was the Dell Display Manager defaulting to the most stupid default the developer could of made it. All I had to do is turn it off and now it works like windows have always worked for the last hundreds
 of years :)&nbsp; why you would make any product default any other way is just nuts.

that question is best researched on a trusted software review site like Cnet.com. Do a search on reviews for that software and look at what is said about it.<br />

            Hi Andreas,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />It looks like you installed version 1903 which has a known issue of Night light not working(Xbox game pass is only available on 1903)
<br />
<br />Gamma ramps, color profiles, and night light settings do not apply in some cases
<br />Microsoft has identified some scenarios where gamma ramps, color profiles and night light settings may stop working.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-1903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/releas...</a>
<br />
<br />Please wait until Microsoft fixes it.

<p>Hi Andreas, I had the same problem after upgrade my Windows 10 to the 2019 update. The solution I found is very simple:<br />
<br />
1. Go to Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Device Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Uninstall the Monitor (generic) drive</p>
<p>4. Reboot&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me and now I can finally use Night Light option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way... thanks Microsoft -.-</p>

</p><p>I had windows 8 installed in my system, but for some issue I wanted to format and re-install the same. I had 3 disk partition (C, D, E). Now during setup I deleted C &amp; D partitions and made 1 un-allocated space. When I tried to make a new partition on that
 un-allocated space, it is showing an error - "We couldn't create a new partition. [Error: 0xf723bcd0]". And I can't delete the E: disk also as it has my important data. What can I do?</p>

            You have to first&nbsp;uncheck the recycle bin in the "Show or hide common icons on the desktop" menu, then click apply. After you have done that, you need to go back into the "Show or hide common icons on the desktop" and then check it again. This is what
 worked for me: ;)

                    My new PC is running windows 8 (64).&nbsp; I want to add a third-party font, which I used in XP/Vista etc, to Windows 8. I can find the /windows/fonts directory but can't copy my new .ttf file into it? Previous Windows had an 'Install font' option, as best
 I recall.How do you get a new .ttf file into this directory. Hope you can help?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Double Click on the Font and you will see the install option listed when you do that.
