<h2>            Unable to sign-in to Microsoft Band app on Android following change in security details</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I was advised a couple of weeks ago by Microsoft of potential dodgy activity on my account and that I should change my password (I think the activity was probably just me logging
 in from a work PC). So I did that (and I can't remember if I was also prompted to set something else up on security...).</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Ever since, I have been unable to log into my account on my Android phone and so now I can't get onto OneDrive and also my Microsoft Band 2 isn't syncing to the Microsoft Band app on my phone and I'm not
 receiving notifications etc. on it.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I can logon fine from Web/PC's</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">When I try to sign-in from one of the apps on my phone it goes away and doesn't come back - I'm presented with a totally blank screen..</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I have cleared the cache/data for the apps concerned. I have re-booted my phone. I have re-installed Microsoft Band. I have checked that I haven't go 2-step security setup on my account. I have removed a
 Microsoft/Outlook account from my phone (different one) - all to no avail!</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Can you please review my account security details and advise what I need to do to get this working again?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">It's very frustrating especially as my Band 2 is now not really working due to this.</span></p>

<h2>            Excel Lookup without sorting Table - Possible&#63;</h2>
                    Lookup requires that the table (lookup vector)&nbsp;be sorted&nbsp;by the lookup field (value).&nbsp; Is there a method or other formula that does not require the table to be sorted first?

<h2>            OneNote does not sync</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I started to have problems with OneNote 2013. First I got an error saying that one notebook (stored in OneDrive) could not sync: "We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE4020017)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors were associated to a particular section. Following: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-issues-when-you-can-t-sync-OneNote-299495ef-66d1-448f-90c1-b785a6968d45, I tried to open that notebook in OneNote online. That worked although I could
 not open the section. Then I copied all the pages in that section to a newly created section. This did not help either. now two sections could not sync. Then I decided so sort the pages in that section and distributed (moved) the pages among various notebooks
 and sections. Now several of my notebooks cannot sync..... :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I decided to close the notebook but now I cannot re-open it. it looks like all the data is still in OneDrive but i cannot sync the notebook to my local OneNote 2013 (windows 8) and also not to my ipad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating. anyone with a suggestion/solution to my problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Raul&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: after moving various pages around i ended up with several empty sections. I deleted these sections from various notebooks but these sections keep on re-appearing after a few secs.... :- S</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just noticed that there is something wrong with several of my notebook files stored in OneDrive. I wanted to make a back up of my notebooks by copying them to another location in OneDrive but the problematic notebooks cannot be copied... I hope that
 I did not loose any important file. I would appreciate receiving help from the Microsoft community to fix my issues. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I am using Microsoft Office 365 and have suddenly been having the same issues as Raul for notebooks on Onedrive. I am currently using Onenote Version 16.0.7070.2036 on Windows 10, but I think the problems were occurring before I updated my Onenote version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstall and reinstalling office, removing the old Onenote registry key folder (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OneNote), and using the web app. The problem sections cannot be synced or deleted, and any new notebooks that I
 create cannot be synced either, regardless of whether I create them on the computer or my ipad. I suspect this is a Onedrive issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there's any more information needed that can help with solving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Edwin</p>

            <p>Same problem here. This just happened today on multiple machines. After doing some troubleshooting steps, I've also concluded that this is a OneDrive issue because problematic notebook sections can't be opened via the web app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using OneNote since the first version and this is the first time I've ever considered migrating to another note platform. I have several years worth of notes and not being able to open a section even in the web app scares me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I'm using OneNote Home and Student 2016 version 16.0.7070.2033 on both my machines.</p>

</p><p>Sorry to read that you are having similar problems.</p>
<p>I hope that this is just a OneDrive glitch. it is indeed scary to think that I might have lost several years of notes....</p>

            <p>I'm also having the exact same issue today. I did a lot of work late last night, went to bed - and when I got up this morning I cannot access any of those notes either via OneNote or via OneDrive.&nbsp;

            <p>Same here. I'm using OneNote 2016 and 2013 on different computers (both Windows) and both seem to be affected. The Windows store app and the mobile app (android) are also affected.</p>
<p>I've tried everything that i can think of. I've cleared the cache, made new notebooks, deleted old ones, deleted pages, deleted sections, saved offline copies, re-synced offline copies to the Skydive, etc. Even copying the individual elements from the affected
 notebook to a new notebook resulted in the new notebook experiencing sync issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the notebook in OneNote online doesn't help much either. Strangely enough, if &nbsp;i play around with it enough I can get it to open the pages. Once i do get it open i can see all the content intact but if I try to modify it, the changes won't be synced.
</p>
<p>The desktop version also behaves like this. Sometimes I can get the pages to sync to the other app. This is usually slow and the "incomplete sync" error is displayed the whole time. After some time the sync error did disappear but once I clicked on the notebook,
 it tried to sync and the error reappeared. If I click off of it to another notebook the error would disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was watching my internet usage with task manager and i could see that it would sync for about 10 seconds then stop. I could then get it to continue to sync before it would stop again. Its almost like its timing out and stops syncing. I'm not sure if this
 is normal or if its even relevant to the issue. Thought i would just put it here if it helps to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried creating a new notebook and seeing if it syncs. For the most part, it can sync fine. It can even sync ink but it runs into issues when I either copy things from the affected pages into it or it seems to cause issues if I add tags like check
 boxes. Once the section gets a sync error I usually can't recover it. Even this is inconsistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some hope; I was able to recover one of my notebooks twice by deleting the affected sections. This was my main notebook which contained the Quick Notes section. Now it only contains that Quick Notes section and the sync error is gone. I'm reluctant
 to try too much with that section though because i fear that i might loose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss for what is going on. Hopefully this was just some glitch and it will be resolved soon.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've had exactly the same problem and mostly the same course of action as Raul, over the past 8+ hours:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- OneDrive OneNotes don't sync, but those on network shares do</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Deleted sections keep reappearing, even after emptying notebook's recycle bin</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Data has disappeared from desktop and web versions in the recovery process of trying to move to other OneNotes</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Now I have multiple problematic notebooks with bits and pieces of the original one</p>
<p>
</p><p>More such threads have cropped up, like this one I already replied to:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-onenote/onenote-failure-to-sync-and-not-problem-with/b555cae7-930e-4b22-b562-2679af94ca69</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of the client version or platform, it seems OneDrive is the common factor in all cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy if Microsoft could restore to the last properly sync'd version. Until then I've switched to manual sync and am not touching OneNote lest I lose more data.</p>

            <p>I have Onenote 2016. Last night one of my notebooks had a sync error (0xE4020017). When I went to the Onenote Online, the Notebook is there and all the section tabs work except one. When it is clicked nothing happens. There is not even an error
 notice. It will not open the content. All the other sections were fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as is the common practice with Onenote errors, I created a new section in my desktop version (labeled "archive"). That showed up in the cloud. I copied over the section. It worked. But later the "archive" section no longer works, except just
 before I wrote this review.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also renamed the affected section, section1. The name transferred but none of the content did. I just get the same error number on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a new notebook, add a new section, even write into a new page and it syncs. But when I copy files from the affected section (via an *older backup* so it *cannot be corrupted local backup files*) I get the sync error again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a quick repair to no avail. I have closed the entire notebook. And I have reopened that notebook's backup into a newly named notebook. The name copied to the cloud. The section name copied. I copied one section (instead of all of them)
 but the content is missing again. No error named in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ConnerTenn,</p>
<p>Interesting that you have found (part of) a solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly how did you delete the problematic sections? In OneNote online, in a local version on desktop or iPad?
</p>
<p>Did you do something with the local cache files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards from Belgium,</p>

<h2>            Project 2010 - Subtasks hidden when filter applied</h2>
                    I have an expenditure schedule that includes multiple projects handled by separate project managers.&nbsp; I want to be able to apply a filter the the project manager column and then print showing only the projects assign to that project manager.&nbsp; When I do
 this, the subtasks for the projects hide.&nbsp; I've tried (View, Outline, Show All), (View, Outline, Show Subtasks) and even manually clicking on the [+] box and [-] box beside each project.&nbsp; The +/- will toggle, but the subtasks will not show.&nbsp; I had no problems
 doing this in 2007.&nbsp; Any ideas what I'm doing wrong and how to make it work?&nbsp; Please reply.

            <p>I've been searching everywhere for an answer to this question, and this is the only mention of the problem that I've been able to find.&nbsp; A little worrisome that it hasn't been answered in over a year, but this was a very usefull feature that 2007 had.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate the issue, when a filter was applied&nbsp;in 2007 (e.g. show only incomplete tasks), we had the ability to use the +/- checkbox next to a specific summary task to first collapse (-) the filtered summary row, then expand (+) it to show all the subtasks
 (including the completed taks, or whatever filter was applied).&nbsp; In 2010, doing the +/- technique on a summary row maintains the filter for it's subtasks, and the only way I know of to show the filtered subtask is to show ALL subtasks and scroll back down
 to the task (hopefully noting the row number to make this an easier chore).&nbsp; This can be frustrating in a meeting filled with program managers who want quick information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be much appreciated, even if the answer is that this feature no longer exists.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            I hate to say this - but the feature no longer exists.&nbsp; In both Project 2010 and Project 2013 if you apply the Incomplete tasks filter you may still expand and collapse the summary task but the completed subtasks are hidden and will not re-appear until
 you remove the filter.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I had 2 Office 365 email accounts in my Windows Outlook 2016 desktop app. The primary email account was deleted as the domain no longer exists, but I needed to make my secondary account the primary account. Per Outlook, it said I couldn't change the primary
 account unless it was the last one left. Once I removed the secondary account, it wouldn't let me delete the primary account because it says it doesn't exist. Whenever I reload the Outlook app, it asks me to provide login credentials to the original primary
 account, but it no longer exists. I have no way of accessing my Outlook app now and it's this ridiculous feedback loop of error. Please advise. Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Sdgo123,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, you should use this account to active your Office suite. Please go to the Windows Credential Manger &gt; Windows Credentials &gt; delete the credentials with the word "ADAL" firstly.
 And then <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new profile</a> with your second Office 365 account. Note: you need set this new profile as the default one. If you login to Outlook client, please go to File &gt; Office Account &gt; Switch account to reset the primary account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please refer to the following article to check the issue on your side:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reset Office 365 ProPlus 2013 and/or 2016 activation state</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2015/05/01/how-to-reset-an-office-365-install-to-the-initial-activationinstall-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2015/05/01/how-to-reset-an-office-365-install-to-the-initial-activationinstall-state/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persist, in your case, we suggest you uninstall the Office 365 suite and reinstall it. And then using the second Office 365 account to active the new Office 365 suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

<h2>            VBA Code to compare .csv files in two folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to VBA and need help in creating a VBA code that would compare the .csv files in different folders, the files to be compared are matched by the file names(same name files need to be compared).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us assume we have two folders Folder A and Folder B, and each folder has 10 csv files with data. The files in both folders are same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>## Step 1##</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loop through each file in Folder A and compare its contents with the file with the same name in Folder B</p>
<p>
</p><p>## Step 2 ##</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the contents match, then a Line should be written to the "Match Summary" sheet in current workbook, that Files - "Filename" - Match</p>
<p>
</p><p>## Step 3 ##</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of contents mismatch, a&nbsp;Line should be written to the "Mis_Match Summary" sheet in current workbook, that "Files - "Filename" - Mis_Match</p>
<p>
</p><p>## Step 4 ##</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then move to next file and so on and write their match or mismatch summary in next lines</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have created the code to write data from all csv files from&nbsp;a folder to a single sheet, and compare the two sheets to yeild the results, but I need the above stated functionality to work</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for responding. I had seen your post helping a user setup the code to compare .prn files in different folders. Could you also help me setting up the requested functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I can't use WinMerge tool for my requirement is security concerns, downloading and using tools is not allowed in the environment I work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you or someone else&nbsp;could help in setting up the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Okay, you said "I have created the code to write data from all csv files from&nbsp;a folder to a single sheet", so I guess that you are able, resp. you have code to get the files.<br />

<p>Furthermore I can assume that you are able to write the names of the files into a sheet.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 and E71 bluetooth modem</h2>
                    
<p>How to create a dial-up connection with Windows 7 (x64 Ultimate), (Microsoft) Bluetooth and E71?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to create some connection manually as I did on XP. Didn't work, modem not responding.</p>
<p>When using PC Suite to create this connection it seems to do exactly the same just with other dialogs. Does not work, either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message is: cannot open COM3 (mapped to E71 bluetooth profile).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC Suite 7 works without problems so far (bluetooth only).</p>

<h2>            My phone doesnt roam when I need it to</h2>
                    <p>I live in Greece, and when I got my phone, I had a Greek SIM card. However, I went to Denmark, and due to the rip-off costs given to me by Vodafone, and the cheap phones in Denmark, I decided to exploit the no roaming fees in the Eurozone, and use my Danish
 SIM card in Greece. However, I seem to be unable to do this, as my phone shows no service in Greece, and I have concluded that my phone has a problem with Roaming.</p>
<p>I'm unable to find any option that can change where my SIM is from, and since all the setting in the Time and Language settings say that I'm from the US anyways, I dont think that can help.</p>

<p>okay, i will answer this to the best of my ability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had my roaming feature on in denmark, because my phone wouldn't accept that it was a local SIM card, and not one I'd brought along from Greece.</p>
<p>I haven't checked, but I assume my phone works with all SIM cards, because it worked in Denmark (with roaming on)</p>
<p>Roaming is allowed on my phone, and I'm unable to find a manual switch for roaming</p>

                    My laptop came with a trial version ot Office 2007.&nbsp; After the trial, I purchased Office 2010 and it has worked consistentely without a problem.&nbsp; Now, when I try to open an Excel file, a window pops up asking me for a product key for Office 2007 which
 I don't have.&nbsp; This happens even when I try to open the file through the shortcut to Excel 2010.&nbsp; 2007 only acts as a viewer and won't let me edit my files.&nbsp; When I looked at the programs, it shows that I purchased Office 2010 in 2011, but shows that 2007
 was downloaded in February 2012.&nbsp; How did this happen?&nbsp; How can I designate Office 2010 as my default?

            You should be able to access the files by opening Excel 2010 (or Word) from the Start menu and then using the File &gt; Open dialog.<br />
<br />
It appears you had an unused 2007 trial. It has become the default (possibly triggered by a Windows Update). You want to reset the windows default file associations to point to Office 2010.<br />
<br />
You want to uninstall 2007 using method 2 or 3 in this tip<br />

            Series 40 phones like the 5310 cannot run java apps over 1mb. It's a hardware/software limitation.<br />
<br />
Only S60 smartphones can use these large programs.

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
Help !! :(<br />
<br />
I need some help in installing applications on my 5310 phone. Everytime I try to download any compatible application (GMAIL, WIDSETS, Free Nokia stuff available for this phone), after downloading, I get "Invalid Application" error. I have tried various applications,
 small size applications, checked all security settings however I continue to get the same "Invalid Application" error.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate if anyone can give me some solution to this problem. I am a regular user of mobile applications and this error is driving me crazy. Prior to this I was using same applications on 6270 without any issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance in reading my post and trying to help me out :)

            I heard the this problem (file size too big) was fixed in S40 3rd edition, I have a Nokia 3110c which the 3rd edition S40, I am getting the same problem when I try install the oxford dictionary.<br />
<br />
Is there a work around to install software with bigger size.<br />
<br />
I have lots of space in my memory card, but the phone memory is limited.

            Is the file over 1mb is size?<br />
<br />
If so then it's impossible to run it on a series 40 phone. There is no way around it as it's a limitation of the operating system.<br />
<br />
Only S60 phones can run large java apps.

            Hai,<br />
<br />
The problem occurred for me too when I first tried to install a jar file. I am having Nokia 5310 from october 2007. I ahve a solution for this, Since now I have 11MB sized websters dictionary downloaded from sourceforge.net.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
<br />
Connect the mobile phone to PC using Datacable and select the mode as USB Storage. Then copy the necessary file into your memory card. Then remove the connection and open the file in phone. Thats all..... For some jar applications it will take some time to
 open.<br />
<br />
Note: There is no such limitation in Software size for Nokia Mobiles.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Reyas

            Hello friends, I need your help urgently. I have a Nokia 2700c and I need the answer of following questions serialwise : (1) Can Nokia 2700c be installed with Flash Player, PDF reader? If yes,then, how much memory size will it be covered? (2) In the internet
 advertisement, there is availability of PDF reader to be downloaded for Nokia 2700c with different memory capacities. Can that be downlaoded directly from the mobile? Can that be involved virus? (3) There is also internet advt for antivirus for Nokia 2700c
 to be downloaded. Can that be directly downloaded from the mobile? Can that antivirus itself be involved virus? PLEASE REPLY...

            What is the result coming in column 2?
<br />
<br />Is your column 2 formatted in Date format. If not, it will show numerical equivalent of date. 
<br />
<br />For example for 8-Feb-18, it will show 43139.
<br />
<br />If date is in text format, you can use following kind of formula -
<br />=--A2

<h2>            Formatting paragraph with hanging indent not doing anything</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to apply a hanging indent to text in a text box.&nbsp; I'm using Special &gt; Hanging (.7) in the Paragraph dialog box.&nbsp; It is not doing anything at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I <strong>want</strong> is for each paragraph in the text box to have a heading word and the text to wrap to the right, like a Hanging Indent works in Word.</p>
<p>Word1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the description in the text box, wrapping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at .7 inches.</p>
<p>LongWord:&nbsp; Here is another description in the text box, also<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrapping at .7 inches.</p>
<p>Is there some additional step I have to take, or will the text box in PowerPoint just not do this?&nbsp; I THOUGHT I used to do this in 2003, but I don't use PP that often and maybe I'm hallucinating.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for whatever help you can give me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did anything change on your system? In particular, did you do anything with fonts prior to the crashing behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there's a bad email. Can you use a web interface to get to your email account and delete any message that looks problematic that arrived or was sent about the time the crashes started?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try rebuilding the Outlook identity by holding the Option key down as you start Outlook.</p>

<p><span>Hi Marius Ioan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Which option did you select in OneNote when pasting the data? Please check the screenshot below for reference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdfd8969-2f22-4edc-9481-e4b7a421e886?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdfd8969-2f22-4edc-9481-e4b7a421e886?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tested on the same monthly channel version which you have and this is how it appeared when the content was copied from Excel and pasted to OneNote.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1144ad7-787e-44bf-ab3b-61c55ded555c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1144ad7-787e-44bf-ab3b-61c55ded555c?upload=true" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your screenshot, I suppose you used
<strong>Keep text only</strong> option. I’ll suggest you <strong>try Keep source formatting</strong> option when pasting the content.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19c3b1ea-1e8d-442d-8b98-2cc657e80bd8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19c3b1ea-1e8d-442d-8b98-2cc657e80bd8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>If something is misunderstood, please correct me.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Neha</span></p>

<h2>            using logic to copy a cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to use logic to automate a team table for a sports club and I understand how logic works but not how you "program it" in excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite simply I'd like the player name from the list on the left to copy down into the subs list if the cell in the games section is blank (or could be if it is zero, if that would make it simpler...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example</p>
<p>
</p><p>if sum cell c8&nbsp;(player 5 in game 1&nbsp;first half&nbsp;= zero then copy cell b8 to c15</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't know how to do this with excel logic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help and thank you in Advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Bernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the first response and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>whats the difference between the 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd&nbsp; like to be able to add a list of all the players and then assign them a team which breaks them out into separate sheets with substitutes automated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>
        </p>

            The only difference is that I hardcoded the 4 instead of using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ROW($C$4) - so if you insert a row above C4 then mine will break.</span>

<h2>             Outlook 2007 &#58; Stopped downloading Emails </h2>
                    
<p>The computer company that services my computer said it was a Microsoft issue.&nbsp; Microsoft was working on servers.&nbsp; If this is true, when can I expect Microsoft to have this fixed?</p>

<p>Microsoft's servers wouldn't have anything to do with Qwest.&nbsp; Do you get an error message?&nbsp; If so, what kind?</p>
<p>Is this a POP3 or IMAP account?</p>
<p>Does this happen even if you start Outlook in Safe Mode? (hold down CTRL while you click the icon) See if this helps:<a href="http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#safe</a></p>

            It is an IMAP account.&nbsp; Last Tuesday, a week ago, it just stopped downloading messages into my inbox.&nbsp; Have not tried starting in safe mode, but will give that a shot.&nbsp; Thx.
