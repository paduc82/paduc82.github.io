<h2>            CountIf for consecutive occurences of data pattern</h2>
                    
<p>I have the following:</p>
<p>Column A1: A5&nbsp;contains text values "Yes" or "No". I want a formula that will look into the range (A1:A5) and seek a pattern&nbsp;where there are 3 consecutive appearances of "Yes". Only if this pattern is found will the formula report a answer of "1", else an
 answer of "0" is reported. If any random occurences of "Yes" are found (anything less than 3x consecutive "Yes" answers) a "0" will also be reported. Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't see an A7 in Bernard's post...but then he has corrected a typo 2 minutes after the original post<br />
If your cells contain "Yes" rather than "yes" you should change his "yesyesyes" to "YesYesYes"</p>
<p>Otherwise you could do<br />
=IF(LEN(A1&amp;A2&amp;A3&amp;A4&amp;A5)=LEN(SUBSTITUTE(LOWER(A1&amp;A2&amp;A3&amp;A4&amp;A5),"yesyesyes","")),0,1)<br />
to be case-insensitive</p>

<h2>            I am always getting error 0x80070006 for store apps in my Lumia 640 xl running production ring Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been existing for a long time now. I am having a Lumia 640 XL dual sim(India) running Production build of Windows 10 mobile. I have provided details from "Extras &amp; Info" app (except for IMEI). I hope this will not be a personally identifiable
 detail, but rather may help you pinpoint the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to download a store app or when a already installed app is due for an update, it doesn't download or update but shows the error code 0x80070006. This specifically happens for those apps which are installed on the SD card. The apps which are
 installed on internal memory mostly installs and updates fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time, the phone boots up, it shows SD card error. Multiple times, I have tried letting the SD card troubleshooting run. But after several hours too, it doesn't finish, so I just have to skip it to save time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SD card that I am using in this phone is this model (Strontium Nitro 64GB 85MB/s UHS-1 Class 10 MicroSDXC Memory Card (SRN64GTFU1R)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, all other functions that uses SD card like Photos, other media files, games etc run just fine and face no problems.</p>

<p>1.Is your phone and apps up-to-date? Download all available updates.</p>
<p>2.Open store and cancel all pending/stuck app downloads/updates. Now do a soft rest(vol.down +power for ~10 sec.) and try again.</p>
<p>3.Remove the SD card and try the above step again. If that works, there's a problem with the SD card. Format the SD card and try again. Also make sure the SD card is genuine. I had issue like this and found out that my SD card was a fake one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer. Sorry for my late reply. I wanted to make sure that few days passes by before I answer so that I can be sure it is not a temporary issue.&nbsp; I had followed your steps of troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't make sure that the apps were uptodate as they wouldn't install anyway. But the OS was uptodate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleared all pending downloads and did soft reset. No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed my sd card and tried installing an app. But anyway internal apps did get installed previously too and it got installed now also. I then formatted my sd card and I also did full hard reset including internal memory and memory card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for a few days the problem got reversed. None of the phone memory apps would get installed and memory card apps got installed and updated just fine.&nbsp; Again after a week or so, the problem got reversed and now since then memory card apps are not getting
 installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my memory card using Amazon.in directly by Amazon fulfilled order. So in my opinion, there is less chance that it is fake. Defective maybe, but less chance to be fake. ( http://www.amazon.in/Strontium-Nitro-MicroSDXC-Memory-SRN64GTFU1R/dp/B00WGAU3O0
 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to "use" my memory card for all other purposes. I am able to store and view media like camera roll photos, store and view documents, use the many apps that luckily got already installed, store and listen to music etc. The only thing that doesn't
 work with this sd card is install or update apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me out on this? I am desperately looking for a solution.

            <p>Really weird. Was the issue present when your phone was on windows phone 8.1? Then download the Windows Device Recovery Tool on your PC and use it to do a complete reset of your phone. This will return the phone back to windows phone 8.1. Also do a full
 format of your SD card and start everything from afresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also let's try isolating the issue-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did the issue start after updating your phone to this build of windows 10 or was present before?</p>
<p>2. Remove the SD card or use a different one. Does the issue persist?</p>

<p>I did not have this issue when I was using Windows phone 8.1. It only started after upgrade to Windows 10. I have already tried doing full format of this sd card and this issue didn't go away. Infact, this is the second sd card in which I am having this
 same problem. In my previous sd card too, it was the same. Removing the sd card obviously is not making any difference because the apps are getting installed fine on the phone with or without the sd card. However, There is also no way to use Lumia 640xl without
 sd card as there is only 8gb internal memory, which is very less when we want many apps too.<br />

            File a report via the feedback app from your phone. Just to make sure, is enough free storage space available on your phone memory and SD card? Sometimes lack of free space causes a multitude of problems.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in February I managed to break the screen of my Nokia 928, now took it out of the drawer and decided to get all the media off of it - BUT in order to access the files on the phone I need to unlock the screen lock, which I cannot see cause the screen
 is not working and all black...<br />
Any ideas how to bypass the screenlock and get my files from the phone?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I disable microsoft security essentials integration with Outlook.</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, with no change to my PC, I started getting multiple copies of each email I received in HOtmail transferred to Outlook via outlook connector. I get a new copy everytime the computer scans the emails (about every 20 miniutes). One suggested
 cure is to disable my&nbsp;virus scanner's (microsoft security essentials)&nbsp;&nbsp;integration with Outlook. How exactly do I do this?</p>

            <p>As far as I'm aware MSE does not integrate with Outlook, unlike most third party AV programs</p>
<p>It would be unusual for MSE to be set to scan every xx minutes, the std, default,&nbsp;MSE schedule is to scan weekly at 02:00, of course you may have set a different schedule.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I was not referring to MSE scanning every x minutes. It is outlook connector that sends over emails from hotmail every x minutes. Until a few days ago, it would only forward new emails not ones previously sent. Suddenly, it starting sending ones
 that it had previously sent as well. Thus, at the end of a day I will have 20 to 50 copies of the same email.</p>

            I figured out how todisable it. That was NOT the problem. Still getting repeated copies of each and every email.

<h2>            Microsoft Update offering updates for CTR installation</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2013 Professional which appears to be a Click2Run installation:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/278c7e3c-6c25-4fc5-ac4e-dff5308a345b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>More or less simultaneously with the update to the build shown, Windows Update presented two "important" updates for Office 2013:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>On the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2883060/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2883060 page</a>, I&nbsp;read that
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><span>This update applies to the Microsoft Installer (.msi)-based edition of Office 2013. It does not apply to the Office 2013 Click-to-Run editions such as Microsoft Office 365 Home.
</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">They are hidden for the time being, because three questions arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will I break something if I install these two important updates which are not intended for CTR installations?</li><li>Will I&nbsp;miss out on&nbsp;something if I don't install these two important updates offered by Windows Update?</li><li>Why is Microsoft Update offering updates for an installation that apparently shouldn't be having any?</li></ol>
<p><em>Supplementary question: where do questions about Office Update belong? This question isn't about installing, upgrading or activating Office but about updating it.</em></p>

            <p>Hello Noel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description provided, in spite of having C2R installation of Office, you have been offered updates for MSI installation of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if you had installed any other version of Office previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check if you have any other Office versions listed under Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You may receive error and unable to install the click to run Office updates or even though you were able to install the updates, it will not affect the MSI installation of Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You will not miss out or lose anything by installing or not installing the click to run Office updates if you have MSI installation of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This might be an issue if you had any click to run of Office version installed on the computer previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, reply and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I've not come across any CTR version previously. I did have a trial of Office 2013 installed before this, installed by
<strong>professionalplus_en-us_x86.exe</strong>, which I take to be a (625MB) self-extracting MSI cabinet. It had&nbsp;build no. 15.0.4128.1014.&nbsp;<em>
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I retained Office 2003 because of its preview handler, which was missing from Office 2007.

<p>Similarly if you can try SIM from Other Operator in Nokia 500. Because its something wierd for the Phone to detect that you are out of Home network.. It should be the work of the Network ..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, welcome to our new posters!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While using a network abroad as a guest because your carrier has an arrangement with that carrier to support you while being in range of their network is roaming your would also be roaming if your carrier does not have a network of their own and are using
 another companies network to provide their services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of this would be the UK carrier GiffGaff who are on the O2 network. They are in fact roaming on that network. Depending on how your carrier has set this up they will appear to your device as either a guest or as a 'home user' of the network. You
 will usually notice this by the way the connection is identified. You see either the name of the host or the name of your own carrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you are actually roaming in these situations just allow roaming options and you'll be fine. In this situation you would not incur additional cost for this. Important in this case would be to make sure you disable roaming when traveling abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, let us know if you have any further questions.</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<p>1. What version of Internet Explorer is currently installed? Do you have an&nbsp;iexplore(exe) file in the IE folder at [C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer] ?</p>
<p>2. The ITBar7Height value is a normal registry value. It will be recreated on restart. See the post by Ramesh Srnivasan

<p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, we would suggest you keep the latest version of Office, the latest version now should be 16.16.1. Turn off the wifi, launch app, re-turn on the wifi to see if you can update the Office without crash issue.</span></p>
<p><span>After updating the app, check whether you can launch the app when wifi is turned on.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please try to go to<span> move the folder to the desktop:&nbsp;<strong>~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.&lt;word/Excel/PowerPoint&gt;
</strong><span>to see the result.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please tell us the information below:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue happen to all Office apps? Or only a specific one?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was there anything changed before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, to check if the issue is related to startup app or any third-party, please try rebooting your system in safe boot to see the result:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The white Apple logo appears on your display.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Release the shift key when you see the logo window. If your startup disk encrypted with FileVault, you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Launch Office in safe boot to see if the app still crashes</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rena</span></span></p>

<h2>            keyboard does not appear</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just discovered that when I tap the bar to write a name in the phone book, or search an address in the net the keyboard does not show up. For the keyboard to show up when I need to write something I must go to airplane mode and only then it comes to
 view.I tried rebooting but in vain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

 thing I can do is close Word and restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter which help topic I am trying to access, the same Script Error window comes up ... the same Char: error, the same "Permission denied," the Code may change from 9 to zero, but the url given is always the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried copying/pasting the URL (that comes up in the Script Error window) into my browser hoping the URL would lead me to the answer I seek, or at least an option to find the answer ... but all I get is a full screen of html code (a source code).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to correct this? I am somewhat afraid to download the free software that comes up online when I search as I don't want to take a chance at messing up my computer and what I have going for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or answers anyone can give me, I'd sure appreciate. I've done a lot of research on this and cannot find answers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<h2>            MS Project 2013 reports cost remaining reporting</h2>
                    Hope someone can help me with this.&nbsp; I have a project that has been created with various stages and milestones.&nbsp; some of the payment milestones are linked to tasks within different stages and therefore making it difficult to report on total costs incurred
 and cost remaining by billable milestone.&nbsp; I have created milestones and linked them to the relevant tasks, and can calculate the required cost field by manually adding up the values listed against each task, but can obviously not use the totals in the stages
 as these include costs for various other milestone grouping.&nbsp; Is there a way by exporting or creating a link to an excel document where I can then use a formula to generate this information, or a new method in MS Project (such as the new reports function)
 to generate this information?

            <p>I understand from your description that situation is this. You have tasks scattered throughout the plan, and within a particular set of tasks all have a common successor which is a milestone signifying a payment (income, the opposite of a cost). When all
 of the tasks in the set are finished, the milestone can occur and you can get paid.</p>
<p>.. Or, when some of the tasks in the set are finished, or at least started and have some actuals, then you want to be able to see the actual cost and the remaining cost for each task as well as the actual cost and remaining cost sub-totaled for the entire
 set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what you do. Use a spare custom field, a text field will do, say text1. Insert that column. Put some kind of common identifier in that column for all of the tasks in a particular set. Then make a custom group, and group on that field. Show the cost
 table, and you have the sub-totals for actual and remaining cost.</p>
<p>No need for EXCEL, and there is nothing new in this, it is just the same old thing.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2-level equation numbering with optional 3rd level</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to number equations including the chapter number, but I also want to be able to include a 3rd level of numbering (for example when an equation has two or more branches):</p>
<p>Chapter Number. Equation Number. 2nd Equation Number (a,b,c)</p>
<p>1.1</p>
<p>1.2</p>
<p>1.3a</p>
<p>1.3b</p>
<p>1.3c</p>
<p>1.4</p>
<p>1.5</p>
<p>1.6a</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to set 2 level numbering and I know how to set 3 level numbering. However I don't know how to combine them in one setting, so that the 3rd level is optional.</p>
<p>It's very common in math textbooks, but I don't know how to achieve this.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Dear Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for taking the time to help me. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I not sure I understand what I have to do. Maybe it's because I am in panic right now, since I am running out of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have a look at the picture I uploaded in order to see what is the result that I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the chapter number, followed by the number of equation which resets to 1 in every new chapter, for example (1.1) (1.2) (1.3) (1.4) (2.1) (2.2) (2.3) (2.4).</p>
<p>Sometimes though, when I have a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">set</span> of similar equations (for instance, like the two possible results of the quadratic formula x1=(b^2-sqrt(D))/2a and x2=(b^2+sqrt(D))/2a), I want them to have the same equation
 number, for example (1.2), followed by an alphanumeric character (a,b,c etc) to distinguish between them, so that the set of equations will be like: (1.2a) (1.2b) (1.2c) etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in a general context it will be like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>(1.1) (1.2) (1.3a) (1.3b) (1.3c) (1.4) etc</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>(2.1) (2.2a) (2.2b) (2.2c) (2.3) (2.4) etc</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want this functionality to be dynamic, so that if I move an equation (or set of equations) to another chapter, it will be able to update correctly when I type Ctrl+A and press F9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I want to be able to create a table of all the equations, like when I do list of Figures, or Tables etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you so much for your time.</p>

<p>Hi again Doug,</p>
<p>I did it! I followed your instructions and the numbering works just like I wanted!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, whenever I bookmark an equation number and cross reference it, it always comes with the equations.</p>
<p>Even on the table of equations. How can I isolate the numbering, without the equation?</p>

<p>Ok, but your workaround is still better that the two options that I currently have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>either do the work with only two level numbering, without using the optional 3 level (a,b,c etc)</p>
<p>or having to do all the work manually without any sort of automation and type the numbering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent you an email with the document, so that you inspect it and identify what I am doing wrong and the referencing doesn't work as I would like it to.</p>

</p><p>For the remaining two users, trying to add the calendar causes Outlook to freeze and hang. We have waited as long as an hour for Outlook to respond, but the calendar never adds. Eventually it is necessary to use task manager to end task on Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Get-MailboxFolderStatistics, I can see that the user created calendar is a subfolder of the owner's Calendar folder.<br />
By using "Get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity username:\Calendar\sharedCalendar", I have verified that the permissions to the calendar are set identically for all six users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding the folder visibility permission to the root calendar folder for one of the users. I have tried removing the permissions, then resending the share invitation. The two affected users are still unable to open this calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All users are running Office 2013 on Windows 10. What can be done to allow these users access to this calendar?</p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the issue, we'd like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are they using a Microsoft account or other email domain account?</li><li>Does this issue persist to other shared calendar? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information about your shared calendar, you can check this article:

<ul>
<li>All accounts are Office365 accounts on the same tenant.</li><li>I have tested this by sharing a calendar from my mailbox to the affected users. The symptom was the same. When trying to add the calendar, Outlook will hang (Not responding) for a very long time. After forcing Outlook to close and then re-opening, the shared
 calendar appears in the list in the left hand panel in calendar view. Clicking the check box to add it to the view causes Outlook to hang and become unresponsive again.</li></ul>

Shared calendar access</a> indicates that the calendar being shared may be available but will be read only. It seems that this should affect all users who access the calendar. In my case, only two of the five users connecting to the calendar have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the users was able to add the calendar by selecting the checkbox, then leaving Outlook in the not responding state while they were away from the computer. Over an hour later, when they returned to the PC, the calendar had added to Outlook.

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To identify if it’s a permission issue or a client issue, you may try configuring the problematic user’s account in a normal user’s computer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you may try using PowerShell commands to assign permission to these two users to if you can get any updates.</p>
<p>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar -User *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -AccessRights Reviewer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this issue only happened to two users, please cheek if there is any difference between them and other four users such as client version, Cached Exchange/ Online mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, can you provide the detailed version of this affected user’s Outlook client and OS so that we can do more tests to see if we can reproduce this issue?</p>

    <title>map field names in table-A to field names in table-B - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron allard  say:</h3>
<h2>            map field names in table-A to field names in table-B</h2>
                    table-A is imported from a spreadsheet. To protect against the column names not matching up with the field names in table-B, I wanted to be able to list the column names imported and have the ability to indicate which of the field names in table-B it should
 match up with. my thought was to generate a table-C which contained&nbsp;two fields. One with the Table-A name and another&nbsp;which contains the column name&nbsp;that would be loaded (from a select list) with the field name it relates to in table-B by the user. Then to
 have a VBA procedure that renames the fields in table-A to the correct spelling so that an append query would stick the new data in the correct fields of table-B.

            <p>Will this be a routine operation? Will the fieldnames be changing all the time? You could certainly create such a table, and write some VBA code to generate the SQL for your append query, but it sounds like a lot of work for not much benefit! Why not just
 LINK to - rather than import - the spreadsheet, and have an Append query appending (say} [Last Name] to [Surname], or whatever mapping is needed? If the fields don't match, you can then edit this Query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it would NOT be necessary or appropriate to rename the fields in TableA. By default Access will try to append to the matching fieldname, but you can easily override the default.</p>

            <p>So let me get this straight, you get a spreadsheet which may or may not have different column headings then the field names in the Access table. Do the column heading change? is this a recurring import?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As John said, unless the names change from time to time, create a canned Append query and link to the spreadsheet. So all you will need to do is run the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I had a similar situation. A client would get order data from different sources. The data would include a customer name and address, what was ordered etc. Since the spreadsheets came from different sources, the data might not be using
 the same column headings or order etc. So I built functionality into their app that allowed them to select an input file (could be txt, cvs, xls or some others). Once selected the file was linked and they could review the data. Then a list of the "fields"
 was displayed and they could choose the fields they wanted to import. They could even add fields that weren't in the linked file (i.e. a rep's name). Next they got to match field. Each field in the import file was assigned a number and the user would enter
 that number against the corresponding fieldname in the destination. Once completed, a SQL statement was generated to append the data. This worked very well and I even had a feature to save the configuration if they got the same file from that source.</p>

            These spreadsheets will be coming in daily from 9-12 field reps. They should be using the spreadsheets as given to them but experience shows that someone always changes something or reorders them or something. I should be able to lock the field names on
 the spreadsheet and be safe but again someone always figures out a way to mess it up.

            <p>Frankly, in that situation I would inform all sales rep that they must not change the spreadsheet format or the spreadsheet will be returned to them to fix. If the problem persists it will result in disciplinary action.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A great way to tackle this problem is to import the sheet into a temp table (which will have the spreadsheet column names).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to “translate” the fields and move the data into the production table, simply use a append query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The beauty of this is you don’t have to write code and the append query lets you set up a query with the fields translated from one name to another</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5afcb156-c236-4de0-a9a3-72ab0f6934de" /></p>
<p><br />
Note how the “from” and “to” fields can be set. And even better is you get a nice drop down. So no hand coding etc. is required to do this field translation – all done with the mouse + GUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you need to “empty” the temp table that has the same structure as those incoming spreadsheets before you import and run the append query. Once you get this all working, then you can create a one click button to:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Pop open the file dialog to let user select spreadsheet<br />
Empty the temp table<br />
Import spreadsheet into temp table<br />
Run the above append query</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, before you “automate” the above several steps, simply get the above steps working manually. Once done, then have the whole process run with a single mouse click will become an easy possibility.</p>

            <p>I'm not quite following this... I feel like the assumption is that I will be importing and appending the data. It will ultimately be a clerk. The applications I create are never run by me... That being said, I have already created the first three (4) steps
 you mentioned. Its the append query I'm thinking I have to create in vba so that I can modify the "from" - "to" fields based on the imported file. Or to actually change the field names in the imported table so that they match up with the master table. I thought
 if I could display a two column table with the first column showing the fields as specified in the import and column two with the master table field (where matched) and blank if not matched so that the user can manually match to the appropriate import to master
 field. then I could read this table and build the append query with it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you don't think I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill - but I know these field people and I'd bet 33% of the daily imports wont match up! And I wont have the band-width to be running these myself.</p>

            <p>Well... I'm afraid you're up against the problem which has affected automated data since the time of Monsieur Jacquard: "Garbage in, Garbage out." I'm sure your clerk will at some point be faced with a spreadsheet with fieldnames like Field1, Field2, Field3,
 or A, B, C, or some cryptic unknown names invented by the field person - and the best outcome will be inability to import the data, and the worst will be that data will be imported into plausible but&nbsp;<em>WRONG</em> fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the only solution would be to give the field people a locked-down spreadsheet (or other locked-down application) into which they can enter data but not modify its structure. I don't know enough about Excel to suggest how (or if) this can be accomplished,
 but without it, you're heading for sharp rocks and rough water.</p>

            <p>My assumption here is that the spreadsheet is “standard” and that columns don’t change often. So in most cases, I am assuming that column names are standard and don’t change often. You would thus have to pre setup the import for each type of spreadsheet.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If column names in spreadsheets are to change “common” then this certainly becomes a difficult challenge and would REMAIN a difficult challenge EVEN if you built a good UI since users of the application importing data will thus constantly have to “answer”
 and setup say 25 columns – a significant barrier to user friendly application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Having to select 25 columns each time for a import is going to be somewhat messy by near any kind of UI you build. And if the user messes up the mapping, you now have bad data inside of your production applicaton – a lot of work to fix up such a mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus I assumed you have some kind of standard spreadsheet, and you the developer can pre-build the import for such spreadsheets. You might even build some kind of “drop down” or have code to determine the kind of spread sheet, and thus choose from the 10
 common templates you import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No question you can build and setup a UI that displays the incoming columns and allows the user to select the correct target columns - nothing stopping you from doing this. However&nbsp;even in the best of times that sounds like quite a bit of work by the user
 for each import, and certainly is going to be prone to “user” errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So nothing here is stopping you from building such an UI to allow a user to make those choices, but the trick would then be to “reduce” the amount of choices and workload for each import. So such a UI is possible but questions remain if this is a practical
 approach for "end users". </p>
<p>
</p><p>And as noted, they might by accident send a Company name column into Last name, and fixing that kind of import can be difficult. So this is 100% possible, but I'm not sure it is such a great idea.</p>

</p><p>While I agree with Albert that this is easy to do using the UI, I was going under the assumption that a non technical user would be doing this. That's why I built the functionality I did, so that anyone could do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not difficult to do. It does make use of some temp tables and it generates the SQL statements in the VBA code. I think I have a stripped down copy somewhere that I may be able to share.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>On the other note, I cannot understand a corporate culture that allow this. We actually had a similar problem here. One of the accounting personnel had to provide a spreadsheet of sales data on a monthly basis that was imported into one of my apps. Just
 about every month, the spreadsheet column headings changed so my import crashed. We had to go to her supervisor to make sure that she followed the format needed, but the message did come across.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How can I enable the Table Shading tool in a word doc when Restricted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> millyra  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I enable the Table Shading tool in a word doc when Restricted Editing is on.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2016 and am creating a template to roll out to our company that will stop users from using un-styled font formatting and un-styled tables.&nbsp; However I will require the document to be free to allow users to add page break function, and for
 tables to add colours in certain cells, have a double row header and enable the text direction layout to switch where needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Restricted Editing as mostly this does work for all my needs, I'm then exporting it out as a 'normal' template and enabling it on other's machines this way.&nbsp; However is there anyway to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> restrict the afore mentioned functions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I've been tearing my hair out as there doesnt seem to be any answers out there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>fyi there might be some users who only have word 2003-2007 too.</p>

            Page breaks:
<br />I recommend that you allow these by allowing use of a style that has page-break-before paragraph formatting and uses your body text style for the style for following paragraphs.

<p>Tables: <br />
Add your table setup in the form of quick tables and table styles. <br />
<br />
Perhaps have an area in your document where users can edit in any way and train them to use your quick tables and table styles. This would be the editing restriction of No Changes ... with exceptions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change of text direction may require different quick tables depending on what you set up.
<br />
<br />
Quick Tables are a type of building block. You can make them appear first in the gallery by choosing the appropriate names and / or categories.
<br />
Building blocks are discussed in these pages. <br />

<p>I've had to sign in using my friends account firstly as I can't even get into my own to ask a question.</p>
<p>I've had an email saying my trial version is close to expiration and to go through and purchase, I follow through but cant remember my password so send an activation code email yesterday. &nbsp;I come in today to reset my password, I copy the exact user id in
 the email and go through procedure of cant access my account, I cant get passed the user id page as it asks me to type the user id in as so&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please type your email address in the format *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Which is exactly how I'm typing it in as its copied from the e-mail. Im extremely frustrated, so far office 365 has just caused me ongoing sign in issues I've never known something to cost me so much time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi customer,</p>
<p>based on my test, clicking on <strong>can't access your account</strong> to reset password will go through a two step verification process which requires: 1. email verification code 2. phone/text verification code. username is not required.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7d048c5d-eecb-4638-bd7f-2114c8fd3c55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7d048c5d-eecb-4638-bd7f-2114c8fd3c55" /></a></p>
<p>therefore, could you first share a full screenshot about "user name is not incorrect" page with us to clarify the situation?<br />
note: to insert a screenshot, please click on use rich formatting and select the insert image icon.</p>
<p>moreover, you may also try the following method:<br />
1. have you made any changes like adding a custom domain and updating your username using this domain recently? generally, this operation will change username from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. it requires you sign in with the updated *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
2. is there another admin in your tenant? if yes, please let him login and check your username for you.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
vincent</p>

<p>to get here, i followed the link in e-mail to purchase the subscription to 365 for business&gt; clicked can't access account&gt; copy and pasted my username which came with the verification code i'd received the day before.</p>
<p>i don't believe i can access the account any other way, and have tried the other option of&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>

<p>Hi Liam,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We checked the account and it is correct. &nbsp;We noticed that there is a space next to the account which may cause the error message.&nbsp;Please try again with this account to reset your password.
<br />
Note: If we click the Space button at the end of account, we will get the error message as the system may identify the account as a wrong one.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After entering the account and the characters, you will get the page mentioned in Vincent's post. Go through the first two verify steps and then enter a new password for this account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<div>Hi P. Chapier,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the bad experience.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you mean move the selected cells with the mouse like it in Word, I think it can be done in Excel:</div>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228254c0-4589-4aff-af5d-a04fe8697ed6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228254c0-4589-4aff-af5d-a04fe8697ed6?upload=true" /></a><br />
<div>From this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-or-copy-cells-and-cell-contents-803d65eb-6a3e-4534-8c6f-ff12d1c4139e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Move or copy cells and cell contents</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is not what you meant, could you be more specific about how you want to move the rows?</div>
<div><br />

<p>At Word when you are in a parragraph with a simple shortcut "OutlineMoveUp" and the other "OutlineMoveDown" it is possible to move the whole paragraph WITHOUT SELECTING IT up of the previous paragraph or down</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The way you mention here I knew it already. It implies selecting the whole row. But that's what I'm asking if there is a fast way that just by being in a specific row with the command THE WHOLE row goes up or down</p>
<p>

<div>Hi P. Chapier,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am afraid it is not feasible. The cells/rows need to be selected first then they can move. There are shortcuts like Shift + Space to select the whole row but it needs one more step anyway, not as easy as it in Word.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Given this situation, we suggest you post this idea in <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel UserVoice</a>. It's forum collect new ideas and feedback from Excel users and the feedback will go to the developing team. I tried to find a related one in UserVoice so that you could vote for it or leave comments, but it seems that it has not been posted
 before. You could consider posting a new one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your understanding.</div>
