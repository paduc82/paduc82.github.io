<h2>            nvidia geforce 9800 gt problem</h2>
                    My screen graphics developed faults. I have tried different drivers and system restores and checked for viruses without success in finding a solution. Games inform me that the accelerator is disabled or not supported. Hardware diagnosis tells me driver
 problem detected and windows stopped it with code 43. (I cannot find suitable help with this). I have checked compatibility, but it has been working since new without problems. The computer is now very slow because of this error. Do I have a hardware or software
 problem and can it be easily resolved. Any pointers to what action I can take will be appreciated. Bill.

<p><span>Hi BillofEssex,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message when receive when playing games?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you installed the latest graphics adapter drivers from Nvidia website?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error code 43 means Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you manually download and install the latest graphics card drivers from the Nvidia website if you have not done
 it, using the below link and check if it works.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the motherboard has an internal graphics card then you can also remove the card from the computer and run using the inbuilt graphics
 card and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I play rented Xbox Movies from the Surface to Xbox&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can send my own movies from the Surface to the Xbox to play but cannot send a rented movie from Xbox Movies to the Xbox. I only have the option to rent the movie again on the Xbox. This is very bizare as I have already rented the movie on the Surface so
 why can't I have the freedom to either play on the Surface or the Xbox. I can do this with my own movie library.</p>

    <title>USB Optical Drive not detected on Surface Pro 4 but is on other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottlindner  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Optical Drive not detected on Surface Pro 4 but is on other Windows 10 systems</h2>
                    <p>I have an external optical drive that used to work great on my Surface Pro 4 but after a recent update (or something that changed the behavior) this Surface Pro 4 no longer seems to understand the concept of an Optical Drive. When I plug in my USB optical
 drive I hear the USB device connected sound, Device Manager redisplays like it's going to do something, but then nothing. There is no CD/DVD Device option even available in the Device Manager menu on my Surface Pro 4 but there is on all of my other Windows
 10 machines. Again, this device is fine, it works on every one of my other Windows 10 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just Reset this Surface Pro 4 and had it clear everything hoping somehow things got messed up over the time I have owned it. That didn't work either so it definitely isn't some system corruption that has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read countless reviews about this issue and all of the "solutions" aren't solutions because they don't address the issue that Windows doesn't even have the concept of a CD/DVD Drive option in the Device Manager, but it used to. Was this an intentional
 change by Microsoft since it seems to be specific to my Surface Pro 4? Any thoughts on a fix for this?</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Reset was performed natively on the machine itself. I don't know the proper lingo but how I did it was with these steps:</p>
<p>- Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Recovery</p>
<p>- Under Reset this PC I selected "Get started"</p>
<p>- selected option"Remove everything"</p>
<p>I let that grind. Did the Windows updates and plugged in my USB optical drive and it still doesn't work. If there is another more clean way of doing it, tell me how and I will give that a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did the update. My system says it's running 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is a Asus SBW-06D2X-U.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you can see a screenshot of the Device Manager on my Surface Pro that doesn't even depict DVD/CD-ROM drives as an available option with the drive plugged in.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da0c3acd-94f8-4a6b-9e41-32bdc550ecab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da0c3acd-94f8-4a6b-9e41-32bdc550ecab?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And here is a screenshot of Device Manager from another Windows 10 machine with the USB optical drive connected to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/707bcc8b-292c-4747-b17e-ebad8bbb8a0a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/707bcc8b-292c-4747-b17e-ebad8bbb8a0a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here are the driver details on that other Windows 10 machine:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca15802e-5d32-428e-be90-7e0870b52a54?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca15802e-5d32-428e-be90-7e0870b52a54?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In checking my Surface Pro 4, the cdrom.sys file is present but WsOMFlt.sys is not.I tried manually copying that missing file over but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help you can provide to get this working.</p>

            <div>And this drive was working before without needing a USB powered HUB? I'm</div>
<div>wondering what might change if you used a POWERED USB hub and plugged the</div>
<div>optical drive into that and then plugged the hub into your SP4. It would be</div>
<div>strange that it worked before without a hub, but worth trying. Guessing that the</div>

<p>The device does not require 2 USB ports. If you read the documentation you'll see the second connector is for full speeds but it will run at lower speeds on a single one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did work before and works today with only one connector plugged in. I already demonstrated to you that the device works with a single port on another machine.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I understand that. Surface USB ports historically have not supplied enough</div>
<div>power for many USB peripherals. I was checking to see if this might be a power</div>
<div>issue since you didn't specifically state what you were using for power sources</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;I already demonstrated to you that the device works with a single port on another machine. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As above, there are lots of USB peripherals that work on other Windows machines</div>

<div>Do you have any other USB peripherals you can try? Try the Surface Diagnostic</div>

<div>which can often fix most software issues. Then do a two button reset:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then</div>
<div>release it.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same</div>
<div>time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons</div>
<div>down for at least 15 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You</div>
<div>should see the Surface logo.</div>

<p>I made this recovery disc a while ago. I'm going to try installing it to see if the older version of Windows 10 works. It should since this drive worked on this Surface just a couple of months ago. I deleted all partitions first to make sure it is completely
 clean.&nbsp;</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Instructions for using the recovery drive if you need them:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip</div>
<div>to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it working on the Surface with an older version of Windows 10. I'm going to bet after I fully update Windows it's going to stop working, but I'll post that once I get there.</p>

    <title>USB Keyboard driver failure in XP Pro SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newfuturevintage  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Keyboard driver failure in XP Pro SP3</h2>
                    
<p>I've got an HP WX4300 workstation running XP Pro SP3, and a USB keyboard problem.</p>
<p>No USB keyboards will work on this PC.&nbsp; PS2 are fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I plug in</p>
<p>1) Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000,</p>
<p>2) Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro or</p>
<p>3) generic USB keyboard with hotkeys,</p>
<p>XP displays the "Found New Hardware" wizard, and fails to find the correct drivers to install.&nbsp; On a working system, this wizard should never appear when plugging in a USB HID compliant keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>-The USB ports are fine: all the above keyboards function 100% in the BIOS, as well as in Linux running from a live CD .</p>
<p>-I have tried all the USB ports on the PC, all function identically.</p>
<p>-The comfort curve 2000 used to work on this machine when directly plugged in, and when connected via a KVM.</p>
<p>-I recently removed the KVM from the machine, and that is when USB keyboards stopped functioning, either directly plugged into the USB or through the KVM.</p>
<p>-This condition exists in Safe Mode as well as in normal mode.</p>
<p>Steps I have done so far:</p>
<p>-In device manager: I have uninstalled everything mentioning "keyboard" "comfort curve" or "HID"/"Human Interface Device".&nbsp; Upon reboot, the New Hardware Found wizard comes up again.</p>
<p>-in device manager, I have also uninstalled all the USB Root Hubs.&nbsp; Upon reboot, the USB hubs reinstall as expected, and then the "New Hardware Found" wizard comes up again trying to find drivers for the keyboard.</p>
<p>-on a working machine, I noted all the drivers reported in device properties for the keyboard.&nbsp; I copied those driver files from the working machine over to the non functioning machine.&nbsp; Upon reboot/ reinsertion of the keyboard, the wizard comes up yet again.</p>
<p>-installed the intellitype manager.&nbsp; No success there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am 1 step away from levelling the machine and starting from a new install, but would prefer to not do this.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be welcome!</p>
<p>TIA, NFV</p>

<p><span>Hi Newfuturevintage,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When it tries to install the drivers for keyboard, do you receive the option to install the drivers manually?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may follow<span>&nbsp;</span>the steps below and check if it helps to fix the keyboard issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to contact the computer manufacturer or access the computer manufacturer’s website and try to check and download
 the latest chipset drivers and firmware for your computer and install it. Later check if the keyboards are detected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>While the computer tries to install the drivers, if it gives you the option to select the drivers from the list and install
 it manually, you may try to install the drivers manually from the list and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to uninstall the IntelliType software on the computer from Add or remove programs. Later restart the computer and
 reinstall the IntelliType software and check if it helps. Access the link below to download the latest software for your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Keyboard&amp;name=B2L-00002&amp;os=XP_32&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Keyboard&amp;name=B2L-00002&amp;os=XP_32&amp;lang=en</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>You may also access the link below and follow the steps in the article to troubleshoot the USB issues on your computer and check
 if it helps.</span></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, when it tries to install the drivers, I do receive the option to install manually.&nbsp; I have tried pointing the wizard at the c:\windows\system32 and c:\windows\system32\drivers folders.&nbsp; Both fail.&nbsp; I have also tried "choose device from list", and picking
 the closest relatives to the Comfort Curve 2000.&nbsp; This also fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now tried updating the BIOS firmware and updating to the latest chipset drivers for my HP machine, this did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried uninstalling intellitype, this also does not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I have also tried the KB/310575 tips, and this also does not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any other suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi future,</p>
<p>If you're using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
USB hub</a>, I suggest plugging the device directly into the USB slot on the computer.</p>
<p>The files that you've copied from the working machine to the non-working machine are likely pointing to a file that did not get transfered.</p>
<p>I think we might be able to update that driver through&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;update like this:</p>
<p>This will temporarily disable the keyboard, but you should be able to to follow through with the mouse.</p>
<p>While&nbsp;<em>connected to the&nbsp;Internet</em>, open the Device Manager and
 locate the keyboard (should be under "Keyboards").</p>
<p>You might have to click on the arrow to the left of "Keyboards" for the entries to drop down.</p>
<p>Double click on the entry for the keyboard, click the Driver tab at the top of the window that opens, then click Uninstall.</p>
<p>There will be a box labeled "Delete the driver software for this device" in the next window that pops up, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pIon6s3U_-Nq3szu7uY48_Mn3BE1KiRPlwoexJ2SwHuO3DlBZwWgii9v7vojx-iw1r573MbE_jOSG5y6mDNFy5w%2fdelete_driver.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>This example is of a video card entry, but you get the gist.</p>
<p>Click in the box to put a check mark there, then click OK.</p>
<p>At that point, you'll lose the use of your keyboard.</p>
<p>You can click "Action" then select "Scan for hardware changes" in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>This should download a new version of the keyboard driver, and hopefully restore function to the keyboard.</p>

<p>Hi Chris--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not using a USB hub with this keyboard, it's going directly into a USB port on the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed along with your suggestion to delete the driver, but my warning dialog "you are about to uninstall this device from your system" does not give me the option "delete the driver software for this device", neither for the keyboard, nor any other
 device in the device manager.</p>
<p>To restate, I am on XP SP3.&nbsp; Further, I never get to the point in installing the USB keyboard that a driver is ever installed, so XP has no drivers to install.</p>

<h3> lighty44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 7 - Canon MG5200 printer problem</h2>
                    my windows 7 wifi connection to the the Canon MG 5200 has stopped working. I've reinstalled the printed drivers but the problem seems to be that data is not getting from the pc to the printer. The message indicated that there is a print job &nbsp;that is preventing
 the data transfer taking place.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had this problem develop with my previous Xerox wired printer so I changed the printer to the Canon and it has been working OK unitl now so it looks as if it's pc related ?</div>
<div><br />

            Sharief thank you for your response much appreciated.
<div><br />
<div>After uninstalling the programmes and reloading etc I discovered the problem was simply that the printer was too far away from the router and therefore did not receive the command to print.</div>

            Hi, <br />
<div>I would suggest you to try perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Clean boot will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> <br />
<br />
Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state “to reset computer as usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Disconnected all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if any hardware is getting conflict.

            PV92Tray is the PCtel HSP Modem V.92 Configuration Utility.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Is the modem working OK?<br />
<br />
What driver did you install (if any) for your modem?<br />
<br />
Open Device Manager (Start &gt; Run &gt; devmgmt.msc &gt; OK)<br />
Expand the "Modems" category<br />
Is there a warning icon next to your modem?<br />
Right-click and select Properties<br />
What is reported as "Device Status"?<br />
Click the "Driver" tab<br />
What is listed as the Driver provider, date, and version?<br />
Click the "Driver details" button<br />
Click through the various files; other than Microsoft, what company is listed as "Provider"?<br />
<br />
From what I have seen, this problem may arise if you permitted the installation of an optional hardware driver update from Windows update.&nbsp; If that's what happened and the modem was working properly before you went to Windows update, open Device Manager to
 the Modem Driver tab and click the "Roll back driver" button.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you haven't installed a driver ...<br />
<br />
If this is an internal modem, go the website of the manufacturer of your computer.<br />
Enter your model and any other identifying information (e.g., Service Tag, serial number)<br />
See if there is a driver for your modem<br />
If so, download and install it<br />
<br />
If your modem is external, or if your computer mfr doesn't have a driver, see this --&gt;

<h2>            &#34;Date Modified&#34; Column Updates Files to Current Date Without Opening or Changing File</h2>
                    
<p>When using Windows Explorer in Windows 7, I find that some files have their "Date Modified" dates changed to the current date even though I have not opened them or made any modifications. Simply by clicking on the file in Explorer the date is changed. It
 is important to have these dates remain as the actual last modified date, and this seemingly automatic change is causing major headaches.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: Go to safe mode</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</span></strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If safe mode helps, then you may as well perform clean boot to figure out the culprit program that’s causing this.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article.<br />
<strong><br />
Method 3: Perform Virus scan</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>To see if this is the work of virus,
 perform an intensive virus scan on your computer. Update your antivirus database before running the scan. If you don’t have antivirus installed, download and install Microsoft Security Essentials.</span></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I just upgraded 5 devices to <strong>Windows 10 1809. </strong></p>
<p>3 of 5 devices got the same problem as yours. </p>
<p>Reset to the Factory defaults with keeping the files did not help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also all these well known answers about SFC / SCANNOW and reinstalling Microsoft Store
<strong>did not help me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The solution was very easy:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>WIN+X -&gt; <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>locate there your <strong>LAN (Wireless network device)</strong></p>
<p>Right Mouse click on it, go into the Properties</p>
<p>and do <strong>UNINSTALL DRIVER</strong></p>
<p>then <strong>reboot your PC.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On rebootm your driver will be reinstalled automatically</p>
<p>and now your Microsoft Store, OneNote, Weather and other apps will be able to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I've recovered all 3 devices so far. </p>
<p>Too bad I did not find this solution earlier.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I just upgraded 5 devices to <strong>Windows 10 1809. </strong></p>
<p>3 of 5 devices got the same problem as yours. </p>
<p>Reset to the Factory defaults with keeping the files did not help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also all these well known answers about SFC / SCANNOW and reinstalling Microsoft Store
<strong>did not help me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The solution was very easy:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>WIN+X -&gt; <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>locate there your <strong>LAN (Wireless network device)</strong></p>
<p>Right Mouse click on it, go into the Properties</p>
<p>and do <strong>UNINSTALL DRIVER</strong></p>
<p>then <strong>reboot your PC.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On rebootm your driver will be reinstalled automatically</p>
<p>and now your Microsoft Store, OneNote, Weather and other apps will be able to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I've recovered all 3 devices so far. </p>
<p>Too bad I did not find this solution earlier.</p>

That is bizzare!&nbsp; How'd you stumble on this one?

<p>Found this solution at some "how to fix MS Store login connection" site.</p>
<p>During last 2-3 days I tried all the available solutions.&nbsp; No luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bizarre one with "uninstall LAN driver" did help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I got the problem after Windows update process and after Reset to the factory defaults + keep the files.</p>

</p><p>If you have 2 physical network cards then delete both (say Yes to uninstall the drivers).</p>
<p>Here at my work PC I have only one. "Realtek...."<br />
All the rest positions are not important or virtual ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This operation is harmless</p>
<p>because the deleted cards will re-appear on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS You may download the network drivers from your PS manufacturer and save them to desktop</p>
<p>to be able to re-install them instantly on any internet connection failure.</p>

<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.
<br />

            <p>Hi Ericliu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the internet issue occur only when you are using the wireless network from your University?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For&nbsp; the error "Windows Error Reporting service", refer to these steps:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Verify if error reporting is turned on.</font></span></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>To do so I would suggest you to check whether<b>Windows error report service has stopped working</b>. Try to start the service by following these steps:</font></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><font><span><span><font color="#000000">a. </font></span></span><span><font color="#000000">Tap or press Windows Key + R, type<strong>services</strong>, hit enter.</font></span></font></p>

            The problem appears to also happened when I was at home connected to my home internet. &nbsp;Nothing happens when I "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tap or press Windows Key + R, type</span><strong>services</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,
 hit enter." but my Windows error reporting service is on and on automatic. &nbsp;I also don't run antivirus software. &nbsp;Could the problem be my wifi card? &nbsp;Thank you for responding!</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You try typing <font color="#000000"><strong>services.msc</strong> in the run box and go ahead with steps provided
</font><font color="#333333"><strong>"Windows Error Reporting service".</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, could the wireless card is corrupted or outdated because the issue appears at home as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>You may try updating the wireless card drivers by visiting the manufacturer's website and check if that helps.</font></span></p>

            <p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try following methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>:<br />
Open the Windows Update troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Try to install update KB2863822 AND kb2850047 manually in clean boot state.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />

            For Word and Excel 2003 Viewers installed on my XP machine, I followed these recommendations, including deleting registry subkeys HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0 and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0, and then doing a detect
 and repair. After doing this, I am no longer prompted to install Security Update for Office 2003 (KB2850047) every time I start Windows (thankfully). However, the Microsoft Update History shows that the update fails on a daily basis. I guess the next step
 is to do an uninstall/reinstall or else ignore it.<br />

<p>Hi, I have the same problem intermittently as well. It work sometimes OK and other times not. I have tried 3 separate cables and all suffer the same problem. If it starts off working it seems to stay working but if it doesn't work to start with you don't
 seem to be able to get it going. I have been trying to turn the console on 1st then the TV and the other way around but haven't found a definite answer at this point. The Xbox is a XBox 360 S Kinect and the TV is a Vivo. Any ideas anyone ?? Sorry if I butted
 in on this conversation but it seemed the most logical space to put this.</p>

<p>Have you tried resetting the video / audio settings on the Xbox? If not try doing this. Turn off the console and restart it using the controller. During start up hit "Y" and the Right Trigger at the same time. Do this until the console restarts.

<p>Hi iRayDawg,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I will try this if it stops again. After posting, I continued searching further and found an answer in another thread somewhere and they suggested changing a setting in the console Video settings to Disable Discovery mode. Previously
 when this was enabled it would show DVI and not HDMI. They said that DVi does not carry sound - which made sense with the issue I had. So I have Disabled Discovery mode and set to 1080i resolution and set the Audio to digital stereo and so far all is working
 but will wait and see if it continues. </p>

<p>Worked perfectly for me once I tried it, but the screen looks awful once you change it.</p>
<p>Edit; scratch that, the 1080i looks great.</p>

<h3> antonygray7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 101 &#40;NET&#59;&#59;ERR_CONNECTION_RESET&#58;  The connection was reset.</h2>
                    I have begun to experience this problem intermittently only during the past couple of weeks. Error Code 101 (NET;;ERR_CONNECTION_RESET: &nbsp;The connection was reset.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Facts:</div>
<div>1) This has nothing to do with the website as ability to access all websites is lost for a period of about 3-5 minutes - then seems to resolve itself.</div>
<div>2) This is nothing to do with the network - as I first experienced the problem using mobile broadband and the problem continues with conventional broadband.</div>
<div>3) I don't&nbsp;experience&nbsp;the&nbsp;issue&nbsp;at all&nbsp;with my mobile and can access sites whilst PC is&nbsp;temporarily&nbsp;disabled - using broadband.</div>
<div>4) Whilst the connectivity issue &nbsp;that prevents me from&nbsp;accessing&nbsp;websites is active. I can still send and&nbsp;receive&nbsp;email via Outlook and message using Skype</div>
<div>5) Using Windows 7 and the error code appears with any browser it doesn't make a difference.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen many posts about this subject and I would hope my own&nbsp;experience&nbsp;will provide sufficient information to solve this problem that many people are experiencing.</div>

            <p>It sounds as if you should be set for US keyboard but are actually set for UK (or the other way around). The important thing here is that this is not about where you live, it is about the physical keyboard layout. The US keyboard is different to the UK in
 a few small areas as you have found out. Examples...</p>
<ol>
<li>On a UK keyboard the 2 and " are on the same key, on the US keyboard it is 2 and @</li><li>On a UK keyboard the 3 and £ are on the same key, on the US keyboard it is 3 and #</li></ol>
<p>...there are other differences too but the above will help you decide which layout you have. For full details see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout</font></a>.</p>
<p>So, if you are in the UK but have a US keyboard you must tell Windows that you have a US keyboard not a UK keyboard (or the opposite).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Start,&nbsp;type intl.cpl and hit enter.</p>
<p>Click the "Keyboards amd Languages" tab, then click the "Change keyboards..." button</p>
<p>Select the keyboard layout appropriate to your keyboard from the dropdown box for Default input language and click OK, then click OK again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to download applications.</h2>
                    Whenever I try to download an application from the windows app store, at the the end of every download, it keeps saying "try again" and then shows "see details". Whenever I click on "see details" it says "something went wrong. The error code is 0x803F8001".
 This happens for every application I try to download, which literally means I can't download any application. Please how can I resolve this ?

<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, what you can try is to check if you can boot your computer into safe mode. Kindly visit the link provided here for guidance on how to do it:

<p>Hello. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a home computer. The only change i noticed was it kept restarting on its own prior to this issue. As far as i can remember, it has been updated (there's an automatic update of windows). Im using zenmate VPN in google chrome. The computer can boot on
 safe mode.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are also associated with remote connections in your computer, albeit we cannot rule out if the VPN on Chrome you are using is the one causing this message to appear. The next thing you can do is to perform a clean boot on your
 computer to further pinpoint what is the root cause of this. For guidance, kindly follow the steps provided on this link:
