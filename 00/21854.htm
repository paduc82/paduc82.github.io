<h2>            email&#58; pdf file attachment converts to winmail.dat</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2016 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>I started to received complaints from friends and clients last week or so that they cannot open the pdf file I sent on their phone, but they are able to open thru PC on any email programs (gmail, yahoo mail etc)</p>
<p>So&nbsp;I tried numerous test by sending pdf files to my secondary gmail.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;see the email via&nbsp;my Samsung S7, attachment&nbsp;show as winmail.dat but it I see the same email from PC, it shows as pdf.</p>
<p>I double check the settings under "options/mail"&nbsp; It is currently set as "html"&nbsp; I also tried under "plain text"; results were same.</p>
<p>I don't recall running into this issues... perhaps, last few updates might have changed something?</p>
<p>Need help</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, Philip, </p>
<p>I do have Outlook set up as html both under "compose messages" and "message format"</p>
<p>I got more complaints yesterday so I did more testing by sending few email to both my hotmail(primary) and gmail.&nbsp; From PC, attachment on both email showed up as pdf file.&nbsp; When i viewed the same email from my Samsung S7, only the ones on gmail show as winmail.dat&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I cannot figure out on my own; i am switching to Gmail as my primary for now</p>

<p>Attachment shows as pdf on all and every device.</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>Via Outlook from my hotmail, i sent exact attachment to both my Gmail and Hotmail.</p>
<p>Result is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; from PC, regardless of email acct all shows pdf</p>

            I'm having the same issue sending attachments (PDFs) using Outlook 2013 via an Outlook.com email account. I've tried all of the documented "solutions" that I can find to no avail. In my case, I have several email accounts that I manage with Outlook 2013,
 but only one is plagued by this issue. I would also note that this issue came to light only after Microsoft migrated Outlook.com accounts to Exchange.&nbsp;

            Outlook disgusts me, if I didn't have so much depth from work I would abandon. &nbsp;Ever since being forced into using Microsoft Exchange I cant send PDF's to team members mobile devices. &nbsp;Which is quite critical, anybody overcome this or should I bite the
 bullet and change to gmail? -pissed off Outlook user for 5 years

            <p>I abandoned Outlook. &nbsp;I opted to start using the Win 10 Mail app because it allows me to manage multiple email accounts from a single interface with a layout that's familiar and touch friendly. Otherwise, I would've gone to Gmail. That said, I did move my
 contacts, calendar and tasks to Google and am not looking back. Those Google products work flawlessly with Android, which made it a no-brainer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest benefit to using the Win 10 Mail App is that I only need one address book (hosted by Google), no matter how many email accounts I have setup in the Win 10 Mail app. Google contacts and calendar also interface well with their built in Win 10 counterparts.
 &nbsp;So in summary: email accounts hosted by Outlook.com and everything else is hosted by Google, all accessed using the email, contact and calendar apps built into Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not perfect, but my clients and business associates now receive every attachment that I send to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye-bye Outlook.</p>

            <p>Issue still exists.&nbsp; In my case, only the acct that is set up with Exchange is having issues</p>
<p>But if you set it up SMTP, you will loose some features and benefits; so what is the point paying $$$ to subscribe MS Office.....</p>
<p>After spending enormous amount of hours and days (not to mention tossed around like ping pong ball between departments and between the techs who didn't seem to understand the difference between MS Outlook 2016 and web-based Outlook) on the phone with MS
 tech support, i was elevated to Level 2 support.</p>
<p>Received solution was "no fixes at this time", "not sure if there will be in the future", "don't know", "don't know"...</p>
<p>If this is a freebie software...yeah, i would understand such a "don't care" behavior but all MS Office Outlook users pay their dues to use the program for reasons.</p>
<p>Overall, sad and disappointing.&nbsp; May be it's time to let go as i did with many MS products...windows phone, keyboard etc....</p>

<h2>            Combining 2 or more IF&#40;AND statements in to one IF&#40;AND&#40;OR statement</h2>
                    <p><span>Is it possible to combine 2 or more
<b>IF(AND</b> statements into one <b>IF(AND(OR</b> statement in Excel 2007? <br />
<br />
Following are two examples in which I'm attempting to make it easier to follow my question.
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<b>Example One:</b> Written separately it would like this:</span></p>

<p><span>=IF(AND(Length&lt;=0.875,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),0.031,0.094)</span><span><br />
</span><span>=IF(AND(Length&gt;=1.000,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),0.063,0.094)</span></p>

<p><span>Length = Looks at a cell with a value (Example 0.500, 1.000, 2.000 etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>Nominal_Size = Looks at a cell with a value (Example 0.500, 0.625, 0.750 etc.).</span><span><br />
<br />
Is there a way to combine these two statements into a single cell? </span></p>

<p><b><span>Example Two:</span></b><span>
 Written separately it would like this:</span></p>

<p><span><br />
</span><span>=IF(AND(Length&lt;=0.875,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),0.250,0.313)</span><span><br />
</span><span>=IF(AND(Length =1.000,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),<span>0.407,0.438</span>)</span></p>
<p><span>=IF(AND(Length =1.125,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),0.407,0.438)</span></p>
<p><span>=IF(AND(Length&gt;=1.250,Nominal_Size&lt;=0.625),0.594,0.625)</span></p>

<p><span>Length = Looks at a cell with a value (Example 0.500, 1.000, 2.000 etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>Nominal_Size = Looks at a cell with a value (Example 0.500, 0.625, 0.750 etc.).</span><span><br />
<br />
Is there a way to combine these four statements into a single cell?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.</span></p>

<p>I tried some code in VBA. It does open up the table but it still displays the index value in the field with all other correct data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table has some fields like: Object name, Object type, Serial No, Status (All text fields) etc.</p>
<p>Form has a combo box, a label and a search button. </p>
<p>On clicking the search button, it searches for the record in the table but under object name it displays numbers like 1, 2, 3 or the index number of the object selected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My VBA code is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub search_click()<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Dim ObjectName As String<br />
&nbsp; Me.ObjectName.SetFocus<br />
&nbsp; ObjectName = Me.ObjectName<br />
<strong>MsgBox ObjectName(Added this to figure out what is being sent to the sql query)</strong><br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenQuery "Lookup By Object", acViewNormal, acEdit (That is the query which runs)<br />
End Sub&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Query:</p>
<p>
SELECT Object.*<br />
FROM Object<br />
WHERE (((Object.[ObjectName])=[Forms]![Object_Lookup_Form]![ObjectName]));<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to which property I need to add/change in order to make this work?&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>Note that is normal for a combo box to display a name or some text while its actual value is an ID field from the table.&nbsp; Actually, it sounds like the combo box is set up correctly and the problem is that your query criteria is using the object name field
 when it should be using the object ID field. (Depends on what fields you have in the Objects table.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If changing the criteria is not possible, please explain why.&nbsp; And&nbsp;we will then need to see the combo box's RowSource.&nbsp; If its a query, post a Copy/Paste of its SQL view.&nbsp; If its a table, post a list of its fields.&nbsp; Also post the combo box's ColumnCount,
 BoundColumn and ColumnWidths properties.</p>

            Check the combo box properties and make sure the bound column is not 0. There is a difference between the properties dialog and the vba code references. A property value of 0 would return the index. A property value of 1 would reference the first column.
 In VBA, referencing Column(0) is the first column in the Row Source.

            Since your Bound Column is 1, the first column from the Row Source will be stored in the combo box Control Source. Your first column from the Row Source is [Object].[ID]. If you want the ObjectName to be stored in the Control Source you should set the
 Bound Column to 2.

            <p>Your situation remains in the unusual category.&nbsp; If the object names are unique and you are using them as foreign keys in another table, then they should be the primary key in the objects table and you have no use for the ID field.&nbsp; If the object names might
 be edited to correct spelling or whatever, then the ID field servers as a never changing unique value that is better used as the primary key and therefore should be used as the foreign key in other tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, make up your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ID field is&nbsp;the primary key, then a simple select query should display the ID field instead of the name.&nbsp; When you need to see the name in a report or as a read only field in a form, then use a query to Join the
 other table to the Objects table as the report/form's record source.&nbsp; If the name field needs to be edited in a form, use a combo box as you had it before and it will display the name while saving the ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR, if the name is the primary key, then you should delete the ID field because it serves no useful purpose and is confusing you.</p>

<h2>            Nokia E72 - internet browser - error message&#58; memory is full close some applications and try again</h2>
                    
<p>When using nokia web browser going to a site like engadget which load 4Mb +- causes the browser to display an error message that memory is full and to close some application which the only application in load is the browser it self, it also causes the entire
 system to hang.</p>
<p>this is most likely a memory leak when it clodis with&nbsp; simply bad hardware design + bad memory management application crash and error messages start appearing, i wonder would apple ever release a device like that???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nokia next time put some more ram in to you devices 128MB is ridiculous.</p>
<p>please do a better QA!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nokia e72-1</p>

<p>cache was cleared, that's not the problem, the problem is a low ram about 30MB (no application running)&nbsp; and a probably browser memory leak.</p>
<p>there is too many system process (about 150+) that take to much memory.</p>
<p>when you have a 128 mb of ram you have to be very efficient with memory management.</p>
<p>this is another of the many bugs this nokia e72 has.</p>
<p>this will be my last nokia device, kit's are not being properly tested before release, OS is unstable, it freezes and crash to often, it's an unreliable device.</p>
<p>it looks like nokia does not really care about quality.</p>

<h2>            Listing of &#34;Standard Windows Office Compatible Fonts&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings-</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, our company has recommended that Verdana be used on things such as PPT. This is because the company is global and folks work across platforms (Mac/Windows), and it has always worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've heard that perhaps Verdana is no longer listed as one of the standard, compatible Windows Office fonts.... Before we change our recommendation, I was wondering</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If anyone knew if this were true</p>
<p>2. If there is anyplace online where Microsoft has posted a list of compatible fonts. (I looked, couldn't find it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help or direction!</p>

            <p>I can't speak for Mac, but in case it helps, I've just installed Windows 10 and Office 365 and nothing else on a new computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether it's distributed with Windows or Office, but Verdana is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering how widely it's been distributed up to now, I'd think MS would be doing itself serious damage if they suddenly removed it at this point.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t adjust right border of table &#40;PPT 2016&#47;Win7 Pro&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t adjust right border of table &#40;PPT 2016&#47;Win7 Pro&#41;</h2>
                    As of the last few weeks (probably since an update), I've been unable to adjust the far right border of my tables in PPT. when I try to move the border, it snaps back to where it used to be. I can adjust all other borders, just not the far right edge.
 The only way I can find to move it is to resize the entire table. Has anyone had this problem or know of a solution? It's driving me crazy. Thanks.

            I can float my mouse above the right border, then slowly move it toward the left. When it is slightly inside the rightmost border, it changes the 2 vertical lines with right and left-pointing arrows and I am able to move the border to the left. As the
 other John has observed, it won't move to the right to expand the column width.&nbsp;

            No, I know HOW to do it. It just wouldn't working. The right-hand border would not move. As of yesterday, it seems now that I can move the right-hand border in, but not out. &nbsp;Maybe it's just my computer (in combo with a Microsoft update?). It used to work
 fine...

<p>
</p><p>My problem is similar, but not identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell external keyboard for my MacBook Air. Right now, whenever I type a number on the keypad, it writes the number, but deletes the character (or space). It is like my number pad is on 'insert' or 'overwrite' mode, and I can't turn it off. This
 is happening in Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is it only started happening mid-September. Did Microsoft update things without me knowing?</p>

</p><p>I have watching some videos to better learn to use Sway. Unfortunately it seems that Microsoft has decided to eliminate the navigation menu bar both in the on line and app versions. I cannot understand the reason because the edition is much more difficult
 now. Can you please explain it to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the only interface for Sway I will forget it and stop wasting my time.</p>

<p>Hi Julio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear that the new UI is not working out for you.&nbsp; We've found that most users are much more productive with the new UI, but understand that it might not be for everyone.&nbsp; Are there specific aspects of it that you don't like?&nbsp; We're always
 looking for feedback on things that we might be able to improve.</p>

            I still don't see where to just add a card. Clicking the plus icon seems to only add more text to the existing card. Really don't understand why it should be so difficult to create a new slide.

            OK I figured the card issues out. The problem is they don't actually tell you you're adding a new card. The menu says add a Heading Title or something like that, which makes it seems that you are just adding new content to the existing slide. Really confusing
 that they just don't say "add a new card".&nbsp;

</p><p>The Heading Cards are no longer accessible in the range of tools. The Heading Cards should be with the +button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heading Option now comes up on Text Cards up near Emphasise, Accent etc …. BUT does not always list on the screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Various anomalies are being experienced with the UI.</p>
<p>Copy/ paste does not work reliably/ consistently.</p>
<p>Cursor activity can be erratic .. and this applies on using Office 365 as well.</p>
<p>Updates to the cloud server are not as responsive as they could be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disrupted internet access has been reported to our ISP and to our major telecommunications provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think some/ many&nbsp; of the issues are with the Microsoft software … but all has to work together for the system to be a system and a reliable one.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>To delete a contact in the new Skype version, simply follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Skype App.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Contacts </strong>icon.</li><li>Locate the contact you want to remove and click his/her profile icon.</li><li>Select <strong>View Profile</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Delete Contact.</strong></li><li>A message box opens with the prompt: “Are you sure you want to remove [name of contact] from your contacts list?” Click<strong> Remove</strong>.</li></ol>

    <title>Casting photos from OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgevlachos76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Casting photos from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Since a couple of weeks ago, I am unable to cast photos from the Android OneDrive app to Google Chromecast 2 (the cast icon is now longer there). My phone runs Android 7. I am an Office 365 subscriber and I believe Microsoft should extend the courtesy of
 continuing support for the "rival" Chromecast... Is there any way around this that does not involve buying extra trird-party apps?</p>
<p>

<div>Hi GV,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Since your concern is about casting photos from the Android OneDrive app to Google Chromecast 2 that isn't working as expected, I’d recommend contacting our OneDrive experts through in-app support. To do this, sign in to
<strong><a href="https://onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive.com</a></strong> from any browser, click the
<strong>?</strong> help icon on the top banner of the page and select Email OneDrive support. If you also have other OneDrive related concerns, you may raise it with them as they’re now handling all of it.</p>

            <p>It was somewhat disconcerting after the Christmas break to find some functionality has disappeared from my Yammer account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit like finding out someone has come into your office over the holiday period and removed key documents that were safely pinned to your personal office noticeboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial concern is that Microsoft has been doing some A/B testing to see if anyone is using the functionality. &nbsp;If that proves to be the case then Office 365 will become an environment where trust is gradually being eroded. &nbsp;</p>

            Looks like it has been completely removed except the ability to bookmark. Can't find a way to view bookmarks at all. And now even the private chat feature (real time) is missing. Yes off topic so I'll have to find the topic for it.

<h2>            Cannot save Shared Excel file in Safe Mode or Standard Mode</h2>
                    We are having a problem saving a Shared Excel 2010 file either in SAFE Mode or standard mode. Add Ins have been unchecked.&nbsp; The file is opened in [SHARED] [Compatibility] Mode. After entering data and clicking on SAVE a message is generated "the document
 was saved sucessfully but Excel cannot re-open because of a sharing violation. Please close the document and try to re-open it again." When OK is clicked and you try to close the file you get an error message. "The file is locked, try again later." We are
 using Windows 7.

<p>I understand your problems.</p>
<p>As its not a final version of Windows 10 for phones.</p>
<p>It contains some bug which slower the performance of phone.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't released the final version of Windows 10 for phones.</p>
<p>Its under a technical preview state.</p>
<p>May be it will available later this year.</p>
<p>But it will supports all Windows phone 8 devices.</p>
<p>If you don't want to use technical preview.</p>
<p>You can roll back to Windows phone 8.1</p>
<p>For that refer the link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/roll-back-windows-phone-81-windows-10-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowscentral.com/roll-back-windows-phone-81-windows-10-preview/</a>&nbsp;</p>

 disconnecting it from the cable and re-start using the recovery tool. If this will not work, suggest visiting the nearest Care Point to have it assesses by our technicians. Your files will be deleted, unless backup is turned on prior to this. Also, charges
 may apply once the technicians identified that your phone was updated to Windows 10.

            Hi Debra,
<div><br />
Thank you for providing an update with additional information on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
As per the error message which you get, it could have happened that Windows Firewall is not allowing the game to reach your computer or it is the firewall for your network that is creating an issue. Let’s check if temporarily disabling Windows Firewall helps
 you to play the game online.</div>
<div><br />
You can follow the methods:<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Refer to the link to temporarily turn off Windows Firewall and try playing the game:<br />
Follow the section “<strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <strong>For Windows Firewall:</strong> You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from
 worms or hackers.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Let’s open a port on Windows Firewall and check if that helps. <br />
But, before we do so, I would suggest you to make sure of certain risks of allowing apps through Windows Firewall. Refer to the link:<br />
“<strong>What are the risks of allowing apps through a firewall?”<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/risks-of-allowing-apps-through-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/risks-of-allowing-apps-through-firewall</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please make sure to close the port after troubleshooting the issue. Follow the section “<strong>To close a firewall port</strong>”.</div>
<div><br />
Refer to the link to open a port:<br />
Follow the section “<strong>Open a port in Windows Firewall</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a></div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persists, you can contact MSN for further help. Refer to the link:</div>
<div><a href="https://support.msn.com/Default.aspx?&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.msn.com/Default.aspx?&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1</a>

            <p>If we're disabling the firewall in order to try to allow the game access, what good will reactivating the Firewall and opening certain ports...Does not disabling the Firewall negate needing to open ports. I'm pretty sure that when you disable the firewall
 it opens up all of the ports, correct?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried IE reset already, should have mentioned that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I opened Search Windows and typed in “Troubleshooting” Up comes an entry:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>--------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>(gear symbol) Troubleshooting Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(gear symbol) Find and fix problems</span></p>
<p><span>(gear symbol) Troubleshooting History</span></p>
<p><span>-------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But clicking on any of these brought nothing up, just a blank search box. So I looked into this to see what was working. I can access something like Calendar or my own files from Search but not entries
 with a gear symbol next to them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I went into Control Panel using a taskbar icon I have for that purpose and ran the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter. But no joy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The IE problems started happening on the weekend. I am thinking of trying a restore to an earlier date, but that seems like hammer to crack what hopefully is a simple issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your help, any further ideas are welcome.</span></p>

            Well I don't use EDGE so doubtful it is anything to do with updates for that. I think it may well have been an update myself as I did do quite a few prior to the problem starting.

<h3> stephenps  say:</h3>
<h2>            sumif formula help - sum a range if another range equals a fixed cell value</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this formula is to add the value in a fixed column range based on if 3 other column ranges equals the value of a fixed cell.</p>
<p>This formula works great, but I need to add a criteria to the formula and I do not know how.</p>
<p>The criteria I need to add would be if a value in a range of cells (column) is greater than 50, then it would proceed with the formula. &nbsp;If the value is less than 50, then it would not proceed with the formula.</p>
<p>I need this to work for the entire range of cells in the first formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my working formula:</p>
<p>=(SUMIF($I$2:$I$42,$B46,$H$2:$H$42)*3)+SUMIF($K$2:$K$42,$B46,$H$2:$H$42)+SUMIF($M$2:$M$42,$B46,$H$2:$H$42)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need the formula to consider expressed as best I can in excel language:</p>
<p>if($e$2:$e$42&gt;50,&lt;proceed with above formula&gt;,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that doesn't work :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help!</p>

<p>I did but that was all greek to me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out a way to work around it.</p>
<p>What I did was instead if check for the 50' length and add heads at the bottom in the totals section, I added a column line item so that the spreadsheet would tell me in each row next to the wire size if it needed a head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that I had to do was add the column for heads, and then an additional sumif for the heads at the bottom for totals which was the same sumif I used to total each wire size, but now for heads rather than size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies, help is greatly appreciated!</p>
