<h2>            Windows 7 hangs during shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>Starting yesterday, evertime I shut down my computer (using start-&gt; shut down), my comp logs off windows and then hangs on the "shutting down" screen until I use the power button. This also happens on restarts as well.</p>
<p>I am using windows 7 32-bit&nbsp;home premium (the free upgrade from vista home premium), an AMD phenom II 965 3.2 ghz quad processor, and 4gb of DDR3 ram. Any ideas what might be causing this?</p>
<p>BTW I recently installed a new Creative sound card, perhaps this has something to do with my problem?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try removing the sound card to see if that helps. If you had on-board sound before did you disable<br />
it in the Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot?<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

first.<br />

<h2>            How to stop a WIndows 8 computer becoming the Master Browser &#40;NOT talking network www browsers, IE etc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the wrong PC takes over Master Browser some computers are not Seen/Listed on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use to have this problem with mixed Windows XP, 7 &amp; 8 computers &amp; especially when I had a NAS attached, I have a WD My Book Live and it had a habit of taking over Master Brower, in those days a real pain as not everything seemed to be picked up on the LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all now WIndows 7 or 8 I actually like this WD My Live NAS taking over and all the computers &amp; everything nicely picked up on the network quickly &amp; reliably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However now if I reboot my router that the NAS is directly attached to, another computer (Windows 8 64bit) takes over MB while the router refreshes.</p>
<p>It keeps being the MB until I shut it down for a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this computer for some reason does not seem to do a very good job because half of the 6 or 7 PC's on the network are now not visible &amp; printers etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why this one does take over, I have 1 or 2 PC (win 8) that are more directly connect to the router and far more likely to be always on. Not sure whether it would be any better but strange they never try. The PC that does take over is on a
 router bridge &amp; then a couple of switches away from the main router so I would have thought on a restart etc it would take a minute of so for them all to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course it is not always immediately obvious that this has happened. OK'ish for me but not for my staff as some computers are not visible anymore.</p>
<p>This PC is also tucked away and only accesible remotely so not so east to restart for staff. Don't want them using RDP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There does not seem to be any pattern. Some WIn 8 &amp; WIn 7 are visible &amp; some WIn 8 or 7 are NOT visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see why this PC does not do a good job of MB &amp; would like to know why but I would prefer that it does not even try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIth the XP computers I could stop them trying with registry setting, does nor seem to have the same settings in WIndows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wish there was a visible setting that could access the MB stuff rather than keeping it hidden because when there is a problem it is really hard to see &amp; fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years I have seen quite a few people have problems with this, especially when things like NAS or SAMBA devices are present.</p>
<p>I once had a Blackberry Playbook that would take over as Master Browser!!!! &amp; of course did a rubbish job. I had to change its network domain.</p>
<p>If there was a simple table that you could tick, Yes or No &amp; order of preference. This ability is there but just buried. OK works 99% of the time for most I guess but when it does not.</p>
<p>I don't pretend to know much about how this works I just know I have spent days in the past trying to find out what was happening &amp; then try to fix. The worrying thing is I usually stumble on a pattern that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been putting up with this for months now &amp; decided I really need to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks I/A</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Video&#47;audio out of sync</h2>
                    We&nbsp;have been talking on Skype video&nbsp;using 3 identical HP computers running current Windows 10 without any problems until recently. Now the&nbsp;video lags in both directions when device A talks to either device B or C. Communications between B and C, and other
 computers&nbsp;is normal. Upload and download speed tests are normal on all devices. When talking to device A, turning off video on either side allows the video and audio&nbsp;to sync on the remaining screen. ???

<p>this is all very well, but can you please tell me where to find the menu bar??? I have just moved to a Windows 10 computer and the preinstalled Skype doesn't show a menu bar as far as &nbsp;I can see. Voice/Video sync is very delayed on live calls. Even slightly
 out of sync in video test mode. I'm sure it's not the internet connection, as sync is OK when using my Windows 8.1 tablet. Please help. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Red X on desktop application Icons</h2>
                    all desktop application icons have a red X on them. They seem to work fine. All desktop documents now have shortcut symbol (small arrow) even though they are not shortcuts. Seemed to occur after I copied picturers from Sony cybershot Camera using explorer.
 Any idea what happened? How do I restore?

            <p>Thank you for the support. It was very interesting how this played out. The original "Red X problem occured when I copied and pasted photos onto my desktop from a new Sony cybershot camera. I copied them there to burn these photos to disk and eventualy transfer
 them into my pictures gallery on my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well low and behold after burning to disk (the problem persisted) but&nbsp;when I copied and pasted them into "pictures" the red X's and short cut symbols all&nbsp;disappeared and the desktop returned to normal status. Now remember at this point in time the original
 copies of the pictures from the camera are still residing in a folder on my desk top. I eventually disposed of these in recycle bin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what happened when I copied and pasted from the Camera to the desktop folder, but that was when the issue manifested and copying and pasting from desktop to Pictures folder made it go away. Wierd....PC function was not effected at all as far
 as I could tell only the cosmetics of the desktop Icons???????</p>

<p>Does not appear to effect anything but very irritating.</p>

            So after running into this problem myself, I found a solution:<br />
Go to C:\Users\(Yourusername)\AppData (this is a hidden folder)\Local<br />
<br />
In there you will find the file IconCache.db. Delete it, then go back to desktop and refresh (either f5 or right click and select refresh).<br />
<br />
If it keeps occurring, I might suggest taking a backup and running a file scan as it can be both malware or a dodgy harddrive that keeps corrupting your files.

<p>This check and X issue has just showed up.&nbsp; In one case I removed the two photos with an X from the folder and the folder received a check mark. However, That all this mess is there is disturbing.&nbsp; I have windows 10. There is no IconCache.db listed or found.
 I feel weirded out by this random "judgement" &gt; not sure what is going on, and I want it gone. A Mac is starting to look like a great idea.</p>

<p>Hello Lobitojr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. There are some codes that do and then some that last until 9999. Also keep in mind that pre-paid codes are stackable for example if you have 3 3-month codes you can redeem all and it will add it to 9 months of live. You can
 request a call back they can look up the codes and see when they expire for you.</p>

<h2>            How to find jpeg files with empty Comments field&#63;</h2>
                    I know I can search a folder in File Explorer, and use&nbsp; [ type: jpeg comments: "seasonal" ] -- without the brackets -- to find all jpeg files that have the word "seasonal" in the comments field in the metadata. How do I search for the files that have
<em>nothing </em>in the comments?

<h2>            What Does the Little Number Mean on the Envelope in my Taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 and on the left hand side of my Taskbar, next to a SEARCH dialog box, there is a yellowish Envelope.&nbsp; It stays there along with a couple more icons like the Blue lower case "e" that's next to a folder to access what's on my hard drive
 and then a shopping bag.</p>
<p>There is a small number "1" on the envelope and for the life of me I cannot get that number to go away.&nbsp; I don't have any unread messages or anything else that requires my attention as far as I can see.&nbsp; I've been trying for 30 minutes to try and get it
 to go away with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me get this taken care of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            Hi LRW <br />
<br />
Most likely that is an Outlook Mail icon . . . <br />
<br />
Right click that icon you are referring to, what options do you see on the resulting menu, is the name of the associated App listed and is there an 'Unpin from Taskbar' option?

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps.
<br />
<br />Getting rid of the New mail icon is to fully open an email - any email - in a new window (not just in the preview pane) by double-clicking it."
<br />
<br />It may have sync issues if you use mail in mobile device
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>There is only 1 account associated with it, my HOTMAIL account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click there is an option to UNPIN it from the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on it to open, there are emails, but I have either read all of them or right clicked and had it mark all of them READ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, the little number 1 remains in the bottom right corner of the Envelope icon.&nbsp; I don't know what it means or how to get rid of it.&nbsp; I don't mind that the link to that email account is on my Taskbar, I just want to know what the 1 is doing
 there on the envelope and how to get rid of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I noticed it last night and clicked on it, there was more than 1 new email.&nbsp; I opened them up, read them and then deleted them.&nbsp; When I closed the mail application, the number 1 was still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your time and efforts to help me get this straight.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo laptop won&#39;t start up after powered down during factory restart</h2>
                    So my Lenovo laptop was pretty slow so I did a factory restart. During this I put down my screen putting it in sleep mode and I got frustrated that it wasn't working so I powered it down completely and powered it back on now all it does when I power it
 on is flash the Lenovo symbol and turn off the screen over and over in an endless cycle I tried the battery thing where I remove it and only use cable it doesn't work. This is pretty bad because since it's Lenovo I don't have a start up safe mode or even that
 menu please help I need this computer for school and other things because this is my only laptop and I don't have 500$ lying around.

<h2>            How do I fix error 1327 invalid drive G&#58; when I try to install utilities and drivers cd&#63;</h2>
                    I used to get the error when I turned my computer on. I read it was related to HP printers. Since it was my brothers old computer and I don't have his printer I uninstalled all the printer software. That seemed to work, however, when I needed to install
 the utilities and drivers CD the error came back. The device manager said I have one device without a device driver - the ethernet controller. So I need to install the driver so I can connect to the internet with my router.

<p>Put your computer in clean boot state and install the driver and check if it helps.</p>

<h3> marshallpotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print emails from Windows Live Mail inside Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I looked at previous posts on this problems, but none seem to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; I have Windows Live Mail set up to get emails from several different servers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to copy emails to Word and print from Word, but I can't seem to print from WLM.&nbsp; I have checked the printer to make sure it is the default, I have checked to make sure that WLM is printing to the same printer, but WLM will not print to the new
 printer.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on the phone with the printer company and as the printer prints from other programs e.g. Microsoft Word, and won't print from WLM, it must be an issue with WLM.</p>
<p>

            Hi,   <br /><br />My name is Zoe. I'm an Independent Advisor from Directly. I'm sorry to know that you're facing issues with Skype.   <br /><br />Skype for ipad requires an IOS 10.0 or above. It would be better for you to update your IOS system before you update Skype.<br /><br />Hope it helps and please let us know if you have further questions!   <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Zoe

            Hi Lynn
<br />
<br />I am sorry, if you cannot upgrade iOS to version 10.xx you will not be able to use the Skype app on your iPad, Microsoft turned off support for iOS 9.xx recently . . .
<br />
<br />You should still be able to use the Web version of Skype on your iPad, depending on the browser you use:

            Hi Lynn
<br />
<br />No, you will not be able to download Skype, they have a version that runs on that web page, rather than installing the App . . .
<br />
<br />If you click the link above, does that take you to the Skype web version?

<p>I have the same problem as Zoe. I'm running OS 9.3.5 and my ipad is old enough that I can't update to OS 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to access web.skype I got a message "Device not supported".</p>

            Recently many other users are experiencing the same problem as you, but unfortunately there is nothing we can do at the moment. You may wish to use Skype on other devices.
<br />
<br />Hope it answers your questions and let us know if you have any other questions!

            As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.<br />
<br />
1. Install older iTunes 12.6.5 supporting AppStore: <br />
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079 <br />
<br />
2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.<br />
<br />
3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link: <br />
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510<br />
<br />
4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.<br />
