                    My inbox indicates I have 3 unopened e-mails.&nbsp; When I click on the inbox and go in there are NO unread e-mails.&nbsp; Is there the opportunity to hide e-mails or do I have a glitch.&nbsp; I have looked everywhere.

            Hi Mother E,
<div><br />
<div>Does the ribbon totally disappear or does it just minimize to the single line of heading?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Minimized...</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ca03728-7d34-4b2c-8779-460e18db8de4" /></div>

<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b252ab8c-7f4f-4897-a637-a0d4edadbf26" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Minimizing could be caused by errant clicks, but gone could be caused by either a corrupt preference file, logging in under a different user id, or someone else who uses your computer is turning it off in Word &gt; Preferences &gt; Ribbon.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Give us more information and we'll try to help.</div>

            Hi E,
<div><br />
<div>What you are referring to is the Menu Bar. Ctrl-Click (right click) on your toolbar and choose the Customize Toolbar option. In the dialog tick the Menu Bar option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully that corrects the problem. However if it doesn't...</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the menu that you got when right clicking the toolbar there is a setting to Dock toolbars. Make sure that is marked. There is also a Reset Toolbars option, which I believe will restore the toolbars to there original settings. I do not know its effect
 on the menu bar but it might be worth a try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, if none of the above works (or sticks) then you'll need to replace your Normal.dotm template. It does not require a reloading of software. Let us know if you need to take that course of action.</div>
<div><br />

            PMFJI :-) But as Rich suggested remove &amp; install is rarely a prescribed fix on a Mac.<br />
<br />
There are 4 primary contributing factors to a 'missing menus' issue. Tend to #1 &amp; #2 before anything else:<br />
<ol>
<li>A continuously running computer. Often, simply restarting your Mac can resolve it -- try that first if you haven't done so already,</li><li>Failure to maintain a current update level -- You didn't indicate what your present update level is but 14.3.6 is what it should be. Look in Word&gt; About Word to confirm. If anything less, use Help&gt; Check for Updates, then repair disk permissions &amp; restart
 afterward,</li><li>A corrupt Normal.dotm template or damaged preferences (.plist) file, or</li><li>Somebody made extensive changes while in the Customize Toolbars &amp; Menus dialog.</li></ol>
<br />
The screen shot strongly suggests #3 or #4...<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The Formatting toolbar (directly above the Ruler) shows bunches of stuff that it normally does not include. Many of the controls are not even in a '<i>format</i>' category [i.e., Spell Check, Word Count, Draw Table, etc.] so they would have no reason to
 be there unless added by a user or other 'outside' influence.</li><li>There is a toolbar immediately above that one which displays the names of the missing Menu items [i.e., File, Edit, View, etc.] as well as many of the commands that should be in those menus [i.e., Open, Print, Cut/Copy/Paste, Undo, Redo, etc.]. No such
 toolbar exists in a normal scenario.<br />
</li></ul>
If the issue persists after doing #1 &amp; #2 above reply here for additional steps to take. It will help to know whether the changes were deliberately made or stem from another cause. Please indicate whether anyone has done any customizing of Menus &amp; Toolbars.
 (No offense, but kids love to hack around :-)) Also, do the following &amp; include the results of each test:<br />
<ol>
<li>Hold Shift while you launch Word. Are the menus/toolbars correct? As they were? Otherwise?</li><li>Create a new User Account, launch Word normally there. Are there any similar issues?</li></ol>
<br />

            Hi Rich -- Just a few points of clarification if I may :-)<br />
<br />
Re: "<i>However if it doesn't...</i>" -- It won't. The check simply toggles the display of the Menu Bar
<i>toolbar</i> while in the Customize dialog. It has no effect on the main Menu Bar itself. The box is always checked by default when you go into the dialog even if you left it unchecked when the dialog was last closed.<br />
<br />
Although it can be done programmatically there is no UI setting to toggle display of the main Menu Bar. With the exception of the Word, Apple Script &amp; Help menu pads (note that they don't even appear on the Menu Bar toolbar) you can remove menu pads from the
 Menu Bar toolbar. Doing so will cause them to be removed from the main Menu Bar but each has to be removed manually. That's why I suggested that some errant customization may have been done -- the screen shot looks as though someone did drag the menu pads
 to a custom toolbar.<br />
<br />
Re: "<i>I do not know its effect on the menu bar...</i>" -- You can't reset the Menu Bar from the UI by using the right-click method. The right-click method restores only the toolbar on which you right-click. In the Customize dialog you can select the Menu
 Bar toolbar &amp; use the Reset button there to restore to the built-in defaults. Also, even in the dialog the bar to be Reset must be selected in order for the button to have any effect. IOW, you can't reset everything at once.<br />
<br />

            Hi E.
<div><br />
<div>As Bob Jones has said the problem is either a corruption of the Normal template, a Word Preference file, or your Customized Toolbars/Menu bar. It sounds like you want to keep your Toolbar/Menu bar customizations so that rules out a potential fix of replacing
 your Normal template. All toolbar customizations are stored there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What you can try is replacing your Word Preferences files, there are potentially two. You locate them in the following locations:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.word.plist</b></div>
<div><b>~/Library/Preferences/microsoft/com.microsoft.word.plist</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>You delete both of the plist files. Don't be concerned if you find only one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No Office application can be running when you do this. That includes Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint etc. It is best to perform a restart prior to deleting these files. After deleting the files you can open the Office apps, the files will be recreated and you
 can verify if this helps, which unfortunately I doubt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said, customizations to Word's Menu Bar, Standard &amp; Formatting toolbars are held in the Normal template. Whether your customizations caused the corruption or not, the only fix is to replace the Normal template, which will delete your customizations.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>FWIW, this is the reason why people like myself who extensively customize Word's User Interface (for Office 2011 the UI is the Menu Bar, Standard and Formatting toolbars) never do so in the Normal template. We create our customizations in other custom
 Global templates and add-ins.</div>

            Dear Rich,
<div><br />
<div>I am sorry for the delayed response. &nbsp;I have tried everything mentioned and nothing seems to work. &nbsp;I basically have a product that is currently not fit for purpose in the condition it is in. &nbsp;This is because it takes me ages to create a document that
 would normally would be done in minutes. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My next question to you is, is there any way I can contact someone at microsoft to remotely go on to my computer and fix the problem for me? &nbsp;I cannot find a number anywhere. &nbsp;It is as if they don't want us to contact them and only want us to use there
 forums to fix our issues. &nbsp;In my case, it has not helped the situation (please don't be offended as you have been patient and tried everything).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

</p><p>If it's another person's computer you should be able to Share Office from there by clicking the Share Office 365 bar from the link above. You then have two options Email invite or copy a link. Send the link or email to the
 person who's computer it is and then they can download and install Office. They need to activate Office with THEIR OWN MICROSOFT ACCOUNT, Hotmail or Outlook.com will do if they already have one or create a new Microsoft Account at sign in.</p>

    <title>Plain Text AutoText in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pakinfo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plain Text AutoText in Word 2007</h2>
                    <p>I have added some co-worker's names, that I type often, in Quick Parts section of Word 2007. In Word 2003, anything added to AutoText could be typed quickly after the tooltip "Press ENTER to Insert" appered after typing first few letters. This functionality
 is missing in&nbsp;Word 2007. Consequently, I never used my custom AutoText entries. I find typing the entire text easier than going through dozens of Quick Parts entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently discovered that F3 key can quickly insert full text from Quick Parts if I type first few letters before pressing it. However, I was utterly disappointed to see that the text entered with F3 key is not plain text, instead it has formatting of the
 text that I used to create the AutoText entry. Word 2003's AutoText feature always entered plain text which would assume the formatting that I had selected for my current project. How can I make F3 key enter plain text in Word 2007?</p>

<p>As you already know, AutoComplete does not work for AutoText in Word 2007 (the functionality has been restored in later versions of Word).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to formatting, note that AutoText entries (Building Blocks) are never plain text in Word. This applies to all versions of Word (since at least 1997). What you have to do is prevent direct formatting from being added to your entries as you create
 them. When you are in the process of creating an AutoText entry, be sure to select your example content and press Ctrl+SpaceBar (to clear any direct font formatting) and then create the entry. This prevents direct font formatting from being added.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, if you have selected a whole paragraph (up to and including the paragraph mark, the current paragraph style will be saved with the entry. If that style does not exist in documents where you insert the AutoText, formatting will change in the
 target document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to make&nbsp;use of AutoCorrect entries instead (File | Options | Proofing | AutoCorrect Options | AutoCorrect). These are plain text by default and they will be triggered by specific text strings. For example, you can have "BJ" autocorrect to "Ben
 Jones."</p>

            No, versioning was permanent removed in Word 2007. It was a frequent cause of document corruption. For an alternative approach, see

            Thanks for your response, Suzanne.&nbsp; I never had a single instance of doucment corruption and have been using Word2003 up until this month.&nbsp; I downloaded the ad-in you provided the link to but, it just creates multiple files with different names which is
 what I was avoiding doing.&nbsp; Too bad this feature has been removed it provided quick easy access to electronic files of previous versions all within one file :(&nbsp;

 it says I'm still in a family so I cant join hers yet. How do I leave my current family if there's no parent account so I can join my actual family?

            <p>Hi Leuni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contributing to the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please look up the section in the link below called <strong>"I tried to add an account to My Family, but I receive an error saying the account was already part of another family"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/my-family-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/how-to/wp8/apps/my-family-faq</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get a link where you will need to log in with the account you used as a parental account and remove the child's account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also add a new Microsoft account to the Family your mom has set up and change the main Microsoft account on your phone to the new one by Hard&nbsp;Resetting the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            It will be eventually, all you can do at the moment is wait.<br />
<br />
Updates for some countries take longer than others and updates for network branded or supplied models can take significantly longer.<br />
<br />
Exact release dates for specific product codes are always unknown.<br />
<br />
Also be sure to check for updates on the phone and using a computer as sometimes an update is released on one but not the other.

Maybe can takes up to a month, like my previous 5800 (to be available for UK).Unlocked Generic<br />
<br />
I also don't mean to be negative but with my previous 5800 here in UK some updates never appear for it and hope will not happen't the same

<p>What is so special about our "country variant" phones that we get to wait longer for the updates?&nbsp; I also have the 059C8T6 (US variant dark grey).&nbsp; I can assure you that my phone does not scratch my back, massage my feet or any other specialties that the
 standard version does not also do.&nbsp; In fact my phone seems to be exactly the same as the standard NAM version.&nbsp; Hmmm?&nbsp; Anyone know the difference(s) other than the product number?</p>

<p>I agree with everyone else, what's the deal with the product code release rubbish?&nbsp; These phones are nearly identical, except localization.&nbsp; But then again, Apple and Google manage to do this on a global scale, why not Nokia?&nbsp; It only upsets your loyal users.</p>

    <title>moving old Outlook files to new Outlook installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick lindahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            moving old Outlook files to new Outlook installation</h2>
                    <p>The last Windows 10 update last week apparently corrupted/removed the User Profile so I was no longer able to log in. I thought I would do a reformat, since I back up the PC every day and it had been a couple of years since I did this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Upon installing Windows 10 fresh again and installing Office 365, I realized that I no longer have a .pst file saved in documents to be able to import and get my setting and archived emails back (POP3 archive back to 2003). I'm not sure where the file was
 saved and if I will be able to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;How can I "recover" my old info to the new install of Outlook??</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

<br />I suggest you:
<br />-At the top of your Outlook ribbon, choose File. ...
<br />-Choose Open &amp; Export &gt; Import/Export.
<br />-Choose Export to a file.
<br />-Click Outlook Data File (.pst), and then click Next.
<br />-Select the name of the email account to export.
<br />

<br />Upon installing Windows 10 fresh again and installing Office 365, I realized that I no longer have a .pst file saved in documents to be able to import and get my setting and archived emails back (POP3 archive back to 2003). 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello RIck
<br />
<br />First, the default location for PST files is 
<br />drive:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook
<br />
<br />If you did a full system backup, then you would need to check that location in the backup (make sure to &lt;unhide&gt; all folders. All depends on the backup process followed.
<br />
<br />Assuming you can recover the PST file(s) you're looking for, then don't suggest that you import anything. Instead, for a POP account, make sure to configure it using an existing data file instead of letting Outlook create a new one.
<br />
<br />For an archive PST file, just add it back to the profile. 
<br />Go to Outlook menu --&gt; File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Open Outlook data file

            <p>I don't fully understand the question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're referring to the interface language, it should be rather obvious. Mac Office is language-specific, so if you have the French version the menus, dialog windows &amp; other text elements of the user interface will be in French. If you have an English
 version, all will be in English, etc. Other than that, Mac <em>Office</em> doesn't have a 'language'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Language is a property of the <em>text</em> used in the document, regardless of whether it's an Excel spreadsheet, a PowerPoint presentation or a Word document. The initial Default language for text typed into an Office document is determined by the software
 version. However, any portion of any document can be formatted as being in virtually any language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to determine what the current Default language is set for is to open a new blank document in Word, then go to
<strong>Tools&gt; Language</strong> to see which language is highlighted in the list. The Default can be changed to whatever you prefer &amp; the choice will affect Excel as well. PowerPoint has its own Default language setting.</p>
<p>

            <p>You would think this shouldn't be a "state secret" but the developers at MS must think it is and probably have the language id hidden in binary code in one of the plist files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the PowerPoint plist in ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Powerpoint.plist contains an "Alternate Language Id" reference that indicates a language code. (1033 for US English).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other indicator, though probably not a perfect indicator, is checking for the ACL library name in this path: ~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Office 2011/Microsoft Office ACL [English] the name in braces will tell you the user's default AutoCorrect Library
 language. I am not sure what will be held in the folder if the user has chosen to have multiple language libraries. There are other language specific ACL files that can get generated in this path: ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office
 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one of the other guys knows for certain which of these directories holds the "official" default file that was initially loaded with the installed language specific version of Office 2011.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've a bit of time later to test on a system that only had the English (US) version loaded. The path I provided of
<strong>~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Office 2011/</strong> contains the ACL that was loaded at install time so I would surmise that it is the language version of the Office software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the directory path of <strong>~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office 2011/</strong> are the dynamic language specific ACL libraries that get updated &amp; used day to day by the user.</p>

            I found a lproj entry at /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources which seems to be based on the language installed. For english it is en.lroj, for german de.lproj. Is my understanding correct or is there a possibility

            <p>Yes, that's quite possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on which "core" language you have installed. &nbsp;I believe there are three core versions: English, European, and Asian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought the key I sent you to would update, because MS Office can't switch languages: the user interface language remains whatever was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, they have never disclosed the details of this to us.</p>

<h2>            Home Publishing requiring print test before printing 2 sided docs every time</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, my Home Publishing 2000 works great except it has one annoying issue. When I try to print 2 sided docs, it makes me repeat the print test everytime I print a page, even if it was just printed. How can I fix this? It never happened
 with other Windows upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Sounds like an issue with the printer driver, rather than the program.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But, in reality, Home Publishing 2000 is 16+ years old. The underlying windows printing technology has changed a lot in that time, so it is believable that that the program may not be able to interact correctly with Widows.&nbsp; I think it is entirely possible
 that you won't be able to fix this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What printer and printer driver are you using? You could try installing a different version, like an older one or one for a different printer, of the printer driver to see if that helps with the problem.

<h3> jchengjosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Will Not Sync</h2>
                    <p>My OneNote will not sync, I get a "Saved offline (error)" in the right corner on Windows 10. On iOS, on my iPad, I get a "Working offline (an error occurred)". For both of these, when I try to click on "Sync Now", it fails. I don't know how to deal with
 this, I thought I could wait it out for a few days, but nothing's changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I found that my error code is: 0x2 bdf5f</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a lot of these suggestions for this will not work with this current version of OneNote, I guess it's too new. Like, there's not File button.</p>

<p>Yesterday, my phone ran out of battery so I plugged it onto the charger and left it that way overnight like I normally do. When I tried to turn it on in the morning, a white screen flashed on the screen and it kept going from a black screen to white about
 5 times and then shut off again. It keeps doing this, I've tried taking out the battery and SIM card and&nbsp;waiting for a while and nothing has happened. I've also tried the deep reset&nbsp;thing where you hold down the 3, green key, and * and the flashing still happens
 when I press the key to turn it on. Please help.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint - Bad Redirect on Page Edit Save</h2>
                    <p>I've recently started encountering an issue with updating or inserting Document Library views into site pages via AppPart. On a new page (or or existing) for example, if I insert a document library view and hit save (w/o customization), the browser redirects
 to the Pages &gt; AllItems list view rather than the intended and expected created/edited page. The URL is of the page created/edited page, not the all view--spooky! The only way to re-access the site page is to restore its prior version w/o the AppPart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone able to guess what might be causing this? I haven't made any updates to our install or site / app settings recently, so not sure what's causing this.</p>

<p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create a page and insert a Document library app part to it. After clicking Save button, it shows the correct page and URL. To investigate the issue from your side, could you share with us the following things?</p>
<p>1. Do you refer to SharePoint Online or on-premises SharePoint server? If the issue is related to on-premise SharePoint server, I suggest you start a new thread in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/home?category=sharepoint&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint TechNet forum</a> for professional support. It's the specific channel which handles on-premise SharePoint server related questions and issues. Thanks for your understanding.

            The redirect is determined by the url query parameter - if you add ?Source=url to a document (or any link) that's where it will redirect.&nbsp; So&nbsp; check the url behind the link. No need for screenshots!!

    <title>Excel Networkdays - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. brooke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Networkdays</h2>
                    <p>I am using the networkdays function to give me the workdays between today's date and a future date. In one box, I have the formula =TODAY() and the other box I have the date 11/30/16. I type in a different box =networkdays (E3, H3) which are the proper boxes
 for the start and end date. On the formula box, it says =26, which is the correct number of days. However the formula result = 1/26/1900 so when I click enter, the date 1/26/1900 pops up instead of the number 26. I have been trying this for hours and cannot
 get a number to pop up. I tried inserting today's date instead of using the TODAY() function but I am still getting the same result= 1/26/1900 when all I want is the number 26! My end goal is to take the number 26 and divide by the a different number to tell
 me how many #/26 days. Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>I am running Windows Mobile 6 on my Blackjack 1, I've installed and reinstalled WMDC several times, even turned off my Symantec.&nbsp; It said the device driver was installed successfully.&nbsp; When I plug in the phone it makes a noise and "Microsoft Windows Mobile
 Remote Adapter" pops up in the Device Mangager.&nbsp; However, nothing else happens.&nbsp; The WMDC interface does not show up.&nbsp; What kills me is that it worked fine last fall.&nbsp; It just stopped working and I haven't been able to get it going since.&nbsp; I'm trying to sync
 to Outlook 2007.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi PeelResearch Man,<br />
<br />
Since the MVP has recommended a hard reset, here is some information about hard resets to help you during this process:<br />
</span><br />
Starting fresh with a hard reset can repair a change in the registry because it returns your device to factory defaults.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Doing that will erase&nbsp;the data and software you installed on the device.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, you will want to at least backup your Contacts,&nbsp;Calendar and Tasks. You can do that with a free software
 program called PIM that you can download from </span><a href="http://www.dotfred.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.dotfred.net</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Going forward you can make incremental backups and save them so if another issue occurs, you can restore to a time prior to the issue.&nbsp; Checkout
</span><a href="http://www.spritesoftware.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Spritebackup</span></span></a><span>
 and </span><a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/products/backup/?en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Spb Backup</span></span></a><span>,
 both are excellent and our MVPs would recommend either one.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For more information on backing up your data and synchronization see the Windows Mobile Total Access page protect your data:
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/totalaccess/columns/protect-your-mobile-data.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Back up and synchronize important information</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Once you have performed hard reset, then check it after every application is re-installed to determine which one,
 if any, caused the registry problem. <br />
<br />
Please keep us updated on your progess. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</span></p>

<p>You have done several things that&nbsp; have not produced a positive result as of yet.&nbsp; I would consider doing a hard reset on the device and then try to connect again.&nbsp; The reason I would do that is to eliminate that the issue is the device.</p>

            <p>What is a TAFE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you files will not transfer from one school to another.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a free Office license from your old school, it will expire when you leave that school or when your email account is cancelled by the school.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before your "old" email account is cancelled you should copy all of your files to another location.&nbsp; Your local hard drive, an USB drive of some sort or you can get one (or more) free hotmail/outlook.com email accounts from MS with 5GB each of free space
 on MS OneDrive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The "free" Office 365 for Education is only free while you are at that specific school.&nbsp; You may or may not get another free license at the new school. You will have to check with the new school for confirmation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are very few "free" Office licenses that you can access after you leave school.&nbsp; There are a couple of ways you may be able to get Office through your work, but you will have to worry about that later.

    <title>Excel&#58; Making a break sheet and assigning breakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterhowitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel&#58; Making a break sheet and assigning breakers</h2>
                    <p>I work for a company and we are looking to find a solution to automatically make a break schedule for us. &nbsp;We have the information to put in (employee name, shift, and hours worked), but we have no idea how to have excel automatically spit a completed break
 schedule out for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: to follow US labor law, all employees must take a certain number of breaks per shift based on the hours they work. &nbsp;1 fifteen minute break for 4 hours, 1 fifteen and a thirty minute lunch for 6 hours, and 2 fifteens and a thirty for 7+ hours.
 &nbsp;The first fifteen in a shift needs to be about 1.5 hours into the shift, a thirty minute break must be taken within the first six hours of an employees shift (aiming to take it about 5 hours in to the shift), and the final fifteen must be taken about 1-1.5
 hours before the end of a shift. &nbsp;Currently, we use breakers to give our employees their breaks. &nbsp;Breakers are employees who are given a list each day of everyone they need to give a break to (they take over that employee's duties during their break) and how
 long the break is (15 or 30 minutes long). &nbsp;These breaks cannot overlap (ex. a breaker cannot have two 15 minute breaks to give at 9:30, because they need to cover the employee's duties, so they would need to give a break at 9:15 and then another at 9:30).
 &nbsp;Breakers also need to be given breaks, which they will cover themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goals:</p>
<p>1. We need to automatically generate these employees' breaks</p>
<p>2. We need a way to select employees who we want to be breakers and have the spreadsheet automatically assign them breaks based on their schedule</p>
<p>3. We need a way to automatically determine how many breaks an employee gets based on their shift (so if an employee has a four hour shift, they will only be assigned one 15 minute break)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue how to accomplish this (I assume it will require some complicated formulas). &nbsp;I have a decent amount of excel experience, just not enough to accomplish this, any tips/full solutions would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Below I will have a sort of
 diagram to show the preferred layout of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>

<td>Break 2/3 (30 minutes)</td>
