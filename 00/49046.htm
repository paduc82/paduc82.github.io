<h2>            Windows 10 Error&#58; Code 38</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: AlexPrudnicki </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, i don't know if anybody else has this problem, I recently upgraded to windows 10 pro, and when I tried to down load onto my USB, I get this message:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory. (Code 38)<br />
<br />
The driver could not be loaded because a previous version of the driver is still in memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't reformatted anything, I have tried to delete, searched for hardware changes, all to no avail, any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex.</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to download onto USB device due to error prompt Code 38. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I suggest you to follow below steps and check if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Troubleshooter</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices.
<br />
I suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your USB device. Refer these steps:<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large</strong> icons.<br />
3. Click on<strong> Troubleshooting </strong>and click on the <strong>view all </strong>
option on the left panel.<br />
4. Run the<strong> Hardware and devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall the USB controllers</strong></p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated, similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers are not detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</p>
<p>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Right click on Start and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>", right click on the Host Controller,click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click "<strong>OK</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>(Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed)</strong><br />
3. <strong>Restart</strong> the system and Windows 10 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue sill persists, I would request you to check for chipset driver updates that you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I had same problem and tried every solution listed on this site and many others. Finally after hours and hours of searching discovered that WIN 10 and probably all Windows platforms do not completely flush all memory when powering down. This is done to
 speed up reboot later. To completely flush memory on power down press and hold the shift key down while clicking on SHUT DOWN. I did this and it fixed the problem.

</p><p>Once I updated to Windows 10, my portable DVD created a error code 38. All the other answers did not seem to apply to Windows 10. So after much research this is what I came up with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the <strong>Settings</strong> mode.</p>
<p>2. Click<strong> Devices</strong></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Connected Devices</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;You will see an <strong>error</strong> for the device that is not working.</p>
<p>5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>6. Click <strong>Device manager</strong></p>
<p>7. Click<strong> &gt; for&nbsp; Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong></p>
<p>8. Look for the <strong>USB Root Hub </strong>with orange error symbol</p>
<p>9. Right click it and than click <strong>uninstall</strong></p>
<p>10. Restart your computer with the DVD still connected</p>
<p>My portable DVD started to work. Word of caution if you unplug your DVD player and replug it. The error message will reappear. Just repeat the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this well help some you, like me, who was confused with the others answers given.</p>

            <p>This worked for me and it seems like it has fixed another problem too. </p>
<p>When logging in, sometimes the keyboard wouldn't recognise some keystrokes (and sometimes it would). After applying this fix, the keystrokes began working as they should have.</p>

            <p>The really annoying problem with these solutions is that they all involve re-booting which is not really a solution at all if you are working on a file stored on a USB drive and the work is then lost.</p>

            <p>I didn't have any luck with any of the solutions here, or the one mentioned at
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff184583.aspxhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Tweak Device Manager for a more Complete View of Devices">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff184583.aspx</a> to tweak Device Manager to show hidden entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did work for me was using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/244617/using-driver-verifier-to-identify-issues-with-windows-drivers-for-advanced-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Using Driver Verifier to identify issues with Windows drivers for advanced users">
Driver Verifier</a> (C:\Windows\System32\verifier.exe). </p>
<p>
</p><p>BE WARNED, Driver Verifier is not for the faint of heart: if it finds <em>any</em> suspect driver, even if it's not the one you're interested in, your system won't start. In my case, to get my device working again it was enough to run the standard settings
 against the just the driver file that was causing problems (you can find the name of the file(s) from Device Manager: right-click on the problem entry, then click Properties &gt; Driver tab &gt; Driver Details button).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're finished don't forget to run Driver Verifier again and select 'Delete existing settings'.</p>

            Hi Skar.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />3) Keep checking for Updates at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update to see if a newer monitor is delivered for the TV.  Be aware that not all TVs can be made to display correctly for a PC, especially older ones or ones that are not Smart TV's.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>&#42;An opportunity for Xbox One to dominate&#42; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mythonaut ix  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;An opportunity for Xbox One to dominate&#42;</h2>
                    
<p><em><span>Before I make this pitch, here's some necessary data-</span></em></p>
<p>Both the Wii U and the PlayStation 4 allow users to <strong>play their home console games remotely, on a separate screen</strong>. &nbsp;While the Wii U streams it from the console hardware to the controller's screen via a local link, the Playstation 4 actually
 allows you to stream your games <em>from</em>&nbsp;<em>your console</em> to the Playstation Vita via the internet...
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EVEN IF YOU'RE AWAY FROM HOME</strong></span>. &nbsp;In other words, if you're say... at a coffee shop or in an airport (anywhere with Wifi), you can whip out the PS Vita and start
<strong>streaming your home console games to it over wifi</strong>, while <strong>
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">still taking advantage of your home console's spec</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">s</span></em></strong>. &nbsp;Obviously this is a feature that could act as a selling point to a lot of "on-the-fence" consumers,
 as cloud gaming and remote streaming increasingly become part of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>What's described above is a CURRENT feature... so for anyone questioning feasibility of streaming from a home console to a portable device over wifi, it's already happening. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>HOWEVER</strong></span>...
 Microsoft has the opportunity to<strong> blow the vita's streaming feature out of the water.</strong> &nbsp;Here's how...</p>
<p>Being the developer of Windows, Microsoft has the ability to bring this same feature to Windows PCs, thereby
<strong>allowing anyone who owns a windows computer to stream their games from their home console to their PC ON THE GO</strong>... Not to mention with the USB port built in, they could even use the Xbox One controller with it. &nbsp;Plus, this would sell more Xbox
 platform games as opposed to games sold over Steam. &nbsp;Here's why: &nbsp;To many consumers like myself, the reason to buy a game on PC is to play it on a laptop on the go... however, having the ability to do this while taking advantage of my home console's specs
 would be distinctly preferable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Not only should this be integrated in Windows PCs, but Microsoft has already gained access into<em><strong> virtually any portable device</strong></em> via the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SmartGlass</strong></span> app. &nbsp;Upgrading the SmartGlass app to allow users to stream their games from their home console to their portable devices over the internet would be a huge selling point to many gamers...
 and it would render the PS Vita feature superfluous. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As a gamer, I'm telling you... mainstream casual gamers who aren't willing to shell out money for an additional gaming device (like the PS Vita) would go nuts for this feature.</p>
<p>Then just release a plastic attachment that mounts onto the Xbox one controller with a slot/stand that
<strong>grips your smart phone in place as a screen</strong> on the controller, connecting the smartphone to the controller via micro usb, allowing for controller support on your smart phone.</p>
<p>As far as I can see there is nothing non-feasible about this. &nbsp;Microsoft <em><strong>already has their foot in the door</strong>
</em>for this with <strong>SmartGlass </strong>and<strong> windows OS</strong>. &nbsp;It's not as if portable devices wouldn't have the specs to handle this idea. &nbsp;Keep in mind,
<strong>the game would actually run on the home console, streaming only the audio and video to the portable device via high speed internet</strong>. &nbsp;The remote device simply needs to be able to receive a live stream, and send back the user's controller input.
 &nbsp;So if a smart phone can sufficiently handle face-time or any live stream 2-way communication, it should be able to handle this concep<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">t</span>, given that both ends have a solid internet connection. &nbsp;Of course, lag would
 be a consideration, but theoretically it wouldn't be any different than the lag between two players on Xbox Live.</p>
<p>For many consumers,<strong> this integration would shatter the post-Mattrick consumer conception that Xbox is "the bad guy" and Playstation is their "best friend".</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>The praise would be remarkable, because this feature wouldn't even require consumers to buy an additional device!
</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vita costs somewhere in the range of 250 bucks, so if Microsoft integrated this feature through SmartGlass, Xbox would dominate this aspect of the competition. &nbsp;As a consumer who doubles as an enthusiast of the gaming industry, I'll go out on the limb
 and claim to have some valuable perspective...</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Please hear me when I say that this is how Xbox can take the lead.</strong></span></p>

<p>I think most people would simply find it easier to install their games directly onto their PCs and/or laptops and not even bother with the console to begin with. Even though it is an interesting idea in theory, I doubt the quality of the stream would make
 it feasible (at least for now). On top of that, I don't know many people who would carry a full-fledged game controller around just so they can play on the go.</p>

<p>Your idea is very flawed, and here is why....</p>
<p>Casual gamers who have a PC/laptop dont have a powerful enough rig to run xbox games. And if you think millions upon millions are going to run out upgrade their laptops to play games on the go you are wrong.</p>
<p>What really is going to help Xbox dominate is software. When people start to realize Xbox has the big games, more people will flock to it.</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
I have the same problem. I can't figure out how to purchase a windows 7 ultimate license. I don't want windows 10. I just want genuine windows 7 ultimate with a valid product key so I can get on with my life. I don't want anything to happen to my data, either.
 This is getting ridiculous. My laptop came with vista apparently because that's the code on the bottom, but my friend who gave me this computer, has put windows 7 ultimate on it as well. I do not have his product license key. He was using it at his business
 so maybe he had a business license that needs to be renewed? I don't know. It says the copy isn't genuine. I don't believe that. I think it just wants a renewed license key. I can't find one, tho. I guess I'll just deal with the annoying popup if there's nothing
 else to do.</p>

<h2>            Scratch on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Yesterday, I realized that my new Xbox One has a little scratch on the top part of the console. This is corcening me because I just bought that Xbox a couple of days back, so it's practically brand new. I wanna repair or do something for taking the scratch away. But, what should I do? Does the guarantee covers it?&nbsp;I am really worried because, like I've mentioned before, the Xbox is new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please help me as soon as possible. I don't know if whether fix the scratch or leaving it beacuse many&nbsp;people told me that the scratch is really small (which in part is true) but I want the Xbox with a very good appearance as long as possible. Help me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PD: I'll leave you a picture of the Xbox and the scratch.</p>

<h2>            Sea of Thieves No Longer In My Library</h2>
                    I've had Sea of Thieves for about a year now but haven't played it in a couple of months. Went to download it and now I don't own it?? Not even in my purchase history. This is my only Microsoft account. Support brushed me off. Help please. Cannot stress
 enough how much the phrase&nbsp;[Mod Removed - Profanity]&nbsp;Microsoft" applies in this situation.

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply clarifying that you are using a PC. Sorry to hear that Sea of Thieves isn't showing up in your only known Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is your primary account and you are still unable to access the game (and were not previously a Game Pass subscriber), it may be due to a licensing issue, which sadly, we here on the forums are not able to assist with as we lack the necessary tools
 to do so. You would need to request a call back from Xbox Support so that they may investigate why your account isn't recognizing that you own the game as previously recommended by XBF Crystal.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>The best way to request a call back from a member of our support team is from the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> section on the bottom of any of our support pages.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Select </span></span><span><span>Contact Us.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Choose your category. (In this case, Xbox on Windows 10.)</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Select "See Other Options" when presented the virtual agent.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your description, I understand that the issue you are facing is related with the copy and paste issue on your Windows 8.1 computer. I will certainly help you with the same. However, we need few more details to understand the cause of the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you facing this issue on Notepad?</p>
<p>2. Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<p>3. Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently?</p>
<span>&nbsp; </span><em><span>Note: To know the KB numbers of the windows updates, follow the underlying steps:

<p>
</p><p>If you mean that you want to transfer your conversation history&nbsp;from classic Skype (7.40)&nbsp;to the new versions (12.18 or 8.17), I'm afraid it's not possible. Only the latest conversations will be shown in the app. But moving forward with this version, your
 chat history will be saved in our cloud for two years. So when you log in to a new device, your conversations will automatically load.</p>

    <title>Skype For Business - Mutes My Head Set After 10 Seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael allen &#40;mallen&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype For Business - Mutes My Head Set After 10 Seconds</h2>
                    <p>Recently our office has licensed Skype for business, since the install we have been working out a few kinks. Seems we have just about all of them figured out except one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have Sennheiser Head sets - if we have the headset on Computer audio about 10 - 15 seconds later the headset shuts off or mutes.</p>
<p>Like Skype is taking precedence - so we shut the option to let a program take precedence over the headset. (allow applications to take exclusive control of this device) off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;We did have telephone sounds at first (dial tone, then busy signal), but i figured out how to shut all those sounds off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help me out here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE - i have figured out a work around. IF i disable my headset and then re-enable it. This will keep my headset on until i click back onto Skype, then 10 - 15 seconds later, back off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Michael Allen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, we suggest following this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-audio-and-video-in-skype-for-business-62777bc6-c52b-47ae-84ba-a8905c3b71dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to check audio settings on Skype for Business when encountered any audio issue. Please view this link and try to follow the steps in it to see if it works for your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also check and update the device and other devices’ drivers via Windows
<strong>Device Manager</strong> to see if issue persists. If the issue persists, please try to re-install the device and see the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check whether you have the latest version of Skype for Business client: Open any Office 365 version of apps, for instance, Outlook-&gt;File-&gt;Office account-&gt;Update Option-&gt;<strong>Update Now</strong>.
 And if the updates couldn’t fix the issue, could you please provide the version number to me for analyzing (Skype for Business-&gt;Help-&gt;About Skype for Business).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b154ec-b74a-4689-b20e-1f3972f1b607?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78b154ec-b74a-4689-b20e-1f3972f1b607?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, may I confirm with you the following information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What did that mean by “until click back onto Skype”?</li><li>How did you configured to allow applications to take exclusive control of this device (is that as shown below)?</li><li>Whether your device would working without this issue on other PC client?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f10db31-b8fe-487f-8c05-7ece71247acb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f10db31-b8fe-487f-8c05-7ece71247acb?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>Thank you for the reply, We are running the current Skype version Skype for business 2016 MSO 16.0.9226.2126 (32 bit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked drivers for all audio and have looked for updates for all office products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Same thing is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your question #1 - I can get the Headset to function correctly when i disable it, then re-enable it from device settings (sounds). This will stay fixed until i click back on to the Skype window where my contact list is. (bringing focus back to Skype)
 once i click on a contact to send a message to them, my Headset goes back to muting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #2 - yes that is the area, i shut those options off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #3 - this issues presented it self after the installation of Skype for business, this is an issue for 15+ other users in our office. No one had any headset issues before the install of this product.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Michael Allen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check whether this issue is related to network connection, May I know if the impacted PC clients with this devices are in same network environment with other clients which works well? If you switched to
 different network environments, could this issue occurs?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the drivers have been updated, you may try to uninstall the device via Device management then re-add it to see the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check whether you have any other audio application running on PC background and exit it, some audio applications would affect Skype for Business operations. Meanwhile, whether your headset works well
 with other audio application on your PC?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you click one contact to send a message the headset is mute, is that means if you call someone, or in a meeting, the mic is mute? If so, whether you can unmute it via clicking the unmute icon on Skype
 for Business?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3570f2b4-789d-4e32-8aee-d6bdcdad4816?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3570f2b4-789d-4e32-8aee-d6bdcdad4816?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Have you or your admin set any conferencing policies on Skype for Business online (or local server), since there is an option about allowing IP Audio in meetings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>The issue is still present. IT has nothing to do with my network, and everything to do with Skype for business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close my Skype this issue goes away, and my head set acts normal and wont mute or shut off.&nbsp; I'm not a new user to Microsoft or Skype, I service 3,000 users weekly with technical issues. This one has our whole office amazed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you fully understand our issue. let me try to break it down again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our headsets are Sennheiser OfficeRunner they have 2 options on them Phone and Computer audio, you can switch these back and forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we installed the new Skype for business our Computer audio side of the head set disconnects or shuts off after 15 seconds or so. (computer audio option use to have a dial tone, then busy signal, then it would shut off, I turned the sounds off)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with our system or network, this issue presented it self after the Skype for business install.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you said when you choose back to Skype for Business, the Computer audio side of Head set is disconnect, mute and shut off. Since we couldn’t find that device in Skype for Business qualified devices lists,
 if possible, please use another Headset which Skype for Business support to see:

<p>Hi Michael Allen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, I have updates this post. For your question, we usually suggest users to use Skype for Business supported devices, if the device isn’t support by Skype for Business, it may not work
 well with Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>App data is a hidden folder, if you couldn’t see it, click Start icon, in search field, type Run-&gt; type %AppData%-&gt;then you will be navigated to Roaming folder, go back to the upper level AppData folder-&gt;and
 find the correct folders via location I previously posted:</p>

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 8.0 to 8.1 getting stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hi -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently acquired a Lenovo W530 laptop. &nbsp;This laptop was used in a corporate environment and was supposedly reimaged back to the factory image before I received it (it had been used as a Win 7 laptop). &nbsp;It now has Windows 8.0 Pro. &nbsp;I would like to
 upgrade it to Windows 10, but as I understand it, I have to first upgrade it to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have been trying to do this unsuccessfully for the last several days. &nbsp;My first step was to apply all outstanding Windows updates. &nbsp;My next step was to use the
 Lenovo Update and Drivers tool to update all drivers on the machine. &nbsp;NOTE that in the Control Panel, this tool is labelled "Lenovo - Update and Drivers (32-bit)" but the laptop is running a 64-bit OS. &nbsp;Also, this tool hangs when trying to install the most
 recent WLAN driver. &nbsp;The driver seems to work, but I'm wondering if that might be some or all of my problem. &nbsp;Every attempt to upgrade hangs at the "getting devices ready" point. &nbsp;Sometimes it gets to 100% before it hangs, sometimes only to 93%. &nbsp;When I reboot,
 I always get the error 0x101 - 0x30018 (one time I got 0xC1900101 - 0x20030018 which is suspect is basically the same error). &nbsp;I have looked through the WindowsUpdate.log and don't see anything obvious (by that a search for the above errors shows no results).
 &nbsp;I did note on one website the statement "Some editions of Windows 8 don't support updating to Windows 8.1 from the Store, including Windows 8 Enterprise, Windows 8 Pro (if installed using volume licensing or activated using a Multiple Activation Key), and
 preview versions of Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. &nbsp;The last 5 characters of the Product ID are AAOEM and so I'm also wondering if that could be the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, in an effort to save time on each of these "do-overs", I have downloaded and created an ISO DVD that I'm using for this install. &nbsp;I assume that shouldn't make any difference to the error being received.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I'm at a loss as to what my next step should be. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't say where the&nbsp;8.1 Pro came from or who installed it; just that the corporation reinstalled 7 before you acquired it and it now has 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This part of your information&nbsp;is correct.</p>
<p>Volume Licensing does not allow 8 &gt; 8.1 upgrade&nbsp;through the Store.</p>
<p>That is a free offer for home users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Volume Licensing the upgrade for 8 &gt; 8.1 is done through Software Assurance, which, as a private user, you do not have access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: As a private user you should not be using a Volume License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi Bill -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for a company that provides employees with laptop computers. &nbsp;These computers are refreshed (e.g. replaced) every three years. &nbsp;The company policy is that when the computer is replaced, the employee can keep the old computer. &nbsp;Ownership is changed
 and the computer or the hard disk is shipped back to the corporate offices where they are reimaged back to the original factory image. &nbsp;In the case of this particular machine, while I was using it, it had a Win 7 image. &nbsp;However, the machine evidently was
 originally a Win 8.0 Pro machine. &nbsp;So, now I'm trying to upgrade to 8.1 so that I can upgrade to 10. &nbsp;I see the tile for the upgrade, but it fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to provide an update on &nbsp;this issue. &nbsp;After playing with this for several days and not making any progress, I noticed that Microsoft was offering to perform the update at a Microsoft store at no charge if the user was having problems. &nbsp;So, I took
 the laptop into the local Microsoft store. &nbsp;They told me it may take a couple of days. &nbsp;Two days later, they called and said that they were also unable to upgrade from Win 8 to Win 8.1 and asked if it would be OK to just restore the Win 8 image. &nbsp;As this was
 essentially a new machine to me, I did not have any personal data on it and readily agreed to whatever install they wanted to do. &nbsp;They said they would call back in a couple of days after they completed the upgrade (or just clean install of Win 10?). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are fortunate enough to live near a Microsoft store, that would be the easiest solution. &nbsp;I am typing this on an an old Dell laptop that originally shipped with Vista (I think in 2008) that I upgraded to Win 7. &nbsp;I just completed the upgrade to
 Win 10 with absolutely no issues even though the Dell site tells me that they have not tested this machine with Win 10 and a search for drivers on their website doesn't even list Win 10 as a choice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help.</p>

            <p>Well, as a final update, the Microsoft store couldn't figure out how to upgrade the PC either. &nbsp;They did manage to upgrade it from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro but couldn't upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I am still trying to upgrade to Windows 10, but now at
 least have a starting point of Windows 8.1. &nbsp;It fails consistently at 32% total completion, 6% configuring devices. &nbsp;The error I'm receiving is 0xC1900101-0x20030018. &nbsp;As far as I can tell by googling this, it appears to be a driver issue, but I can't figure
 out which one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a Lenovo W530 ThinkPad laptop run a 64-bit OS. &nbsp;I have successfully been able to upgrade a W510 ThinkPad without any issues.</p>

<h2>            Unblock someone on skype</h2>
                    How do I unblock someone on skype.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am desperately trying to unblock someone I blocked on skype.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are no options that I see to unblock someone. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The older version of skype gave you an option to unblock. The new version is horrible. No option to unblock.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp;

<p>1) Click your avatar (centered above the search field) to open the profile page.</p>
<p>2) Click Settings to open those.</p>
<p>3) Towards the bottom there's a Contacts setting. Click the Manage Blocked Contacts right there.</p>

            Hello again. Unfortunately if you are logged into the correct account I would guess that you (as are many users) are affected by a known bug in the new version of Skype. Microsoft is working on a bug fix but no ETA as if yet. In the meantime many users have chosen to return to classic Skype until the new Skype is further developed

 ese codigo para que me den un codigo que si sea del gamepass sin embargo aqui en la pagina no me deja hacerlo pues dice error en la pagina verifica la region...

<p>Hi there WirelessFlame78,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update with the issue of redeeming a card on the Microsoft Account. If the incorrect card was purchased, we do not have the tools or resources to change the code. I recommend to try redeeming the Microsoft Card to the account and try to purchase
 the game pass subscription. Before making the purchase, make sure to place a back up PayPal or credit card on the account. Not doing so, will give you an error message : "How would you like to pay the rest."</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>If the problem persists, I recommend to </span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>contact Customer Support</span></span></a><span><span>for further assistance.</span></span></p>
<p>

            A monto te refieres a la cantidad? Por que si es asi su monto es de 25.900pesos colombianos eso significa que debo usar la tarjeta de microsoft para comprar el game pass SIN tarjeta verdad?

<h2>            Japanese keyboard layout</h2>
                    <p>Hi! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 4 here in the States with U.S. keyboard layout. &nbsp;Since I am used to using Japanese keyboard layout (i.e., when I hit "Shift + 7" with Japanese keyboard layout, I get " ' (apostorophe)".). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how I can get this setting in windows 7, but not sure how to in windows 10. &nbsp;Please someone help me on this?</p>

 I have 3 email accounts, for 2 of them, I can't send or receive mail (or sync the accounts), for the 3 one, I was able to get a message today in my inbox, but can't seem to send one. I have tried deleting the accounts and reinstalling them, it didn't change
 anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The error codes I am getting are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Server Error: 0x800488A6</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800488A6 </p>
<p>
</p><p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Server Error: 3204</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8DE20003 for the second account</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE August 11th:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the password on my Live account and discovered that the old one was apparently 1 character too long. So I then deleted and recreated my account once again, for maybe the 4th time, and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this account now started&nbsp;syncing&nbsp;and is working fine&nbsp;(no more error messages).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I decided to do the exact same thing with my H<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">otmail account:</span>&nbsp;I reset the password, deleted and recreated the account, but this time it didn't work. The message I get is: "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows
 Live Mail is&nbsp;synchronizing&nbsp;this account. Check back in a few minutes to&nbsp;read your messages".</span> But even after a few hours, there is no progress and I still can't receive or send mail. If I try to send mail with this account, I get the same error messages
 as before!</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE AUGUST 25th</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">With no useful help from Microsoft here, and also being unable to use my printer (no more updates and no driver that works with Windows 10)
<strong>I have decided to revert to Windows 7! And yes, Windows Live Mail is now fully functional again!

            <p>Thanks for your reply. Nothing has worked so far. I followed the different links to the posts from: Ratandeep, then Hal Spragg, ael_G and EP2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the post "how can I resolve machine configuration issues in windows live mail" from Ael_G, (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/how-can-i-resolve-machine-configuration-issues-in/7462aa67-6131-4504-a11b-7060a95c694b) I
 was unable to do the step 4 for " SSL security DLL libraries may not be properly registered": I got an error code for the following commands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regsvr32 wintrust.dll</span></p>
<p><span>REGSVR32 initpki.dll</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't know the meaning of these steps, I just follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p>Also, the step 5 for "Incorrect entry in the hosts file": I didn't see anything relating to mail that I could remove. But maybe it's different with windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any advice? Can't Microsoft do some kind of update/fix to the mail app?</p>

            <p>Microsoft have clearly done something in Windows 10 that messes up the synchronisation of hotmail accounts.&nbsp; I have the same problem as all the above posters.&nbsp; My e-mail account with hotmail.co.uk is now showing error code 0x800488A6 following an upgrade
 to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; As usual Microsoft is not owning up to its own mistakes.&nbsp; Why don't you just fix this.&nbsp; For the record, my other e-mail accounts are working, including one at hotmail.com.&nbsp; Maybe something to do with linkage to Facebook?&nbsp;

            <p>I was the original poster of&nbsp;a similar thread, and I have now solved MY problem, as follows, and I hope this may help others.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Went to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Manage my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; From there I clicked my icon at the top right hand corner&nbsp;and selected Sign In with Another Account.&nbsp; Signed in with my&nbsp;Hotmail.com account details and then was taken to this Account page.&nbsp; I clicked
 on the Inbox and could see all the Hotmail.com emails.&nbsp; I then signed out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then closed all the Settings windows and ran Windows Live Mail, and hey presto! all the Hotmail.com emails were downloaded into WLM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has now worked for me on my Lenovo laptop (main computer, and also a VAIO PC, and a Surface Pro tablet.&nbsp;

            Thanks for this.&nbsp; I have also solved my problem which was with a hotmail.co.uk account.&nbsp; Yesterday I accesssed this account via Firefox and Outlook.com.&nbsp; I then reset my security information and gave an alternate e-mail address (non-hotmail) account for
 a verification code, which I received and entered. I looged out of Outlook on the browser and back into Windows Live Mail - the hotmail.co.uk account was now working.&nbsp; I have checked again today and all accounts are now OK.&nbsp; Not sure why this worked but it
 did.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi - In Windows 10, if you click the Start button, Settings is the 3rd option up from the bottom in the left-hand column.&nbsp; Or alternatively, if you click the Notifications icon in the taskbar at the bottom right corner of the screen, All Settings is the
 3rd one up on the very right of the squares at the bottom of the Notifications panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From either of these places, you can then select Accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Cowboy1618,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is error you get when installing the files?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When did this issue start?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Was there any changes done prior to the issue?</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>For Windows Installer errors try this:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. On the "Start" menu, Type Run in search bar and hit enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the "Start" menu, click "Run".
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENT</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>For Windows Update:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method A</span></strong><span>: Verify Internet connectivity
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that you can successfully access other Web sites. If you can’t successfully access other Web sites, your Internet
 connection may not be working correctly, and you might want to contact your Internet service provider for help.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can successfully access other Web sites, continue with Method B.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method B:</span></strong><span> Make sure that Windows Firewall
 is turned on, and temporarily disable third-party firewalls </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning</span></strong><span>: This workaround may make a computer
 or a network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend this workaround but are providing this information so that you can implement this workaround at your own discretion. Use this workaround
 at your own risk. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To complete this method, follow these steps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Make sure that Windows Firewall is turned on
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To do this in Windows Vista</span></strong><span> and in Windows
 Server 2008, follow these steps: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. To open Windows Firewall, click Start , click Control Panel , click Security , and then click Window Firewall .<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click Turn Windows Firewall on or off .
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.Click On (recommended) , and then click OK .<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Temporarily disable third-party
 firewalls </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do this in Windows Vista and in Windows Server 2008, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, and then click Control Panel .<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click Security, and then click Security Center . If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type
 the password, or provide confirmation. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note
</span></strong><span>Please select Control Panel Home in the navigation pane on the left side if this option is not already selected.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Under Firewall, read the firewall status note. This information will indicate which, if any, firewall is installed and whether
 the firewall is turned on. For example, for ZoneAlarm, the notice will say Zone Alarm Firewall is currently ON . There will also be a green On button in the corner on the right side of the firewall section that indicates that the firewall is currently running.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Open the third-party firewall application that is listed in the firewall status note, and temporarily disable the firewall.
 If necessary, refer to the firewall application documentation, or contact the application vendor for more information about how to temporarily disable the application
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Additional steps are in the KB article “You may encounter temporary connection-related errors when you use Windows Update or
 Microsoft Update to install updates” <span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941</span></a><span>

    <title>Windows Update Error Code 9C48 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kat_005  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error Code 9C48</h2>
                    I keep getting this error every time I try to update Windows.&nbsp; I have read through all the post on here &amp; other sites&nbsp;I could find &amp; tried many to find a solution to this problem.&nbsp; My biggest problem is that when I go into my Programs &amp; Features section
 there is no Internet Explorer 9 listed so that I can uninstall it.&nbsp; If it's not there, how can I uninstall it?&nbsp; I also tried going into the command feature &amp; uninstalling it that way (another way I read in a post) but it didn't work either.&nbsp; I tried restore
 my computer to an older restore point but it only goes back so far and I think I upgraded to IE9 back in November.&nbsp; Any help PLEASE would be nice!!! Thanks!

            <p>Every time I turn on my computer, my Windows Update says I have 7 important updates &amp; 2 optional updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Security Update for Windows Vista (KB2724197)</p>
<p>2) Security Update for Windows Vista (KB2758857)</p>
<p>3) Security Update for Windows Vista (KB2770660)</p>
<p>4) Security Update for Windows Vista (KB2779030)</p>
<p>5) Update for Windows Driver Framework version 1.11 for Windows Vista (KB2761494)</p>
<p>6) Update for Windows Vista (KB2748349)</p>
<p>7) Update for Windows Vista (KB2779562)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 7 important updates are successful for the time being but always come back saying I have 7 important updates everytime I turn on my computer. So apparently it's not updating if it's pops back up everytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2 optional updates are:</p>
<p>1) Windows Internet Explorer 9 for Windows Vista</p>
<p>2) Bing Desktop v1.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only select the Windows IE9 update and it fails everytime &amp; I get the error code 9C48.&nbsp; I don't exactly have to have this update but I feel it may be causing the problem maybe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>1) Apparently all of the updates are not successful since it pops up everytime I turn on my computer.</p>
<p>2) I wanted to uninstall IE9 and see if this was contributing to the problem, plus this IE9 has been nothing but a headache so I would like to go back to old IE if possible.</p>
<p>3) Yes, I get the Error Code 9C48 everytime I try to update IE9.</p>
