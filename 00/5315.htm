<h2>            &#34;Collaboration&#34; menu option available to view PWA interface in Project Pro 2010</h2>
                    Is the "collaboration" menu option available to install so that the PWA interface can be viewed within Project Professional 2010. This functionality can be referenced to Project Pro 2007 / "Collaboration" menu options where you could select Project Center
 or Resource Center (for examples) and the PWA interface would open in Project Pro 2007.

    <title>Internet Explorer 11 sometimes acts weird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dottyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 sometimes acts weird</h2>
                    When I click on the scroll box on the vertical scroll bar, the window and all the content, looks weird like it's distorted. (See illustration). Why does it do this? And how can I prevent it from happening again? I've tried refreshing the page, exiting
 out of Internet Explorer, restarting my computer, but nothing works. It doesn't do this all the time but occasionally. Actually, "occasionally" is one time too many. I'm using IE11 on Windows 7 on a desktop computer.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/318b475c-a624-4843-94be-5efe2a4e79b3" />

<h3> jeffstouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft has Failed to manage my account&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I received an email from MS saying that my Credit card had been declined (the expiration date had been updated and my security code had been changed by my provider.) In the email that MS sent me, they graciously (or so I thought) provided me with my Name
 and User ID. The email then told me to login to my account (providing me with a link:&nbsp;<a href="http://click.email.microsoftonline.com/?qs=4483c8baa1f3a1e6408be6418a1b344a68b157fb571542a11aa7348defa50b749660ad469476503b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx</a>,
 which I clicked on.</p>
<p>I then entered my user ID and was told that the account does not exist!!!!</p>
<p>Why provide me with false information? If that is not the correct ID, then why send it to me? I cannot login to my account because that is the account that MS says has expired, but then when I try to login, the account does not exist!</p>
<p>Anyone else having trouble following this screw-up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want from MS is the correct credentials so that I can login and take care of this issue. Every time I tried to login, I was told the account doesn't exist (but when I click on the address above (I see a glimpse of the account name, before I get shunted
 to a login screen.)</p>
<p>Unbelievable! What a waste of time! If this happened to Bill Gates, or Steve Ballmer, the person responsible for this lunacy would be fired...</p>

<h3> mklein2836  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013-Meeting text is blank after sending response</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with one of my users that I cant seem to find an answer for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User&nbsp;sends an email to&nbsp;Assistant asking her to setup a meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistant goes up to<br />
calendar and&nbsp; selects the day/time/attendees and goes out to get the dial in<br />
info to include. Works perfectly so far.&nbsp;User clicks accept and sends a<br />
response and this is where it breaks.&nbsp; The text of the message disappears<br />
and only his original email&nbsp; to&nbsp;Assistant is included in the body of the meeting<br />
as an attachment, not text. If he clicks accepts and does NOT send a<br />
response then the text shows up as it should. <br />
<br />
I did the same with one of the tests by clicking accept and sending a<br />
response and text showed up normal. The other attendees also send a response<br />
and have no issue. Something with only him. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing, when he clicks accept and sends a response, the attachment has ONLY his original email to the assistant requesting the meeting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of us are on Windows 10 (he did state that this has been&nbsp; going on with just him for about 3 years, so prior to Win10) and Outlook 2013.

<h2>            White boxes around icons on Internet Explorer</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I hope you can help.<br />
<br />
I have just recently done a reboot and had to reinstall windows onto my pc. I have spent the last day downloading various updates but for some reason even after installing what I thought were the latest drivers for my Nvidea GE FORCE 9500 gt I keep getting
 strange white boxes around various images on various sites, the pages themselves&nbsp;are not alligning properly either its like the site is all out of wack,&nbsp;now I am not sure if this is because I need to download Active x, Direct x etc etc but again I have downloaded
 what I feltwere the latest versions of all of these and it still has made no change. I do believe the site is using some sort of javascript but I have downloaded that too...<br />
<br />
I would post a screen shot of the problem but can't on these forums.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hey Steve Hartill,</p>
<p>Antivirus and antispyware products that are set to scan internet data can cause problems. Your firewall may be set to block pictures or your antivirus or anti-spyware scanner may be removing data or disabling features. Some firewalls may block advertisements
 (and other graphics) so that you only see a red x, or block scripting. Some will block access to sites according to keywords.</p>
<p>As such disable all your antivirus and other security software. Now try to access those websites. If you end up being able to view the pictures perfectly, that would indicate that one of the security softwares installed is causing problems. Enable one at
 a time to determine the culprit application. Once you figure out, you might have to add certain exceptions within the firewall setting to allow access to those pictures.</p>
<p>Another method you can try is to reduce the security setting so the browser. Settings the security settings too high can prevent you from accessing the web site which hosts the image.</p>
<p>Reset to the default security settings. In Internet Explorer, click on Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Security -&gt; Default Level.</p>
<p>If there’s still no go, try resetting Internet Explorer to its default settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered. Rather than resetting everything, you might want to reset specific settings or delete your webpage history.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information, see:<br />

<p>As a last resort, uninstall all the ActiveX controls and reinstall them back. See where it takes.</p>
<p>That should be it for now.</p>

            <p>His Windows update is stuck, so being patient wouldn't give him the new build via windows update. &nbsp;There are ways to purge windows update as an alternative and hope that it works, but the ISO is available directly from Microsoft, and it works fine.</p>

</p><p>If you use the ISO, it's not only a clean install - it can preserve your apps and data the same way it would using the upgrade.</p>

            Hi,
<br />this is file from DVD video disk. Unfortunately Windows 10 does not have codec for such videos so Windows Media Player can not play them.
<br />You need to buy DVD player from Microsoft Store ore use third-party programs.

<h3> aedan comey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Collapsable Headings, a Table of Contents, and INCLUDETEXT fields that rely on Mail Merge Fields</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2013 and have several documents that I have to generate frequently, they're very similar but involve a few different moving parts based on a few variables. I've built an Access 2013 database where you can pick your variables and it creates
 a table entry that has the path to each word document with the corresponding parts. I've built a mail merge for 2 of the documents I need to generate that uses the INCLUDETEXT field then a Mail Merge from the access Table to input the parts and it works great.</p>
<p>For the remaining documents, there is a table of contents, then collapsible headings for each entry. I want those headings to be drawn from other Word files and inserted via mail marge. I've tried formatting the source files, merging the formatting, not
 formatting the source files, inserting from bookmarks instead of the entire document and nothing works. Any ideas?<br />
It looks like this, but with a ToC that reads off the section headers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Header</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. {INCLUDETEXT "{MERGEFIELD M_0101}"}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. {INCLUDETEXT "{MERGEFIELD M_0102}"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where the fields contain a path to a word doc which contains something like</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Title Point 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Text 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Text 2</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Text 3</p>

            Using a matching list style and headers in both the master document and the source documents seems to have solved the issue. The info from the site below was helpful in setting it up.<br />

            <p>Here's some more detail that I dropped in a different thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a similar problem...and then some:</p>
<p>When I sync a playlist, it pulls the entire album from every artist in that playlist automatically.</p>
<p>However, the songs I want to be transferred, i.e. the playlist itself, don't seem to make it across.</p>
<p>It keeps throwing up errors such as "unable to sync playlist", "unable to delete [song]", "unable to delete [video]" even if they're files that are no longer on my device.</p>
<p>I've done a complete reset of my device and tried to sync fresh yet it still thinks these files are there and is trying to 'delete' them to sync over but obviously gets confused when it realises that there is nothing there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried forgetting the phone and erasing content on my Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the same on my Windows 7 computer at work using the latest Zune software release - brought it home and it still thinks I have files on my phone.</p>
<p>It's really starting to annoy me as it all happened when I wanted to add 2 more songs to an existing playlist - now I have zero media on my phone.</p>

<p>If your machine is currently running Windows 10 it should be able to upgrade to the Anniversary Edition.&nbsp; As for when it becomes available to you, that is another question.&nbsp; I expect upgrades to be available in a staged fashion, starting on 2nd August.&nbsp;
 What starting on Aug 2nd means depends on how MS deals with time zones.&nbsp; In my time zone it has been 2 Aug for nearly 10 hours now, but none of my public build devices have been offered the upgrade yet.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3725D5E2-14F1-48A2-9169-7180F9FF1494">kasmax</a>. There's no feature on the phone that
 will send you an email as a reminder, but you can check the Nokia Store if there's an available app related to your concern. On your phone, go to the
<em>Nokia Store &gt; use the search field to find an app &gt; for example, type the word "reminder" or "calendar reminder"</em>. If you're going to download the app, make sure that you are logged into your Nokia account. BTW, app availability depends on the app developer.
 So, if you need to know more about it, we suggest contacting them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Is someone using my hotmail account &#63;</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to sign in to my Hotmail/outlook account yesterday I received the following message :</p>

<span>It looks like someone else might be using your account&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps as per the process (ignoring the request for card details - strange) but all emails returned from Microsoft informed me that insufficient information was supplied and as a result I cannot
 gain access and now am being advised to&nbsp;create a new account. I can still see my Hotmail account on my IPhone, but it has not updated for a few days now and I am being told the username or password is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect my account may have been hacked, but at the same time I need more than "view only" access to this account, and would greatly appreciate any help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Office 2016- Used Migration Assistant and no spotlight search</h2>
                    <p>I I just upgraded to the new 2016 MBP and used Migration Assistant to move my data to the new MBP.</p>
<p>I am using Office for Mac 2016.</p>
<p>It worked great, and everything is working on the new system, except Spotlight Search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I force a re-index so my search will return?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried the method where you drag the files to the Privacy section and then remove them, but no luck.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Spotlight on OSX sometimes does not behave as expected and can run into issues, which requires re-indexing the search database for Mac Outlook.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be done using the following steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Terminal by going to Applications --&gt; Utilities --&gt; Terminal
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type "mdimport -L" </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. If you see more than one instance of&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter, delete the Outlook application that you are NOT using, empty it from the Trash, restart your Mac, and go back to Step 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Now re-index your Outlook database using the following command, substituting your own &lt;user_name&gt;:
</span></p>
<p><span>mdimport -g "/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter" -d1 /Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook\ 15\ Profiles/Main\ Profile&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note in the command above the path after "-g" is the default path where your Outlook is installed. The path after "-d1" is the default path to your profile. You will have to substitute your actual paths if you have renamed your profile
 or installed Outlook in a different location. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. After starting the command in Step 5 it will take some time to complete re-indexing. Please wait until the re-indexing completes.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. Quit and re-launch Outlook.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After following the above steps search should start working again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            What font are you using?
<br />What font size?
<br />
<br />Kerning only works on specific pairs of letters IF the font has been designed to allow kerning.
<br />
<br />Kerning works best for large font sizes. It is almost imperceptible in the 10-12 pt size range.
<br />
<br />This article has a couple of points about kerning:

<br />Summary: When you need to adjust the space Word uses between characters, you need to adjust what is called "kerning." This tip explains how you can make the adjustment you need. (This tip works with Word 2007, 2010, and 2013. .)

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you mean the point size in kerning or just the general font size? Well I have never heard of kerning before until this year. The only reason I figured out what kerning was, I noticed my words on my resume were spaced apart all weird. I have never
 encountered an issue like that when typing out my resume in the past. Whenever I have typed in the past the words have been spaced evenly always. So I looked up how to fix the problem and found kerning. But has not helped.&nbsp;

            Both font size and pts used in kerning are important. 
<br />
<br />But what I think you are looking for is justification or what MS calls "align" / "alignment".  If you happened to pick the wrong one, even accidentally, it can make your work look really bad.  There are ways to tweak it even more.
<br />
<br />Getting Rid of Choppiness in Justified Text  <a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/T008139_Getting_Rid_of_Choppiness_in_Justified_Text.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordribbon.tips.net/T008139_Getting_Rid_...</a> 
<br />Justified text doesn't always produce the best-looking results. Here's how to avoid some of the choppiness that can occur.
<br />
<br />
<br />Understanding Paragraph Alignment / Understanding Justification <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Am8lVyUzjKfphXAxm56R5_uCjZzj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/w/s!Am8lVyUzjKfphXAxm56R5_uCjZzj</a> (Tweaked version of article) One of the most basic ways to align paragraphs is to set the alignment used for the text in the paragraph. Word provides four different ways to align text, as discussed in this tip.  
<br />Paragraphs can be aligned in four different ways. This tip examines those alignment methods. WT R 1 Nav

<br />by Charles Kyle Kenyon, Esq. 
<br />Virtually all horizontal justification in Word is done with respect tab settings or to the left or right indent (not margins). Tab settings and indents are paragraph level formatting best set in Styles. This chapter has a companion Word document that was used for the screen shots.

<br />Automatic hyphenation inserts optional hyphens. An optional hyphen is a hyphen that Word uses only when a word or a phrase appears at the end of a line. If the word or phrase moves to a different position because of editing, the optional hyphen is removed.  Ref Mailing Review View Dev.docx

</p><p>However, "but some of the slides don't appear properly to my recipients opening on their PCs" doesn't really give us much to work with. What exactly is the problem?&nbsp; What's changed from what you see on your Mac to what they see?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you by any chance using Adobe (ie, Type 1/PostScript) fonts rather than TrueType fonts?&nbsp; If so, that might be the problem.&nbsp; Office no longer supports PostScript fonts even if they're installed on the Windows PC.</p>

            Hello. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.<br /><br />That's correct. By using the Report option you will inform that you think this is a Phishing so they can add that info to the servers and by Blocking you just will block all emails coming from that email address. <br /><br />Best Regards

<p>Hi zawnyan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Nokia Discussion boards!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried downloading Nokia store from <a href="http://store.ovi.com/search?q=nokia+store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Then click send and a download link will be sent to your phone. If this does not work for you, you can try a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard reset will delete all data from your phone, so be sure to back up your information before doing so. To perform a hard reset, enter *#7370# into your keypad and whem prompted, enter 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you solve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>haZey</p>
