    <title>View settings not applied to Library sub-folders - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            View settings not applied to Library sub-folders</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to W10 1607, I've found the folder view settings applied to my libraries will not perpetuate down to the sub-folders at all. I already tried the suggestions from&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/win-10-libraries-use-same-view-settings-for-all/c606a2a4-ab5b-4e26-97f4-50c059c9f0f6?auth=1
 with no effect. Currently, I'm having to manually change the column widths, locations, and sort by settings on each individual folder. Is there some way via the native View settings (or even modifying the registry) that I can get my desired settings applied
 to all folders within a library?</p>

            You need to recheck all your customised settings as you will find many have changed as a result of upgrading.

            <p>I understand the need to reset some customizations after an upgrade, but that's not really addressing the question. I've gone through and updated my folder views as desired for my local disk. However, the view settings are not applied to libraries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, there is a Documents library by default which includes C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents. If I go to that specific address, the view settings are customized as I'd like. However, if I view Libraries\Documents it's using some default view setting for
 General Items which I've already overwritten (yet it is not applied). If I take the time to change the view for Libraries\Documents, I cannot use "Apply to All" from the Folder Options | View settings, and I have to go through every individual sub-folder to
 get everything displayed as I like. This cannot be a purposeful decision on Microsoft's part since the behavior didn't happen when upgrading from W8.1 to W10. It was only after the 1607 upgrade that this presented itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a way to set folder view settings for Libraries in a manner that they can be applied globally.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Unfortunately this did not change the behavior. I even tried deleting all my existing libraries, restoring the defaults, and then repeating the process of resetting all the Folder View settings to default but it doesn't change the behavior. For whatever
 reason, libraries appear to be exempt from Folder View settings application in 1607 and it's extremely frustrating. If anyone else comes up with a workaround, I'm all ears.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Stuckfree,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand that you want to know why <span>Ctrl + Alt + DEL are considered as a secure method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If your computer is part of a domain, domain-wide policies may have been set that override the settings you make on the local computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Disabling the <b>CTRL+ALT+DELETE</b> sequence creates a "security hole<b>." The CTRL+ALT+DELETE</b> sequence can be read only by Windows, ensuring that the information in the ensuing logon dialog box
 can be read only by Windows. This can prevent rogue programs from gaining access to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On MS-DOS-based computers (and some older UNIX-based systems), pressing
<b>CTRL+ALT+DELETE</b> gains the attention of the BIOS, causing a "<b>warm</b>" reboot. You can use the keyboard to shut down the operating system. On Windows-based computers (starting with Microsoft Windows NT), the
<b>CTRL+ALT+DELETE</b> sequence is intercepted by Windows. The advantage of the keystroke-intercept technique is to help prevent Windows from being shut down by someone who does not have access to do so.

<p>The Windows file and folder structure is exactly what you make it. When transferring pictures from one machine to the other then a simple way goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag the various folders from the old PC to a flash disk.</li><li>Connect the flash disk to the new PC.</li><li>Drag the flash disk folders into your Pictures library.</li></ol>
<p>In this way you end up with exactly the same folder structure as you had on the old PC.</p>

<p>BULLSHIPS!! Default Folders,i.e., 3D Objects,Desktop, Documents Downloads, Music,Pictures, Videos et-EFFING-cetera, nested under This PC, has above it a Desktop and nested an Administrator's username which has nested beneath it same as aforementioned plus
 AppData,Contacts,the already mentioned that also has nested beneath some of them other folders,repeated from This PC, essentially some are repeated with added Favorites, Links, MicrapsoftEdgebackups(that is perpetual you can't remove it it seems)Saved Games,Searches,
 Security Scans, then Collapsed This PC is alone below Admin Username, THEN the C:\ drive whatever its name is with users nested personally named Folders, and where system files are and nested Then Collapse the C:\ drive and you see the structure with any other
 drives listed, then Library (which when expanded gives repeats with nested folders Camera Roll, Documents, Music Pictures, Saved Pictures, Videos, Collapse Liibrary and again Drives listed and Network Folder, Control Panel Folder, Recycle Bin Admi Tools and
 Network Connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I realise there are options to display all folders, Show Libraries and Expand to current folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, under Appdata is Local, LocalLow and Roaming, with Default Folders depending on the user the Nested Default Folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is under the C:\ drive the system folders has one called users in that it has Default,Public, Admin User,so named(the major user) folders, and nested under each of those 3 Options is every socksucking folder I have already named for each of those
 Folders, that is 16 Default Folders under my major username, that is repeated under user, with Default having 10 folders and Public with 11 Folders, with my username again, 16 MORE Folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you're missing the point, if you rely on Windows to use Defaults based on whatever the criteria it uses to decide, the freaking file could end up ANYWHERE, plus often just selectinjg a folder is a waiting game as each read of each folder is real
 time even if the contents haven't changed.</p>
<p>Something is screwy here.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the C: drive and its Folders, or Directories, where the structure where there was no Deafault screwups. Now if I download a file to a browser that I have directed where to put it, somehow it ends up in what was the old(still there) Documents
 and Settings. With Libraries which repeat what is in defaults, yes 2 places, but actually in one but with so many repeated names it's damned confusing, and simple housekeeping in File Manager is impossible. I'fd rather remove every Default Folder and name
 the ones I want the files to go, cuz Windows does a pisspoor job of keeping track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure this is what the questioner Lizabelle was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mi-CRAP-SOFT's Flie structure sux, and to try other managers?, but they are dependent on MICRAPSOFT, so back to the rabbithole you guys send us on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sole user of this PC why do I have to have so much I don't use, the repeated Document Folder in and under several places. NO ONE, i.e., ME has no need for so many redundancies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Addendum:</p>
<p>All of this is on a single PC, and networking other pCs makes it another nightmare scenario with Shared Docs and crap</p>

            Hi Lizabelle, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />The easiest way to move photos from one location to another would be to copy and paste them. If you've used an app to manage your photos, they can sometimes copy them into multiple locations depending on how the app works.
<br />
<br />Copying and pasting the files is as simple as selecting the ones you want to move, pressing Control+C, then browsing to the location you want to move them and pressing Control+V.
<br />
<br />Also, in case you'd like to move it, you can move the location of your Pictures folder to wherever you'd like on your PC. Here's a tutorial on how to do this:

<p>Are you kidding me?&nbsp; I have thousands of photos from 1991 on.&nbsp; It is impossible to cut and paste from one computer to the new one.</p>
<p>I have never used the one note.&nbsp; now i not only have multiple places where my pictures seem to be located, but they have added a new set of Pictures under my name.&nbsp; PLUS my old pictures are there, but cannot be viewed because they have been changed to an

<p>I get it, and I'm with you on that. For some ignorant reason I thought the posts were ceased for this topic, and commented to the one who had a suggestion Frederick Long, so read my reply to him and let me know ifit helps, though nothing I said solved it.
</p>
<p>So I try to work everything from the C:\ drive that is under the Folder This PC, give the drive a unique name and work from the drive I find using the Default Folders confusing and I lose files all the time, relying on the File manager to place the files.
 For some reason, lately every action I take Windows creates a Shortcut for, extensions are .lnk, and any Programs I use, I get from the Taskbar, where I created the 2 Programx86 and Program Folders.</p>
<p>My point is you can create your own file folder locations,by using the file extensions, and since you create the place for&nbsp; them, they are NOT being placed by MICRAPSOFT's Defaults.</p>
<p>I wish I could remove the 5 Folders called Documents, the 5 called Downloads, etc.</p>
<p>Not sure it'll help ya, but it's what I do.</p>

            Sorry for the confusion - you won't need to copy and paste each individual photo. You can copy and paste the folder that contains all of your photos, and they'll all be moved in one action. It might take a while for the computer to move the photos, but you can just let it run through the process - you just need to copy and paste once then let it go!

<p>I have spent hours trying to find all of my pictures.&nbsp; They are NOT all in the same place on my old computer.&nbsp; Now I have 4 or 5 complete sets of the same pictures on my new computer and cannot find the old pictures on the old or the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried getting down to the pictures, Documents etc and just loading that on to the Seagate but now I'm completely lost and I have to get some work done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET THE PICTURES INTO ONE PLACE WITH WINDOWS???</p>

<p>Which folder contains all my pictures?</p>
<p>I have the following:</p>
<p>Quick Access - Pictures</p>
<p>I Cloud Photos</p>
<p>I cloud Drive</p>
<p>Desktop Pictures - twice</p>
<p>This computer- pictures twice plus public pictures</p>
<p>Camera Roll</p>
<p>Pictures</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pictures</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pictures</p>
<p>&nbsp;Camera Roll</p>
<p>&nbsp;Icloud Photos</p>
<p>&nbsp;Xmas 2008</p>
<p>&nbsp;Iphone 4s</p>
<p>&nbsp;Public Picures</p>
<p>&nbsp;Camera Roll&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saved Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these have lots of the same pictures, but I found my 900 Africa pictures, finally on the i Cloud photos file and the old 2007 photos with a group that was repeated three times, but not the fourth time.</p>
<p>Im sorry to dump on you, but I really do not understand why this is happening.&nbsp; I am worried because I found some of my 90's photos that were changed to an EXP file which is not recognized by anyone, so it appears that I have lost all of those.</p>

<p>Some specifics would help (file system paths to folders)</p>
<p>Start by viewing the Properties for the folders under <strong>This PC</strong>. Look at the
<strong>Location</strong> tab, that will tell you what file system folder is designated as your 'official' Pictures, Documents, whatever folder. The folders under This PC are just special shortcuts to these file system locations. The same is true of the
<em>UserName</em> folder on the Desktop --- it's just a shortcut to C:\Users\<em>UserName</em>.</p>
<p>Libraries are just saved searches --- a way to view content from multiple folders in an aggregate view.</p>
<p>So you may have duplicates of your photos or you may be seeing the same content from 3 different virtual paths:</p>
<p>This PC &gt; Pictures</p>
<p>UserName &gt; Pictures<br />
Libraries &gt; Pictures Library</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which get their content from the same file folder:</p>
<p>C:\Users\UserName\Pictures</p>
<p>or possibly:</p>
<p>C:\Users\UserName\OneDrive\Pictures</p>
<p>In which case, you will also find your photos under:</p>
<p>OneDrve &gt; Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you may have duplicate views, but not duplicate files.</p>

<p>In your first post you wrote <em>"</em><span><em>I am so frustrated by the crazy windows file structure"</em>. I get the impression that someone dumped lots of pictures all over the place on the old PC.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Transferring them to the new PC will not solve the problem. You will first need to clean up the mess on the old PC. Here is how you can do it:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder C:\Users\Lizabelle\Pictures.</span></li><li><span>Tweak the frame so that it fills the bottom half of the screen.</span></li><li><span>In the View menu, select "List".</span></li><li><span>Open another instance of File Explorer.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to the <em>iCloud Photos</em> folder.</span></li><li><span>Use the right mouse button to drag this folder to the bottom frame. Select&nbsp;<em>move</em> when prompted.</span></li><li><span>Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for every folder that contains pictures.</span></li></ol>
<p>Seeing how your pics are all over the place, this will take some time. The final reward will be that they will be stored where they belong, namely in the Pictures folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will now be ready to copy them to the new PC. Do NOT MOVE them - keep the originals on the old PC until you're sure you have them on the new PC.</p>

    <title>Mixer Overlay On Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xdangerxdavex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixer Overlay On Xbox</h2>
                    It would be REALLY nice if the Mixer overlay on Xbox could be either transparent or not shown at all. Or maybe just a little red dot in the corner during streaming. Especially when streaming from LightStream when most of us already have a chat bot and
 really do not need to see a small portion of our screen taken out by the overlay. Just saying...the option would be nice. Thanks.

            The big Mixer Overlay panel is a lot of annoying often hiding on the screen where you need to see it. And when it moves again it bothers in something else. The panel could be smaller or better devised, that's true.

            Well the millions of people that stream directly from their Xbox which Microsoft, Mixer and Xbox all promoted have to deal with an overlay on their screen while playing a game. It is (in many peoples opinion) unattractive.&nbsp; And if a stream app is not being
 used, you do not have to see it at all.

            I can definitely agree with your point. I see no reason that the overlay couldn't be transparent. Hopefully they'll run an Idea Drive about Mixer within the

<h2>            Downgraded to Windows 7 off of Windows 10. Now asking me to change my product key.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>When this computer was first purchased, it's OS was Windows Vista Home Premium, then updated to Windows 7 Ultimate. A few months to a year later, it was updated to Windows 10. I decided to downgrade back to Windows 7 Ultimate, and now it is asking for a
 new product key and that "You have XX days to activate. Activate Windows now." Then I click it, and I have three options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Buy a new product key online.</li><li>Type a different product key.</li><li>Contact Microsoft to resolve this problem.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I really do not want to buy a new product key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1525.</p>

            <p>How did you downgrade back to WIndows 7?&nbsp; The modern way is to use&nbsp; a backup image which preserves activation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reinstalled then you'd of course need the Product Key.&nbsp; Use the Product Key which came with your Windows 7 Ultimate retail Upgrade disk.&nbsp; If you didn't save it then you'd have to buy another one.&nbsp; It's available on Amazon.&nbsp;

 was go back to Windows 7.</p>

            <p>There are no dumb questions so ask all you need.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible the activation is cracked and not Genuine.&nbsp; It indicates it is factory activated SLP and with Ultimate that is rarely Genuine.&nbsp; However the brand is correct so I suppose it could be a Dell Installation disk purchased for Ultimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andre may have something more definitive on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to test this for sure is to try inserting the Product Key found by running
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ProduKey</a> to see if it will activate.&nbsp; The only reason it shouldn't is if you insert any wrong characters (so double check) or it is cracked.&nbsp; In that case you'd need to buy Genuine Windows 7 which is still available via Amazon and a few other major online
 sellers.&nbsp; Unless you know you need the few extra expensive features in Ultimate I would buy Home Premium and do a
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">
Clean Reinstall Windows 7 .</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to do that then I'd do the far superior <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade</a> which resolves all issues with Upgrade.&nbsp; Read over the link carefully to see if it answers all questions. &nbsp; If you know for sure the Upgrade was activated on the PC it should reactivate with the Digital Entitlement for the
 life of the PC.&nbsp; If it passed Genuine Check during Upgrade then you should be OK.&nbsp; But at worst you'd need to buy and insert a Windows 10 Pro Product Key&nbsp; or reinstall Home Version with the cheaper Home key.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>As you have tried SFC tool etc, Check if reinstalling all apps fixes for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Start Menu</strong> and type <strong>powershell</strong>. It'll automatically start searching for the program and will show PowerShell in search results. Now press
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</strong> keys together to launch PowerShell as Administrator. Alternatively, you can right-click on PowerShell and select "<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>" option.</li></ul>
<p>Then Enter the following command that will reinstall all the modern apps in Windows :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get-AppxPackage -allusers | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -register "$($_.InstallLocation)\appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode}</strong></li></ul>

            <p><span>Hi
<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/20b14d24-9c00-4d01-993a-79912c3afbbc">Pranjal</a>,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting this query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any recent changes in the Computer prior to the start of the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that windows update is failing.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to hear that. Do not worry; I will surely help to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:
</span></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type “<b>sfc /scannow”</b> without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then I would suggest you to make sure “Background Intelligent Transfer Service” is enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press “Windows key + R” from your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “”services.msc” without quotes in the “Run” Window and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Search for “Background Intelligent Transfer Service” service.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right click on it and select “Start” option.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Close the “Services” window.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot
 helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup
 items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each
 startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that
 are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes
 the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that
 are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item
 that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. 
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps you. If the issue still persists, please feel free to reply back.</span></p>
<p><span>I would be glad to assist you further.</span></p>

                    <p>Every time I start up the computer the page for G:\ Drive appears on screen. I was advised to perform a clean boot but that seems to have been a temporary fix as the fault reappeared after a few hours.

            Hello, I am sorry to hear that you are having a severe BSoD issue. IRQL Not Less or Equal means that there is a communication error between the RAM and the operating system. This means that the operating system might be corrupt or in worst case, the memory or the RAM itself is broken. One thing you could do to fix this is to do a system file check and run DISM health restore. More on that here:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />If that suggestion does not work, I would recommend for you to do a clean install of  Windows 10 from a bootable USB. This will ensure you that you have all the system files for Windows 10. Also before you do this, try and see if all the device drivers are up to date. If any of the above do not work, you may want to check if the RAM is causing the problem. If you are able to open up your computer, try taking out one stick of RAM and see if it boots up and is normal.
<br />Hope this helps, and feel free to let me know anytime if you are having trouble!

            Hi,
<br />Looks like you have verifier enabled.
<br />Please disable verifier first(Verifier /Reset in Run dialog box)
<br />
<br />Second, Please uninstall  Intel(R) Turbo Boost Max Technology which should resolve your issue.
<br />
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for IntelNit.sys

            Hi vegas,
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates IntelNit.sys as the cause of your crashes
<br />
<br />That is the  Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 software on your PC
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device, then download and install the version of that software they recommend, it may well be an older version, but it will at least be compatible with your system . . .

<p>Na verdade o que acontece é que a live é um serviço prestado em dólar, quando você compra eles convertem aquele valor mostrado em reais para dólar com a cotação do dia, só que você paga com a cotação do dia em que pagar a fatura( lembrando também que toda
 compra em dólar incide aproximadamente 6% de I.O.F, e a live deixa claro que o valor é isento de impostos),
</p>
<p>Então seriam se você só tivesse comprado a live gold por R$89,00, ainda pagaria pagar uns R$5,00 de imposto, o que levaria a uns R$94,00, esses R$ 4,00 são exatamente diferença de cotação.</p>
<p>O aviso da live mencionado, é justamente porque alguns bancos não mais aceitam esse tipo de transação, onde o valor é mostrado em uma moeda(Real) e cobrado em outra(Dólar). E isso aconteceu justamente porque muitas pessoas estavam reclamando do banco por
 situações como essa.</p>
<p>Espero ter podido explicar o que aconteceu.</p>

When an account is deleted it is held by security for at least 30 days.&nbsp; At the end of that time you should be able to create a new account with that email address.<br />

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do I need to do anything about this? Is this related to a new problem?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have recently got a Windows Action Center error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Restart to repair drive errors</strong><br />
<strong>We found errors on a drive. To repair these errors and prevent loss of data, restart your PC now. The repair could take a while to complete.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The restart completes (doing very rapid checks), and after a minute or so Action Center displays the same error again. This happens every time I start the computer. Sometimes the computer boots straight to the Start screen, and sometimes it boots to a blue
 screen with the option of sending a report to Microsoft before completing the boot. Sometimes it sends a report with no action required.<br />
<br />
I have checked the hard drive using PC Checkup with MyDell, and with TuneUp Utilities, and no errors are reported. Using CHKDSK C: /f /r /x does not complete, but gets stuck at 13%.<br />
<br />
I have also used chkdsk to check the two USB external drives that I use, and no errors are found.<br />
<br />

            I had this problem on my machine a few weeks back.
<br />So I know exactly what you mean. 
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings
<br />Make sure that guest and public sharing is off.
<br />Make sure that guest and public network discovery is off.
<br />Try it
<br />
<br />If that still doesn't work then add a static IP with your gateway being your router.
<br />Try it.
<br />
<br />If that still doesn't work then use Powershell (this is what I had to end up doing)
<br />Open Windows PowerShell in admin mode. Start -&gt; PowerShell -&gt; Right-click -&gt; open as administrator
<br />Get current profiles. Make sure you are logged on to the network you want to change. 
<br /> Type  Get-NetConnectionProfile
<br />Change the network in your list to be private
<br />Type Set-NetConnectionProfile -Name "MYWIFINETWORK" -NetworkCategory Private
<br />Check that everything went fine
<br />Get-NetConnectionProfile

            <p>It will continue to work as normal, of course, this depends on the edition, if its Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows 7 Professional, it should continue to work. If its Enterprise edition, then it might stop working.

            Hi Mike
<br />
<br />You seem to have the full Skype for Windows application and the Skype for Windows 10 app installed on your PC
<br />
<br />You only need one version, you can use either on your PC since you are using Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps
<br />
<br />How many version(s) of Skype show in that list?
<br />
<br />You can remove either version, which will not affect the other version, those are not connected in any way . ..

<h2>            Error privacy and online multiplayer</h2>
                    <p>On my Xbox One, when I try to play online, I get a message saying: "To do this, change a setting", telling me that I can not use multiplayer online games because of how my account is configured. Then my father logged on his profile on Xbox.com and tried to change the setting mentioned in the message to my profile, noting however that it was already allowed that works, in fact on my old Xbox360 I had no problems... Sorry for my english.</p>

<p>HI,</p>
<p>on your console its self you can go to the system setting options, then under your account tab you can select privacy and online safely and see what is set there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also sometimes you have to reboot your console for the changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>            WiFi</h2>
                    My Windows 10 PC suddenly quit recognizing my WiFi network and listing it as a connection option. &nbsp;Other devices in the home still recognize it, and my PC is able to recognize other WiFi networks when taken elsewhere.

<p>Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I went through all 3 approaches, and I believe I did them correctly although I'm no computer guru, and still no luck.&nbsp; Will recognize other Wifi systems in range but mine not listed.&nbsp; After Step one above, I got to the
 final step after running troubleshooting and got the response:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Problems found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have no preferred wireless networks</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer&nbsp; is set to manually connect to 'ResidenceInn_Guest'"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never even stayed in a Residence Inn so not sure how that even got in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I ran the other two approaches but back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about ready to pitch this in the trash and buy a Mac!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!!!!</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

<p>I did a system restore last night, going back to before this problem started, but no luck.&nbsp; However, although I went through those steps, I never got the option to go back to previous version of Windows so maybe that would make a difference.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?</p>

            Are you willing to perform a manual downgrade?
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
