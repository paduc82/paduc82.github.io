    <title>How can I relocate the source file in windows movie maker 2012 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I relocate the source file in windows movie maker 2012</h2>
                    <p>In WMM 12 the source file is usually located in the c drive and if you move it from them to another drive the clips in movie maker become invalid because the program is looking for them in the original drive. So is it possible to change the location of source
 files to another drive and have MM recognize that?</p>

            <p>Hi Nic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you import a video, audio, or picture, the file remains in the original location from which it was imported. If you will edit the source file after it was already imported into Windows Movie Maker, the changes that you make to the file will automatically
 appear. However, if you will move the source file to a different location after it was already imported, it may not be recognized by Windows Movie Maker anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try moving the source file to a different location before importing it to Windows Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns.</p>

            <p>Yes, each time you load the project, Movie Maker will look for the files in the original location. If it can't find a source file, it will show it with an exclamation inside a yellow triangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you have to do at that point is double-click on one of the problem clips and navigate to the new location. Once you have fixed one file, all media items in that folder will also be relinked. Be sure to save your project after fixing the location.</p>

<h2>            no google account option when adding accounts to calendar</h2>
                    When I try to add an account to the calendar in Windows 8 it only gives me two options: Outlook and Hotmail. No way to add Google account to sync the calendars. How do I get the option to appear? My google account is synced with my account/email. &nbsp;P.S.-I
 have tried to input my google info into both of those and it doesn't work... Please help! Very frustrated.

            There might be some problem with the Calendar app. Try searching the windows store for Google accounts or Gmail and install one from the available app. The app may have its own calendar functionality.

    <title>xbox live gold issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hojuts  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox live gold issue</h2>
                    <p>I have xbox live gold valid&nbsp;until December but every time I try to play an online game it brings up a screen that asks me if I want to purchase 1, 3, 12 mo xbox live gold. I click No Thanks because obviously I have xbox live gold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend told me to reset the xbox and I did this two ways: pressed the xbox button on my physical xbox as well as unplugging the power cord.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem still persists and I want to know how to fix the issue. I found something online that tells me to download my profile and load it on my xbox again but I don't know how to do that and I wonder if there is an easier way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know; this has been going on for days and I'm starting to get annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Warzone REQ bundle DLC Share not properly conveyed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Warzone REQ bundle DLC Share not properly conveyed </h2>
                    
<p>My brother and I share our games and DLC through the Home feature and we both were expecting the REQ Bundle to share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To our dismay, we were not able to do so. The DLC redeemed on his account, downloaded onto both XBOX Ones, and activated. The XBOX clearly showing it downloaded to my Xbox, but not allowing me to open or find.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is the store description:</p>

<ul>
<li>Game Description:Gear up for Warzone and Arena multiplayer with the Warzone REQ Bundle! The new REQ System provides players with an unprecedented amount of choice and strategy. Experience multiplayer with the Warzone REQ Bundle, 14 Premium REQ Packs. Amongst
 the highest-valued REQ Packs in the system, the bundle delivers randomized content in the form of unlockable weapons, armors, vehicles, and more. These packs provide a greater chance at unlocking some of the rarest REQ Cards available including Mythics - legendary
 items so rare, so storied, and so powerful that they can change the course of entire battles. Get ready for the next evolution of Halo combat with the Warzone REQ Bundle!* *Warzone REQ Bundle (includes 14 Premium Requisition Packs, with 2 releasing on a weekly
 basis) requires Halo 5: Guardians game, Xbox Live Gold membership (sold separately) and broadband internet; ISP fees apply. Online multiplayer requires Xbox Live Gold subscription (sold separately).
</li></ul>
<p>No where does it state that it's excluded from the DLC share feature. There is no disclaimer, there is no link to a TOS specific to this DLC, and our Limited Collector's Edition does not have a disclaimer anywhere.</p>

<p>I have contacted support and I've been told that I'll need to go ahead and buy the DLC for $25. I was told that the DLC is similar to Grand Theft Auto's Shark Cards (and similar DLC) in that they will not transfer to other accounts. I do not see the similarities
 as they are able to be purchased multiple times, while this DLC is finite.</p>

<p>I feel deceived that I cannot access this content although it's a one-time purchase and downloaded to my XBOX. The exclusion was not properly conveyed and I'd like to see if there is anything else I can do.</p>

<p>It's always like that with microtransaction DLC.</p>
<p>It only works on the account that paid for it.</p>
<p>To be honest I don't really see why they have a download for it.</p>
<p>Also officially you are not supposed to 'Share' DLC in the manner you describe. It's just a loophole so they don't really have to explain anything in the description.</p>
<p>Officially you are only supposed to share your DLC with friends if you are actually signed in and online on their xbox. You are not supposed to use the Home feature for that purpose.</p>

<p>Support last night made it clear that Game and DLC share was a feature. They even went through the the process of showing me how to set it up just in case.</p>
<p>The Limited Collector's Edition defines the Warzone REQ Bundle as an add-on and not a microtransaction.

<p>My apologies.</p>
<p>I missed the part you said brother. So i'm assuming you live in the same house which is what the home share feature is for.</p>
<p>For some reason I thought you meant share with a friend. That would be a loophole.</p>
<p>As for micro transactions being DLC. Yes they are often downloaded but locked to the account that bought them. Either that or they are locked to the first account that uses it after downloading.</p>
<p>It's probably because they are only supposed to be used once. My guess is each microtransaction download has it's own unique serial number which can only be used once.</p>

<p><span>Greetings MattWGordon,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the feedback in regarding your question. As stated by support, that portion of the bundle content is not DLC, but an in-game consumable item and not applicable for Home sharing.&nbsp; REQ packs
 can be purchased separately in-game or earned in game.&nbsp; For more information on this system in Halo 5, please refer to the post here:

https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/blog-posts/halo-5-guardians-req-system-introduction</a> &nbsp;for more information."</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that clarify any question/concern you may have.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<p>I understand this, what I don't is why this was not explained upfront or on the product's packaging. It's treated as DLC (downloads to his and my XBOX Ones), but immediately changes once in-game? It's tricking people and from other posts on this site and
 elsewhere, I'm not the only one with this feeling.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I can also understand why the Gold, Silver, and Bronze REQ Packs do not work with the Share Feature. They can be purchased an infinite ammount of times. The Warzone REQ BUNDLE works differently though in so many ways. It can only be purchased once and downloads
 to the actual console.</p>

<p>Hello? Is that really it? Just "suck it up, give us more money"? Microsoft advertises a product with no disclaimer and we're SOL? That's a bit much. It's not my fault.</p>
<p>It would be different if the Warzone REQ Bundle was mentioned to not transfer. It would be different if there was better communication between the seller and buyer. As a buyer I know there is a responsibility to know what the product I'm buying is, but I
 did just that and was still burned. I'm forced into paying an extra $25 ( if I want the product) because Microsoft did not do their end of the deal.</p>
<p>Why is the option removed to buy the REQ Pack if it's not supposed to transfer? Why is it downloaded to my XBOX One (and account) if it's not supposed to transfer? To me this whole situation is filled with deceit.</p>

<p>They're consumable items, no one should have to be told that you can't share an item sold as a microtransaction. If you bought a $50 Xbox card would you expect to get one for each console? They already let you share games and dlc with the home console feature.
 I just don't get what your complaint is, "Give me free doubles of in game items"? No one is forcing you to buy 2 req bundles, in fact you can only buy 1 per account, but who ever actually purchases the bundle is the one to get the packs.
</p>
<p>Also the actual cards you get from the req bundle is not downloaded to your xbox, just your right to open 2 free packs of random cards per week. If you were to get banned from Xbox live those remaining packs would be forfeited, where as an actual dlc which
 is bound to your xbox can be played even when your account is inactive (as long as it's downloaded at the time of restriction). If they did what you suggest they should people would just bounce gamertags and no one would buy the bundle, just piggyback off
 of others.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 recognises the cable BUT does recognise the printer - it says no printer attached</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 and USB to Parallel Cables</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was inadvertently upgraded from Windows 7 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a label printer with a parallel port connected with a USB to Parallel cable working perfectly in Windows 7.&nbsp; The cable is an ATEN UC-1248B</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Windows 10 recognises the cable BUT does recognise the printer - it says no printer attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went out and bought a generic USB to Parallel Printer cable and it too gives me the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this label printer to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the printer driver retained&nbsp;when the upgrade happened but it is greyed out and no matter what USB port I tell windows I am using, it remains greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Windows 10 now absolutely not work with USB to parallel cables. I have no drivers I can find to add. What can I do to get Windows 10 to see a printer that worked perfectly well in Windows 7?</p>

            <p>OK - I've resolved it and it was partly a combination of the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 doesn't seem to like you adding a printer if it can't detect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much playing around I managed to install a printer manually with a local connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than choosing Lpt1 etc. I chose USB004 as I was pretty certain this was the cable. I did a test print and watched the printer spool screen. I could see the job flashing up for a moment and then disappearing. The printer didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then loaded the latest driver for the printer which was Windows 10 compatible updated the driver and did a test print. The printer came to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works! How long for, I don't know, but it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows still thinks there is no printer attached as per the image above, but it prints regardless. Only goes to show - not to believe everything windows properties tells you.</p>

            Hi,
<br />All the crashes point to memory corruption. There might be a 3rd party driver involved, but let us check the Memory first.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memtest86-test-ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memte...</a>
<br />If you have a DDR4 RAM, use MemTest86 rather than MemTest86+
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).
<br />
<br />Disclaimer:
<br />There are links to non-Microsoft websites which would provide accurate and safe information. Watch out for ads on the sites which are frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). There is no need to buy paid products to fix your computers as they do more harm than good sometimes.

            My apologies, the passmark one only allows you to get 4 passes which I thought should offer you 8. Please run memtest86+(the first one) which should test for 8 passes.

            Microsoft is not what you need to be 1080p compatible.&nbsp; You failed to mention what Logitech software.<br />
<br />
You need:<br />
<br />
video card, video card drivers and LCD monitor that does 1080p<br />
<br />
Video editing software that handles 1080p<br />

<p>I'm wondering why users like you don't search the forum before posting question. Most of the issues I see&nbsp;have been already encountered by somebody else and an answer is already provided. So if&nbsp;users searched before posting question, they could save&nbsp;lot
 of time and energy. I'm not picking on you. I'm just trying to get some insight. Is the search not working or folks don't know what to search?

<p>Thank you for the information, Debbie. Upon checking the model of the computer, the latest updates for its drivers are only in available up to Windows 8.1. The drivers of your computer may be encountering compatibility issues with Windows 10. This can be
 the reason why you're unable to install the update. We highly recommend contacting Asus so that you can verify they have updates for your drivers which are compatible with Windows 10. You can access this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and click on
<strong>How to find out an OEM’s contact information</strong> to know how to contact Asus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to resolve the Windows Update issue, you can follow the steps found in the link that we've provided in our last reply.</p>

<p>I figured it out for my computer!! It was a hardware conflict of all things. I needed to remove the wifi card from my Gateway computer, manufactured by Anatel. I found the solution on another board and am so relieved, I wanted to share it everywhere. The
 update ran just fine after removing the card. FYI, I wasn't connected to the Internet using the wifi, just having the card in there was enough to cause a problem.</p>

<p>How did you remove the wifi card from your gateway? I know this has to be the issue as i've read many people with this problem and the same PC as me. However, I cant find how to take the card out of my computer (DX4860) anywhere online. I have no experience
 with the hardware in my PC i've just opened the side panel and immediately gotten really confused. Any help as to how to remove this wifi card from my gateway would be&nbsp;greatly appreciated.</p>

            Taking out the adapter from my Gateway computer resolved the issue.&nbsp; I then installed a usb Netgear wireless adapter and everything works great.

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows 10 device is having trouble installing the latest updates, I suggest resetting the Windows Update components. This operation will refresh all of the components required to download and install the latest updates for Windows 10 and create
 a new <em>SoftwareDistribution</em> folder for the update files. You will need administrative permission to complete this task.</p>

    <title>Who Is Janice&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nheather  say:</h3>
<h2>            Who Is Janice&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So for the last two days, I have been trying to contact MS Support in the UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put failed attempts yesterday down to it being a Bank Holiday but was expecting better luck today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is how it went</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Dialled 0344 800 2400 (the UK support number)</p>
<p>2) Automated voice welcoming me and informing that my call may be recalled and to press '1' if I was okay with this.</p>
<p>3) I pressed '1' and then got a series of menu options</p>
<p>4) I selected HOME USER</p>
<p>5) I selected ACTIVATION</p>
<p>6) The recorded message then told me that I was being put through to the correct department</p>
<p>7) I then listened to a lengthy silence - no voice information, no musak, just silence</p>
<p>8) Eventually the silence was broken with a recording "This is Janice's automated voice testing system"</p>
<p>9) Then an ear-piercing SQUEAL</p>
<p>10) Then the line was unceremoniously disconnected</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's look at this.&nbsp; I guess the support team are still on holiday.&nbsp; The fact that Microsoft can't put a message up front explaining that is a bit lazy and unprofessional.&nbsp; But I can live with it and try again tomorrow or next week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the burning question I can't get out of my head is</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is this mysterious JANICE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does she specialise in automated voice testing systems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, is she the head of the automated voice testing system department?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nigel</p>

<p>I don't have an answer to your question but just remember you are talking to other users on the forum and not MS employees.</p>
<p>I've never had to try the support number myself (I'm in the UK) but if you give details of your problem perhaps others may be able to help.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really expecting an answer, just expressing amazement that Microsoft would run their support centre in such an amateur manner - if that was done where I worked there would be serious questions to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to my problem, I can’t activate a perfectly legal and valid retail version of Windows. &nbsp;I have been told that I need to speak to someone at MS Customer Services but that is easier said than done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea whether they are open or closed as all I get is the stupid recorded message from Janice.&nbsp;</p>

            I have known a company’s automated call service to be terrible even with a premium rate number, I’ve called &amp; been kept on hold then just disconnected with no explanation, on occasion I just hear a ‘Bye’ &amp; that’s it. 
<br />Tbh it sounds like they’re using the holiday to test out a new system thinking no-one will be calling. 
<br />Make sure you're calling the correct number too. Give it until later today or tomorrow &amp; retry.

<p>I believe you are saying that you enjoy feeling the even and closely spaced variation in the wheel's resistance to being rotated as you scroll, &amp;c. This is a result of the mechanical design, and implementation, of the mouse wheel mechanism and cannot be
 changed by electronic means. It might be possible to access the mechanism by partly dissasembling the mouse's housing and adjusting the tension in a spring. Unless you are willing to sacrifice a mouse in the cause of experimenting, I would not recommend it.</p>

</p><p>You are correct about the display driver crashing occasionally, but from taking a look at the crash dumps, i found two modules that could be contributing to this, by potentially conflicting with Norton AV.</p>

<p>I believe they are both remnants of long since remove AV Protection software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove both,&nbsp;and &nbsp;If after removal, the situation does not improve, the we can also remove Norton and replace with Microsoft Security Essentials, and perform a clean, re-install of Nvidia Display.</p>
<p>But lets just remove these two modules for now and see if that resolves the crashing..</p>

            Are you being issued the driver update through Windows Update? If you are, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

    <title>No Network Connections after Upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Network Connections after Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>No Network Connections after Upgrade to Windows 10 from windows 8.1 pro installation no problem when signed in their was no network connection s at all no wireless and no Lan and also no audio I have tried reinstalling several times and also a fresh install
 from windows 7 all updates through to windows 8.1 pro and I was connected no problem till I upgraded to windows 10 and the same issue no Network Connections or audio after Upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why this is happening considering I was testing the developer preview from start to release and I had my audio and Ethernet was working just fine I've tested from windows 7 to windows 8 to windows 10 and always had network connections
 and audio until I upgraded to the release of windows 10 I have it on my acer laptop and my other HP desktop and they are connected just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So My issue is this why is it not working when it did its check before upgrade and it says there are no problems your ready to go and upgrade this issue should have been detected before the upgrade if there was something wrong.&nbsp;</p>

I have a variation on this problem&gt;&nbsp; I have a Dell Insipron 530 desktop.&nbsp; It has been connected&nbsp;via an Ethernet cable&nbsp;since it was new.&nbsp; I have an Intel(r) 82562V-2 10/100 Network adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I upgraded from Win 7 Professional to Win 10.&nbsp; Everything was working
 fine for about a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday morning&nbsp;instead of powering down to the sleep mode when I was done working I choose to reboot my machine for the first time since I upgraded to Win 10.&nbsp; Since that reboot I have had no network connectivity.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I even went to the expense of buying two different wireless USB network adapters and still no network connectivity.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I followed all of the steps you suggested above and there is still no connectivity.&nbsp; The network connector indicates it is enabled and working properly with the most current driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the properties window and the Events tab I can see the device was migrated 12 Sep Then Device configured&nbsp; and Device started and Device&nbsp;installed with status 0x0.&nbsp; Thursday Driver service added&nbsp;and Device installed with status 0x1.&nbsp; Today I have updated
 the driver 3 times and each time there is a Driver service added event and then Device installed event with the status 0x1F.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sooooo .... is this device installed status difference the root of the problem and how to I repair or rollback to a working configuration</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my issue is why did my PC loose connectivity after rebooting and how to I restore network connectivity via the Ethernet cable that was fine yesterday.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your helps </p>

    <title>Shortcuts to .MSC files omitted from Start Menu in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornan the iowan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shortcuts to .MSC files omitted from Start Menu in Windows 10 &#40;e.g. SQL Server Configuration Manager&#41;</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 7, a number of .msc file were included either with Windows or with separate products.&nbsp; Shortcuts to these files appeared in Start Menu folders and could be either searched or seen in Start Menu folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, a shortcut in the Start Menu named "SQL Server Configuration Manager" [for SQL Server 2014] pointed to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Windows\System32\SQLServerManager12.msc"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro, the shortcuts to .msc files were gone (but still present in Windows.old\Programdata, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched C:\Windows\System32 for "extension:msc" it found <strong>72</strong> such files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restore these shortcuts in Windows 10 I will have to create potentially many shortcuts, when the .msc files worked perfectly well on their own in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I report this bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix the behavior in the meantime, short of creating dozens of shortcut files?</p>

    <title>STOP&#58; c000021a 0xc0000001 0x001003f0 on a fresh W7 install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            STOP&#58; c000021a 0xc0000001 0x001003f0 on a fresh W7 install</h2>
                    Edit: Solution at bottom of post.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I've seen this question asked multiple times without any particularly satisfying answers for someone in my position.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a computer I assembled about three years ago, and I recently moved the OS over to a newer unit. As I still have an unused copy of Windows 7 lying around, I decided to buy a new drive to plug into the old machine and install 7. The computer was previously
 running an identical version of Windows 7 (professional x64). The drive was *empty* when purchased, and I made sure to format completely before plugging it in to the new machine as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I pop in the Windows 7 DVD, I get the 'loading' screens typical of the process, followed by the flashy windows loading logo. After that vanishes, I immediately get a BSOD with STOP: c000021a 0xc0000001 0x001003f0. (The actual message is a bit longer, informing
 me the system has shut down, but I gather these are the important values). Frustrated, I thought perhaps the machine was rejecting the DVD drive. I used the Windows 7 USB tool from the Microsoft website to create a bootable copy of my W7 DVD on a thumb drive.
 I managed to get the machine to boot off of the thumb drive, but had the exact same problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Vexed, I took out some old backup discs for previous operating systems. The Windows Vista disc encountered the exact same problem as described above. My Windows XP disc fared a bit better, spending about 10 minutes 'loading setup'. I didn't get a BSOD
 in this case, but the system eventually just turned off and did not reboot.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have duplicated the efforts described above on a second hard drive I formatted that has been working fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's impossible to run any real diagnostics at my skill level since no operating system exists on the machine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For context, the machine is a &nbsp;DFI LANPARTY DK P35-T2RS with a Q6600 processor, four sticks of Mushkin 1gb 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 800 (PC2 6400), and a MSI N460GTX CYCLONE 1GD5/OC GeForce GTX 460 (Fermi) 1GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP graphics
 card.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These components all worked well together in the past - while the only new piece of hardware is the hard drive, it doesn't appear any particular hard drive is the problem. Please advise.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: I have located the issue. The heatsink had become unseated a bit in one corner - the BIOS was registering a toasty 93C on the processor. I re-seated the heatsink with great prejudice and was rewarded with a 60c drop to ~35C. Windows 7 is currently
 installing, so I suspect the system was overheating and BSOD-ing in self defense. My only point of confusion is why an error code associated with bad drivers or corrupted install resources was arising. I hope this helps out folks who find themselves in similar
 situations to mine.</div>

            <p>Thank you. this solved my issue on my HP laptop.</p>
<p>After countless c000021a errors trying to install Win7, I ended up buying a new hard drive only to my despair of getting the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many searches trials and errors, i found this post.</p>
<p>I didn't go all the way as to re seating the heatsink.</p>
<p>I simply improvised and put the laptop over a cooling pad.</p>
<p>Everything went without a hitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows installed just fine and works ok. Thank you.</p>
<p>Saved me hours trying to resolve this.</p>

            Thankyou so much, like many others I'd spent hours poking around for a hard drive issue. The cooling pad has completely eliminated the problem, I'm hoping a fan clean out will resolve it permanently.

<h2>            Windows 7 CD Burning</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried built in burner, Nero 8, and Magic DVD.&nbsp; I cannot write an image file to a CD.&nbsp; The indications every time are that it has burned correctly.&nbsp; On completion, the disc ejects, nothing is on it when you access through My Computer apart from a desktop.ini
 file.&nbsp; This is not a drive issue, I have a blu ray drive and a DVD Writer, both exactly the same.&nbsp; Both worked fine under Vista as well before Windows 7 install</p>
