            <p>No changes to the computer, it had been switched of for 3 weeks while on holiday. I tried to do a restore to a point before we went away but it would not do it. Came up
 with a message after re-boot. Looked at event <span>&nbsp;</span>Viewer as you have recommended. Under system it has numerous ERROR
<span>&nbsp;</span>entries <span>&nbsp;</span>source Service Control Manager
<span>&nbsp;</span>under properties it states The print spooler service terminated unexpectedly It has done this x number of times. All these error messages are the same, except for the number of times it has happened. I am
<span>&nbsp;</span>running XP home addition with service pack 3 installed. <span>
&nbsp;</span>I have manually started the spooler and it runs until I try to open the Printer &amp; Faxes folder. That is always empty, and when I go back to check that the spooler is still running, it is not. I have tried copying the spool directory from another computer
 into the system 32 folder but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Any further help would be greatly appreciated</p>

            I ran SFC/SCANNOW when I first had this problem and it made no difference. I have just&nbsp; re run it again working through the info provided by John, and this time it has solved the problem. All ICONS back in the printer folder. Between the two scans I had
 run Glary Utilities several times.

            Running sfc /scannow will not help you.&nbsp; It is a good time waster though.<br />
<br />
If the Print Spooler Service is not running, the Printer and Faxes folder will be empty.<br />
<br />
Which info was provided by John that may have done the trick?&nbsp; Was that John Galt?<br />

Can you post the link or message for these instructions from John so I can try them here?<br />

            I know this is an old question, but I thought I would provide an answer for future users. I had this problem a long time ago with Windows XP. Come to find out that PRINTUI.DLL was completely missing. Went to the i386 folder (or the original disk) and copied
 the original file. I'm sure its also available online.

<h2>            Tab Key throws me out of MS Money Sunset</h2>
                    I now have Windows 10. I have used Money Sunset for years. I changed the registry number as I read to. It helped get me in again. A day or two later my son told me to change it back. That worked fine. Now when I input a transaction, when I tab over from
 the Payee to the amount, it throws me out again. When I tab other places in the transaction I have no problem, just from Payee to the Amount. I can move the mouse over instead and it works fine, just slows me down a lot. Any idea how to fix this. I have repaired
 the file with the Quick Repair and the Standard Repair. It says there was no problems with the file.

    <title>File transfer of large files suddenly stops - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File transfer of large files suddenly stops</h2>
                    Dear community and Microsoft support team,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>since the release of Windows 8, I'm experiencing a strange issue on my SATA3 1TB HDD (I can specify the exact model if needed), running in AHCI mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When copying or moving larger files (starts with files of about 50 MB or more), the file transfer suddenly stops - the transfer rate goes down to 0 bytes/s.</div>
<div>I can't even pause or cancel the progress. The button then just grays out and I can only kill the explorer.exe to get this file task away (it stays there - and if I start another action it just gets joined in the file tasks window below the frozen task.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's an image. You can nicely see the sudden stop of the file copy action.</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01caaa1f-a406-40b0-841e-1ffc8900b8a6" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the left side the progress just froze. It will stay like that _forever_. I tried waiting 2 days because the computer was running anyways. Nothing happened.</div>
<div>On the right side I tried to cancel it, but the buttons just gray out and the label says "Cancelling" - this will also _never_ happen. The other controls react normally to user input (e.g. hiding the details), but the buttons are disabled _forever_. The
 only way to get rid of this frozen task is to kill explorer.exe.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- I experienced this problem on my and another pc in my old home.</div>
<div>- I experienced it with different fresh and old Windows 8 installations on my current PC (very annoying after copying files back on a fresh Win8 install - it freezes even there).</div>
<div>- It doesn't matter if this happens on local disks or over the network.</div>
<div>- It doesn't matter if details are shown or not.</div>
<div>- I also experienced this on Windows 8.1 Preview on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help in advance. If you need additional details, feel free to ask me.</div>
                </div>

I'm wondering if converting the file system of the external <br />
drive to NTFS would improve the issue.<br />

            It doesn't matter if an external drive is part of the operation. internal and even the same drives (only different partitions) cause this problem. The external drive i mentioned is already NTFS

            I am having the exact same problem. Large file transfers slow to a halt. When I try to cancel the box doesn't go away. I booted into safe mode and large file transfers work fine. This is all after performing a complete format and reinstall of windows 8
 using only the drivers Microsoft automatically installed. Help would be appreciated so I don't have to use safe mode for file transfers. Thanks

<p>Hi, BossBanana!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your connectivity issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried restarting your router? Unplug your router's power supply, wait 30 seconds and give it another go. Ensure your Xbox is off while you restart the router. Once your router powers back, turn your Xbox on and try it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helps!</p>

<h3> epijdemic  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACPI.sys causes system stuttering, runs it hot and drains battery for no apparent reason. Whats causing this&#63; &#40;i7 Surface Book, dGPU&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have trouble with a process called "System" (PID ID 4 - NTKernel.exe) and more specific with its "ACPI.sys" driver since weeks now.</p>
<p>It sometimes comes up, eats between 20-30% CPU for no reason and stays like that. No matter if I work in Photoshop or just have Mail app open, this process keeps coming randomly, freaks out and does not stop on its own.</p>
<p>Even worse, it lags the system every 10 or so seconds for 1 second. Complete unresponsive, like a pretty bad hiccup, which makes the system totally unusable for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember when I first got the Surface Book I had a very similar issue with a process called "System &amp; Compressed memory" that was causing this CPU/Batter drain and system stutters (early 2016), but mid 2016 windows update fixed that for good. Now with
 some creators update it seems back and it drives me nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/y20zyF6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://imgur.com/y20zyF6</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Look at that CPU temperatures.. it constantly hovers around 80Â°C when ACPI.sys freaks out again peaking over 90Â°C when I work. Working in Photoshop does use the GPU a lot so I never hear my fans spin when I work normally and this process is not running amok.
 I cannot hold my clipboard when this happens, because its just too hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What do I do? This Surface Book is freshly replaced by Microsoft (old one's base battery failed) and has this problem occurs basically out of the box with all updates installed.</p>
<p>Only things I have installed are: 1password, Adobe CC (PS,AI,DC), Dropbox, OneCommander. This is my absolute minimum setup I need to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Surface Book i7 16gb 512GB dGPU</p>
<p>Windows 1703 (OS Build 15063.413)</p>
<p>I use a Dell 27" external Display on the minidisplay port for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Support regarding this numerous times already, but they don't deal with it the right way imho and mostly urge me to run troubleshooter or reinstall, which I did like countless times already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really love the Surface Book platform, but things like this make me wanna through it out of the window... it's a real pity, this awesome hardware deserves a better and more stable OS experience</p>
<p>

<p>No luck with all of that. I tried to look into the issue with Windows Performance Recoder/Analyzer and have found that the ACPI.sys is causing over a lot of entries within a 90seconds timeframe. that might be some stuck loop within, i dont know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>see some screenshots of 1-2 minute recordings with WPR:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58796272-2251-41bc-bcaf-a00c577c6134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58796272-2251-41bc-bcaf-a00c577c6134" /></a></p>
<p>red= photoshop, green = ACPI.sys ("System") .. kicks in at about 1 minute after photoshop start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>another trace with photoshop already started and closing at the end of the trace ends the ACPI.sys frenzy.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/207ea4e6-efcf-4ede-aa38-19d4c5845314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/207ea4e6-efcf-4ede-aa38-19d4c5845314" /></a></p>

</p><p>However, the problems regarding ACPI.sys draining 30% CPU while photoshop is open did not get resolved. I have no way to verify if Windows of Adobe is causing the problem. (the ACPI.sys drain sometimes also gets triggered by Mail or other apps, not only
 Photoshop, but Photoshop is most reliable to trigger it, maybe because it uses GPU?)</p>

</p><p>With different "User Profile" you mean a new (local) User added via "System Configuration -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Local Users and Groups -&gt; Users"?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your Windows 10 device encounters high CPU usage when using an application is due to a broken ACPI driver. To troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you download the latest Surface Book drivers and firmware. To do so, kindly
 go to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw Puzzles ads</h2>
                    Something is wrong with the ads on this game. &nbsp;The ads box goes black and then freezes up which then freezes up the puzzle. &nbsp;This lasts anywhere from 30 seconds up to 3 minutes. &nbsp;As soon as the next ad finally appears the game works properly and as long
 as the ads are working fine so is the game. &nbsp;It was suggested to me to uninstall the game and then reinstall the game, but I don't see how that will fix the ads. &nbsp;Can someone look into fixing the ads? &nbsp;

<p>Hi Shireley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ads normally appear with ad-supported apps or free apps from Windows Store. There are several reasons why you are experiencing issues in loading those ads before playing the game. It could possibly be caused by a server connection error or there are temporary
 files which block the app to load. To resolve your concern, it is recommended that you uninstall and reinstall the game to reset the app and remove those temporary files or cache. You may click on this
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>as your reference on how to uninstall and reinstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after installing Microsoft Jigsaw, here are additional solutions that you can perform on your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 1.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter for Windows Apps on your computer by clicking the run troubleshooter button on this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">link</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 2.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Reset Windows Store to clear store cache.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Pressâ€¯<strong>Windows key + X</strong>â€¯on your keyboard.â€¯â€¯â€¯&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click onâ€¯<strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong>.â€¯â€¯â€¯&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Typeâ€¯<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>, and then hit Enter.â€¯â€¯â€¯&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 3</span></strong><span>. Remove temporary files.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click
<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>This PC</strong> and click on <strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Remove files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<br />
<p>You can also change your privacy settings to turn off your advertising ID to disable targeted ads on your computer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows key on your keyboard, and then go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click Privacy, and then turn off the <strong>Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.&nbsp;</span></p>

            The only way to increase gamer score is to earn achievements. So if you've already earned all of them in that game, you would need to play another game.

<p><span><span>Badboybabs, please repost your question in a new thread.&nbsp; Trying to keep both situations separate will be too diffucult and may lead to misleading information.&nbsp; I am replying
 here to the original poster.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to use the disk for some or most of these procedures.&nbsp; Does booting into safe mode work?&nbsp; What version of Vista are you using (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2)?&nbsp;
 What is the manufacturer, make, and model of computer you are using?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesnâ€™t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking â€“ or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer â€“ or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully this wll help us to at least identify the problem if it doesn't actually resolve it (yet).&nbsp; I look forward to your feedback on how the procedures worked
 and the results of the scans and tests (and answers to the questions I asked).</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Why can I not access newspaper articles&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kramdenantivirus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can I not access newspaper articles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is the first day on which this has happened. I have always been able to get to newspaper articles before. I recently went through a major update (I have Windows 10&nbsp;and Microsoft Edge) which required 90 minutes after I restarted my computer. I noticed
 certain web sites were much faster. I'm not aware of any recent updates but I turn off my computer using the sleep button now and it comes on in the middle of the night. That's all I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, it seems every web site goes through "not responding" and if I click on "recover webpage" I get the box saying "Windows is searching for a solution". Sometimes the web site disappears and I get whatever was there before. Most web sites work mostly
 fine now, and maybe it's my slow Internet giving me "not responding" messages. Wikipedia, this site, Yahoo mail (mostly), Proboards, uexpress, pqarchiver, creators.com and the Tribune web site are doing fine. Any McClatchy web site or BH Media won't let me
 past the main page. I just get a blue rotating circle or the dots going around and around at the top of the page. I can't even do a search for an article or anything. I can't click on "news" on the McClatchy sites.</p>

            A workaround is to right-click and copy the address. Once a web page with this problem appears, the screen goes blank and then it comes back. Sometimes I have to reload or whatever it is called.

            After hearing the word "troubleshoot" from another site where I asked for advice, I clicked on the button in the&nbsp; lower left corner to see what it would give me.&nbsp; I had received a message about the major updates but looked at my messages and didn't see
 one, and didn't know how to go back and find the one I needed. However, I did find a message which led me to where I would go for a solution.&nbsp; I don't even remember what I did, but a box showed up in the lower right corner telling me to restart the computer.
 When I did, the problems were solved.

    <title>Windows treats my graphic tablet as a touch screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows treats my graphic tablet as a touch screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I have a huge problem ever since the last windows update, and that is the touch screen interface interfering with my graphic tablet. I have tried twitching the tablet options, but it's doing its job properly on other operating systems, so I don't think it's
 the tablet driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is when I'm using Photoshop, and instead of drawing a line I end up dragging the canvas, because my computer thinks I'm scrolling with my finger on a touch screen. I have a recording of this that I can't attach here, however I'll be happy to send
 it to anyone who thinks they can help.<br />
<br />
I have tried all the troubleshooting solutions on this forum, including disabling Windows Ink, twitching the Pen &amp; Ink settings (which seems to do absolutely nothing, I notice no difference), updating the tablet driver, uninstalling the HID Compliant Pen from
 Device Manager (including the hidden ones). I also tried reinstalling my tablet but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: When the canvas isn't zoomed in at all, the tablet works fine, but that's just because Photoshop doesn't let you drag a canvas if it's not zoomed in, so the&nbsp;<em>drag</em> function is automatically disabled. However, I can't work with the canvas on
 0% zoom because I need to add certain details.</p>

<h2>            Not connected - Connections are available</h2>
                    <p>My laptop recently has been having a problem with connecting to the Wi-fi. The router is on and working perfectly with other computers, but when I try to search for a net work, here is what it shows;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Hamsi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2. What error message do you get when you try to connect to the internet?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any software or hardware changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to open the link which you have provided in the post. Please provide the error message again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to use Network troubleshooter for Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of people use networks, but most people donâ€™t have the time or inclination to become networking experts. Instead, we often rely on someone more knowledgeable to troubleshoot our network problems. But what if you donâ€™t have someone available to help
 you? The Network troubleshooter in Windows 7 provides a way for anyone to diagnose and repair network problems.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/using-the-network-troubleshooter-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows7/using-the-network-troubleshooter-in-windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> After installing the latest driver from manufacturer website if the problem does not resolve the issue follow the link given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wired and wireless network problems</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue does not resolve from the above steps then try to disable security software and then try to connect to internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed any security software on the computer, then I would suggest you to try disabling it temporary and check if the same issue occurs. Make sure you enable back the security software once the troubleshooting is done to prevent the computer
 from virus attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For more information on this you may refer the below link:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> <em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> If the above steps does not resolve the issue try to uninstall and reinstall network card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Uninstall and reinstall the network drivers.</strong></p>
<p>Here are the steps to uninstall the network card from Device Manager:</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>On the Device Manager window, look for the network card and let us know if you see any yellow exclamation mark in front of the Device.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> Right click on the Device and select Uninstall.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong> Re-install the latest network drivers from the Manufacturerâ€™s website.</p>

&nbsp;Here's my issue: I'm running Windows XP Professional, came on computer so no disk/program CD, everything was working great until yesterday when I deleted a couple of unrecognized files (at least that's what I intended on doing), then I ended up with a white
 window along the left side of screen for my documents, etc (like a task bar only wider). I couldn't get rid of it so I tried my google chrome and could not get t to open, nor does IE, or anything else. I cannot get into control panel either and restore does
 nothing. I tried safe mode, and safe mode with networking. I have no internet access, no control panel, and nothing in safe mode works either. I've tried a few command prompTs from several forum postings and I cant get anything to work.

 If the files that have the key word are not indexed to the search location, it would fail to find the files. I would suggest you add
<span>&nbsp;</span>all the location and drives to the Index to search the files with key word 'psychometrician'.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>You can follow the methods below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>The option to find the word or phrase has been removed from Windows 7. However you can use the search bar. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start menu button and select Computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top right corner of the screen you will see a Search Bar.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type in the word or Phrase in that Search bar and press enter and a list of files that contain that word or Phrase will be displayed in the Windows Explorer page.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to add your files in index. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To see the complete list of locations that are indexed, or to add locations to the index, open Indexing Options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Indexing Options by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button and then clicking <b>Control Panel</b>. In the search box, type
<b>indexing options</b> and then click <b>Indexing Options</b>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<b>Advanced tab</b> click <b>Index settings</b> and <b>Select New </b>and <b>add the location</b> and click
<b>OK.</b></span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><span>Go to
<b>File types</b> checkmark all the extensions associated with <b>Microsoft word</b> and click
<b>OK.</b></span></p>

    <title>Forced updates are the bane of my existence. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forced updates are the bane of my existence.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I'm guessing we all us Wundow's 10 users had the forced update today at around 9:30am (NZST)? Wow, how convenient. Right as I get out of bed to finish off some assignments. Can't possibly take too long, right? I mean Window's is always updating, and
 I mean <em>always.&nbsp;</em>Anyhow, an hour and half later, I'm still waiting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2 hours go by and I can finally get back on my pc (after being given 15 minutes notice @9:15am that my pc needed to restart. No postpone option, nothing) log on, and WHAM!! Some completely BS message greets me after I put my password in; 'Windows needs to
 finish installing updates'. M'kay, you've had 2 hours to do that, please let me on my PC now, I need to desperately do some work. 15 minutes I have to wait after logging on to gain access to my desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we be given 15 minutes notice for a forced 2hr 15min update?? IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. God it must be an important update if it takes that long. Oh look, adobe is updated along with a slightly new interface. Good thing this is completely vital to
 my computer's very existence because otherwise I may have been outraged it took so long over something trivial. Good thing I can now receive and view my notifications in an orderly manner, lets see what notifications I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'WINDOW'S NEEDS TO UPDATE. PLEASE SELECT A TIME TO UPDATE' Surely there must be some IT geek pissing himself laughing out there at all this, but I certainly wasn't entertained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ignore the message, believing it to be a glitch and proceed to plow through the assignments I so desperately need to complete. Fast forward to 8pm, I need to nip out and pick the girlfriend up from the airport. I leave my pc as it is, and head out to pick
 her up. Arrive back an hour later only to discover my lock screen glaring back at me. What is this wizardry?? Maybe the new 2hr 15min update autolocks after a certain period of time? I log on to discover that in the short period I was gone my pc restarted
 itself for unknown reasons. Lets see if my work saved (I have autosave set for every 5 minutes). Well, would you look at that: 'date modified: 9/10/2016 1:17 AM' all the work I did today has been for nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These forced updates have got to stop, enough is enough. Is Microsoft not like every other company on the planet that has to rely on customers to survive? We all overwhelmingly loathe forced updates, to the point that I can guarantee some of us have actually
 bought mac's, or told ourselves 'this is the last microsoft pc I'm buying'. Listen your customers. Forced updates have got to stop, no more excuses, no more lies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>STOP THEM NOW<br />

            I'm the sound man for my church. So I get in this morning and fire up the system only to be greated with an update screen. &nbsp;Now it's time for service to start and I can't get into the computer. Time to switch to Mac, this is unacceptable.
