<p><strong>I am trying to install an add-in for Microsoft Excel 2007. &nbsp;The installation stops in the middle of the process and a window appears stating the process can not proceed due to Error Code 1925. &nbsp;It further explains that the user does not have the
 authority to install the add-in and recommends that I log in as the administrator. &nbsp;I am the administrator and the user profile specifies that I am the administrator. &nbsp;So I created a new administrator and that didn't work either. &nbsp;Any ideas how to fix this?
 &nbsp; Thanks!</strong></p>

            Try running the installation "...as administrator." Right click the installation icon and selection "run as administrator." Accept the UAC prompt...if your account has a password you will be prompted for that as well. After that it should install.<br />
<br />
If not, try installing using the real administrator. type cmd in the search box, right click the cmd command and run as administrator. In the command box type
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong>, switch users to the administrator and run again. You might want to move the add-in to the public desktop or you will have to navigate to where you stored the setup (or you can download again, your choice).<br />
<br />
be sure to turn the administrator account back off when you're done. Log off the administrator account and log back on to your own. If you still have the cmd box open, just run the same command changing the "yes" to "no". If you want to keep it, put on a strong
 password to protect your system.

<p>Just work directly with GMail. Why insert extra software between you and your mail? It doesn't add anything to the experience and only provides one more potential point of failure. GMail is a bookmark on my browser's bookmarks bar. One click and I'm reading
 my mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft decided to 'app-ify' common functions that worked perfectly well on their own, not because it offers any additional benefit but as a marketing strategy to hopefully interest people in Microsoft Store. In the same vein, the place where you go to
 change your Windows 10 settings is called the 'Settings app.' Seriously?</p>

<p>Hi S-and-S,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">many</span> frustrated attempts - trying to change Gmail and Mail settings - and seeing the number of similar online responses about this problem - I have to confess I think you've got a point</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why indeed bother - I guess with this being my first experience of Windows 10 I was mistakenly hoping that Microsoft Mail would provide a very convenient way of being to access email accounts in an improved format - where as perhaps the reality is the two
 systems just don't work together at all...</p>

            We shouldn't put&nbsp;all the blame on Microsoft. Can you see Google saying to Microsoft: "Don't worry, we'll modify GMail so that it works perfectly with your app." Ain't gonna happen.

    <title>Windows Store Icon Missing on Task Bar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Store Icon Missing on Task Bar</h2>
                    <p>My windows 10 computer doesn't show windows store on the task bar.&nbsp; Instead an empty space appears on the task bar. I tried windows reset as others have recommended but after running wsreset.exe an error appears. When i click on the empty space Windows store
 opens but&nbsp;an empty blue window would appear and then the window would disappear. This occurs as well for the other apps&nbsp;for example photos. Also on the start, the store and the apps&nbsp;that won't open have no illustration&nbsp;on their tile. Instead an empty tile
 will only be present.&nbsp;I want to know why this is occurring and how&nbsp;to fix it.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;recently upgraded my computer from 8 then to 8.1 and finally windows 10 version 1151. Please Help me somebody.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Nyima Yonten,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes when i ran the wsreset.exe before an error message appeared. It is as stated below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ms-windows-store:PurgeCaches</p>
<p>The remote procedure call failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the error message being shown. I was tired of not opening my apps for example groove music and i couldn't take any photos. Therefore I searched online and found many posts that said I should run powershell as admin and paste the following command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -Di</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After running the command, it just made things worse, the apps and the store on start would still remain empty but when i clicked them, a window won't appear like it used to. Instead
 it simply doesn't do anything. I was sorry i ran that command. When i run wsreset.exe it says:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You'll need a new app to open this ms-store</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let me tell you how this problem began as i believe i had some fault. First of all Candy Crush soda saga won't open as i had installed the game and was working but all of a sudden, it
 simply stopped then the Blue screen of Death appeared. Afterwards, the game didn't open. The other apps such as groove music were still working and microsoft windows store was opening normally. Then i came across the command i found on many sites in which
 i ran the same command afterwards in powershell only for the command to not work and the apps and ms store to disappear. I am deeply saddened by my careless action. That is why I posted into this community hoping to find a true help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you have a solution i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks</span></p>

            <p>I have the same problem, and it seems from googling it that this was caused by Microsoft releasing an update that broke Windows Store for people who upgraded from older Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's face it, Windows 10 is still a Beta. Reminds me of the earlier versions of Linux. Something is always broken. If it's not Store than it's Cortana, if it's not Cortana then the Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the fix will be eventually found and pushed through, but I am seriously considering spending money on a MacBook.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had all sorts of problems relating to a corrupt Windows 10 and its Apps.&nbsp; These include:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; No Speaker Icon on the taskbar (bottom right)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Missing Windows Store icon on the taskbar (bottom middle)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Missing Windows Store icon on the Start (boxes) page (after left clicking Start)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Failure to open Windows Store after clicking on the spaces where the icon would be (on Start (boxes) page and the taskbar)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Missing EasyChat for FB Messenger icon on the Start (boxes) page (after left clicking Start)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Exclamation Mark on EasyChat for FB Messenger icon before it vanished off the Start (boxes) page</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Failure to open EasyChat for FB Messenger after clicking on the space where the icon would be (on Start (boxes) page</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Failure to to open ISS Tracker after going to the All Apps Menu and clicking on the icon (which was still visible)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all I know there are more problems which I have yet to discover!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I sat up very late last night trying to go through each of your recommendations&nbsp;(all of which I copied maticulously) including the System File Checker and DISM Command and as for the Get - AppxPackage command it gave the report:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Get - AppxPackage is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file" (see below).</span></p>

 Windows Store App scan final results</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Today I rolled back my version of Windows 10 to a version which last worked successfully before doing security and Windows updates.&nbsp; This did work in that it recovered missing icon images on the Start (boxes) page but not the Windows Store icon in
 the taskbar.&nbsp; However the icons still fail to open the programs so only a minor victory.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope these photos help to go some way as to explain the problems I am experiencing even after following good advice.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the last resort is to do a clean download and installation of Windows 10 as it looks like a lot of very hard
 work including installing my manufacturer's own drivers and MS Office 2007 (CD Key, updates, etc) and I really don't feel I am able to take on such a large job.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope someone can help me to successfully restore Windows 10 back to its fully working state.
</span></p>

<p>Same here, on insider preview, did a roll back from 17017 to 16299 due to instability, it was fine at first, but all icons that is a "metro" app disappeared from taskbar after a restart</p>
<p>It looks like this now, tried that Get-AppxPackage command and it ran successfully but didn't make any differences.</p>

 and do they tend to head for the hills, I been in from before windows 95 have odd problems but windows / r solved most and even vista was not a problem compared to windows 10, as it could be great if they spent the tim

<h2>            BSoD on Dell XPS L401x due to ndis.sys</h2>
                    I have Dell XPS L401x with Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of memory. Technically, my machine should be able to run Windows 8 very smoothly. However, I get BSoD too frequently - about twice per hour. I even tried to format hard drive and reinstall Windows. Issue
 is gone for a while but it comes back after usage of few days. Maybe, some Windows update is causing the issue. Error report says "ATTEMPTED EXECUTE OF NOEXECUTE MEMORY(ndis.sys)". Dump analysis by MiniDump analyzing tool
<a href="http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WhoCrashed</a> tells that the culprit is NDIS 6.30 driver.<br />
<br />
I ran memory tests and everything seemed to go fine. Moreover, same laptop runs Windows 7 without any trouble. So, not a hardware problem. Please, if anyone knows, tell me how to fix this. It's really annoying to have BSoD every 30 minutes.<br />
Here are my dump files by the way: http://www.mediafire.com/?852sh53lqy08snc<a href="http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, I would like you to follow the methods to fix this issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you’re not able to boot on desktop, then perform the method given:</span></p>
<p><span>Disconnect all the external devices and get into safe mode:</span></p>

<p><span>1. Press “windows key + c”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type in advanced in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Scroll down to the bottom until you see an option labeled
<strong><span>Advanced startup</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on the
<strong><span>Restart now</span></strong> button and Windows 8 will restart your computer and go directly into the Advanced Startup options menu.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on troubleshoot and then the
<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span>6. New windows will open which says
<b>Startup Settings.</b></span></p>
<p><span>7. Choose an option says
<b>Enable Safe mode.</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in safe mode perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Clean Boot:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform clean boot to identify if any 3rd party service is causing this issue:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow<b> Step 3</b>
 from the link to start the computer to <b>Normal start up mode.</b></span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Choose system and security.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click windows update.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the left pane select installed updates.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are any failed updates, go ahead and install them again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: perform the check disk in system:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Removal of third party antivirus:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></b><span>Uninstall the third party antivirus if any you are using.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your
 computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet
 or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 5:

<br />
all ID3v2.3 tags of more than 10 Mbytes. <br />
When encountering such files, windows 7 explorer hangs for minutes on the <br />
files. The delay times of the explorer increases with the ID3 tag size. <br />
This can affect files with uncompressed album arts or mp3HD files, which <br />
have large id3 tags. <br />
Can anyone at Microsoft look at this? <br />
Thanks</span>

            Any resolution on this from MS?<br />
I also noticed that Windows&nbsp; doesn't support id3 v2.4 tags. Why not?<br />

First...it may be worth a try to Repair Windows Essentials:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-signin/cant-sign-in-on-windows-movie-maker-live/236d30ee-9a7e-456a-ad43-8a4f3bb0bb63">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-signin/cant-sign-in-on-windows-movie-maker-live/236d30ee-9a7e-456a-ad43-8a4f3bb0bb63</a><br />
(see answer from:&nbsp; Cesar_E.)<br />
<br />
Also you could try reinstalling...<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Get Movie Maker for (Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP, Windows Server 2008)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download</a><br />
<br />
And it may be worth a try to rename the following file...<br />
<br />
Rename&nbsp; Pictures.pd6&nbsp; to&nbsp; Pictures.OLD<br />
<br />
The path is:<br />
<br />
Windows\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\<br />
Windows Live Photo Gallery\Pictures.pd6<br />
<br />
Pictures.pd6 is a hidden file...the following article explains<br />
how to show hidden files:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 - Show hidden files<br />

<br />
If you cannot find the file...do a search for&nbsp; Pictures.pd6 .<br />

================================================<br />
A couple of possibilities...<br />
<br />
Do you have Windows Media Player installed?<br />
See the second entry in the following article:<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi traumax,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. I understand that you are having issues in Photo Gallery and you already tried the steps given by Volunteer J. To isolate if the issue was caused by corrupted files, try to clean install Windows Essentials. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><strong>Note</strong> : If you are using Mail, I suggest that you back up your emails through this

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Delete the Windows Live folders (if any) found on the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Windows Live</li><li>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3.

 and install.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly update us afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>IE Extensions on Windows RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greggkite  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE Extensions on Windows RT</h2>
                    <p>I fully understand the desire (and even NEED) to keep third-party add-ons off of Surface RT, but the Internet Explorer app is unusable for many people and sites at the moment. The lack of Microsoft's support for their own products in things like Silverlight
 and (for me) Windows Media Player's IE Extension, is discouraging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I listen to audio files from a company website as a major portion of my job, and the website only works in IE compatibility mode, using the WMP Extension. As this is not available on the Surface, I really can't get any work done on it. On top of that, I
 am taking night classes online which use a program that requires Silverlight. MS may say that these sites need to upgrade to HTML5 or whatever but that's not really an excuse and it's not up to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tl;dr: MS should update the IE app with built-in first party extensions.</p>

            I totally agree.&nbsp; I need to install a Media Player add-on so I can view something live.&nbsp; This is so unfair.&nbsp; You left this comment in March and here we are in November with the same issue.

</blockquote>
<p>There may be a workaround if you know the URL that the Media player add-on would be reading from.&nbsp; E.g. often I am finding that the Silverlight requirement is just for its UI but the actual URL for the media is available buried in the source and then we
 can open that and view it in the MUF <strong>Video app</strong>.&nbsp; The first step in a workaround on this tack would be to inspect the HTML source using either Ctrl-u or F12 (from IE11 Desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I have also noticed that some sites make this even easier by exposing the media URL in various ways intentionally externally making them much easier to capture and use.&nbsp; YouTube would be an example of this technique.&nbsp; E.g. there it is right-click,
 Copy URL.</p>

<h2>            Skype changes Status to Online by itself.</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype running on a Windows 7 Professional machine (I have it installed in other machines but none of them are on line at time of this testing) Seen the other fix which does not apply to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any of the devices mentioned in other posts.&nbsp; Skype is not open on any other device.&nbsp; I will set it to offline and it sets me back to online when I am NOT at the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; People think I am ignoring them when they message me and I don't reply (because
 I am not at my desk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to stop this very annoying behavior?</p>

<p>Virtual memory is hard drive space set aside for the PC to use in conjuction with the RAM while operating. Everytime you shut down the computer that memory is emptied. Generally, the virtural memory only becomes a problem if you are running a lot of applications
 at once or loading very large files (like a photo editing or CAD program). If the virtual memory is set too low, you may experience&nbsp;performance problems as you try to run more programs at once or open lots of files. The virtual memory is generally set at around
 twice what you have for RAM. There is a way to check and adjust that, if that is the problem.</p>
<p>OTOH, if you mean the hard drive is almost full, then you would need to look into archiving old files, removing or removing application you don't need, or getting rid of temporary and junk files. There also is a tool to clean up the drive and free some space,
 any of the following methods will start the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>All Programs</strong>, point to<strong>Accessories</strong>, point to
<strong>System Tools</strong>, and then click<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>. </li><li>In Windows Explorer or My Computer, right-click the disk in which you want to free up space, click<strong>Properties</strong>, click the
<strong>General</strong> tab, and then click<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Run</strong>. In the <strong>
Open</strong> box, type <span>cleanmgr</span>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>This will attempt to find and remove junk/temp files, empty the recycle bin, and offer to compress unsued files.</p>

<p><br />
The memory is OS managed but it only uses the windows partition for virtual memory/pagefile so it's easy to run out of it. Make some memory available on another partition as well. The size should be 1.5 or 2 times the amount of RAM.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will download 100&#37;, but not install</h2>
                    <p>I have a Compaq desktop computer - manufactured in April 2010 but not sold to me until August 2012 for home use.&nbsp; Windows 7 Home premium is the OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2010 installed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody has touched this computer to adjust/change/alter anything, it is "as is" from the mfg except for whatever upgrades Microsoft</p>
<p>installs from time-to-time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a senior citizen and came late to the world of electronics so I am not tech savvy, but I can and do follow directions exactly as I am told.&nbsp; I have been in touch with the techs at Microsoft Community and they have told me to try a multitude of different
 angles, and not one thing is working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight one of the techs suggested I contact Microsoft direct, as he had done 3 times, to see if MS would call and install Windows 10 on my computer - guess what?&nbsp; The link in the message returned with an error message:&nbsp; NOT FOUND</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech suggested I repost my problem. &nbsp;I suppose I could live without Windows 10 but probably will have more problems in the future with old computer trying to tie into new techology, but I cannot buy a new computer for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Been working
 on</p>
<p>trying to upgrade to Windows 10 for quite a long time now, totally unsuccessfully!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me if you can, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to the caring and concerned folks in the Microsoft Community.</p>

            <p>Gerry -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have carefully read and reread your reasponse a great many times, and I have tried my best to follow your directions - never, ever did anything more confusing and more difficult on a computer in my life.&nbsp; That said, I believe I have now successfully placed
 the System Information Report from my computer into ONE DRIVE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I cannot figure out how to share/forward, etc. to get this fiel and/or the file path to The Microsoft Community Forums where everyone has been trying to hard to assist me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as I am aware, English is the only language used - I have no idea how to comment on the "safe mode" - where would I have found that info?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet had time or sense enough to try to get the computer to create a System Log and get such a report to share with all at the Forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to check out your directions in advance and I do not see Admin Tools in any list I</p>
<p>could see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if you did not read my note that I AM NOT a very computer literate/savvy elderly woman - I am just trying to salvage my computer and programs as best I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for trying to help me - I hope you won't give up on me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What I do NOT know how to do further is SHARE or get my info to you folks at Microsoft Community Forums.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have thought I was doing the right things and selected SHARE and waited for a long, long time and nothing ever happened.&nbsp; Additionally, I do not know what address/file path to use for Microsoft Community forums to hook up</p>
<p>with the discussion that you are and I having at that location.</p>
<p>

<h2>            stop KB3035583 from showing up all the time</h2>
                    <p>Let me first say that I am a Windows Insider and am running a evaluation copy of Windows 10. I still really do not care for it and much prefer my Windows 7 machines. The last insider build took forever to boot to desktop after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have the Solitaire Free Cell that works much better than the version on Windows 10. Also I use Windows Media Center for recording some TV shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, how can I stop update KB3035583 from always showing up the updates? I have had to stop all automatic updates on the Windows 7 machines. I hide this update whenever it shows up but it keeps coming back. I am not going to upgrade these machines
 and am very unhappy with Microsoft!</p>

<em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
</p><div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.&nbsp; I have done this on 150 client computers and it works flawlessly, and has continued to that since Spring,
 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose hide to EVERY update
 in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>
</p><p>March 3, 2016</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10&nbsp;installation promises to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and sometimes requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition
 on their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have Windows 7 and are quite happy with it and do not want to change their systems to Windows 10, and simply do not want the hassle of being constantly asked to make this change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;advise my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true</span></a>
 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”&nbsp; Woody’s advice is that if you have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.&nbsp;
<em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more than annoying.&nbsp; It goes way beyond that.&nbsp; It is underhanded, dishonest and just plain wrong for Microsoft to do this.&nbsp; There is no offer to accept or refuse.&nbsp; There is no informed consent.&nbsp; There is not even an idea of what it is&nbsp;your getting
 and what the result is if you change your mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of updates that if already installed should be removed:</p>

<h2>            Login screen reacts only to a mouse click, after click keybord works</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem and I have it for a very long time. After turning my computer on, I'm on a
<strong>login screen</strong>, where I must type password/PIN. But before I can type, I must click to open the "slider." Normally it can be open with pressing any key. But for me,
<strong>only mouse click works</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC is only locked or restarted it is working normally. Just after turning PC off it behaves like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I reinstalled my PC hoping to fixing it, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 - 1803 April update (but it is broken for about 2 years)</p>

            Hi ENeMy DaVe96,<br />

<br />
Just to verify, what is the make and model of your device? Is this happening even if you're on safe mode? Can you provide a screenshot of the "slider"?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>My device is laptop Acer V3-772G. Picture of "slider" is <a href="https://ctrlv.cz/shots/2018/06/18/VR4H.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. (It is the lock screen, but on touch screen you slide it upwards, so I called it slider)</p>
<p>It can't be tested in safe mode, because there is a box to enter a password right after start.</p>

 App Plug-In has timed out or failed if the problem persists please restart the browser.&nbsp; This occurs in multiple browsers and multiple workstations.&nbsp; We have attempted to completely remove and reinstall the plug-in but that did not make a difference.&nbsp; Skype
 used to work and then just stopped one day, We have removed AV and that did not make a difference.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this before and know how to resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi, I wonder if someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I need to use Skype for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't seem to be able to download the plug-in on Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zoom works well as an alternative, or appear.in, but I just can't get Skype to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where exactly is the download?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Pete</p>
        </p>
