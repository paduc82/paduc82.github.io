            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description I understand that you are referring to install Windows 7 operating system on the computer that came with Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that as the base/ host OS is Windows 10 you will have an option to rollback to previous Operating System. You will have to download Windows 7 ISO file, perform clean install which will result in lose of data.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To install Windows 7 operating system refer to:
</span><span><strong><span>Go back to your previous version of Windows

            <p>That usually is not possible</p>
<p>You'd have to contact the computer manufacture to see if that is possible </p>
<p>If not return for an exchange for a machine that it is possible or a full refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you paid with credit card you have a better chance of refund</p>
<p>Your cc company can be a great help if the seller gives you any slack</p>

            <p>The question has become moot, as I can't even download a clean copy of Windows 10 "for unknown reasons" when I tried to follow the simple directions that Microsoft help provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me like Asus is blocking any changes to my laptop that bypass the factory installed software, which loads the 2T hard drive with a total of 1.5T of files and that blows my mind! What can they possibly have on this thing that, with Windows 10
 and only a couple of my own program installations, takes up that much storage? I've never had a computer that had more than .5T on the C: drive and they still had plenty of room for my programs.</p>

<h2>            How do I report a bug in my user interface for windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This morning when I came down to my computer, my desktop had huge icons all over it and my mouse sensitivity was ramped up so high that the mouse cursor was moving all around the screen when I was not even touching it.&nbsp; There are apparently ways to change
 the settings back, but I have no idea yet what else Microsoft may have changed without my permission or any advance notification.&nbsp; I am extremely frustrated and upset at having my interface damaged in this way.&nbsp; If I can't trust windows to make sure that interfaces
 are not broken on people before sending out updates I will have to turn off all updates.&nbsp; I would like to know how to turn of all the updates so that windows must ask for my permission to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was unable to determine where or how to report my anger and frustration about this problem .&nbsp; The so called virtual support person would not let me type in anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning my husbands computer also has the huge icons.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to remember that some of us are not trying to run our computers from our phones and we need to be able to have a stable work environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, anybody who knows how report this problem to the appropriate places.&nbsp; If I do not here from Microsoft support, my next step will be to start contacting members of the computer new about it and I will follow up by buying a mac for my next computer
 if Microsoft ever does this to me again.</p>

            Hi  LynneSlater1
<br />you have raised a number of points, I will try to answer each in turn, I understand your anger and frustration and your wish to let Microsoft know but please bear in mind that in here are users trying to help you solve the issues.
<br />1) to report the problem to the windows development team, you can use the feedback hub, click start and type feedback, you may not get an answer but they will read it and possibly act upon it.
<br />2) preventing updates, in windows home you can set the network connection to metered it will then only install essential security updates. settings -&gt; network &amp; Internet -&gt; Status
<br />click on the "change connection properties" link, under metered connection turn on "set as metered connection"
<br />if you are running windows professional you can get windows updates to ask and wait for you to be ready to install updates. 
<br />3)the problem with large icons - best to look into this before reporting the problem so that you can provide details (up to you)
<br />is it only the desktop icons that are large? 
<br />right click on a blank bit of the desktop and select view then small icons
<br />if everything is appearing larger than normal let us know and we will look at changing the screen resolution.
<br />
<br />let us know if there any problems with the above

            I was able to resize my icons back to small.&nbsp; I am still unhappy that they were changed on my computer without any action on my part.&nbsp; I only use Windows on my desktop and not on any other devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am still having a problem with my mouse.&nbsp; I discovered
 that there is a conflict between my mouse and my Wacom tablet.&nbsp; I turned off the touch function on my Wacom tablet and this stopped my mouse from jumping around, but now I can't use the touch functions of the tablet unless I disconnect the mouse and I don't
 know why this is suddenly a problem today when it was not a problem yesterday.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem appears to have been caused by a Windows update but it is possible that there was a Wacom update too.&nbsp; I do not know why the virtual support refused to let me type
 anything into the window, and I really would prefer to be able to deal directly with a person when I have a sudden problem occurring overnight while I am not doing anything at all on my comput

            Microsoft are working on reducing the number of settings changes when updates are installed, however with so many different hardware configurations it is a difficult task.
<br />that, of course, makes it no less annoying when it happens.
<br />
<br />you can have an online chat with Microsoft Support using the Get Help app or in your browser at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/</a>
<br />the form first asks for a little information about the issue, then gives options of chat or call back etc.
<br />however, as with most large companies,  it is a support help desk which can be more annoying than the original problem.
<br />
<br />with the mouse problem 
<br />right click on start and select device manager
<br />locate the Wacom Tablet (possibly under mice and other pointing devices) right click on it and select properties
<br />click on the driver tab and select roll back driver
<br />if that option is not available or does not solve the issue look for a later driver for your model on the Wacom support site  - <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-cl/support/product-support/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wacom.com/en-cl/support/product-sup...</a>
<br />
<br />have a look at the settings for your table, see if you can reduce the sensitivity a little (I don't have one so can't guide you on that)

 either.&nbsp;</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Welcome to Micorosoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, it appears that you would like to print multiple pages per sheet. I will be happy to help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;you are using Microsoft Office, you may follow these steps to print multiple pages in a single sheet.</p>
<p><span>a. Launch <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> and open a <strong>document</strong>.<br />
b. Click the <strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>Page Layout.<br />
</strong>c. Look for the <strong>Multiple Pages</strong> option under the <strong>
Margins</strong> tab. <br />
d. Set the <strong>option</strong> to <strong>2 or 3&nbsp;Pages Per Sheet</strong> and click the
<strong>OK</strong> button.<br />
e. Before printing, check the <strong>text formatting</strong> by using the <strong>
Print Preview</strong> option within the <strong>File</strong> menu.</span></p>

    <title>Using an iso file to install Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian de la cruz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using an iso file to install Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have a Dreamspark account and, from there, I've downloaded the iso file to Windows 8.1.<br />
<div><br />
I was wondering if, by installing this, my desktop applications would be deleted? I've read some threads saying that their upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 through the Windows Store was ok but that using an iso file would delete the desktop application.<br />
<br />
Is this really the case? If I upgrade to Windows 8.1, from Windows 8, using an ISO file, &nbsp;would my desktop applications be deleted?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<b>ADDITIONAL QUESTION:&nbsp;</b><br />
Is updating from the Windows Store completely ok? By that, I mean, would my desktop applications remain after installing the update from the windows store?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Go to the Start up manager. You will see that WebCake is a start up process and will be running. Turn the process by clicking off box next to program name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No that the program is turned off you can go to the uninstall programs utility in your Control panel section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the WebCake and you should now be able to uninstall it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of people got this and have no idea how they got it. It piggy backs on the soft ware that you got from Face Book.&nbsp; Cool Pix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cool Pix will still be there and the WebCake&nbsp; gone.....</p>

    <title>Unauthorized Access Claim - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unauthorized Access Claim</h2>
                    
<p>I had an acc stolen from me two weeks ago. They somehow obtained my login info and retrieved my acc. Said person then behaved maliciously online with my acc before he signed out and the freeze/investigation began. I've been calling xbl customer support to
 check in on the progress and they told me they have no direct connection to the investigation team. I was told the best way to find out my case status was to set up a thread on this forum. The dude on the phone told me it is monitored and someone would respond
 to me. </p>

    <title>SignalR issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naveengorla  say:</h3>
<h2>            SignalR issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
In our application we are using the SignalR Server and Client. When ever there is a change in server, it will broadcast the signal to all connected clients.<br />
But, all of a sudden there are multiple callbacks at client side fro the same event even though server broadcast only once.<br />
i.e. for 1 broadcast message, client has almost received more than 9000 signals.<br />
<br />
So, we would like to get experts help to know, will server will actually sent those 9000 signals or client itself triggering itself.&nbsp;<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Naveen</p>

<h3> laszlo619  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DNS issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having problems with my computers. Both of my computers are correctly configured, but both computers can't connect to the Internet due to DNS issues. I have tried all things, including resetting my DNS resolver cache (all ways), changing my IPv4
 DNS servers and all the other possible things that one could do! When I contact Microsoft, they want me to pay for assistance and I'm pissed off. What should I do? Would downgrading to Microsoft 7 possibly fix this issue? Cheers and thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi GRADYFURY 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.       
        </p>

</p><blockquote>Hi GRADYFURY <br />
<br />
My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />
This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt. <br />
You can try a couple things. <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter. <br />
Restart the computer. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then try this, <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />
In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />
Press Enter key after each command: <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
<br />
Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />
To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
Restart your computer. </blockquote>

            I suggest you do a repair upgrade.
<br />This will refresh your PC.
<br />It will NOT wipe apps or data but backup just in case.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do this.

            <p>I think if it were me, my next step would be to disable any unnecessary startup items that run in the background.&nbsp; To do that, press Ctrl-Shift-Escape to open the Task Manager, then go to the Startup tab and right-click any items there and choose "disable".&nbsp;
 If you don't see the Startup tab, you might need to click "more details" first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling these startup items will make your computer start faster, and can prevent problem programs from running that block your shutdown later.&nbsp; It won't block you from using these programs on your own, they just won't start themselves automatically anymore.</p>

            to the main question it is not a real problem for you computer. it is more a pain to deal with. I have the same problem. and as to you computer slowing down some apps will continue to run even after closing the through normal means. ie. the red "x". the
 best way to get a fast boot is to switch to a solid state hard drive. the retrieval of info on one is much faster than a mechanical one. after getting one it takes about&nbsp;three seconds for the os to load and 1 second to log in. even more impressive is that
 a friend of mine whose computer took well over&nbsp;five min.&nbsp;to boot up before he switched to solid state. now it is about 30 to 60 seconds.

</blockquote>
<p>When the app is without any name, it is probably a generic process or even a malware of sorts, I would review the virus protection if I saw something like that. Since Windows 8.1 have Windows Defender integrated, is it running and updating, while actively
 protecting your machine?</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error normally occurs when there are some issues with the .NET Framework component installed on the computer. This issue occurs either when the .NET Framework installation or the MSI software
 update registration on the computer is corrupted. To fix this issue, I suggest you to refer to the Microsoft KB article given below and try all the troubleshooting methods given in it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">.NET Framework update installation error: "0x80070643" or "0x643"</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might also encounter this error when installing updates for Microsoft Office 2003 on the computer. In that case, it could be due to some issues with the Office Source Engine (OSE) service. So,
 to fix it, I suggest you to refer to the section “<strong><em>Microsoft Office 2003</em></strong>” and follow the instructions in it to restart the Office Source Engine (OSE) service from the article given below:</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the response.</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate the troubleshooting you tried on the computer. I understand the difficulty when things won’t work the way they should<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:&nbsp; You can try to do a sfc scan on the computer. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.To scan the computer you can follow the below link</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><br />
Step 2: If a Windows image (Windows component store) becomes unserviceable, you can use the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM) tool to update the files and correct the problem.
<br />
To run the DISM command you can follow the below steps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open command prompt in elevated mode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Copy and paste the below command and hit enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> This troubleshooting generally applies to all Windows Update related issues.<br />

1. Move the mouse to the top right hand corner to open charms bar, type Command prompt in search, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.<br />
2. If you receive a notification from User Account Control simply click Continue.<br />
3. At the command prompt, type the following, commands and then press ENTER after each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptsvc<br />
Please do not close the Command Prompt window.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Renaming folders pertaining to Windows Update. Please follow the below steps<br />
1. At the command prompt, type the following commands, and then press Enter after each command:<br />

4. Please do not close the Command Prompt window.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Registering DLL’s pertaining to Windows Update. Please follow the below steps:<br />
1. Please copy and paste the following text into a new Notepad document, and save the file as WindowsUpdate.BAT<br />
2. If saved correctly the icon will change from a Notepad file to BAT file which has two blue cogs as its icon.<br />
Or<br />

<p>
The same thing happened to me on the same day! That morning, the Start menu said, "UPDATE and restart" so that is what I did. Hours later, I attempted to use the live tile to check the weather and all of Windows crashed. If I try to start my computer I just
 get a screen that says, "Error 1962". I made a recovery USB for Windows 10. When I try to reset the PC and keep my files, it says, "the drive where Windows is installed is locked". If I try to reset the PC and remove everything, it says, "a required drive
 partition is missing." I can't system restore, either. Microsoft/Windows caused this issue. This is NOT a PC manufacturing issue! My computer was barely a year old!</p>

<h3> shannonchou  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows Media Player and other media player only displaying 1&#47;4 of the video while the remaining 3&#47;4 is green</h2>
                    After I updated my windows 8 single languange to windows 8.1 single language by downloading it using microsoft store. After the installation, I found out that my Windows Media Player and other media players only plays the 1/4 upper left part of the video
 ( no matter what kind of format). I tried uninstall and reinstall the media player that I previously installed, but the same error still persist, whereas I can't find where to download Windows Media Player for Windows 8/8.1 . Only VLC media player does not
 have the problem (which my friend ask me to use it). So, to all microsoft community users, how can I fix the problem?

            everything works perfectly yesterday. So, I shutted down my laptop after one whole restless day. Today, when I on my laptop and wanted to watch a movie, the same error came up and I tried method 1 &amp; 2. How can I fix this problem? I wanted to delete this
 user account but I feared that my current settings, files and programs cannot be recovered. By the way, that day after I updated to windows 8.1 single language, I changed my user account from local account to microsoft account. &nbsp;Will updating windows alter
 my old settings?

            Help!!! The error still persist. I found out that I must sign in another user account to enable normal viewing of the video. So, whenever I wanted to watch a video, i need to sign in 2 user account simultaneously (1 is my local admin account and 1 standard
 user account). Why this is happening? I need a solution for this problem!!

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have exactly the same problem, and this is caused by&nbsp;the upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. In Windows 8 everything worked fine but after upgrade to Windows 8.1 I can see only 1/4 of the played video. I have updated all the drivers to the latest versions
 and uninstalled and installed all the video codecs again&nbsp;but it did not help. Then I have found this community with your advices.</p>
<p>I have tried option 1 and option 2 and it did not help in my case.</p>
<p>The option 3 shows that in the newly created&nbsp;profile everything works fine. </p>
<p>Do you know which folders or files should be deleted in my original main profile so everything works fine as before upgrade?</p>
<p>I have made upgrade recently and now I regret that I did it because of this very unpleasant upgrade feature.
</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;features of&nbsp;Win 8.1 are&nbsp;fine and upgrade from 8 to 8.1 seem to be good decision but I need your help to resolve the issue that the upgrade creates.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>"Installed all the video codecs again"?&nbsp; Could you clarify what that means?&nbsp; That's troubling: at one point well over 3/4 of all crashes were being caused by the horrible and ineptly constructed codec packs.&nbsp; Those have been a noxious pox upon the software
 industry.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Historically, green or mis-scaled video has been the result of a bad video card driver that's not supporting acceleration properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, you mention codec packs.&nbsp; Some ... less educated people like to throw in all sorts of gunk that interferes with normal playback.&nbsp; There should be no need for a codec pack for any mainstream content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You don't mention what file type(s) you're having problems with.&nbsp; What file type?</p>

            <p>Codecs have nothing to do with this problem as&nbsp;everything was working before upgrade to Win 8.1 with the same setup. As I have seen that there is problem after upgrade&nbsp;I have just tried to install the latest drivers available and I have uninstalled and installed
 all the other stuff that I was thinking may help to repair this problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know for sure that the&nbsp;problem is the Microsoft&nbsp;upgrade and this caused the wrong behaviour of the video playback but I do not know how to resolve the problem in professional way. There is something in the old Windows 8.0 profile what is not working properly
 after the upgrade. In any new account created everything is fine with my system&nbsp;setup but I would like to repair the existing profile without deleting it.</p>
<p>As you can also see I am not the only one experiencing this problem after the upgrade from 8.0 to 8.1.</p>

            <p>As far as I know MKV isn't supported in-box which implies you're installing third party file filters at the very least.&nbsp; The file list in question is suspicious.&nbsp; Do MP4&nbsp;files play correctly?&nbsp; Do WMV files play correctly?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Given the data you've mentioned so far, I'd squarely orient on a problem with the video card driver.&nbsp; (Please note that different players use the card differently and definitely will produce different results.)&nbsp; "Latest" doesn't always mean "all problems
 resolved".&nbsp; What video card are you using?&nbsp; Disabling video acceleration to whatever extent possible would probably resolve this, but I don't know what controls over that are currently exposed.</p>

<p>The file formats have nothing to do with the problem. It is the last thing to discuss or consider in this specific case. What must be analyzed it is what Microsoft update have damaged or did during the update so we have the problem.</p>
<p>WMV, MP4, AVI, MKV and any other video files are not playing correctly. 3/4 of the displayed picture is green and only 1/4 it is actual video that you can see and the rest like subtitles or audio is OK.</p>
<p>This computer was playing all video files and other files correctly before upgrade. The problem is the upgrade from 8.0 to 8.1. What must be analyzed is what the upgrade proces have spoiled in the system that it is not working properly now. Please correct
 me if I am wrong but everything is played correctly&nbsp;in newly created profiles so the graphic card drivers must be OK too?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe those are some driver settings which should have been changed during upgrade but&nbsp;were not changed during the proces? We simply&nbsp;have
 to analyze and find out how to repair the problem created by Microsoft upgrade. It will also help Microsoft and others to get rid of the problem quickly.</p>

<strong>Trace ID:</strong> kkbzYyFXuUuT1JNU.3.1 - the error message I received just before when I tried to 'ask by email' for permission.<br />
There were no changes on my PC before I encountered the issue that I know of, I might add that I am the only person that uses this PC.<br />
I have left my 'family' and am a lone adult.<br />
It is only happening on google chrome.

<p>I have done so, creating the loval account, but still, when I click to use the google chrome app, Microsoft family features pops up and asks to verify the microsoft account, when I click verify another pop up appears asking if I mean to switch apps, when
 I click yes the same pop up appears saying verify your account to continue using Microsoft family features. I then press Verify and absolutely nothing happens, appart from the pop up closing</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, WiFi data usage always shows zero</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it can be seen in the attached snapshot, the data usage facility on Windows 10 does not work for me.&nbsp; Even though I have used perhaps 20G (on boat conventional and store apps), it says I have used 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions? (please no unrelated canned responses)</p>

</p><p>Thank you very much for your help. I ran sfc and the only noticeable problem was related to one of store apps (which could not be fixed). Aside from that there was no other problem. So I guess it is related to something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after sfc and reboot (and a few days of work), it still shows zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw. I have upgraded from Windows 8.1 if that helps (not a clean install).</p>

    <title>Clear Windows Media Player 12 genre suggestions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clear Windows Media Player 12 genre suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to clear the suggested "genres" in Windows Media Player 12?</p>
<p>I recently reinstalled Windows 7 on my laptop, and - in the process of setting up my library in Windows Media Player - I accidentally misspelled a few genres. Although I have corrected the misspellings, the incorrect genres keep popping up when I start typing
 (e.g. "E" lists "Electonic", as well as "Electronic").</p>
<p>Is there any way to clear these suggestions, when no songs have a particular genre label?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>DWOR1</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run Windows Media Player settings troubleshooter and Library Troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</p>
<p><span>Refer the following link to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then I would suggest you to uninstall Windows Media Player then reinstall it and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start” button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><span>Expand “Media Features” option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Un-check “Windows Media Player” option to uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>How do you stop guests getting to control panel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you stop guests getting to control panel</h2>
                    
<p>I thought this would be simple...</p>
<p>I activated the "hidden" Admin account and used it to set up a guest account (with no password) on my Win7Pro machine so that visitors and friends could use it for WebMail and browsing. I disabled the built-in guest account. I set the parental controls to
 prevent games and various other programmes, and to limit the time the machine could be used. I made the account a member of the group "Users" which according to the documentation prevents the changing of various critical parameters.</p>
<p>So when I log on as guest, sure enough I cannot run games, and the programmes I blocked won't run. B U T - and its a huge, monster BUT, as a guest I can still go the Control Panel/User Accounts/Modify and change the passwords of any of the Admin accounts
 then log on as an Admin and do whatever I want. I find this so mind boggling that I cannot really believe it. I have gone thru the procedures of setting up the guest account about a dozen times and the result is always the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is - how can I prevent Guests from modifying accounts ? Hope someone can give me a answer and restore my faith in Win7</p>

<p>No he podido ingresar a Facebook, porque olvidé mi clave.&nbsp; Intenté recuperarla o cambiarla, &nbsp;durante 2 días,&nbsp; en distintas ocasiones,&nbsp;pero todo ha sido inútil. Me dicen que enviaron un código a mi correo, y no llega. O bien ese, &nbsp;es rechazado por el sistema.&nbsp;
 Estimados Srs.,&nbsp; ruego a Uds. efectuar lo necesario&nbsp;para ingresar pronto a FB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agradece su atención.</p>

<h2>            Line around taskbar fly-outs</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with the fly-out windows that popup from the system tray area. Somehow there's a line placed around them that shouldn't be there. I have checked other Windows 10 devices and the line is only visible on my system. It's especially annoying
 when using multiple displays because the line on the right side (which isn't visible right now) is displayed on the monitor to the right of my main display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a laptop running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit (including the november update), and using an Intel&nbsp;HD Graphics 4000/nVidia&nbsp;Quadro K2000M graphics card combo. For those the latest drives have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DPI scaling is set to 100%, both in the Display Settings screen as the Custom Sizing Options screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are some screenshots to show what I mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to disable or fix the lines?</p>

            Okay so I seem to have fixed this. What I did was go to Settings --&gt; Personalization --&gt; Themes --&gt; Theme Settings and apply the default Windows theme there. I was using a saved theme which I believe was synchronized with my Microsoft account. I have used
 that theme for a long time, even with Windows 8/8.1 so maybe the theme got corrupted along the way. Anyway all is good now.
