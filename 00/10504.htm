<h2>            Lumia 930 Windows 10 Mobile Bluetooth and car radio reconnect issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, did anyone find W10 version which works OK with Bluetooth car radio? </p>
<p>I tried several versions before Annual Update, and after, also Insider Preview. None works with my VW Composition Media. I can pair my phone and it works OK once after the pairing, but when I leave my car, BT is totaly blocked -&nbsp;I cannot even turn it off.
 When I get back to my car,&nbsp;my phone&nbsp;will not reconnect until I restart it, or remove pairing and repeat pairing. The only way to fix this bug is return back to Windows 8.1 then BT works with no problems. What a shame that MS cannot make W10 working with BT
 one year after W10 release! My old Lumia 920 is no longer supported to run W10 so I cannot verify if this BT bug appears on other Lumia phones, and I am not going to waste money&nbsp;buying Lumia 950 to see that it has the same problem. Of course, I tried other
 phones with my VW radio, all worked fine except W10 phone. :-/</p>

Check the settings of both devices for possible&nbsp; compatibility issue.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not in HW of Lumia 930, it's Win 10 bug. It works when using Win 8.1. Same for Lumia 920 when got back to&nbsp;Win 8.1 (just cannot upgrade that model to Win 10 anymore). I tested also Lumia 640 with same result: OK when using Win 8.1, not working
 when upgraded to Win 10. I may continue testing other Lumia phones but I don't think that MS cares about such bug. There will be no new Lumia. MS killed Windows Phones. What a pity. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>About compatibility, who do you think should care about compatibility: the best selling car, or the worst selling phone?</p>
<p>Besides, there are complains about Lumia Bluetooth issues with other cars. It's always the same question: why my Lumia does not connect with my car audio if any other phone I try works OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a very sad story of Lumia made by Microsoft ... goodbye Lumia phones!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is very little chance that HP will put some pressure on MS to make Win 10 useable system for their new business phone.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi Roman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, when your phone is still under Windows 10, have you tried connecting it with other Bluetooth devices? Did it work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.<br />

            <p>Hi Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>well, I cannot really tell, as I was&nbsp;using my Lumia 930 with Win10 for short period only. I was using Win10 on my old Lumia 920 for&nbsp;almost one&nbsp;year with several BT devices: Panasonic micro system, Belkin BT audio adapter, Jabra Stone 3&nbsp;(enjoying NFC with
 all three), plus Nokia Car BT in my old car. Never had problem with BT connections. When I bought a new&nbsp;CNG Golf with Composition Media, and finally changed my SIM to have a nano size for Lumia 930, I realized that I cannot use it with my new car. What a disapointment!
 I tried Lumia 920 with Win10 and got the same problem, so I restored Win 8.1 and the problem was gone. But then I found no way to upgade Lumia 920 back to Win 10 where it was before this test - another disappointment that it was removed from the list of supported
 phones. I did the same test with Lumia 640 -&nbsp;same result: works fine with Win 8.1 but not with Win 10. Of course, you can blame VW radio, because Lumia works with other BT devices just not with my car radio. But guess what will I change: my Lumia phone or
 my new car?</p>
<p>Besides, it is not the only car BT audio reported as not working with Lumia phones in this forum, and all users got the same experience: when trying any other phone than Win 10 phone, it works. Same did I with my new Golf, tested with iPhone and old Nokia
 X2 - no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 got much better user interface than Win 8.1, I wish I could use it. Actually, I hate using Win 8.1 after having Win 10 on my phone.&nbsp;A primary function of my phone is to make phone calls, and&nbsp;this is not possible with Win 10&nbsp;while driving my car, unfortunately,
 I spend plenty of time driving my car. It is really a SW issue as Win 8.1 works fine on the same phone. It is known for long time, I saw complains one year old in this forum. If you can't remove such a primary bug in a year, how can you expect that people
 will use mobile windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Roman</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small update. 10 days ago, I tried to upgrade my Lumia 930 to Windows 10 again.
</p>
<p>And guess what? BT works with the original W10 version 1511, build 10586.107</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the anniversary update comes automatically. I kept delaying installation for few days&nbsp;to verify that BT always connects to my car radio within 10s. Then I restarted my phone and got current version 1607, build 14393.321, and BT issue is back!</p>
<p>This explains why I had no BT issues with my new car and Lumia 920 using Win 10 until August/September. I started using Lumia 930 about the time when anniversary update came. My old Lumia 920 got the same update and the same bug as well, but I could not
 roll back to the original W10 because Lumia 920 was removed from supported phones list meanwhile.

<h2>            Deleting a Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Part of my problem is that I am forced to choose from drop-down menus that have nothing to do with my question and are totally misleading. I have been as generic as possible but what I had to choose really has nothing to do with my question. My question
 is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype account through my employment. I am leaving this firm and need to delete my account. I cannot find any information on how to do this. It seems like a fairly simple request but I have spent quite a bit of time on it with no success. The person
 after me needs to keep the Microsoft account but will not need a Skype account.</p>

<h2>            Start Menu and Task Bar Frozen</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Task bar, start menu, settings not working- Original Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC, Windows 10 program and if it somehow matters the computer is a Delta laptop.</p>
<p>So I have been having problems with my task bar. It is still visible, but only some parts of it. I cannot see the time nor the date. I can't see the volume button or my wifi connection. Also some of the hidden apps have disappeared when I click on the arrow.
 I also can't click on the Windows logo/start menu, search or the task view button. And when I open e.g. Google Chrome it doesn't show the window in the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled for a bit and figured that creating a new account as administrator by using cmd and typing
<span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">net user Admin123 MyPassword /add</span>&nbsp;after this I pressed enter and typed
<span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">net localgroup Administrators Admin123 /add.&nbsp;</span>This worked and gave me a new account and I logged in. The task bar is there and the windows show on the task bar when I open something and I can also
 click them. I can also see the time and the date, my volume button, wifi and the hidden apps. But I cannot click on any of them. (Edit: Nothing has changed on my old account, the task bar looks exactly the same)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I kept on googling and the next thing I tried was to just go to my settings (by using Task Manager shortcut since I can't use my Start menu) but it doesn't work anymore? I don't know did this occur before or after making the new account since I haven't
 been using my settings for as long as I can remember this task bar issue happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: My sounds also doesn't work from time to time. The odd thing is that even though the task bar doesn't change the sound can still work but then suddenly stop working without any explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm clueless about what to do and I desperately need this computer for my studying, could somebody please help?</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com Rules being Ignored</h2>
                    <p>I have made many attempts to create a rule to filter out an email I am receiving on a daily basis but none of them are working. I use the "Create Rule" option from the "..." menu item when in the email and I tried going to the rule page itself and create
 a rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these rules work:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://col129.mail.live.com/ol/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>If
 sender contains: "e-Miles Earning Opportunity" then move to Deleted and mark as read</span></a></p>

 sender contains: "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" then move to Deleted and mark as read</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://col129.mail.live.com/ol/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">If
 sender contains: "e" AND "Miles" AND "Earning" AND "Opportunity" AND "earn" AND "earn" AND "e" AND "miles</a>...</span></p>

<p>

 are my rules being ignored?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This

            <p>I'm having the same problem as you and it started with Outlook's "upgrade" to the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone so far as to delete every one of my rules and sweep rules and recreate them and they're still not working consistently. (Rules work occasionally, but sweep never does.)<br />
</p>
<p>The problem persists whether I access my e-mail through the app or in any browser. It is a rule handling and processing problem on Outlook's part, not dependent on any settings we are making or which browser we are using. Something in Outlook's update has
 messed up rule/sweep functionality, which was one of the primary benefits of using Outlook.com in the first place.</p>

    <title>Why does Word want to add extra spaces&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limbomonkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Word want to add extra spaces&#63;</h2>
                    I'm creating a document using different styles--styles for headings and subheadings and a style for the body of the document. (Not sure if this is relevant, but the body is double spaced but my headings are not.) For some reason, Word wants to add extra
 spaces between the text when I change styles. So when I'm writing something in the body, finish that thought and want to write a new heading, I see the double space from the body and then an extra little bit (maybe half a line). WHY?! I didn't put it there!
 I certainly don't want it there! How do I get rid of it and how can I stop it from ever, ever rearing it's ugly head in my documents again?

<p>See if some Spacing After (or Spacing Before) has been added to one or more of your paragraph styles. The specified value will be added between paragraphs (but not between text lines within a paragraph).

<p>
</p><p>Note that Spacing Before/After may be suppressed for two or more consecutive paragraphs. This is controlled by the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" option (Paragraph dialog box).</p>

<span>Please use the Problem Steps Recorder to capture what you are doing so we have more details to work with. Either copy and paste the recorded steps into the forum or upload the zip file to Skydrive and give us a link to the zip file</span></p>
<p>Solving problems unique to a machine can be an arduous task for both the end-user and the help desk. That‚Äôs why Win7 introduces the Problem Steps Recorder, a screen-capture tool that allows the end-user to record the problems they‚Äôre
 having step-by-step. If the problem is repeatable, the recorder will capture what you do in text form.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs as simple as hitting ‚Äúrecord‚Äù then adding in comments as needed. A HTML-based file is converted to a .ZIP folder, which is easily passed on to the help desk.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The program is accessible from the Control Panel under ‚ÄúRecord steps to reproduce a problem‚Äù or run psr.exe from Explorer.</p>
<p>Upload result to a file share site and post the link back here.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In my Mozart I have the option of capturing the GPS information in all the pictures I take from the camera.</p>
<p>How do I use this information.&nbsp; Can this information be used only by some gps enabled apps or is there a way where we can see the pictures based on the location .&nbsp; (I mean see a map view and and the pictures taken from each area shown like it does in the

<p>Google Picassa when installed with Google earth will use the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Mac users iPhoto will use the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a number of other applications that will use the information though I don't remember their names off the top of my head.&nbsp;</p>

In Zune...click on Edit lower left. Should bring up Windows Live Photo gallery. Open the picture then find Geotag's along the right menu. Right click the tag and select 'Map It'

<h2>            Microsoft flyer template creating an additional page.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a one-page flyer with a Word template that was pretty handy until I got toward the end and ran into the next page. &nbsp;I shortened my content/changed the font size to make it fit but two of the cells from the template duplicated and are stuck on
 the second page. &nbsp;if I try and highlight and delete them, they delete all the content from the flyer on the previous page. &nbsp;They are not part of a header of any sort, &nbsp;so I'm not really sure what's going on. &nbsp;All I know is i've&nbsp;been fighting with this template
 for 3 days, I should have just whipped out some colored pencils and made them one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>get the Capture NX-D. I think that is the latest free software that will work with your camera in Windows 10.&nbsp;I guess on my desktop at least the new Photos App from Windows 10 works also hope it does for everyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you really want to go back to your last&nbsp; operating system I think you go to Settings then Update &amp; &nbsp;Security then the Recovery tab and you should see an option to go back to your old system. Maybe you should make backups first.</p>

<h3> deadfish00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account lockout caused by Outlook 2011&#39;s bad credential</h2>
                    The user have an Outlook 2011 for Mac on OS X Lion. I have deduced that the bad password&nbsp;credentials is sent from his workstation. After further testing, I found out that the culprit the Outlook application.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We are not using exchange server but we are using Kerio mail server. The email account authenticates through Kerio internal database so it shouldn't be using AD to authenticate. His account name for AD and Kerio is the same. Every 10 mins after he opened
 his outlook, it will yield bad&nbsp;password&nbsp;account which seems like it's using ad to authenticate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found this article which seems to explain as to why Outlook does it but I need some way to troubleshoot this issue.&nbsp;</div>

</p><p>I just had the same issue, about 3 minutes ago. It's very intermittent. As soon as I get the error, if I click the Home button (it's the default page in I.E. and Edge), the page comes up just like it's supposed to. Therefore, I cannot get a Fiddler trace,
 because it never happens 2 times in a row.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It happens to most of our users at least once per day. When it happens, we notice it on our main site SharePoint home page, because that's the one that is always opened first. We only have one main site, and then we have some other sites that are within
 that one. Users only get to the sub-sites using links on the home page of the main site, so I have no way of knowing whether the issue would happen if someone tried to go directly to a subsite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Karla,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the issue happens when users go to the subsites by clicking the hyperlinks on the home page in the main site and the home page has no such issues.
 If yes, I‚Äôd like to confirm whether the issue happens when you click on all hyperlinks. Moreover, I suggest you check if there are some SPO incidents in your tenant via navigating to the SharePoint admin center&gt;clicking on Health&gt;Service health. If yes, upload
 some screenshots for our reference. Please also check if you can reproduce the issue today.</span></p>

<p>No that's exactly opposite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can't get to the home page (intermittently) but after they see "Page not found" if they click the Home button once or twice, then it loads. Once the home page of the main site loads, the users are able to get to any linked pages and subsites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to only happen the first time (each day) that a user goes to SharePoint. And to get to anything on SharePoint, they go to the main site's home page. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Using COUNTIF on table filtered by multiple slicers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> floriana guardini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using COUNTIF on table filtered by multiple slicers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all! Here's my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Context:</span></p>
<p>I'm analyzing the results from a questionnaire. I would like to create a summary page with some graphs displaying the most interesting results. I have a table with all the response lines, and have formatted it as table and created some slicers to filter
 by demographics and replies to some behavioral questions to segment the respondents. I would like to be able to play with the slicers and have the graphs update automatically when I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Constraints:</span></p>
<p>I cannot use a Pivot table because some tables are based on data crossing different questions, and a pivot works on a single table at a time. I have around 20 questions that I want to present at the same time based on the same filters, and would really prefer
 not to create 20 different pivot tables! </p>
<p>I considered using SUBTOTAL, but unfortunately the formula I'm using to summarize the data is the COUNTIF (as each reply is formatted as a number from 1 to x) and COUNTIF is not included in the subtotal formula options.</p>
<p>I considered using the SUMPRODUCT formula as explained here http://chandoo.org/wp/2012/06/07/formula-forensics-023/ but it requires the filtering to be relative to a cell and I would rather use the slicers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Potential solution considered, but I'm looking for better alternatives:</span></p>
<p>Create a macro that copy pastes the table as values into a new sheet, to be activated after applying the filters on the slicers. The graphs' data sources are linked to the values table.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Complaints:</span></p>
<p>WHY DOES SUBTOTAL NOT INCLUDE COUNTIF????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anybody that will leave a comment! </p>

            <p>SUBTOTAL does include COUNTIF - it COUNTS the values IF they match all of the filter requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want other COUNTIF filtering, then you need to have a column of formulas in the filtered table that will change with the filtering, like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIF(3,A2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copied down. &nbsp;That will give you a 0/1 value that you can then feed to your other formula.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply :) in my case the filtering is different from what I'm looking for in the countif; let's say I have a question with possible answers A, B, C. I have male and female respondents. I want to apply the filter for male respondents only and
 represent the results in a bar chart, e.g. counting the numbers of As, Bs, and Cs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the COUNTIF formula, it will return the total number of B answers regardless of the gender. With the SUBTOTAL formula, as far as I know I can either count the total number of answers, or apply a second filter only for let's say B answers, but then I
 cannot use this for the graph (as I need to know also A and C at the same time). I might be using SUBTOTAL in the wrong way though!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains better what I'm trying to do, it's also possible that I'm using the SUBTOTAL formula in the wrong way!</p>

            <p>Floriana GUARDINI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so you are correct that for what you are asking for, subtotal will not work.&nbsp; A method that will work is the one you found and cited on Chandoo.org&nbsp;&nbsp; ( http://chandoo.org/wp/2012/06/07/formula-forensics-023/ )</p>
<p>
</p><p>As he explains in his forensic review of the formula, the whole subtotal part of the formula is used to identify which rows are visible and which are hidden.&nbsp; It will produce an array across you data the has a 0 for each row that is hidden and a 1 for each
 row that is visible.&nbsp; The remainder of the function can be used to apply whatever condition you want to evaluate such as how many A's that are male (filtering identifies the male subset).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That formula or some derivation of it is pretty much the common way to do it.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had the impression that there was no other way... At this point I think I will stick to my macro solution, which for me is easier to manage than the array formula.</p>

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2011 not embedding images</h2>
                    <p>My boss has been trying to send screenshots embedded in the email for a month now and every time I get the email I just get the blue box with a question mark in it. We have tried making sure he has not trashed the image before the picture sends and tried
 checking his settings but every time he puts the image in the message field no one in the office will get it. We all click the download images button and can see the images in that are in our signature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something to do with the screenshot files?</p>

<h2>            Confusing dilemma connecting Hostgator, Godaddy, and Office 365.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hey guys,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. I have office 365 using an email address connected to my website e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** not *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
2. To set this up I had to input office 365 Nameservers on Godaddy (Where domain is bought).
<br />
<br />
3. Here's the problem: My website host (Hostgator) name servers were removed to make way for the name servers from office 365, as per their instructions to connect my personal website with office 365 so I can use my website domain as the ending to my emails
 to clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Website is now offline.<br />
<br />
5. How do I go about getting my website back online, as I need to put the name servers back into Godaddy, which is now being used by Office 365.<br />
<br />
Btw, I contacted Godady and I got this response which I don't understand and told to contact Microsoft:<br />
<br />
All the records needed to be added by office 365 will go directly to the DNS of the domain which will be hosted by hostgator (because the nameservers will point to them) you just need to contact Microsoft so they can provide you the records needed to be added
 on the DNS.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Khaleesi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you hope your site back online, you can change the DNS records and let your domain point to the host(Hostgator). The change name server, you might need to access Godaddy website(where the domain was registered) and change the Nameservers to the Nameservers
 provided by Hostgator. After nameserver change, you can add the records provided by Office 365 to use Office 365 services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Admin portal &gt; Setup &gt; Domains &gt; click the domain &gt; DNS management &gt; I'll manage my own DNS records &gt; Select the services you need. The value of all the records you need to add will be listed in the page.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8235a191-679b-405e-9783-e95a53ee9de0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8235a191-679b-405e-9783-e95a53ee9de0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, open the Hostgator website to add the record.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Using a Query to perform calculations</h2>
                    <p>I am relatively new to Access and need some help/guidance on how to performance a calculation based upon some values in 2 different tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; Country Name</p>
<p>&nbsp; Total Minutes</p>
<p>&nbsp; Fixed Minutes</p>
<p>&nbsp; Mobile Minutes</p>
<p>&nbsp; High Band Minutes</p>

<p>
</p><p>Table 2<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Country Name</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; Fixed (%)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; Mobile (%)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; High Band (%)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; Low Band (%)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; Satellite (%)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For each record in Table 1 I would like to do a 'Country Name' lookup in Table 2 and perform the following calculations.</p>
<p>'Total Minutes' x 'Fixed (%)' and update 'Fixed Minutes' in Table 1 with the answer</p>
<p><span>'Total Minutes' x 'Mobile&nbsp;</span><span>(%)' and update 'Mobile&nbsp;</span><span>Minutes' in Table 1 with the answer</span></p>
<p><span>'Total Minutes' x 'High Band (%)' and update 'High Band Minutes' in Table 1 with the answer</span><span>'Total Minutes' x 'Low Band (%)' and update 'Low Band Minutes' in Table 1 with the answer</span></p>
<p><span>'Total Minutes' x 'Satellite (%)' and update 'Satellite Minutes' in Table 1 with the answer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>You're not ready yet for calculations; it has to start with a correct Relational Database design that follows the rules of normalization.
</p>
<p>Calculated values don't belong in a database; rather they are calculated on the fly by queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCountries</p>
<p>CountryID Autonumber PK</p>
<p>CountryName text(50) required uniqueidx</p>

<p>
</p><p>tblCallData</p>
<p>CountryID long int required</p>
<p>CallTypeID long int required</p>
<p>MinutesCalled long int required</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then use the Relationships window to draw relations between the corresponding fields and in the&nbsp;dialog that comes up check the box to enforce the relation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter some test data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look into crosstab queries. There is a query wizard for that.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>That will be a good feature for the radio app. It's better that you contact the developer of the application so that it would allow the app to run while the phone is locked.</p>

<h2>            where is my &#39;Social&#39; on my zune account</h2>
                    <p>Some how, or another... Whenever I USED TO click on my ZUNE icon, I would get COLLECTION, MARKETPLACE &amp; SOCIAL, and now I cannot locate my 'SOCIAL', with my 50+ 'Friends' that I could compare music with, and get update...</p>
<p>Please help me to get my 'Social' back.</p>
<p>I LOVE my ZUNE and use it a minimum of 6 days out of the week. Basically... NOTHING that is out there can provide the flexibility, dependabilty, quality, and versatile applications of this caliper of an MP3/Video/Radio/etc...etc... ZUNE player.</p>
<p>Because of me and in my work area, 11 people now have a ZUNE and refuse to give it up.</p>
<p>My wife said that I would give her my wallet, before I give her my ZUNE.</p>
<p>I hope that someone can help me with my 'Social' issue.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a truly blessed day.</p>
