    <title>Windows 10 update stuck in endless loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isabellajohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update stuck in endless loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Recently I finally allowed my laptop to update to Windows 10 but it has ruined my laptop. During the update it needed my laptop to restart but once it reached around 65% it said it was unable to complete the restart/update thing. So, I allowed it to try
 again and it did the same thing. I continued to try and try again but it still had no luck. Then I was redirected to the alternative options which included use a device, troubleshoot and another operating system etc... I have tried almost all of the alternative
 choices and none of them have seem to fix my problem. I am becoming very worried as I have many old photos and documents that I haven't backed up on there and would prefer not to have to restart my entire laptop. I really don't know what to do now so any help
 would be very beneficial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba satellite 2014 touchscreen laptop. It also will not allow me to use the keyboard, only the touch screen. Whenever I press a key the lights light up but it doesn't go through to the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was almost successful one time as I went onto troubleshoot and pressed Reset your PC and did the option which allowed me to keep my files. It took hours but finally allowed me to reach my normal log in. The keyboard still did not work however and when
 I tried to use the touchscreen to type my password, it completely froze. I left it for a while but still remained frozen so I decided to shut t off completely, big, mistake!! It undid all the changes and has now gone back to it's original problem. I tried
 to reset it again but now it would even allow me to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!!!!!</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Isabella .   I'm Greg, a volunteer Installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You will not lose your files, which should always be backed up since the hard drive can die at any time - but unless it does are always retrievable if you don't format the drive first.  At any time you can rescue them using the booted media following this guide:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />We will be using the booted media now which is much more stable than the onboard repair tools.  So create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br /> In the Troubleshooting options try to Reset your PC, which may work better from the media.  If it fails again you can also try the Advanced Options to Go Back or Startup Repair to see if they work any better.
<br />
<br />If that fails follow these steps to Clean Install which  compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587at">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   
<br />
<br />An alternative method to rescue files is during the illustrated reinstall steps at the Drive Selection screen choose the C partition (by size and position, with our help if needed) but do not format or delete this or any other partitions, just click Next to let the install begin.  It will archive your files at C:\windows.old to copy out after install. 
<br />
<br />It's unfortunate that this happened but the consolation is that you will end up with a vastly better install than the one you had, one which has no reported problems by hundreds of thousands of users.  I will also be here to help you as much as needed and will not let you fail.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Xbox one s in white is ugly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had a 360 for years and now think that it's time to upgrade. The xbox one s is only available in hideous white. i have been waiting and hoping a black or grey edition would be released, but no such luck. i won't pay an extra £150 for the x version, so it looks as if i'll have to stay with the 360 or change to a ps4. awful&nbsp;choice of colour.</p>

For further checking, were you using one installer to install all the fonts or did you install them individually?<br />

In this case, we suggest deleting all existing fonts listed in <strong>Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Fonts</strong> and
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts</strong>. Please see the steps below:<br />
<br />
<strong>To delete the fonts in Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Fonts</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open Run dialog.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>%windir%\fonts</strong>, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the font that you want to remove. To select more than one font at a time, press and hold the
<strong>CTRL </strong>key while you select each font.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>File menu</strong>, click <strong>Delete</strong>.<br />
</li><li>When you receive the "<strong>Are you sure you want to delete these fonts?</strong>" prompt, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To delete the fonts in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open <strong>Run</strong> dialog.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>regedit</strong>, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Navigate the following folder <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the font that you want to remove. To select more than one font at a time, press and hold the
<strong>CTRL</strong> key while you select each font.<br />
</li><li>Right-click on the <strong>highlighted fonts</strong>, then select <strong>Delete</strong>.<br />
</li><li>When your receive the "<strong>Deleting certain registry values could cause system instability. Are you sure you want to permanently delete this value?</strong>" prompt, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with deleting all the fonts, please try to install them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>You can prevent a font from loading without removing it from the hard disk. To do this, move the font from the Windows\Fonts folder to another folder.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: <em>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up the registry</a></strong> before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry
 if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.</em><br />

<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps you provided. Still only 3 fonts are installed, and 4 fonts are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems quite strange indeed. Is this a glitch with Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 update keeps on currupting my files &#40;I think&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So for the past month my computer keeps updating itself and when it does it is normal at first, i get to the login screen, log in and it takes a minute to load but then all that comes up is a black screen with a cursor. I can't see anything else, I can press
 ctrl+alt+del and that screen is visible but when I try to open task manager it doesn't display either. I've been restoring my computer to the previous updates since this problem started so I can use it. I'd like to figure out how to fix this, I appreciate
 any help.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> cjatdell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brother All-In-One MFC-7360N crashes Windows 8</h2>
                    I bought a Dell laptop with Windows 8 (64 bit). I also installed all the required drivers recommended by Windows and Brother in order to make this Brother all-in-one printer (MFC-7360N) to work.<br />
<br />
However, as soon as I plug the USB in, this sad face :( appears and my windows starts to reboot. If it helps, I see this 'usbxhci.sys' (with an X) error message along with the sad smiley.<br />
<br />
I have googled and been on the phone with Brother support for hours. There is still no solution. I also found this page -
<u>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Brother+MFC-7360N+All-in-One+Printer&amp;vendor=Brother&amp;Locale=1033&amp;BreadCrumbPath=Printers+%26+scanners|Multifunction|&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=win8</u> - stating
 that those two are compatible and there is no action required. Judging by the vote 5-1 "Not compatible" on the page, apparently someone is not telling the truth..<br />
<br />
Any suggestions and or solutions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<p>Did you install any&nbsp;third party USB 3.0 driver such as the Intel 3.0 driver?</p>
<p>Also, two of the minidump files you provided&nbsp;implicated McAfee components and you may be running a version of McAfee that is not compatible with Windows 8.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is to uninstall McAfee and see if the problem resolves.</p>
<p>For security software consider using just&nbsp;the built-in Windows antivirus and firewall.</p>
<p>Also, what Cyberlink software is installed? Is Power2Go installed?</p>

    <title>Is this true&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slingblayde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is this true&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a 4gb xbox 360 Slim, and obviously 4gb isnt enough space to do anything with. I want to drop a 250gig drive in it, but it is $100 bucks, I only paid $129 for the entire console. I talked to a friend of mine and told him I wanted to just buy a 250
 gig laptop SATA drive from the local computer shop (for 45 bucks instead of $100 PLUS 13% tax here in Canada for the "Official" 250gb xbox drive) and put it in my console like I did for my PS3. He told me I can be banned for doing that. WTF?!&nbsp; why would I
 want to pay double the price for a 250 gig drive inside a piece of plastic?</p>
<p>Why would they even sell a 4gb model then? 4gig is useless, and not every person is a sheep who likes to pay top dollar for something that says Microsoft on it. I dont get it. I just want to be able to install my games on a drive instead of thrashing the
 dvd rom at full speed on it every time I play a game. Sure I dont mind putting the disc in to play so it can verify I have the game, then run off the HD, but I dont want it spinning at full RPM the whole time because the original HD drive is too small to install
 pretty much anything on, and its against the rules to maybe save a few bucks and buy something NOT overpriced? For $100 bucks I can buy a 2 terabyte drive ffs, and M$ wants us to pay $100 for 250 gig? And ban you for NOT buying it from them?
</p>
<p>I certainly hope my friend is wrong about this or I may have wasted my time <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Yes it is against the terms and puts you at risk for being banned. The 4gb was made as a replacement for the old arcade 360s (which only had 512mb if I remember correctly) basicly for casual gamers.</p>

<p>The 4 gig is a joke....I dont know why they made that..what does it hold like one game save.Just another way for them to make money off people that didnt know any better.You can plug in a external flash card or hard drive,but it will only hold up to a certain
 amount,Cant remember how much but it isnt very much.It doesnt matter how big it is either....If you take your box apart for any reasons they will ban you from live....its considered modding.</p>

<p>16gigs is max mabuhay for non xbox hds</p>
<p>and yes the 4gig is not meant for serious gamers</p>
<p>thats what the 250gig model is for at 100dollars more</p>
<p>the hd is 120bucks seperately that is why it is suggested you buy the 250gig model</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PS3 drive is replaceable, but cannot be moved between consoles. Sony encrypts the drive such that only the console it was formatted in can read it. Take it out of that console and put it in a new console and it won't work without a reformat.[quote]Just
 has to be a certain kind which is the same in most PCs.[/quote]It has to be a 9.5mm SATA drive so it'll fit in the HDD bay. There are no other restrictions.</p>

<p>Its partly a lie. while the internal hard drive technically is supposed to be official x box hardware anyone can tell you that there is no stopping the external hard drive plugged into a usb slot. So it then becomes a question of licensing because while
 the hardware is on the outside of the device it is not a part of the console. Once you put it into the casing it then becomes part of the hardware and must pass the same licensing issues as all the other internal parts. &nbsp;I have no concrete knowledge just a
 general flow of the way I personally think it should work.</p>

1. <br />
<br />
Please write for what You need this driver. Notebook, desktop or maybe motherboard. Give us also information about producent and model.
<p>2.</p>
<p>To solve problem with <span><strong>Base System Device</strong> You will need to install
<strong>chipset</strong> or <strong>card reader</strong> dirver.<br />
</span></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Go to: <span><strong>Control Panel -&gt; Devices Manager</strong>
</span></p>
Click with right button of Your mouse on each yellow sign with exclamation mark (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ff0eomq.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pf8GgwfumwjFC_5IriwUfMy99bUSHVsJBfPWwQB8lk6XwOJhB7kghDFJ13EP-2UyYbejkQN0wzh74sxFbKlODPGmvGzXnstn_%2fAlert+mark.jpg" />
 ) and choose properties. Then go to bottom details and paste here <strong>hardware id</strong> . This way we will know what it is.<br />
<br />
Below You've got example how to do it:

<h2>            laptop can&#39;t see desktop pc in windows explorer</h2>
                    <p><strong><span>In the last couple days windows updated my desktop pc and one of my laptops (major update-KB4025339&nbsp; that took 25 minutes).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now I can’t access my desktop from my laptops.<span>&nbsp; The desktop icon has disappeared from windows explorer in the network heading. &nbsp;
</span>I can, however access my laptop from the desktop and I can print from the laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It seem that every time Microsoft does updates they change some of my settings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It even took my desktop out of my homegroup – I had to rejoin the group.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve looked at every setting I can think of and all of the files have sharing turned on.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What am I missing??<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything worked fine before the update process! Please help!</span></strong></p>

            I can only say that this problem occurs when using any app or program that is not a &nbsp;specific word processing program. I tried the suggested fixes, and none of them solved the problem. All the suggested boxes were checked.
