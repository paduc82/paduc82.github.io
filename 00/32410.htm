    <title>Video Playback Zoomed in. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andres gonzalez j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Playback Zoomed in.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have an HP Pavilion&nbsp;Notebook that I've had for almost two years now. It runs on Wondows 10, 12gb ram and an AMD Radeon HD 8400/ R3 Series graphics APU. Last week I was using my computer as I always have I recently aquired a webcam that I use with
 skype to chat with my family and friends abroad and everything was ok until one day I saw that all the videos were zoomed wether it be Facebook or a normal webpage like maybe a news webpage so I started looking for help going through different browsers and
 incognito and installing the latest version of flash player and running the video playback troubleshooter to the result that it couldn't identify the problem and so I kept searching until I found a solution for google chrome by disabling the "use hardware
 acceleration when available" option in chrome settings. But then I noticed the problem persisted outside of chrome in the rest of the computer for example in Skype when doing a video call, all incoming video was zoomed in and the preview of my outgoing video
 was also zoomed in I tried installing a new graphics driver but then the computer got slow and when I tried to fix it being slow updating the graphics driver it went back to how everything was initially.</p>

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />	Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

<h2>            Win 10 stuck at login screen</h2>
                    After the last update my other pc has stuck at the start screen, all I can see is the picture there is no login bar or power controls.<br />
Occasionally the screen flickers to purple or black instead and occasionally the loading circle replaces the mouse pointer but nothing seems to work at all.<br />
<br />
I cannot get safe mode to work as I cant acccess the power controls, it seems completely locked up and I have restarted again and again to no effect.

    <title>Surface pro 4 flickering&#47;ghosting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crimcup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 4 flickering&#47;ghosting</h2>
                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div>
<p>I am in veterinary school in the Caribbean so I have no access to any computer stores, let alone a Microsoft store. I am very upset with my Microsoft surface pro 4. I use it everyday, it has all my notes for classes and exams on it. I mainly use OneNote
 and google chrome. I bought it in late summer&nbsp;2016 before moving down here for school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>There is a really bad glitch that randomly occurs. It seems to be when I use my computer for a longer period of time. It "ghosts" pages on top of each&nbsp;other and the screen flickers in and out. It gets really bad and keeps
 me from being able to study or get any work done with it. I have tried updating it, restarting it, turning it off for a while and nothing resolves the issue. It stops glitching or at least slows down if I leave it alone for a half hour to an hour. I have read
 threads that a lot of other people have had this issue and I have tried the steps and nothing works.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Can someone please tell me what is wrong with the surface pro 4? Is there anything you can do to help me while I am away at school? I am in desperate need of a solution.</div>
<p>
</p><p>If a Microsoft rep can contact me I have videos of the issue I have tried emailing to Microsoft but get no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi.&nbsp; I am also getting the same problems as are many others, and&nbsp; I cant find the definitive answer to the problem. I have deleted apps that could cause potential conflict like icloud and waiting to see if that helps. I have also noticed that after prolonged
 and heavy use the Surface gets very hot and the ghosting is more likely to happen.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft can give some answers to this.&nbsp;</p>

            That is the same thing that happens to me! It's whenever I use it for a couple hours. The fan starts running hard as well like its getting too hot. Very frustrating that there aren't any answers for this.

            If it is out of warranty would Microsoft still replace it? I can't be without a computer since I am in school. If anything, I could ship it home after having family bring me a new computer but at this point I don't know if its worth investing in another
 Microsoft product since I am having so many issues without answers. I am so upset that this product only lasted about 2 years. If so many people post and complain about having the same issue with the surface pro, why aren't we getting feedback about the issue?

<h2>            Meu controle n&#38;&#35;227&#59;o sincroniza no Xbox 360&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Dae bugrada! De boa?</p>

<p>Seguinte, eu estou com problemas para sincronizar meu controle. O game é novo, e nunca teve em assistência.</p>
<p>Eu ja vi algumas perguntas do gênero, e vídeos explicando como sincronizar. Mas não funcionou!</p>
<p>Eu estou fazendo do seguinte jeito.</p>
<p>Eu ligo o Console através do controle... Até aí tudo bem... Mas quando eles procuram sincronizar sozinhos, isso não acontece!... As luzes do controle ficam piscando.. (as 4 simultaneamente). Eu fiz o processo apertando o botão de sincronizar do console e
 depois o pequeno do controle.. Esperei, e adivinha? NADA ACONTECEU... Então, pensei que poderia ser a bateria descarregada.. Eu carreguei com o cabo USB da Microsoft, e deixei até o led ficar verde. Belza.. Então tentei denovo, e mais uma vez, não deu certo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Será que alguém pode me ajudar?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Não existe ordem para qual botão apertar primeiro, pode ser o do console quanto o do controle, tanto faz! Vendo o vídeo parece que você está demorando para precionar o botão do controle depois que o ciclo da busca no console já está acabando!</p>
<p>SOLUÇÃO: Tente precionar os 2 botões de sicronização ao mesmo tempo e mantenha-os precionados até que a busca comece a ser realizada!</p>

    <title>Error&#39;s after Windows 8 Reinstall &#40;Error 1935, Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james williger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#39;s after Windows 8 Reinstall &#40;Error 1935, Windows Update Error&#58; 800F0922&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So lately I've been having issues with my PC completely turning off in the middle of certain tasks that I was able to do before
</p>
<p>(Watching Netflix, playing games, rendering videos...)</p>
<p>I would watch the CPU on the task manager reach up to 100% very easily. After much trying to fix it by checking for viruses, malware and any possible programs that I didn't want installed, I gave up.
</p>
<p>So I decided to just reformat the hard drive and reinstall Windows 8. To my surprise my PC still kept shutting off when doing these certain tasks and when I tried reinstalling League of Legends, it gave me
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error 1935.An error occurred during the installation of assembly 'Microsoft.VC80.ATL.type="win32".version="8.0.50727.762".publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b".processorArchitecture="amd64"'.</p>
<p>Please refer to Help and Support for more information."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I could not install 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable' no matter how I tried.
</p>
<p>So I reinstalled Windows 8 again and I still had the same problem. I also found that I could not update Windows through 'Windows Update' either. It always gave me "Windows Update Error: 800F0922"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not install iTunes, LoL, nor play some other games I could before, I used CCleaner and fixed everything but the problem still lingers.</p>
<p>So this is the only problem that I found I could not fix on my own and I need some help from the community.</p>
<p>All help will be very appreciated, thanks!</p>

I would suggest you to reset Windows update components and see if that helps. <br />

            <p>I reset Windows Update components and that certainly did not help. </p>
<p>It said that the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Service Registration missing or corrupt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update Error 0x80070490 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fixed</p>

<p>
</p><p>I actually never had the Windows Update Error 0x80070490 ever show up so that's new

<p>Like I've previously stated, Windows Update is not working. It's giving me Error 800F0922 and nothing I've done so far has been able to fix it.</p>

<h3> sayedsauce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Phone on Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>I'm in the insider preview program and my "your phone companion" app was displaying my notifications and had the option to mirror my screen. They said "In Preview" next to them. I reset the app because it wasn't recognizing another phone I was trying to
 add. When I did that the last 2 in preview options disappeared. Is there anyway to get them back?</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect android phones to wireless network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian_15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect android phones to wireless network</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I own 2 droid phones, now they can connect to old Belkin router and hot spots<br />
but they are unable to connect to MN-700<br />
But my laptops can connect to wireless<br />
I don't have MAC filtering enabled<br />
I tried enabling it and added phones' MAC address but no luck<br />
Static IP setting is not set on the router nor on my phones<br />
I also can't connect to my friend's mumble server... I don't know if they are related problems<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
(Sorry for positing on Windows forum, there was no option for router)<br />

            Hello, try resetting Edge to see if that fixes the issue.
<br />
<br />1- If you're running Microsoft Edge, close it.
<br />
<br />2- Open File Explorer and type the following path into the address: C:\Users\UseYourUsername\AppData\Local\Packages and hit Enter. (Remember to replace "UseYourUsername" with your user account name.)
<br />
<br />3- Select and try to delete the Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe folder as you would with any other folder. If you get a "Folder Access Denied" prompt, simply click Continue. Also, there might be some content that you won't be able to delete. If this is the case, in the dialog box, select to skip the files.
<br />
<br />4- Once you've tried deleting all the content, go inside the Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe folder and try deleting the remaining folders by selecting all the folders, right-clicking them, selecting Delete, and clicking Yes to confirm the deletion. You may notice that you can't delete AC folder, but that's alright.
<br />
<br />5- Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />6- Now, were going to re-register Microsoft Edge in your account. Open the Start menu, search for Windows PowerShell, right-click it from the result, and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />7- Type the following command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />cd C:\Users\UseYourUsername. (Remember to replace "UseYourUsername" with your user account name.)
<br />
<br />Then, type the following command exactly and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" -Verbose}
<br />
<br />That's all there is to it. If you want to be cautious, restart your computer one more time, and then you should be able to run Microsoft Edge again and hopefully without any issues.

<h2>            My Skype logs out on its own &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    At random times through out the day my skype just logs off. I could be having a conversation and it logs off , I can hear the other person still there, but obviously I can't respond. When I log back in and they try to call me or I call them skype will
 freeze and crash. I may have to do this 1 or 2 more times until it works. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it still does this. How can I fix it?

<h2>            Clipboard sync not working</h2>
                    <p>Under Settings, System, Clipboard, Sync across devices, there is a Sign in hyperlink, but I'm already signed in. I should see "Automatically sync text that I copy" and "Never automatically sync text that I copy." Why are these options missing and why is
 it displaying "Sign in" when I'm already signed in? My second PC displays the correct options.</p>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just got my first Windows 8 machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having problems accessing my files using a C++ program I have written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, when I get properties on the folder, it shows Read Only. If I change it, and check again, it still shows Read Only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files in c::\Program Files\NMS\DataFiles needs to be accessible. to the program which opens them with share access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not a practicing developer, but you are running into the Least User Privilege component in Windows. This can be fixed by including a Manifest in your C++ program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend that you post this question in the appropriate Developer forums. The experts there will be able to guide you.</p>

<p>and along the way there will be &nbsp;a few all out sprints. &nbsp;Extra points for finishing with style and class. &nbsp;Having the 5ghz band replaced with a defiant firmware glitch causing the NIC to power down all to often that took 12+ months to update is why Intel
 has competition in this round.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue with the NIC which needs to support 2.4 and 5.0 bands but for now it is only supporting 2.4.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A wireless network router has a limited broadcast range. The further the computer is from the router, the weaker the broadcast signal. Solid objects, such as walls, metal furniture, and electrical appliances might interfere with the signal and decrease
 the usable range.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For testing purposes, move the computer closer to the router and minimize interference from electrical devices. If testing the connection with the computer near to the router proves that the wireless connection does not disconnect at a significant
 interval, you can move the computer to determine the range of the connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s first run the Network and Network Adapter troubleshooter and check if that provides any useful information regarding this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the wonderful process to diagnose any and all windows wifi/nic issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps i did not make my question clear. The 2.4ghz spectrum is so overcrowded where I live/work and my 2.4ghz sub-net is also taxed to the max (I have 802.11G devices ported in to this 2.4ghz sub-net and I only have 802.11N &amp; AC on the 5ghz sub-net). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need (want really badly) to take advantage of the 5ghz spectrum/sub-net and the current NIC I have does not do that. &nbsp;so I need (wanton desire) a new NIC that does. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were upgrading your NIC from single band (plus BlueTooth) to DUAL Band which MANUFACTURER (INTEL? BROADCOM? ACME? Etc.?) would you go with and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your wonderful reply, I am looking forward to your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>AdMan The Lab Rat</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are willing to update the NIC drivers then it is better to check the network adapter in your device manager and see which you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to update the drivers for the same Network adapter.&nbsp;If it is showing INTEL, I would suggest you to update the drivers for the same NIC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the steps provided below to check the manufacturer of network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Device manager </strong>from the list.</li><li>Expand the<strong> Network Adapters </strong>and you will be able to see the <strong>
manufacturer of the NIC</strong>.</li></ol>

            <p>Howdy Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quality response, I really appreciate it. &nbsp;Funny you should mention that.... I had not received any email notification of a reply to my question and decided to see if perhaps I missed it or it got SPAM'd or whatever and low and behold there
 indeed was a response from you. &nbsp;Thank you, my apologies for not getting back with you sooner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the NIC I have is an an "Intel Wireless-N 7620 + BT" </p>
<p>I have attempted several times over the past two years and as recently as in February 2015, &nbsp;April 2015 and June 2015 to update the NIC's original driver (the one and only original Driver was dated 9/13/2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some magical reason THIS MORNING TODAY an update was available and I was able to successfully install that updated NIC DRIVER via the Windows 8.1 GUI --&gt; Device Manager --&gt; NIC = N-7620+BT --&gt; Properties --&gt; Update Driver --&gt; Search Other Web Sources
 (NOT Windows Update)... AND now the Driver is dated = 12/9/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted, the DELL Inspiron 17 7537 she rebooted and reconnected just swimmingly to the 2.4GHz Router, since it is still a single band NIC = still no 5GHz functionality. &nbsp;I shall get back to you about any changes in performance/handling characteristics
 since the box is temporarily undergoing preventative maintenance at the moment, since I am running a complete VIRUS scan. &nbsp;I am hoping this Driver upgrade works out, I know alot of folks with this configuration are feeling the same pains I am and have no 802.11AC
 capabilities coming there way soon. &nbsp;When the 802.11N works it's beautiful, but when it hangs, it's horrible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am really interested in upgrading the NIC </strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Still I am curious if anyone has a compelling reason to use BROADCOM instead of INTEL</strong></p>
<p>My reasons are the current NIC (Intel-N 7260+BT) has two major Win 8.1 issues Intel is aware of and has yet to fix:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The BlueTooth Mouse connection randomly drops forcing a reboot to fix it and</li><li>Waking the PC up from sleep after an hour also drops the WiFi connection forcing a reboot to fix.&nbsp;</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Sheldon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><b>Step A:</b> Boot the computer in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Safe mode</b></a><b> </b>and check if the issue persists. </p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step B:</b></p>
<p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>clean boot</b></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b>” to return the computer to a

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting a program error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try the Methods given below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>How do I disable InPrivate browsing in Windows 7 HP version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlpmlw  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable InPrivate browsing in Windows 7 HP version&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 HP. I want to disable InPrivate browsing. I want to be able to see my history of web sites I visited. I am a novice on a computer. Any information that I have read about disabling InPrivate browsing tells me to change my registry. I am
 not comfortable in doing this and&nbsp; do not quite understand this. I have always read not to change your registry if you are not experienced with computers. I think this is a terrible feature. It should be made easy to disable on Windows 7 HP just as the other
 Windows 7 versions. I am so stressed over this. I just want to be able to view&nbsp;my history of web sites that I visited. This is a new computer and I don't want to mess it up.&nbsp;Can anyone&nbsp;make this easy for me to fix? I would appreciate any help. Just remember,
 I&nbsp;am still learning about&nbsp;using a computer, so please be&nbsp;precise and gentle when explaining.&nbsp;
