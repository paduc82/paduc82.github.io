    <title>how to create a document library without creating a group&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willem weetjewel  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to create a document library without creating a group&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We are a small company of 3 people with Office 365 Business Premium. We only need the companies documents available to all users in Windows Explorer and occasionally on a smartphone or tablet. Since the new OneDrive client was released early this year we
 were - for the first time in 2 years - a little bit happy with the filesharing part of Office 365.<br />
We do not use or need any of the online collaboration features of SharePoint. But when we need a new directory tree in our &lt;companyname&gt; folder I learned that I need to go online and create a "Site", go to the "Documents" library of that site and synchronize
 it to all PC's and laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I created a new site this way, I had not done it for a few months. About an hour after I did that we all got an email "You've joined the &lt;sitename&gt; group" with the same name. The content of the email is in terrible facebookish would-be-social media
 style including even a Like button.&nbsp;Yech! The group&nbsp;also appeared in our already overcrowded folder pane in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all hate Facebook and don't want anything from that culture in our company. More in general, we only need email, calendar and all our documents shared to all users by default. Nothing else.<br />
How can I create a new document library in C:\user\&lt;username&gt;\&lt;companyname&gt;\ without creating a group? I noticed that with the new sync client the name "SharePoint" is not used anymore in Windows Explorer. The icon also changed. But online it still has the
 SharePoint name and logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is SharePoint still the way to go if you need all documents and folders shared company-wide? If so, how can I create new document libraries without creating groups?</p>

<p>Hi Willem,<br />
<br />
From your description, I assume you just created a group site. In your situation, you don't need to do so, as you're using Office 365 Business Premium, you can create a site in SharePoint admin center:<br />
go to <a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 admin center </a>&gt; Admin centers &gt; SharePoint &gt; site collections &gt; New &gt; Private Site Collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a site in SharePoint admin center will not create a group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
James</p>

<p>Thank you, James. This seems to work. To my relief, after an hour or so,&nbsp;it showed up as a normal site, not as "site collection", when I click SharePoint from the Office 365 app launcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we are able to keep working like we did, it only got more complicated. But that fits in a good Office 365 tradition. I'm pretty sure that there was no SharePoint Admin Center when we started about 2 years ago and creating sites was much easier. SharePoint
 is way, way too complicated for small companies and it is getting worse. We need something like Dropbox! OneDrive is much better than SharePoint but unfortunately you cannot set it to share everything bij default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks again.</p>

<p>Later&nbsp;I learned that there is a simple way to make "Create new site" behave like it was before groups were invented. Go to&nbsp;Sharepoint Admin Center &gt; Settings &gt; scroll down to Site Creation and make this change:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1aa6e8ad-ef76-4e1c-ae40-c2b8d38c100b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1aa6e8ad-ef76-4e1c-ae40-c2b8d38c100b" /></a><br />
and click OK at the bottom of that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that creating a subsite of a teamsite does not create a group. A bit to my surprise, when you sync a subsites document library&nbsp;it appears as a separate tree of folders in C:\users\&lt;user&gt;\&lt;company&gt;\</p>
<p>I would expect it to appear one level deeper, under \teamsite - documents\ but it gets on the same level.</p>
<p>With the new OneDrive client the 5000 item limit is gone, so I guess this is another option to get a new document share.</p>

            Hi Willem,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your sharing.<br />
About the local synced path of the subsite, this is expected that the parent site name will not be added into the path. The path is always in this format: ...\company name\&lt;site or subsite name-library name&gt;\ no matter we sync a library in a parent site or
 a subsite.<br />
<br />

                    Outlook 2013 is not saving my emails that I send into the sent items folder. I have Outlook 2010 installed on a different computer and it works fine. As far as I can tell I have outlook 2013 configured properly. I think everything is set to default settings.
 Why is Outlook 2013 not saving sent items yet Outlook 2010 is doing so?

            Outlook 2013 may not be using the same Sent&nbsp; folder as Outlook 2010.&nbsp; Outlook 2010 gives you the option to use a server folder or a local folder, Outlook 2013 does not allow this and uses a server folder only. If Outlook 2010 is using a local folder, the
 results you see would be expected. Outlook 2010 also allows you to select which server folder to use, so, it may be using a different server folder than Outlook 2013. Be sure you use the "IMAP Folders" button to refresh the folder list and check for the presence
 of additional Sent folders. I have an IMAP account that I've had for many years. It currently contains 3 different Sent Items folders, "Sent", which Outlook 2013, my Android smartphone, and the current webmail client from&nbsp;this ISP&nbsp;all use, "mail/Sent-mail"
 which the webmail client used to use, and "Sent Items" which Outlook 2010, my old Windows Mobile 6.1 smartphone, and, I believe, the Windows Live email client used.

            I have looked at IMAP Folders and refreshed it and there is no other folder that remotely looks like a sent item folder. All folders are synchronized. When I started Outlook 2013 just now it synced up the Sent Items folder and I see all of the items that
 I sent with Outlook 2010. I then sent an email from Outlook 2013 to another email account. That email was delivered but nothing showed up in Sent Items. There must be a solution for this.

This problem is vexing a whole lot of people, because Outlook 2013 has changed the way of handling sent mail for IMAP accounts:&nbsp; you can no longer direct Outlook to place sent mail in a folder of your choice.&nbsp; I'm now forced to manually copy sent mail from
 the IMAP server's "Sent Mail" folder into my local folder.&nbsp; What a pain.<br />
<br />
So here's a question for a savvy Outlook expert:&nbsp; When I am formatting an email to send, I can pull down the Options menu, click on "Save Sent Item To", and then click on "Other Folder".&nbsp; Then I can navigate to my local Sent Mail folder.&nbsp; So when I send the
 email, that's where Outlook will save it.&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp; But it's just for that single email.&nbsp; What I want to know is this:&nbsp; Can I cause this behavior to be the default for all of my sent emails so I don't have to specify it every time?<br />

I can confirm that I have 100 % the identical situation. What I find extremely strange is this:
<div><br />
<div>1. In Outlook / File / Options / Mail there is an option to click "Save copies of messages in the Sent Items folder". But it does not save them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. In the Account settings / More settings / Advanced we can unclick "Do not save copies of sent items". You would think that this means that copies are saved automatically. (Why make this a negative anyway? Better like before: Save a copy ...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. So many people complain about this. Some offer clever work-arounds. (I have one too, I made a filter inside Gmail to copy all mail from me to a folder called "sent items Office 13 bug" which Outlook then synchronizes and from where I then move the files
 to the real Outlook "sent items" folder.) But why does the MS Office team not come forward with an official response?<br />

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule works: Nice! Thank you. </span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>The only problem that now remains is that all these copies of all sent <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages are shown in BOLD as they are "unread"... Have you found <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a way to mass-reset them at the end of each day?</span></i><br />
<br />
You certainly can do it manually whenever you want.&nbsp; Select all the messages you want deleted (Cntl-A will select all messages in the folder), right click, and click on "Mark as Read".&nbsp; Can't say whether you can do it automatically;&nbsp; but I actually appreciate
 that default behavior.&nbsp; I often have some un-dispositioned emails in my Sent Items folder (I may delete them or move them to another folder);&nbsp; having the new ones come in as "Unread" differentiates them for me.<br />

                    I have a problem in opening my Message section on my Communicater, as it shows an alert saying; Problem starting Messaging centre. In this case I can't even send messages at all.

            Sounds like you might have to format it or have the firmware updated...<br />
<br />
To format the communicator, remove and then replace the battery. Then when you see the word Nokia in blue on the inside screen, hold down the ctrl, shift and F keys simultaneously. After the word Nokia disappears and before the Nokia handshake logo appears,
 you should be given the option to completely format the device .<br />
<br />
ALL DATA on the phone memory will be completely erased and the original settings restored so make sure you have any important data backed up.<br />
<br />
If you didn't get the option to format the device before the Nokia handshake logo appears, repeat the same process again and hopefully you will receive the option before this logo appears.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, find a Nokia engineer to update the firmware on the phone.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, the
All Account</span> contains trash emails from Trash folder under every email account you have signed in Outlook 2016 for Mac, based on your description, may I confirm that if can you open these email without subject in Trash folder? if yes, please open the
 email and based on the email content to check whether you can find those email from your added account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it these email still doesn’t exist in your added account, I still suggest you contact our

<h2>            The Layout view and print view of report does not match</h2>
                    <p>I have created and formatted report in design view, the report is long and have two pages. After I create the report, the layout view is fine, but the print preview is giving me the issue.</p>
<p>When I go to print preview, the second page does not load. The second page is not visible even if you export to PDF, however, I can see the contents of the second page when I print the physical copy, but the background and setup is weird on second page.</p>
<p>How can I make the report and knowing where the page break is in Design View?</p>
<p>How can I make the second page visible in print preview and look similar to the first page?</p>
<p>I also receive error saying my for is wider that the page, but I have make sure that all contents fit in letter size paper.</p>
<p>Please help me make my report works,</p>

            <p>1) How can I make the report and knowing where the page break is in Design View?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can add a page break control in your section to force the page break at a specific location</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How can I make the second page visible in print preview and look similar to the first page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this might be related to the page width</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I also receive error saying my for is wider that the page, but I have make sure that all contents fit in letter size paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Your report width + left margin + right margin shouldn't exceed the total width of your paper</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When a report area is wider than the page it could be due to a horizontal line exceeding the page width. For example, if you use a page 8.5 inches wide with left and right margins set to 0.5 inches the report area should not be more that 7.5 inches wide.
 If the area is too wide it gets pushed to the next page. If the cause is a line you might not even see the overlap and the page will look blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grab the right edge of the report in design view and slide it to the left. If it won't move in a control such as a line or label is too far to the right. Either adjust the margins or move whichever control is in the way to the left.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the .ppsx on another computer with PowerPoint 2013, not PowerPoint 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I checked PowerPoint 2013 &amp; 2016 can both handle embedded video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I originally embedded the .mp4 into the PowerPoint 2016 .ppsx file I might have actually linked it, instead of embedded it. I'll check the file tomorrow when I have access to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran an embedded video test with PowerPoint 2013. I embedded an .mp4, then emailed it to a friend who also has PowerPoint 2013. The video played just fine on the friend's end. That leads me to believe that I need to change the .mp4 in the other PowerPoint
 2016 file from linked to embedded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>When you are working with Powerpoint and embedding media on it, the media is an external file. Although the code is present on the slides and the media is visible on your computer, it does not get played on the other computer as the linking is relative to
 your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to create a package file where all the media, fonts and anything extra that you have used are present and linked properly and can be viewed the same way as you view it on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powerpoint helps you create that package by using the Package for CD option found is the Publishing options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use this option you are given 2 options. Copy to CD and copy to folder. Choose copy to folder and choose where you want to save the package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you will be asked if you want to include all the linked files. Click on yes. It will then create a folder for you where all of the files are included.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A PPT viewer is also included which should be used to view your presentation. If the ppt file is directly viewed it may take the default options of the other PC and may not link the files correctly. Start the presentation through PPT View which is included
 in the folder.</p>

<h2>            5800 - How to change default web connection setting&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I try to use OVI, BBC iPlayer etc. it tries to connect to internet via my post-paid SIM connection even when WiFi connection available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make WiFi connection as default web setting instead of connecting using my SIM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I open Opera, it presents a list of available connections I can easily select one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

<p>If you have no data allowance don't use internet based apps. You can always use built in browser by going to connectivity and selecting WLAN and selecting start web browsing. But the best solution is to take out a data plan, it will really improve your user
 experience and get the most out of your phone , without worrying.</p>

<p>I already have that setting! Yet I'm facing this issue. That's why I'm puzzled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some apps like Opera behaves as expected, but OVI store, BBC iPlayer etc. are going via network provider by default and I don't seem to have way to tell them use WiFi instead.</p>

<p>When I'm trying to connect say OVI, it says "connecting using O2 Postpay WAP"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, this "O2 Postpay WAP" is under "Uncategorized" section in my connection setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If delete this, shall I be able to send SMS?</p>

<p>Also, I'm reluctant to delete my network setting entire because on some occassions I do like to connect via network provider.</p>

            For Ovi, you don't have to use the app, you can connect to web via WLAN and use browser to go to Ovi store and download from your account, and BCC &nbsp;iPlayer won't work with O2 !

            profiles can be edited to suit your needs so you may want to edit these and set them up for your personal use on some s60 phones the clock you use can be different the date will show inside the clock if you select analogue if you use the digital clock

</p><p>HRM MC Chaos:</p>
<p>Your're error 0x800723fd is temporary connectivity error. But if your problems include the 8 listed above then your build 10041 seems to be screwed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This MS url is for trying to fix connectivity:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/818018/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would address that connectivity error by applying all the solutions listed in above KB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you should get the latest iso file for build 10041 and do clean install using usb/rufus. When you do clean install, are you deleting all partitions until only one partition (unallocated) remains in custom selection proces? After install is complete
 I would check power options first. On my past updates I have noticed that each build puts my power options back to default. Some of those default setting include "sleep" options that I think slow down any new windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have personally done about 4 clean installs of different builds along the way to build 10049. Try to be patient with clean install of build 10041 (it is very slow). Some insiders have suggested that when build 10049 update is finished downloading and begins
 install process you should disable your internet adapter. That will speed up the install process.</p>

            <p>I've got essentially the same problem (updates end with error code <strong>0x80072efd</strong>) with the enterprise tech preview, build 10074, installed clean (reformatted disk). The environment is a corporate network with unauthenticated proxy servers guarding
 the perimeter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Message Analyzer 1.2 (just released) I see that the windows update process is still ignoring the proxy settings; the Windows 10 system is cheerfully attempting to establish a direct connection with the Microsoft (Akamai) servers. The system does enumerate&nbsp;(apparently
 correctly)&nbsp;the patches that are available, but errors out when attempting to download them.&nbsp; The proxy selection works quite well for normal IE traffic, so the configuration settings don't seem to be faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failure occurs regardless of whether the proxy is selected by a proxy.pac script with a hard-coded URL or with the proxy server itself hard-coded in both IE and winhttp.&nbsp; WPAD is not used because of security considerations, and winhttp for unknown reasons
 has never supported hard-coded paths to proxy.pac.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the testbed I have on a laptop I've been able to get the updates by temporarily connecting to a DMZ drop in our lab - obviously not a viable workaround for our field tests that must run before rollout. The DMZ drop is also unusable for the Win10 system
 I'm running in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: is there a way to make Update honor the IE setting for proxy selection?&nbsp; Can we expect this to be fixed before RTM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: Especially in the *ENTERPRISE* version of the preview, why in the name of $DEITY have several builds been allowed to go out with this bug?</p>

            After upgrading from 8.1 to 10 I could not connect to the Store (0x80072EFD). Nor would Cortina connect to the Net. I read through tons of FAQs etc. Most suggestions took me into exasperation hell. Bottom line: I found my proxy settings and turned them
 off. I can now access the Store and Cortina does what I ask instead of telling me she can't connect to the Internet. You will get lost following all the various instructions and the deadends to which they lead on your set-up. Just find Proxy set-up and turn
 it off.

<h2>            How do I get Microsoft Word to type &#39;&#254;&#39; from the US-International keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I have three keyboard layouts activated on my Windows 8 64-bit laptop: US, US-International, and a customized layout for typing in Old English.&nbsp; The custom layout was installed a few days ago, and since then, Microsoft Word 2013 has been unable to type
 a lowercase 'þ' (Unicode 00FE)&nbsp; It is accessed by Alt(Gr)-T on both Old English and US-International layouts, and every other program types it just fine (including other Office applications).&nbsp; Word will even type the uppercase 'Þ' (Unicode 00DE) just fine
 as well, but it just does nothing whenever I try to type the lowercase version.&nbsp; The only way to input 'þ' into a Word document is to either use the Insert Symbol menu or Copy/Paste from another program (e.g. Notepad).<br />
<br />
I'm not even sure if the Old English layout was the trigger.&nbsp; I'm only guessing due to the coincidental timing of the problem's onset.&nbsp; The layout was designed with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4.<br />
<br />
I recall having a similar problem on a slightly older machine of mine that I believe has since crashed due to unrelated issues, though I can't remember what may have triggered it or how I stumbled onto a solution (if I ever did).&nbsp; Microsoft Word just does not
 seem to like the 'þ' character, since its ability to type it is apparently quite delicate for some reason.&nbsp; Curiously, at least sometimes, if I type the capital first, that will enable the lowercase counterpart to be typed successfully for a short while thereafter.<br />
<br />
There is another report of this problem (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeversion_other-word/us-international-keyboard-problems/1d0645a0-cacc-461f-91fe-9ee8aa66c2ca">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeversion_other-word/us-international-keyboard-problems/1d0645a0-cacc-461f-91fe-9ee8aa66c2ca</a>),
 but the discussion seems to have ended before a solution was found.&nbsp; Any advice would be most appreciated!

            I offered it as an alternative because while ALT+0254 works on a machines running Word 2013 and 2016 under Windows 10, and while all of the other keycodes work on a machine running Word 2003, 2007 or 2010 under Windows 7, neither ALT+0253 or ALT+0254 do
 anything.

<h2>            Calculating standard deviation from summarized count data</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a data set exported from Qualtrics where the output is counted data from an ordinal Likert question. In other words, rather than the raw data, I have the total number who selected option 1, number who selected option 2, etc. through 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 1:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1 - 120</p>
<p>Option 2 - 36</p>
<p>Option 3 - 49</p>
<p>Option 4 - 11</p>
<p>Option 5 - 2</p>
<p>Total: 218</p>
<p>
</p><p>I calculated the average Likert score as 1.8 by assigning a value of 1 to option 1, 2 to option 2, and so on, and taking the average. However, how can I calculate spread data like standard deviation using this count data? I obviously do not want to type
 out 120 1's, 36 2s, 49 3s, 11 4s, and 2 5s into Excel. And of course, if I take the standard deviation of the numbers as-is, I will get the stddev of the 5 count numbers rather than the 218 responses they represent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<br />This has single formulas for calculating Mean, SD-P and SD-S. 
<br />
<br />I have also prepared a table where 120, 1s, 36, 2s etc. are inserted and calculated Mean &amp; SD for these through regular formulas.  You can verify that the results are same in both approaches.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Publisher 365 - which I think is 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have mail merge problem, when I Finish and Merge I cannot select multiple records to merge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 700 records in my CSV, and I normally select differing amounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently need &nbsp;these records merged:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1,4,11,18,25,32,39,46,53,60,67,74,81,88,95,102,109,116,123,130,137,144,151,158,165,172,179,186,193,200,207,214,221,228,235,242,249,256,263,270,277,284,291,298,305,312,319,326,333,340,347,354,361,366,370,377,384,391,398,405,412,419,426,433,440,447,454,461,468,475,482,489,496,503,510,517,524,531,538,545,552,559,566,573,580,587,594,601,608,615,622,629,636,643,650,657,664,671,678,685,692,699,706,713,720,727</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no option to select these amounts for new publication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The merge to Print, Print pages text box has a limit of only 255 !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer if this can be rectified, maybe option like this :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select record from column AK start count at record 2 select records in AK that differ EG:</p>
<p>REC1 NUMBERS</p>
<p>REC2 1</p>
<p>REC3 1</p>
<p>REC4 2</p>
<p>REC5 2</p>
<p>REC6 2</p>
<p>REC7 5</p>
<p>
</p><p>COMMAND : START 2, CELL AK, SELECT FIRST DIFFS</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECTS FIRST 1, 2, 5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merge records : 2, 4, 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway How to select list of records number sequence above in Publisher ?</p>

            <p>Sorry. Though you can pre-filter recipients I would suggest the easiest solution for you is to do a 'pre-sort' of your data source file using Excel or whatever program you used to create the CSV file and Save As that file for that specific merge.</p>

    <title>Bug occurring when executing saved sql queries which had been executed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emp.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug occurring when executing saved sql queries which had been executed before they have been saved&#63;</h2>
                    When I write new queries in Access I often run these queries before I save them to figure out whether my queries do actually work. Before saving a query access gives them standard names like, e.g., "query1". If "query1" works as expected, I save this query,
 e.g., as "myquery1". However, if I afterwards execute "myquery1" Access asks me to enter missing parameters such as "query1.expr1001". Of course, "query1" doesn't exists any more (this was the temporary name given by Access before saving). I could also copy
 and save the same sql statement from myquery1/query1 to a new query which works perfectly - provided that I have saved the query before I execute it the first time.<br />
<br />
For me this looks like an extremely annoying bug which occurs because Access makes a mess with temporarily saved or renamed queries. Did someone else encounter the same behavior? Is there an explanation (why this is not a bug)?
<br />
<br />
By the way, I encountered the same issue in Access 2007/2010/2013. Sometimes I wonder whether MS actually improves its software from one version to the next (e.g. why does the Access query editor not remember text formatting (line breaks), why does a short
 cut like ctrl+a not work in this text field? These are just two examples of two extremely small and easy UI improvements which would help me to deal with complex queries)...<br />

            I think you misunderstand the OP's point, which is that if they open the query design window in SQL view (and possibly in design view, they don't say) it is captioned by default Abfrage6 (Abfrage is German for 'query').&nbsp; If they then enter an SQL statement
 and opens it as a datasheet it's fine.&nbsp; If they then go back into SQL view and enter a different SQL statement and save it under a name of their choice, when they subsequently try to open the now saved query, they are prompted for a value of a parameter with
 a name which includes a reference to Abfrage6.<br />
<br />
I tried to reproduce this behaviour at the time of the original post without success, and cannot do so now.&nbsp; The behaviour is inexplicable to me.&nbsp; There is no mention of Abfrage6 in the SQL statement, and no attempt is being made to reference a query of that
 name anywhere else as far as I can see on the evidence available. <br />
<br />
I did originally raise the question of whether a computed column Expr1001 had been created at some time, but there is no column of that name referenced in the SQL statement.&nbsp; The SQL statement is clearly fine per se as it opens successfully as Abfrage7.&nbsp; In
 view of my failure to reproduce the behaviour described, all I can think of is that this is behaviour experienced only in the German language version of Access.&nbsp; If so, it's justifiable to regard it as a bug.<br />
<br />
<strong>UPDDATE</strong>:&nbsp; A thought occurred to me, so I tested it.&nbsp; I created a simple query SELECT * FROM Contacts; and opened it as a datasheet. I then ordered the query by the LastName column, not by creating an ORDER BY clause, but by right clicking the
 column in datasheet view and selecting the ascending order option (A-Z).&nbsp; This actually creates an OrderBy
<em>property </em>for the query under the skin.&nbsp; I then reverted to SQL view and entered an SQL statement SELECT * FROM AgeGroups;&nbsp; Right enough when I tried to open this as a datasheet I was prompted for Query1.LastName, i.e. I was able to reproduce the behaviour
 experienced by the OP.&nbsp; If that's not a bug, then I don't know what is!<br />
<br />
I've always felt that a querydef object having an OrderBy property was one of Microsoft's more stupid endeavours as the way to order a query's result set is by an ORDER BY clause.&nbsp; Now I'm more convinced than ever.<br />

            It doesn't sound like a serious problem.<br />
Excel 2010 contains some features that were not available in previous versions.<br />
You are saving the workbook in Excel 97-2003 format and it is telling you that it has converted some cell formats to the closest that it can&nbsp;achieve in that format.&nbsp; Should still be openable in 2003 or earlier.

            The #&nbsp; in the first column in the playlist view is the position of the track in the playlist and not the "track number". So, let it sort by this column... and move around the tracks to how you like it.

            <p>This has been resolved by uninstalling office completely including clearing out registry and directories.</p>
<p>Used Revo Uninstaller to complete remove office from the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>then re-installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Okay.</p>

<h2>            Problem adding numbers and or letters in word. Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a research paper in word and have always been able to add letters or numbers by typing a number or letter, then a period, then space bar. Once I completed the previously noted steps the number or letter would automatically be properly spaced.&nbsp;
 I know how to use the numerical outline function but that is not what i'm looking for help with.&nbsp; Hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
