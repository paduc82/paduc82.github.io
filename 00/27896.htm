    <title>Reduced Screen Size&#47;Resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anne guelker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reduced Screen Size&#47;Resolution</h2>
                    <p>Back in July 2016 Don helped me by providing instructions on how to stretch the image to fill the screen on my 21-1/2" HP desktop computer - open a favorite, then open a link from within that favorite by clicking on "open in a new window."&nbsp; Then close the
 first window and then the second window.&nbsp; That worked very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in November 2016 I had the same problem. That time I could stretch the top, right and left edges and they would stay put.&nbsp; The bottom edge would not stay put.&nbsp; Bruce provided this response</p>
<p>"Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize.
<span style="color: rgba(204, 0, 0, 1)"><em><strong>Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last</strong></em></span>. Windows will remember the size used of the
<span style="color: rgba(204, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>last window closed</strong></span> the next time you open the program.<br />
Or, whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<div>That solved the problem.</div>
<div>Today my computer was worked on remotely, and this time I ended up with smaller images again.&nbsp; I have tried for a very long time tonight to use the proposed solutions, including locating "Properties" but when I click on "Properties" there is no option
 for "Run" or "Maximize."&nbsp; The only edge that I cannot fix permanently is the bottom edge.
</div>
<div>
<p>Once again I am asking for help from the Microsoft Community to get me out of this mess.&nbsp;Thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p><p>My browser is Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10.</p>

<p><em>computer and not enlarging them before closing out?&nbsp; I read that Internet Explorer remembers the screen size when closed out and that is how
</em></p>
<p><em>it stays until the adjustments are made after the fact.</em></p>
<p><em>--- --- --- --- --- --- ---</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Not sure why you had to reset the size on all those shortcuts, but, yes, windows Explorer remembers window size also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, if you or anyone else close an IE window that's not your preferred size, you will have to reset window size. I don't know how you stop techs from resizing windows. I'm not sure that I'd try to get them to not do his.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h3> randomwindowsinsider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 14291&#58; Windows Apps Not Loading After Splash Screen</h2>
                    <p>In Build 14291, none of the windows apps are loading after the splash screen. Not even the Store App, Not even Settings App, Not even Microsoft Edge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reboot of the PC temporarily fixes this, but after a couple of hours, they all go right back to hanging at the splash screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performed a clean reset of the operating system, but still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Store app does load fully (when I'm lucky), attempting to uninstall and re-install the apps that hang at the splash screen causes errors with unknown codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO Build 14291 is very unstable for this very issue.</p>

            <p>I resolved this problem. Apparently, in this build&nbsp;AND 14295 you need to have all Windows Apps installed in internal storage rather than an external one. I had most of them installed on MicroSD card, but for some reason there is a bug in the operating system
 that doesn't allow opening apps from the MicroSD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a manual re-install of the build and this time made sure not to install&nbsp;any apps on MicroSD card and everything was good after that.</p>

Hi Natashagunn,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has been an identified issue and as such Microsoft have a Knowledgebase article on the matter with a number of resolutions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The article is here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236/en-us</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However for anyone not wanting to follow the link:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
1. Reset the time
<p>To manually reset the clock on your Windows Phone 8:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>On <b>Start</b>, flick left to the <b>App</b> list, tap <b>Settings
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fLibrary%2fImages%2f2784254.png" /></div>
</b>, and then tap <b>D</b><b>ate+time</b>.</li><li>Tap to toggle <b>Set automatically</b> to <b>Off</b>.</li><li>Tap each of the options to set the current&nbsp;<b>Time zone</b>, <b>Date</b>, and
<b>Time</b>. When you're done, tap the phone's back button.<br />
<br />
<b>IMPORTANT </b>Double-check that the day, month, and year listed are all correct before you proceed.

</b>and then <b>E</b><b>mail+accounts</b>.</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
2. Connect to Wi-Fi
<p>If the previous steps didn't help, or if the date and time was set correctly, try connecting to Wi-Fi and signing in again:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>On <b>Start</b>, flick left to the <b>App</b> list, tap <b>Settings

</b>and then <b>Email+accounts</b>.</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
3. Reset your phone

            You should have added your Microsoft account while starting your phone up as you won't be getting the full features, you will have to perform a factory reset to restart your phone, unfortunately you will lose all your data and your can't do a backup as
 you haven't set up your Microsoft account.

<h2>            Help in MS Office 2010 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>when I ask for help in MS Office 2010 Pro, it is displayed as a HTML code, not as text- see the picture below. When I click on the line below "ComboBox", several options are displayed. When I use option "Show restricted content" and in the following dialog
 I allow opening the document <strong>MS.EXCEL.DEV.14.1029</strong>, then the required help-text is displayed. But this is very cumbersome. So, please, tell me what should I do to receive help directly as text. Described problem is both on my notebook with
 Windows 10 Prof, and on PC with Windows 7 Prof. Thank you for your advice.</p>

</p><p>I do not use Internet Explorer (I use Mozilla Firefox Browser) and I have not installed security updates 896358 and 890175. I can't understand why MS Office does not display its own help directly as text.</p>

<p>Hello Jan Pl√≠≈°ek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the components of your Excel app or the Office program might be corrupted. However, for us to identify the root cause, we will be performing some troubleshooting steps. That being said, we advise performing the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start Office in Safe Mode.
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting your Excel in Safe Mode will help us identify if there are add-ins that are causing the issue. In case the problem is not present in Safe Mode, we advise disabling all add-ins and enable each to know which is causing this concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair Office via Control Panel.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing so will fix any issues you are experiencing when using any of your Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we'd like to know more about this concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this concern?</li><li>Does the issue happen to other Office apps?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once completed, kindly provide us with the results for further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello friend,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have stated MS Windows in Safe Mode with Internet Connection an then I have tried to start some MS Office Application. I tried Excel, Word, Access, PowerPoint, but all experiments were unsuccessful. The configuration of MS Office Product were started and
 always ended with following message (translated from Czech version):</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;MS Office cannot verify the license for this application. Repair attempt failed or was canceled by the user. The application will now exit.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>A complete reinstall MS Office did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Discussed problem with displaying MS Office help is also on my PC with Windows 7!&nbsp;I am afraid if the problem was caused by some update of MS Office.<br />
</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Thank you for further advice how to solve my problem with MS Office 2010 help. I have tried following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start - Setting - Application - Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010</strong> and I saw following:<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently there is a difference between both version numbers and I can't explain it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have downloaded <strong>Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Office 2010 (KB2687455) 32-Bit Edition
</strong>and tried to install it. I saw following:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb5c581d-be6d-4e72-880c-66f272cbd95d?upload=true" /><br />

It is all I could do.</li></ul>

            The programs that I've tried to install where Windows Live and Microsoft Tag. I did manage to get it working by browsing to the app on the web and then using the Send to phone button. Windows Live changed names from Windows live for windows phone to just
 windows live on the phone. And then I could install it.<br />
I've reinstalled my ROM in an attempt to fix some other annoyances. Before reinstalling ROM I did experiment with the region settings. I prefer us-en region settings. But HTC insists that I should use sv-se by default. And I think the problems occur because
 either the re installation of ROM or the region settings being changed.<br />

<p>&nbsp;Hi Lydiaai,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POP account cannot be set up in Outlook 2016 via the auto setup (only username and password are require). Please refer to
<strong>Manually set up Internet email</strong> in this article to set up your POP account:</p>

<p><span>I notice that the account in Outlook is a Hotmail.com account. Can you set up Hotmail.com account in Outlook via POP mode?</span></p>
<p><span>Here‚Äôs the POP information of Hotmail account:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-Outlook-com-account-to-another-mail-app-73f3b178-0009-41ae-aab1-87b80fa94970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    I use outlook with the Cox email and randomly getting a pop-up window to re-enter my user name and password with occasional errors when trying to retrieve/sent out my email. After a few minutes, I get my mail / my mail is sent out. Cox support could not
 help me. My settings are as per their instructions, I can access and send emails via their Cox webmail. I also get occasional errors on my iPhone using the Cox email account, which is also being resolved automatically after a few minutes.&nbsp;

            Hello NatyUF 
<br />
<br />You can try clearing the stored credentials .
<br />
<br />Close Outlook desktop App
<br />In the Start menu, look for the Control Panel.
<br />Then select Credential Manager. Then Windows Credentials 
<br />Remove any  credentials related to  your COX email addresses under "generic credentials" opening the drop down menu and selecting "remove"
<br />
<br />Launch Outlook. You will be prompted to enter your credentials again
<br />
<br />
<br />hope it helps

<h2>            White Display Problem on stanby - on Nokia 2330 classic</h2>
                    
<p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've serched on google till page numeber 15 (!!) but no one had written something on my problem.</p>
<p>I have 2 nokia 2330 classic, 1 for my father and 1 for my mother (both taken with Vodafone points). They are new.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of them have the same strange problem. They work correctly, but when you leave the phone in a standby mode (so as it can be in your pocket during the day) the display became completely white (after a litlle bit of time). And it remain white till you
 push a button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can imagine that this is a problem for the battery, because when the screen is white the phone sucks a lot of charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing is that both of them had the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyone that has the same problem??</p>
<p>Is there anyone&nbsp; that is able to solve this problem??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 factory settings to see if the problem re-occurred. It has, so I will be taking it back to O2 at the next opportunity.</p>

<p>The problem is that the backlight starts when the phone is on stanby (as in your pocket).</p>
<p>My sister has the same problem too..</p>

            I changed the theme and it did not fix the problem. I also suspect there is a generic software problem with these phones. Does anyone from Nokia monitor this notice board and care to comment?

<p>I am affected by the same issue.</p>

<p>I am also annoyed that our local Nokia service center managed to provide polite answers with a reference that they do not have a faintest idea if the problem has been addressed by tech-support personell or not.</p>

<p>My&nbsp;2330 was returned to O2 for repair under warranty. It was returned as having the fault found and the software upgraded to fix the problem. No surprise 3 days later, I find the white screen again. So it's going back to O2 yet again.</p>

            As long as you don't/didn't save the document after deleting the section, you can close it without saving, and re-open. However, you will lose anything else done since opening the document.
<br />
<br />Depending on your computer, and if File History is on, you can also recover the document from a previous state of save.

            Not an answer about IE, but perhaps another approach to try.&nbsp; Many people control this type of thing via DNS.&nbsp; If your web browser can't look up the address, it can't visit the site.&nbsp; A good, free service for this is OpenDNS (<a href="http://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/</a>).&nbsp;
 Configure your router to use OpenDNS.&nbsp; If course, anyone using a computer on your LAN that is an administrator on that computer can certainly override that setting on his or her own PC, but it will give you general control.&nbsp; This is true for any "family safety"
 settings as well.&nbsp; If the account is "standard" or "limited", though, and the administrator account password-protected, however, this becomes a good tool.

    <title>MS Office asks for Product Key Everytime - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Office asks for Product Key Everytime</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought MS Office and activated it using the Product Key provided. Every time I reopen any of the applications in MS Office, it asks me for the Product Key. I don't understand the solution to it, so I always just closed the window. Now it is annoying to
 even close it as it involves a some time in loading all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to getting it resolved quickly. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>Now when its turned on its showing a smiley on a blue screen and then it turns off. My understanding from reading online is that the update did not install correctly. I NEED A FIX AND I NEED MY DATA!!!<br />
<br />
Soft reset makes no difference.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
So, suddenly my phone shows there's an update. I am ecstatic coz I have *always* has issues getting updates and here this time it was showing up on my phone as its supposed to.... I should have known better...<br />
<br />
I am beyond sick and tried of windows now. I am 10 year Nokia user and I am pretty sure this is my last Nokia and first and last windows phone. I was one of the earliest Lumia 920 users... And have had a horrible experience. For the first 6 months, it couldn't
 be unlocked to be used outside the US. And I was moving out.... So I carried a brick with me that whole time. Ever since then one or another thing had not been working... and every time I would look up for a fix, it turned out there was an update but some
 how my phone not only misses it but couldn't get it no matter what I do. Finally I was able to go to one of the rare Nokia centers in Brazil. The guys were nice enough to get the US version of the much delayed Lumia update for my phone. After that I was sure
 my problems were over and it worked pretty good.... And now this.... I am sick of not being able to rely on a device that is supposed to work pretty good. I am lost confidence now for good. I would appreciate if some how I can find a way to recover my data
 so I can leave this **bleep** phone behind. If not... then this is the last time windows phone is hurting me... I am determined not to give it another chance... I have had to wait, loose my data or work with a degraded device for far too long now.</blockquote>

<p>Provided you followed best practice&nbsp;and keep a backup of media files your data is safe on your Microsoft account and will sync back as soon as you set up your phone again using your account login. Contacts are at
<a href="http://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://people.live.com</a> and it may also be helpful to know which &nbsp;phone we're talking about here, it seems from your post it is a US model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Nokia Software&nbsp;<span>Recovery</span>&nbsp;<span>Tool</span>&nbsp;</strong>to recover your&nbsp;phone if you have software or software update problems. If your phone is&nbsp;not responding, it appears to be stuck or is not starting you can try&nbsp;to recover it at
 home before initiating a repair.</p>

<p>Yes its US model, sorry for not making it clear. I wasn't big on making backups, so no sure how much I'll be able to recover. I think contacts I did pretty often, but I refuse to put pictures on cloud or skydrive etc. That is all definitely gone. Update
 is on as I type this.... I think this is it for me and windows. I have always been the odd man out... I don't mind that, but not when reliability is worse than other... let alone this horrible.&nbsp;</p>

            Tried the Nokia Software Recovery Tool you posted. No difference!<br />
<br />
Before trying that someone had posted a link on another thread about Nokia Software Updater for Retail v 4.2.1.<br />
<br />
Its downloaded for an hour 1.3 GB but still nothing. On downloading your link it did not load for an hour another 1.3GB so I am assuming it tried to use the same data but again.... nothing... Familiar pattern!!!

<p>What phone model is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point whatever you have not had in backup or synced will be lost. Your phone will need to be re-flashed by a nokia care point or repair facility to be restored. Was the phone on a charger (and not a USB connection to a PC as that will likely not
 provide enough charge to keep the phone running if an update takes a while).</p>

<p>I understand the data is lost now... The phone was not on a charger but it was fully charged. It was only on the USB connection... That also charges the phone. But the problem is that during the entire time the Nokia software was downloading the data, the
 phone kept the cycle when you turn it on. It would vibrate, show Nokia on the screen, go to the sad smiley, then turn off after a while, and then vibrate and do it over again. When the 1.3ish GB download was complete it did restart showed a Nokia logo with
 installation progress on the screen. But once that was complete it would start doing the previous explain thing all over again.<br />
<br />
So I doubt&nbsp;the battery was an issue.</p>

<p>Ah, I thought Lumia 920 US version was what you were looking for... I don't see a Model # anywhere, but there is a&nbsp;Type RM-820... Hope this was what you were looking for... I am sure IMEI is not what you are asking for. The only other thing is a product
 code. Not sure if its as sensitive as an IMEI number but the product code is&nbsp;059L848</p>

No, the responses did not help me. I migrated to Outlook from Hotmail, and this is the only problem I have. It does not matter how I sort the mail, when it comes back I still end up with a high count off messages (e.g)111 and 4 pages, but actually only have
 45 readable messages. Unread messages may appear anywhere as well as newer ones at the top.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry have been unwell for a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I missed saying it before I am using Win8 which started as an update to Win7. Due to s a bunch of hardware problems, actually caused by my keyboard in the end, I did a full clean install. I had previously created an MS account and had all my subsidiary
 accounts linked back to a primary so that I had all accounts appear on one Hotmail Screen as individual folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Outlook was released, I migrated, without any problems, and without having to adjust my accounts. The accounts
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** just appeared in my main 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (a Hotmail alias?) window, My IP service provider acct 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** also came across as a separate folder no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, going a bit deeper, it would appear as if messages deleted go away for a while, then come back in the middle of the folder , so I may have a full page 1 of untouched messages, then a whole bunch on page 4, some of which may or not be read, plus messages
 I have flagged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While&nbsp; the 'inbox' has only 4 messages.</p>

<p>Please verify if you have your accounts synced through any mail client? If yes, you may have deleted these emails through your mail client or device. If your connection with your mail client or device is connected through POP3, these messages won't be deleted
 through the web and would just be deleted through your device/mail client. </p>

    <title>Multiple 640&#39;s bricked simultaneously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwmchugh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple 640&#39;s bricked simultaneously</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone had any problems with their Lumias constantly rebooting and becoming unresponsive? &nbsp;I have swapped batteries and sim cards, hard rest using the power and volume buttons and utilized the Microsoft Online Device Recovery Tool. &nbsp;Still, both phones
 constantly restart, lockup, crash, restart, lockup, crash......No MS support until tomorrow morning but I can't seem to find anyone with a thread that seems to be having similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it was my wife's phone on Friday. &nbsp;I figured that an app hung up or something straightforward. &nbsp;I have pulled the battery, rebooted, etc. &nbsp;Occasionally, I am able to use the phone for a couple minutes before it starts the crash cycle again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried my sim card (from a Samsung Note 3) and found the same actions. &nbsp;When my son came home, I started to swap pieces and parts between the phone assuming that since he hasn't mentioned anything to me about his phone, that it was functioning. &nbsp;Wrong,
 I guess. &nbsp;I did individual swaps of the sim card, then battery with the same results. &nbsp;This is where I discovered his phone is NG as well. &nbsp;The problems started roughly the same time as my wife's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My younger children have 435's which seem to be working fine.</p>

I'm using Microsoft's text-to-speech to read aloud some Word documents. Occasionally, however, the voice changes drastically, becomes hoarse, croaking, for at least one or two paragraphs. There are two variants: one in which it is rough and low and one in which
 it is rough and sharp. Then he returns to normal. Does anyone have any idea why? The voice that I use is Elsa (Italian female).</p>

<p>I haven't encountered that problem I can think of one possible cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that your computer is momentarily being overwhelmed with work. The CPU is "maxing" out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you turn on the "Task Manager" app (you can use the&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;Esc&gt; shortcut to start it) look at the right end of the Task Bar (at bottom of screen). A new icon for Task Manager will show there, a small graph box. The light blue bar raising from bottom
 indicates relative CPU use.&nbsp; Leave the Task Manager running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time you encounter this distortion, look at the icon in the task bar.&nbsp; If it is full with a light color bar, that means that the CPU is running at maximum capacity.&nbsp; The peak could be very brief.&nbsp;

            No, it is definitively not CPU related. It is systemic. It occurs every number of paragraphs. Not a fixed number of paragrsphs but mostly.

<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to pin down this sort of problem is tricky. All I can suggest is trying some systematic standard tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 restart the application (safe to assume you have already done this)</p>
<p>#2 restart the computer (again, I'll assume that you have already done this)</p>
<p>#3 Start Word in "Safe Mode"</p>
<p>#4 Start Windows in "Safe Mode"</p>
<p>#5 Uninstall Office from the control panel</p>
<p>#6 Uninstall Office using the "Script"</p>
<p>#7 Re-install Windows, then all other applications (I really like to avoid doing this when ever possible)</p>

<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These ‚Äúcarry-overs‚Äù may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>

            The problem is not CPU related, but has more to do with the reading software starting and stopping at paragraph breaks, screwing up the computer's audio software. The voice not only get hoarse from time to time as it moves on to the next paragraph, but
 may also get hung up for a few seconds. I've found that both problems can be eliminated by playing another audio source at the same time. A white-noise rain patter from Youtube completely fixed it, presumably because it keeps the audio software running.

            Restarting, reinstalling, starting in safe modes and similar ‚Äútry and hope‚Äù approaches are not troubleshooting. I posted this question hoping that there is somebody who KNOWS why that happens, not to get the ‚Äúbusiness as usual answer to any problem‚Äù. I
 worked for 30 years as a programmer and my experience is that those kind of actions do not solve real problems base on bad development or side effects among different pieces of software. So, if anyone who knows THAT piece of software has some idea, I will
 appreciate his/her support, but please avoid trivial suggestions.

            Interesting, but it occurs several times during reading. I cannot start a sound every time it occurs, even because the fastest workaround is to stop reading, move the cursor to a previous word, and start again. I am not looking for a workaround, but for
 a fix.

<p>I think the point that Turnbuckle was making is for you to be proactive.&nbsp; Find a "background sound" that you can play all the time when you are using Text to Voice. Turn the volume low.&nbsp; Then when you use Text to Voice the audio system is engaged and hopefully

</p><p class="contentHeader2">PS: Dario, I see one of the moderators marked the "Answer".&nbsp; If the suggestion does not work for you, feel free to "unmark" it. Click on the "..." "icon" at the bottom of the reply.&nbsp; A question with a marked "Answer" is considered
 finished/fixed by most of the trouble shooters on the forum. Ideally the original poster would do the marking. When a moderator jumps the gun and marks a "reasonable" reply as answer, you the original poster, have the right to unmark it to let the world know
 the problem still is not fixed for you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be looking for an "expert" on your feature, but there are very few, if any (inside and outside of MS).&nbsp; The feature you are talking about is relatively little used, so few people are familiar with it.&nbsp; The techniques I suggested are not "try and
 hope", they are "try and identify" potential causes. When you don't have anything else, like specific problem shooting documentation from MS (which is more rare than hen's teeth, you have to fall back on generic techniques. These are actually the generic techniques
 that MS suggests in it's documentation. </p>

            That answer was not related to your workaround but to the answer of Rohn007 who is not an user, to my understanding. Your answer was interesting but it is a workaround and I already found a couple of them. What I am looking for is a fix.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Question :</strong><em> is there a way to reveal my password on Skype without changing it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer :</strong>&nbsp;Skype's passwords are encrypted for privacy and security purposes. In line with that, it is not possible to show your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to forgot your account's password, you may reset it by following the steps on this FAQ:

<p><span>Hi Josh,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you using Outlook for Windows? The slow performance issue in Outlook can be caused by multiple reasons. Please try the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.To identify if the issue is related to Add-ins, please start Outlook in safe mode to see if the issue persists. (Click<span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Run</span></strong>&gt; type<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span>outlook.exe
 /safe</span></strong><span>&gt; click<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.)</span></p>
<p><span>If it works, try disabling add-ins to see if it works:</span></p>
<p><span>Click <strong>File</strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong>&gt; <strong>Add-ins</strong>&gt; Select ‚ÄúCOM Add-ins‚Äù in the Manage drop-down&gt; click
<strong>Go</strong>&gt; Uncheck any add-ins that you are not using&gt; click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.Make sure you don‚Äôt have any third-party add-ins/ antivirus applications installed that may cause the issue.</span></p>
