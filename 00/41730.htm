<p>Delete is found when editing the entry. You can remove the speed dial/access number entry by selecting the Skype to Go number, clicking Edit, then Delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to change your primary Skype to Go number, you would have to update your Nearest location. This will allow the number to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to remove/delete the primary Skype to Go number, you would disable Skype to Go. While this will not delete the displayed number, it will render it useless.</p>

    <title>Problem with Full Restore using File History on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saintsusannaparish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Full Restore using File History on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a PC on Windows 10.&nbsp; For a number of months it was using Windows 10 File History to backup files to an external drive (Western Digital 2GB).&nbsp; The external drive was in the same office and "behind" the same router.&nbsp; The backups worked fine.&nbsp; Occasionally
 I had a need to restore a prior version of a file, and that worked fine as well.
</p>
<p>Sadly, the system failed and would no longer boot.&nbsp; I bought a new PC to replace it.&nbsp; The PC name, Workgroup, User Name were created all the same as they were on the prior Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; After installing all system updates, I attempted to restore all user
 files that were previously backed up to the external drive.&nbsp; The restore did not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I viewed the contents of the drive through the Windows File Manager / Network connection, I could see all the files the for the user.&nbsp; The file names were all appended with date and time.&nbsp; For files that were frequently edited, the files had multiple
 versions, so the file names were almost duplicated, except for date / time at the end of the file name.</p>
<p>I called Microsoft and created a case number (136-724-8066) for the incident.</p>
<p>Microsoft suggested that I connect the drive locally, rather than through a network attachment.&nbsp; Again, I could not to a complete system backup.&nbsp;
</p>
The Microsoft support rep could see the backed-up files with the date / time stamp through File Manager as well, but couldn't manage a restore.&nbsp; After a few attempts the Microsoft rep said "Microsoft supports the backup, but not the restore".&nbsp; I have a hard
 time accepting that.
<p>Over a few days I was able to remove the drive from the damaged PC and attach it as a secondary drive on my home PC.&nbsp; I was able to use a lot of thumb drives and get the files over to the new office PC a few days later.&nbsp; This was very inconvenient for everyone.</p>
<p>Question: Does Microsoft truly NOT support a restore to a new PC to recover from a system failure?&nbsp; What is the point of Backup (File History) if there is no Restore?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When another Microsoft rep called a few days later for a satisfaction survey, they suggested I post my concern here, and reference the case number (136-724-8066).&nbsp; Please tell me how I can manage a full system restore with Microsoft Windows 10.&nbsp; Thanks for
 your attention.</p>

            <p>Here is a crazy thought...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if you copied the&nbsp;configuration data from your external drive from the "X:\File History\USER_NAME\PC_NAME\Configuration" folder&nbsp;to the "C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration" folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>That might force the newly reloaded PC to recognize the previous history content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you... this is pure speculation.... but it probably wouldn't hurt, just to see if it worked?</p>

<p>Yeah, File History wasn't designed to fulfill the same role as a "backup"...&nbsp; so there is no "bulk restore" feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: I use Acronis to make regular backups of my systems.&nbsp; Check 'em out... the product is great at a very reasonable price.</p>

    <title>Mouse automatically scrolling in Windows 10 &#40;only in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonconyers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse automatically scrolling in Windows 10 &#40;only in Windows windows rather than any applications&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 on my desktop on Wednesday and have come back to use it today to find that it has developed a problem with my mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any Windows window, when I move the mouse pointer to that window it automatically scrolls down without my touching the mouse wheel. This only happens in the actual Windows windows such as settings, the start menu and the live tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not happen with Edge or any non Windows software as the scroll wheel works correctly. It generally works fine with Chrome and does not keep scrolling down web pages but it does have an issue with drop down menus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think it is a problem with the mouse itself as the mouse works fine with my laptop and initially worked fine with Windows 10. I have also tried using an alternative mouse but that has the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not an issue with scrolling inactive windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unplugging/replugging in, restarting, reinstalling the generic mouse drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone or should I just go back to trusty old Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>I had/have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>- Problem only persists in window's programs (e.g. start menu, window's explorer, setting, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line of what I was doing something worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st Method) Clean out the mount.&nbsp; I lifted up the buttons and push air through it and softly brushed excess out</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Method) Restart Computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd Method) in device&nbsp;settings I right clicked on my mouse and clicked "Troubleshoot" in the drop-down menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>4th Method) I unplugged my Bluetooth&nbsp;mouse receiver and waited a bit.&nbsp; After about a minute, I plugged it back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works now... I wish I had an absolute answer, but I sadly don't.&nbsp; It seems to be a window's bug or outdated mouse software... but then again I am more apt to blame windows than the mouse because it only has the problem with Window's Programs.</p>

    <title>Windows Hello - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gsedlik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I'm having another problem with this sync of my Microsoft account. Every time I log in after the computer has been sleeping or restart it, the following sequence of events takes place:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I get a notification saying "Microsoft Account Problem.....We need to fix your Microsoft account (most likely your password changed). Select here to fix it in Shared experiences settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I click it and it brings me to Shared experiences in settings and a window pops up which says "Hello-enable your Microsoft account. You need to use Windows hello or enter your PIN to finish adding gsedlik."</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I click ok and the window loads to something which says the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Add your Microsoft Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to verify the password for your Microsoft account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then underneath that is a space to enter my username but it's already there with a message written underneath in red, which states "That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note I haven't entered in my account yet and I'm already getting a message which says that my account doesn't exist. So I just click next at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) It loads to a new screen which says this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please reenter your password</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you're accessing sensitive info, you need to verify your password for gsedlik"</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I enter my password and it loads for a few seconds before saying the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Oops, something went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That service isn't available right now--please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I click on Next and the following message pops up:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry, but something went wrong registering gsedlik for Windows Hello. Your account has been added to Windows, but next time you use the account we'll ask you to verify your account using Windows Hello or your PIN."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once again, this issue isn't the biggest deal in the world. I can still use my computer just fine and can use my Microsoft account and everything else with no problems. It is just an annoyance that doesn't make sense to me and I would like to see
 resolved. I also did some research and found out that my computer can't use Windows Hello, so why is it constantly asking me to set it up? Is there a way to please get this to stop? Please help me as soon as possible. Thanks again!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi LarryMink, <br />
<br />
The fact that this is happening on two computers makes me think this might be a hardware issue. The camera itself might be defective. However, I would like check in Skype to see if there is anything that can be done to resolve this.
<br />
<br />
In Skype, please follow the these instructions I found.&nbsp; <br />
Go to Tools, then Options, and click on Audio Settings and set the Microphone and Speakers to the computer Audio Card.
<br />
Then click on the Video Settings. <br />
The camera, if Installed Properly, it will come up and show a video picture. <br />
Then, on the bottom of the page click save. <br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Difference between 500GB and 1TB consoles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drummerj99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difference between 500GB and 1TB consoles</h2>
                    
<p>Was wondering aside form the hard drive space and games included, is there any difference between the 500GB and 1TB consoles? Plan on picking up a Xbox One this weekend at Best Buy but still kinda undecided on either the GOW 500GB bundle ($349) or the Tomb
 Raider 1tb bundle ($399). Is the only difference between the two the hard drive? Which would you recommend?</p>

<p>I would agree with a 500gb and put the saved money towards a decent sized external, &nbsp;the 1tb will fill up quickly any some time down the line you will probably be looking at external anyway. &nbsp; Took me less than a year before space was an issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>About 500GB is the difference.. sorry couldn't help myself.</p>
<p>Go for the 1TB, the bigger the better. Plus you wouldn't have to remove games to add games so often. 500GB does fill up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>If the 500MB is cheaper get that.</p>
<p>Whether it be 500MB or 1TB you are not going to have enough space if you plan to have a few games.</p>
<p>Of the 500MB available to you a full 360 is set aside for OS updates and internal console stuff and that's going to be the same for the 1TB as well.</p>
<p>You will need an External HD. &nbsp;So why spend more on a 1TB console and an external HD if it's cheaper to get a 500mb and an external HD.</p>
<p>If they're the same then 1TB. &nbsp;No brainer.</p>

    <title>Folder icons in windows 7 windows explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tetonguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder icons in windows 7 windows explorer</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I noticed all of the folders under "My Pictures" have a small gold padlock attached to the folder icons and I can't figure out what it means. I can copy, move or delete these foldes so what does the padlock signify?</p>
<p>Also, when viewing some - not all - pictures with icon view selected there is a green square with a white check mark in it attached to the bottom left of the thumbnails. I can't figure this one out either.</p>

<p>This means the files are not shared over any network; no one can access your pictures.</p>
<p>You can change this by right-clicking any picture (or folder) and choosing "Share With: &nbsp;Nobody" (or somebody).</p>

            Thanks, but I tried that and the icon is still there. I can access these files from another computer on my network - I didn't try that before though. Also, all of the other folders on that drive don not have the padlock icon, and I have never changed the
 properties of the "My Pictures" folder - it just happened. Guess it's just a one more MS

<p>Did you perhaps move your My Pictures folder to a different drive/location and/or given rights to other users (thus making it non-private)?</p>

            <p>I know this is an old thread, but I have been dealing with this same issue with someone recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple padlock icons, and I think the one that tetonguy is talking about has nothing to do with sharing, just that the folder has restricted access...try amending the security to say that everyone has full control of the folder and the icon will
 disappear (i wouldnt recommend leaving it this way though!), try removing the permissions for the everyone group and the icon reappears...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i then set to share the same folder under homegroup with read or read/write access the padlock disappears, but what has happened is the&nbsp;HomeUsers group has been given access to the folder, if i remove the permissions for this group on the security tab,
 the &nbsp;folder padlock icon reappears</p>

            Sharing and Security Permissions are basically the same thing. &nbsp;If a folder has more restrictive permissions that its parent folder, and it's either shared or in an already-shared hirearchy, meaning it's "less shared" than the parent, it will have a padlock
 icon indicating that it's private. &nbsp;Every folder that's private won't have a padlock, (subfolders of the private folder, even though they are also private, won't show padlocks, because then the screen would be full of lock icons).

Try saving the photos to a folder on your hard drive and see <br />

<p>Good to see progress ðŸ‘. Hope the following problems are addressed soon:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Contacts renaming, for Skype contacts but especially phone numbers! The inability to associate a cryptic phone number to a name makes adding new phone numbers very unusable now; I shouldn't have to use the Windows / oldQtLinux client to rename a phone number
 ðŸ™!<br />
</li><li>Please synchronize between clients only the settings that make sense to synchronize. Especially, notification/sound settings shouldn't be synchronized: at work I want no notifications, at home I do.</li><li>The "Sound" setting shouldn't depend on the "Notifications" setting, and disabling notifications shouldn't prevent me from answering calls (currently, disabling notifications means the special call-answering notification with buttons won't appear, preventing
 call answering ðŸ˜•). </li><li>Screen sharing.</li><li>Keep/search conversation history for more than 30 days.</li><li>[5.4.0 regression] Fix numeric keypad / dialpad&nbsp;broken during calls, making it impossible to select options in business/governments answering machines ðŸ˜•
<p>
</p></li></ol>

<p>Thank you for the notification. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed 5.4.0.1, however there was little change. It did initiate a call much faster, which was a pleasent surprise. Voip is still not functional, and most of the requests found in this discussion have yet to be addressed. For incoming calls voip, I
 need to use Skype for Android. For outgoing voip calls I am still using Skype for Linux 4.3, since 5.3 and 5.4 are still unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype-to-Skype video calls appear to work, although the quality leaves a bit to be desired (when compared to what we had). It is useable, however. Skype-to-Skype voice calls are quite good.</p>

<p>For my Ubuntu box (nothing very special) there are significant issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call my cell from Skype 5.3/5.4 appears to work.</li><li>Call my cell Skype from Skype 5.3/5.4 has a 50% success rate.</li><li>Call any conference call (ATT connect, Skype etc.) it always connects with no audio nor dialpad function.</li><li>Call other VOIP line (business line/government) has a 50% success rate.</li><li>Incoming calls have no notification.</li><li>Voice message waiting has no notification.</li></ol>
<p>If I am only calling private numbers to a landline, or even a LTE/GSM mobile device, then it probably wouldn't be an issue. But I use the conference call numbers a heck of a lot. Lack of incoming notification means I need to rely on my cell for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype 4.3 was connected audio through Pulse. Skype 5.3/5.4, I cannot tell where it wants to connect audio to.</p>

<p>Hi Jonas, </p>
<p>
</p><p>very relieved to see that Microsoft are still working on Linux Skype, Skype responded to the normal Ubuntu update process so have tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, still a very very long way to go, still far far far too early to restrict v 4.3 in any way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great to see Screen Share on the + menu for the call, but not on the menu from clicking there, any indication as to when screen share is included please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings menu is still pretty bare to put it mildly (about 80% down on v4.3, which was quite restricted compared to other desktop Skype versions), still deal breaker options missing such as auto answer, screen share, Skype call volume control, separate
 window for chats so can chat without intruding into the call window, and chat to other accounts spring immediately to mind. &nbsp;With this version the video call seems to sometimes disappear when chatting, which is a massive pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great to see this tiny step, but surely the missing 80% of features should have been included in the new Skype, as the Linux community so repeatedly requested, before any suggestion of restricting stable Skype for Linux 4.3's service, so that moving from
 stable 4.3 to the new Linux Skype offered seamless service in terms of functionality, my thread to that effect has the most people sharing the issue on the Linux forum. &nbsp;Perhaps as this user interface is not getting much support, would it be worth rewriting
 the back end of v4.3 so that we can have the same functionality yet still work with the new cloud structure? &nbsp;That would solve many poster's issues I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that the "bug fixes and improvements" means restoring the connectivity of Skype 4.3 to v 5.4? &nbsp;As main contacts for poor signal are away in areas of even weaker connection, cannot explore for a few weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One bug not fixed is the status indicator, always showing green online for mobile phone contact even when she had been flying for 9 hours so long offline, v4.3 has kept up with the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be far far better to put the sound &amp; video settings with the other settings in preference to within the running call settings, so they are far easier to find, do not mean that you are fiddling with the settings during a call in preference to responding
 to the call (sure this will absolutely NOT go down well in some calls!), and apply to all calls</p>
        </p>

<p>It seems that the numeric keypad which was require during call to business, government etc with automatic switch board (call to landlines) is not functioning anymore during a call. Meaning that you can't select any options as no tone is generated even if
 the number press appears (most of the time). It does work for dialing numbers to call.
</p>
<p>Confirm it was working in the previous 5.3 version (other Linux computer).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for enabling group video call feature. That is a big step forward. Possible improvements:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Set grid mode to default in group video call.</li><li>Make it possible to initiate screen sharing when in group video call.</li><li>Add search functionality and keep conversation history for more than 30 days.</li><li>Synchronize notifications between mobile and desktop version (i.e. it has no sense to get notifications on mobile device (Android) if desktop is connected).</li></ul>

    <title>Swapping gamertags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redstonary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Swapping gamertags</h2>
                    <p>So my friend gave me this extremely rare 2 letter tag that I want to put on my main account, however it has messages on the account from people threating to take the tag as soon as it is chnaged. They do this using a program called a 'turbo' which is a script set up on the Xbox website where a silver account repeatedly tries to claim a gamertag thousands of times a second. So as soon as I change my tag to put it in my main account it will get taken. Is there anything i can do?</p>

            <p>Gamer tags are tied to accounts and can only be changed when you go through the process to change the gamer tag. No one can give you a gamer tag to assign to another account.</p><p>So, neither you or as you stated, "people threating to take the tag as soon as it is chnaged" can take that gamer tag.&nbsp;</p><p>The gamer tag won't be made available right away if you change the gamer tag on that original account.<br /></p>

<br />
<br />Additional troubleshooting steps:
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

    <title>Edge corrupted possibly by a trojan, settings menu does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the danno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge corrupted possibly by a trojan, settings menu does not work properly</h2>
                    <p>Edge was behaving poorly and would cause the entire screen to "blink" black.&nbsp; Defender found and removed a Trojan.&nbsp; When I run Edge again it appears that the&nbsp;Trojan comes back and I need to have&nbsp;Defender remove it again.&nbsp; I am afraid to run Edge anymore
 until I get it cleaned up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides the above, Edge is now corrupted and the settings menu does not work properly.&nbsp; I cannot clear the cache or look at extensions, when I click on these options I get different functions as if the settings menus have been hijacked.&nbsp; I tried sfc /scannow
 but no problems were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to uninstall and then reinstall Edge or some way to completely reset it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Defender run a scan offline function won't work, nothing happens when I click on it.&nbsp; I thought that might be helpful to run.&nbsp; I have not tried the malicious software removal tool but that is my next step I guess.&nbsp; Not sure that will fix Edge but it
 will hopefully make sure nothing else is lurking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue, we suggest that you check for corrupted Windows system files. System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files
 from a cached version thatâ€™s on your PC. If SFC canâ€™t replace the files, the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.<br />
<br />
To run System File Checker (SFC), follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note the space between sfc and the /). Scanning will take a few minutes.</li><li>Do one of the following, depending on the results of the scan:
<ul>
<li>If SFC finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.</li><li>If SFC doesnâ€™t find corrupted files or finds corrupted files but canâ€™t replace them, try using the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM).<br />
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more info about System File Checker, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a>.<br />
<br />
To use the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM), follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> (note the space between dism.exe and / and each switch (/)).</li><li>If DISM finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to be connected to the Internet to use DISM, and it might take several minutes to finish.<br />

<h2>            Neverwinter Nights&#58; Diamond edition and Dungeon Siege&#58; Legends of Aranna are not compatible with Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a couple of programs which windows 7 is automatically blocking due to known compatibility issues.<br />
namely:<br />
Neverwinter Nights diamond edition(original, not nwn2)<br />
Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna<br />
<br />
In searching for fixes, I have found numerous people say that these programs run fine in XP sp3 compatibility mode.&nbsp; However, even after setting them to run in compatibility mode, i still get the message, and of course they will not start.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to know what these compatibility issues are, and if there is a way to get around this error.&nbsp; Up until now I have been highly impressed with the superiority of windows 7 to all previous versions of windows, however not being able to use programs
 with known fixes just because Microsoft isn't aware of them is... annoying.<br />

            <p>A program (or piece of hardware) not working in Windows 7 is not the fault of Windows 7 - but of the software/hardware in question.&nbsp; It was likely made with a limited lifespan in mind - or with specific needs that a given operating system would provide.</p>
<p>When you *installed* the games (not really applications in the classic sense - and usually they have more built-in limitations because of 'special needs' than other such objects) did you run the install in the compatibility mode (right-click on the setup
 file and choose to run it as Windows XP SP3) as well as then changing the shortcut to start the game so it ran in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3) as well?</p>

<p>Looking through the above - it looks like you need to patch this game several times (how this is done, etc - not a problem to be looked at here) to v1.69?&nbsp;

<p>I'll let you look through the posts for the other legacy game, although that may be a lost cause when

the software publisher stated this product is not compatible with Windows 7</a>.</p>
