    <title>Windows 10 1607 Upgrade issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brac55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1607 Upgrade issue</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Like many others I too am running in to problems with the anniversary upgrade. Firstly, I'm on a limited monthly internet plan. So, a 3 plus GB update consumes roughly a third&nbsp;of my data allowance. On the first upgrade attempt,
 the download went as far as 96 % before windows update deciding it wasn’t happy with my restrictive data cap and so goes about re-downloading the whole thing from scratch (despite me backing up the update files), thankfully to completion only for it hang-up
 at 32% installation, saying there was an error. Luckily, I had the <strong>Install.esd</strong> file backed up. So, I made a bootable ISO out of it using the
<strong>esd decrypter </strong>and <strong>Windows 7 USB DVD Download Tool </strong>
as advised by you folks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Upon booting from the USB however, the installation stops midway with a cryptic message saying”<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<em>The computer started using the windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that Windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade. [Do not select | Custom [advanced]| to perform
 an upgrade</em></span> “. It simply boots into my existing installation (version 1511, Home) even after following the retarded message that asks you to remove the media even when the installation files aren’t transferred to the hard drive, and nor does it
 give you a prompt to continue with the installation upon restarting normally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">So, I tried running the setup from within the OS only to hit ‘Product key’ block. This time there was no option to skip entering the key unlike at boot-up. Anyway after a few failed attempts I decided to do a clean install from
 the USB (which was a success) only to find out that windows can’t be activated because the installed version was Windows Pro. I have no idea why Pro was installed when I clearly wasn’t given an option to choose the installation version.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As it stands, I’m now back on version 1511 from a recent system image backup. I would like to know how I can proceed from here without having to download the mega update again (a third time – which I have no intention of doing).
 I still have the Install.esd and the corresponding ISO. I wonder if the <strong>
media creation tool</strong> can help salvage the situation, i.e. make use of the
<strong>install.esd</strong> file.</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify">Your developers need a pat on the back for some of their unrivalled coding &amp; decision making skills. Technology is meant to make mundane tasks and life in general relatively easier and not leave you fuming for no fault of yours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Any help is appreciated. </p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1511 version is very much activated as you can see in the the screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the CMD thing, it returns an error:</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;Licensingdiag.exe -report %userprofile%\desktop\report.txt -log %userprofile%\desktop\repfiles.cab<br />
Error processing arguments.<br />
Error Code 0x80070057<br />
Usage: LicensingDiag -cab &lt;CAB file path name&gt; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Edit: Here's a screenshot of the Product key step</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3604f1a0-91b8-451c-b609-07e707090198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3604f1a0-91b8-451c-b609-07e707090198" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your CMD command refuses to work. So, I just ran the command with only the first bit 'Licensingdiag.exe -report' which gave me a CAB file with two folders in it. Hope the following text is what you are looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can I get an update on this please.</p>

            <p>How come there are no more replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least can someone in the know confirm if I can use the media creation tool to recreate the ISO from the backed up Install.esd file (in case the current ISO has gone corrupt or something).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it would be helpful if I could get the correct procedure for 'upgrade installation' from USB. I've previously installed from the USB without any issues and never had this warning about removing the media as mentioned in the OP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I expect there will be no more replies to this thread. So, feel free to close this thread. As always, one needs to rely on third party forums for windows related support. Here you only find those who copy-paste prepared responses which don"t seem to

            <p style="text-align: justify">Only just noticed now. The ISO file created from the ESD says it's Windows 10 Pro (en_windows_10_<strong>pro</strong>_14393_x64_dvd). Never paid attention to the file name until now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Could that be the reason why the pro version was installed when I tried a clean install and also why it asks for a product key when I run the set up from within the installation (may be it thinks I'm upgrading from Home to Pro
 without a Pro licence).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Another example of MS goofing up the upgrade process by downloading the wrong version via windows update, unless of course the Pro version can also be used to install the Home edition, in which case it's still an error on your
 part.<br />

            <p>Thats definitely the reason why, you need to download and install Windows 10 Home 14393. You can use the Media Creation Tool to upgrade instead:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">Thanks again for the reply.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I have a few questions I would like answered before I proceed with the media creation tool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">1) Is there no way to I could make use of the already downloaded ESD/ISO. I could most certainly do without having to download a third time. And, who's to know the MCT won't download the Pro version again. If it can happen once,
 it can happen again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">2) Does the Media creation tool support 'download resume' (like windows update) because there's no way I can complete the download at one go. It can only happen over a few days with my download cap. Also, can I do an upgrade/clean
 install either at boot-up or from within the OS and not be bothered by the 'Product key' requirement like I'm faced with now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">3) In case of an interrupted download, will replacing the concerned files from the backed up download folder with Btxxxx.tmp file help resume the download from where it left off. Or, am I simply making a fool of myself by doing
 a backup of the download after each session. The last time I tried resuming after a download interrupt, it never worked. But I do remember it working once before with the 10240 version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">It's hard to believe you still give us no control (like a pause and resume option in the UI) over how and when the download happens for such large updates. As of now, the only way you can stop the download is by either stopping
 the Update Service or disconnecting from the internet which may be the reason for interrupted downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If such an option is not possible, those of us on limited bandwidth would really appreciate if you could release smaller sized updates containing only the changes (like the regular updates) than the whole thing, which most likely
 has 80% of the files in common with the existing installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You (decision makers) just can't ignore the fact that not every one in the world has seamless /unlimited internet connectivity to splurge on.</p>

</p><p>You have to alter the details of the file&nbsp;so Xbox Live will recognize it as a game. Easiest way to do this is make a clip of the game, and download it through the Xbox App. Then right click, go to properties, then open the details tab. Make sure to copy over&nbsp;the title (which will be the game), the tags (which somehow tie in with the game), and contributing artists (which will always be Microsoft Game DVR). The last thing you need to do is add a media creation date, which you can do by clicking the calendar on that line (it will default to whatever the date/time is when you do this, just use that). Once you have all that stuff copied, click "apply", and now Xbox Live will recognize it as a game.<br />
</p>
<p>It's dumb that you need to do this because they advertise that you can just edit clips on the PC and upload to Xbox Live. Technically true, but you have to do this step or it won't work.</p>

<h2>            Windows not installing in new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I was trying to install Windows Premium Home addition from original DVD in my brand new dell 17R 5737 laptop here are the model specs :
<a href="http://www.spectell.com/dell-inspiron-17r-5737/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Spectell.com/dell-inspiron-17r-5737/</a></p>
<p>But getting the strange error message when I start the setup "window boot manager has been blocked by the current security policy".</p>
<p>I reset the Bios, reboot the system, try several other setting in Bios but no success so far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll be thankful to the community if anyone give me some solution ( before going to the technician ;) )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log' &gt; Ensure 'Automatically
 restart' is un-checked. <br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick

&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log' &gt; Ensure 'Automatically
 restart' is un-checked. <br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

Yes, if Skydrive is giving you trouble, you can use any other hosting site such as Mediafire, etc. Anything that's of convenience to you.<br />

<br />
The latest DMP file is of the <b>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. </i><br />
<br />
Usual causes are a bug in a device driver, hardware related memory issues, corrupt NTFS volume, anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
<i><b>awechomd.sys - Mon Feb 19 05:35:10 <u>2007</u></b></i><br />
<br />
^^ Symantec pcAnywhere Video Miniport Driver. Definite possible culprit. I'd recommend removing this software ASAP for troubleshooting purposes.<br />
<br />
If removing the Symantec software doesn't stop the crashes, please enable Driver Verifier to see if we're dealing with any other possible driver conflicts:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            <p>I thank you for your response, and also thank Microsoft for years, decades, worth of trouble free Windows.&nbsp; However, I'm done with dedicating hours and hours and hours and hours worth of time, day after day after day after day,&nbsp;trying to "navigate" Windows
 10.&nbsp; I still have the option to "uninstall", but am so put off by the whole thing, that for the first time in my life, I'm going Apple, I'm simply going to "uninstall" Microsoft.&nbsp; Whomever the genius behind Windows 10 is, I wish that person all the best, but
 that person is really not "the best" as far as many are concerned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a lot of good decades, Microsoft, it's been real, and it's been nice, but here lately, it hasn't been real nice.</p>

            Go to APK site, APKMirror <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apkmirror.com/</a>, and downloaded and installed and voila! the problem was fixed. It installed Skype for Android 8.25.0.5, which actually I prefer to the previous version I had.
<br />
<br />Don't know if this would be an approved solution for Microsoft, (I did do malware/virus scans on the file and the site appears to be reputable), but it worked for me.
<br />
<br />Thought you might want to know, it could be an option for people like me, since their device is not rooted, who can only disable but not uninstall and reinstall Skype for Android.
<br />
<br />Actually, this is effectively a reinstall in all but name, but for it to work, you do have to enable "unknown sources" in the security options on Android.

 one is causing the problem? Or are all of them failing? Is there any functionality issue if I don't have these updates? Thanks

<br />
<br />Step1
<br />Open a connection between your computer and the Internet. Place the cursor on the menu items in the upper left-hand corner of your home page. Click the \"Favorites\" column. Scroll down and click the line reading \"Organize.\"
<br />
<br />Step2
<br />Sort your favorites/bookmarks into different folders with title headings. Organize every bookmark into a specific subject folder.
<br />
<br />Step3
<br />Click on \"Import/Export\" under the \"File\" column on the upper left-hand menu on your home page. A box will open with the heading \"Import/Export Wizard.\" Click \"Next\" at the bottom right of the box.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step4
<br />Look at the list of options given in the \"Import/Export Wizard\" box. Check the \"Favorites\" box on the list of options and, again, click \"Next\" in the bottom right. Choose to \"Export\" these favorites and click \"Next\" on the bottom right of the box. Choose the option \"Export to a File or Address\" and type c:\bookmark.htm as the file name. Click \"Finish.\"
<br />
<br />Step5
<br />Close the Internet window. Double-click \"My Computer\" and, then, drive C. Find the bookmark.htm file and double click to open. Select the \"Print\" option under the \"File\" column on the upper left-hand menu.

<h2>            Alt-Print Screen Image Copy into Paint Not Working</h2>
                    I have a Vista (64bit) notebook with a USB&nbsp;keyboard and mouse and when I do ALT-Print Screen my screen does not seem to be copied to the clipboard. When I do CTRL-V in Paint nothing happens. When I select Edit in Paint the paste option is grayed out. Does
 anyone know why this is?

<h2>            Setting and changing hard drive order for Win7. Need background and issues to avoid</h2>
                    I have had to swap a lot of connectors and assign letters as part of curing issues with my recent build. I write because I wonder if Windows stumbles over hard drive number issues and changed letter assignments. I believe I can see delayed boot after re-arranging
 SATA connectors...&nbsp; My goal is best use of I/O and installed-disk options on this production machine.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Recent build: <br />
Intel DH77KC mobo with i7-3770 Ivy bridge processor<br />
ATI V4900 FirePro GPU<br />
16Gig 1600-speed Crucial RAM<br />
<br />
The Intel mobo was a bad choice, I think. I saved a little cash but didn't notice (my bad) how few SATA connectors there were. I bought a controller card for one of the few remaining PCIe slots (just a 1x and a 4x after GPU). That controller broke the boot,
 which was already a bit flaky, but luckily a BIOS update today may have made this better: no blinking cursor for 35 seconds, and the SATA board doesn't stop the boot. I don't like that one SATA connector is shared with the 4x slot. That seems weird and I wish
 I had bought "more" mobo". (I know I would never see a Marvell controller on an Intel board to get more SATA...)
<br />
<br />
So as part of the diagnostics and tuning I moved a lot of SATA connections. There are two drives now seen that were not "there" before. Letters have moved around, and the Samsung 830 SSD boot drive is not "harddrive0". I know how to re-assign letters and did
 that (Computer Management) this afternoon so paths work as they had before. I know where the hard drive order for boot files is arranged in the BIOS. Will do that next.
<br />
<br />
Does the "harddrive#" matter? <br />
If I change SATA connectors what is the best way to re-educate Windows about data and boot location? (I will keep the boot SSD on the SATA-III so will probably NOT ever change that.) There is no RAID internal array/install.<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts or advice?<br />

            <p>Drive numbers are usually defined by the SATA port the drive is connected to and is generally not important.&nbsp; The Windows 7 partition will always be assigned drive letter C:</p>
<p>The System, Reserved partition is not assigned a drive letter and therefore only viable in Disk Management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data partition drive letters&nbsp;should be set to what they were before you rearanged the cables. One method of keeping track of the&nbsp;original drive letter for any partition that is assigned a drive letter&nbsp;by you is to create a "Volumn name" that includes the
 drive letter as part of the name (Example: Data-F) with F being the drive letter you assigned it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can move cables around till your satisfied and then reassign the drive letters so that for example&nbsp;the data partition which may be currently be drive letter E: but the volumn name (Data-F) tell you it was originally the F: drive.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you better with this concern, could you answer these questions for us:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What do you mean by "Header and column names" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is this Notepad you have indicated, the Windows built-in notepad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just need to clarify as Notepad does not have headers or column names. Perhaps if you could kindly elaborate what you were looking to do, we would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response regarding this matter.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for clarifying what you were wanting to accomplish in Notepad. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to go about that in notepad is to manual indent and implement the spacing in between column names, Notepad allows users to input free text; free of formatting- other than font style and size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend using Microsoft Word for the task, this allows you a greater range of formatting options for your document.</p>

            You can also right click the taskbar, select toolbars and tick the desktop option. This will put a shortcut to all your desktop icons on the taskbar so you can choose to hide all dsktop icons on desktop from desktop rightclick option, under view.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 asking for network credentials for NAS after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> half a clue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 asking for network credentials for NAS after update</h2>
                    After last night's latest and greatest update for Windows 10, I discover that I can no longer access my Qnap NAS from the PC that was updated (I'm afraid to allow any of the other ones to update, but given Microsoft's obnoxious forced updating, I can only
 delay that so long).&nbsp; When I try and connect, it asks me for network credentials, though the NAS is set up to allow everyone access; there are no passwords other than the admin one. I've tried a number of "solutions" ranging from simply rebooting, checking
 that the require services are running, turning on sharing in advanced sharing settings and removing the network mapping. I now can no longer map the drive as it asks for credentials. I tried a user name at one point, and now it's stuck with that. This literally
 worked yesterday until I installed the update. Any solutions?<br />

<p>The real issue is most likely that the older file sharing protocol (called SMB v1) has been disabled by default in modern versions of Windows 10.&nbsp; There was a security issue with this protocol, so Microsoft is trying to prevent security problems. &nbsp; Unfortunately,
 that creates other problems with older hardware that only knows SMB v1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you have 2 choices</p>
<p>1) Go to Qnap to get a firmware update to your NAS that supports SMB 2+ (the best option of the two)</p>
<p>2) Go to the Control Panel, Programs and Features, Turn Windows Features On or Off, and re-enable SMB 1.0/CIFF Client</p>

            Unfortunately, that didn't do it. As I mentioned, this worked until yesterday, so it had worked under fairly recent versions of Windows 10, just not this most recent upgrade. Also, as I had recently upgraded the firmware on the NAS, I suspected it already
 had SMB 2+. I confirmed this, though I made a minor change to not even allow 1.0. No difference.

<h2>            google 404 not found nginx</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open <a href="http://www.google.com/ig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/ig</a>, I get the following error: 404 Not Found nginx. I have been through the Microsoft Fix it process and it didn't help. I have also ran the Microsoft program to find trojans,
 etc. and that didn't resolve the problem. Please help. Thank you.</p>
