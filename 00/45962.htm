<h3> nathan zanetto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Connection</h2>
                    <p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pair of Beats by Dre Studio 3 headphones that I have always bluetoothed to my computer, it was a bit clunky at times but worked. I did a system restore recently and now although they pair, they don't connect unless I turn the headphones off and
 then back on. Once connected, they do not appear as an output option nor show up in the sound mixer. After a period of time they disconnect. I use a Targus Bluetooth 4.0 Dual-Mode Micro USB Adapter to connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Uninstalling and deleting the Targus Bluetooth 4.0 Adapter driver and reinstalling the latest driver from the website.</li><li>Updating the Beats by Dre firmware.</li><li>Troubleshooting Playing Audio, device not list so not much use.</li><li>Troubleshooting Bluetooth, "Check Bluetooth radio status" was fixed.</li><li>Troubleshooting Hardware and Devices, no problems.</li><li>Troubleshooting Network Adapter, no problems.</li><li>Updating/installing all intel drivers (intel i5-4460 CPU)</li><li>Updating/installing all AMD drivers (AMD 370 graphics card)</li><li>Checked my BIOS, it is up-to-date</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am now out of ideas. I have attached a photo to show that the connection is made, but it is not a playback option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            E200 00000074 00000000</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone seen this error before? I've went through all the trouble shooting steps and nothing seems to help. I called in and chose an advanced return, but my googling came up empty for this error. When i power on the console, i get the logo screen, but instead
 of going to the home screen, i get a black screen with this error. I've tried everything i can think of from disconnecting the power supply from the console and wall outlet over night,&nbsp; tried a new wall outlet, cleared cache (hold power for 10 secs while console
 is on)&nbsp; offline update, booting with or without game disk in ect. ect. Nothing seems to help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Also, anyone know if my saves will be available via cloud? I never set anything up in regard to cloud, is it automatic when you set up live gold? i have allot of time invested in forza and would really hate to start from scratch.</p>

<p>Well after experiencing an extended conversation with an online agent, I've decided to return my console for a refund (including my opened game disk). After jumping through many hoops in about an hour and a half, i was finally given a number for the microsoft
 money back guarantee. 1-888-673-8624 . This is for anyone else who feels let down by the lack of QA put into the xbox one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I thought after the red ring fiasco on the 360, this console would purr like a content kitten. Guess I was wrong.... Now if they would just staff that number, maybe i can get a refund, my retailer said once the seals were broken, there would be no refunds
 or exchanges. so i am stuck with more hoops to jump through </p>

<p>UPDATE &nbsp;turns out that the microsoft money back guarantee doesn't apply to xbox consoles. I've contacted the legal department on this issue.... you would think with all the hoops i am jumping through, it was me who designed and marketed a poorly built console
 clearly rushed to market with poor QA testing. </p>

<p>I received the same E200 error code multiple times. This was the launch day. I spent all day on hold and chatting to be told to send t back. They couldn't even tell me what the error code was. So I've done an advanced exchange it unfortunately will try to
 be delivered while I'm at work so I'll spend another day or so and time running around to get it. Good news is when I finally he the new system I've got a few people interested in it and I'll make a nice profit off it for my troubles. Sell it, purchase the
 PS4 and a few games for my son he can still play his 360 and I save some money and anymore headaches.
</p>
<p>Reminds me of the 2 360's that had the RROD. </p>
<p>I think ms really needs to do something for the customers affected and come out and appolgize for putting out an unfinished product. Reminds me of the Surface!

<p>Well after explaining to Microsoft staff that my retailer said their policy was no refunds or exchanges, they said they have to return the unit if i was looking for a refund. So, i called the retailer and informed them what the MS rep said, and they accepted
 my return along with the opened game disk which i would no longer need. I'm glad i got out of that mess without loosing money. The warranty is way too short, just keep swapping units til your out of warranty and your out $500 on a new console, or trying to
 sell any accessories/games you purchased along the way.</p>
<p>I may buy another xbox one some day... if they can make it reliable... i have a pong and an atari 2600 that still work.

<p>Lauren: at 22:18:02</p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking, did you do any basic troubleshooting with the previous representative whom you chatted with earlier?</p>
<p>matthew: at 22:18:48</p>

<p>matthew: at 22:19:15</p>

<p>Lauren: at 22:28:28</p>
<p>Please go ahead.</p>
<p>matthew: at 22:32:46</p>
<p>bk</p>
<p>Lauren: at 22:35:03</p>
<p>Matthew, I'd really hate to say this, however, considering that all other options are not available for you, the next best one is for us to do is to process a standard replacement of the console.</p>
<p>Lauren: at 22:35:24</p>
<p>I understand that it may take time. However, you can be assured of getting a working and a fully functional console.</p>
<p>Lauren: at 22:35:35</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier of the error message you received.</p>
<p>Lauren: at 22:35:47</p>
<p>Did this have something to do with the disc drive, if I may ask?</p>
<p>matthew: at 22:38:45</p>
<p>i have not spent that muh money to wait 3 weeks to use my console....no it did not have a disc drive issue....i do not understand why a courier could not take the console with him (an actual exchange) taking away a need for any details of money to be put
 on hold (a service sont recently provided with a faulty ps4 maay i add) MS is making this fair more complicated than it needs to be. of course the courier could not exchange the new console until he has recived the broken one</p>
<p>Lauren: at 22:43:07</p>

<h2>            Toshiba laptop has lost use of F6&#47;F7 screen brightness keys</h2>
                    Hi - my daughter went on a charity website and ever since then, AVG Free reports the virus &nbsp;'win32/DH.FF840283' as being resident on the computer and the screen brightness keys F6 and F7 stopped working. Further examination within AVG reveals that it's
 to do with the Toshiba hot key utility. AVG continues to flag up warnings of a virus being resident within that utility and the screen brightness keys continue not to work. I tried system restore (in safe mode) which fixed the problem temporarily but the virus
 came back. I tried reinstalling the hot key utilities and putting the named rogue file in AVG's allowed exceptions. Again, F6 and F7 worked for a while but then stopped with the virus warning coming up again. Any ideas?&nbsp;

<h2>            shrinking partition problem</h2>
                    
<p>When ever I try to shrink the drive, it just hangs. Nothing happens but the thinking curser is there but nothing is happening, nothing in the Process list using resorces but system idle and tskmang. I think it is the virtual disk service that is messing
 up. HELP!!!! It worked earlier, I was able to shrink it but now it just doesn't do anything</p>

<p>
Hello unknowntbeast,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site. The issue you posted appears to be hardware related; unfortunately we cannot assist with hardware modifications. Please contact the manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Formatting the hard drive will wipe out ALL data, programs and user settings that you have on the computer. If there is any information on this computer that you do not want to lose, or is not backed up, you will need to make backups before proceeding with
 the FORMAT/CLEAN INSTALL.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings
 are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Try following the steps in this article, be careful when following these steps, because they could leave your system unable to boot advanced level required.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You are unable to shrink the volume at all, since according to Windows&nbsp;you have no free space to shrink:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The reason why Windows won't let you shrink the volume is because there are immovable system files at the very end of the volume, as defragment utility shows us. In this case, the immovable file is actually the MFT, or Master File Table for the volume.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Heere Try This: Making Shrink Volume Work</p>
<p>
To absolutely ensure that you can shrink the volume, you should disable as many of the system files as you can, at least temporarily. Here's the list of steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Run the Disk Cleanup Wizard, making sure to remove the hibernation file and all restore points.
</span></li><li>
<span>Disable System Restore</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>Disable the pagefile ( Open up System in Control Panel, then Advanced System Settings&nbsp;\ Advanced \ Performance \ Advanced \ Change \ No Paging File.
</span></li><li>
<span>In the same Advanced Settings, go to Startup and Recovery \ Settings and then change the Write debugging information drop-down to "None" to disable the kernel memory dump.
</span></li><li>
<span>Disable Hibernation mode in your power options \ advanced power options screen.
</span></li><li>
<span>Reboot the machine, and then delete your c:\pagefile.sys file.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
Now that we've deleted almost every system file that we can, you should run at least one of these free defrag utilities, but preferably all of them, in order to move all of the files to the beginning of the volume, so we can force the Shrink volume feature
 to work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Power Defragmenter</span><span> (GUI interface for sysinternals contig)
</span></li><li>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Disk Defrag</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>If you are encountering the MFT problem, then you won't have too much luck even after running those utilities. What you'll need to do is use one of the non-free defrag utilities that is
 able to move the MFT files. If somebody can suggest a free way to move the MFT, leave a note in the comments.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
At this point you should be able to shrink the partition, at least a decent amount. Once you've gotten the partition shrunk, you should re-enable those important files:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Re-enable the Pagefile (Reverse instructions above)
</span></li><li>
<span>If you have issues re-enabling hibernate,</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>From the command prompt, type in the following command:</span>
</li><li>
<span>powercfg /hibernate on
</span></li><li>
<span>You'll have to restart your computer before it will take effect.</span>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Enabling System Restore or kernel debugging information is entirely up to you.
</span></li><li>
<span>Reboot. </span></li></ol>
<p>
Again, your best bet for dual-boot&nbsp;is backup, wipe, and reload.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello, I was wondering if someone can help me figure out what's happened to my computer.&nbsp; After switching it off and turning the power supply off and later on back on computer will not boot up, there are no beeps or sounds of any kind, the LED light on
 mother board&nbsp;is on so I assume there is power going through but it won't start.&nbsp; Has anyone got any idea as to what could have happened and what part of my hardware could have been damaged?&nbsp; Please help I tried a different power supply but it makes no difference.&nbsp;
 I have xp home edition and a pentium 4.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
thank you so much&nbsp;in advance for any suggestions<br />

thanks for your reply, you don't think it might be the processer that is damaged?.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to know for sure what part has been damaged before I buy a new board?<br />

<br />
Hi Ellyy,<br />
<br />
check every cable in your computer wether it fits tight. Try again. If you don't reach the BIOS, and you don't hear any signals, like beeps or other sounds - then try to&nbsp;replace the CMOS-Battery for a new one.<br />
<br />
If you have checked all cables, the CMOS-Battery renewed, and no reaction... write me, and I shall see what I can do for you.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
<br />
Have a nice day!<br />

Thanks so much for your help.&nbsp; I am happy to announce that my computer is fixed, the problem was the main power cable which had been damaged by the spark produced by the power supply&nbsp;point as I switched it off.

            Hi Pluton, I noticed your response to Ellyy and wondered if you would be willing to help me. I have an HP Tower Desktop System ~ Pentium 4 with Windows XP SP2 installed on it. A few days ago I ended up being infected with the Think Point Rogue Virus Protection
 Program. After trying everything I could think of I turned my computer off and back on. Now, all I get is drive lights and whirling sounds but nothing on the screen except the HP Logo screen then it stays slightly lit (gray) and nothing. I went to the Microsoft
 website and downloaded the Windows XP Home Edition .exe boot file on both a CD and DVD and although the drive lights light up nothing happens. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. THANK YOU! Have a great night! CNYVolleyballMom

<h2>            Windows Update responds with &#34;We couldn&#39;t connect to the update service...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was having some issues with my computer and was recommended here to get the latest MediaCreation tool and choose to upgrade now while keeping apps and files in place. I tried it but after the upgrade I wasn't able to connect to Windows Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I again used the mediacreation tool and again did an update on Feb 10. Again upgrade seems to have worked but when I go to Settings-&gt;Windows Update - it gives the message "We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check
 now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this problem was widespread earlier this month but it has been reported to be fixed. I still have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As additional info, I'm in Texas and my ISP is AT&amp;T. Also using Settings-&gt;System-&gt;About says Version as 1809 and Build as 17763.316</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked on the windows version website and the last OS build reported there is 17763.292 - so seems to be something later than that. Is that normal to have Media Creation tool install something that is not mentioned on the website (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4476976)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Settings-&gt;Backup and Updates-&gt; Troubleshoot, but the troubleshooter for Windows Update returns saying that there isn't anything to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit - I have tried changing my DNS servers too (first to Google's DNS and then to OpenDNS) but both still resulted in the same …&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Israel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the links. I have gone through both pages and the problem is still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically from the first site you linked -&gt;&nbsp;https://www.thewindowsclub.com/we-couldnt-connect-update-service<br />
</p>
<p><span>1] Run Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></p>
<p>I have run it. It says Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p><span>2] Run Internet Connections Troubleshooter</span></p>
<p>This isn't really necessary cos I have internet connectivity and can reach various websites just fine (including Microsoft.com)</p>
<p><span>3] Restart the Windows Update Service</span><span>This also didn't resolve the problem. Interestingly while the Windows Update service was running already, it said that it was Manual (trigger start) instead of automatic.
 I changed to automatic too and rebooted. But still running Windows Update continues to give the same message.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4] Change the DNS server</span></span>Already has been done. Both Google and OpenDNS servers have been tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5] Reset Windows Update components</span></p>
<p>Did this too. But still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the second site -&gt; https://windowsreport.com/fix-couldnt-connect-update-service/</p>
<p>I tried 1 thru 6 and still no success. For number 7</p>
<p><span>7. Install the update manually</span></p>
<p>I don't see the Update History link inside the Advanced Settings. I see a View Update History link right in the Windows Update page. However clicking on it shows absolutely nothing to me below Update history - absolutely nothing is listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions for me to try?</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />
Please try update in manual mode. <br />
1. Find update version number </p>
<p>==&gt; I am not sure what you mean by this. I don't know of any specific update right now, because I never get a list of windows updates to install. As soon as I click check for updates, I get the message "We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try
 again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet." I never see which updates are available for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Kindly press Win+I and select Update &amp; Security <br />
3. In Windows Update, click on Advanced Settings and pick Update History) </p>
<p>==&gt; I don't see an Update History option in Advanced Settings. I see a View Update History option on the Windows Update tab itself. Clicking it shows absolutely nothing listed under Update History.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Access the Microsoft official webpage. <br />
5. Find your particular Windows 10 update, download it on your computer and install it.
</p>
<p>==&gt; As I said earlier, I don't know which update is "available" for me. It never returns with a list of updates to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly mention 'Media Creation tool' that install something that is not mentioned.
</p>
<p>==&gt; I used the MediaCreationTool1809.exe that I got from Microsoft (&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 &amp; by clicking Download tool now) to re-install Windows 10 Home again. Specifically I chose the Upgrade Now option with the keep
 files and apps option checked to re-install Windows 10 Home on my desktop (to fix a problem about my audio no longer working). This installed Windows 10 Home Version 1809 (the October 2018 feature update) at OS Build:&nbsp;<span>17763.316</span></p>

</p><p>I've run thru the steps outlined once (and therefore without step 4) and it hasn't resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However some notes from my run -&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Application Identity service (appidsvc) was not running, when I tried to stop it (in Step 2)</p>
<p>2. There wasn't a qmgr*.dat found in order</p>
<p>3. During the registering process (Step 6), while some of the dlls got registered successfully, there were several files that showed an error dialog</p>
<ul>
<li>The following files had an error dialog shown which said "The module "mshtml.dll" was loaded but the entry point DllRegisterServer was not found. Make sure that "mshtml.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again" -
<ul>
<li>mshtml.dll</li><li>shdocvw.dll</li><li>browseui.dll</li><li>wuaueng.dll</li><li>qmgr.dll</li></ul>
</li><li>The following files had an error dialog shown which said "The module "msxml.dll" failed to load. Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependent .DLL files. The specified module could not
 be found. " -
<ul>
<li>msxml.dll</li><li>gpkcsp.dll</li><li>sccbase.dll</li><li>initpki.dll</li><li>wuaueng1.dll</li><li>wucltui.dll</li><li>wuweb.dll</li><li>qmgrprxy.dll</li><li>wucltux.dll</li><li>muweb.dll</li><li>wuwebv.dll</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>I did make sure that I was in the system32 directory inside the windows directory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I ignored the step about Windows Update Agent because it seemed to be pointing to versions for previous editions of Windows (8, 8.1 and so on) and not Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting the services, I was still not able to get windows update to work right - it still says
</p>
<p><span>"We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet."</span></p>
<p><span>--------------------------</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Separately I tried to update my antivirus definitions in Windows Defender and it was able to download and install today's definitions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want me to repeat this and include step 4 next? Or do some of the error messages that I mentioned above point to a different problem?</p>

Did you try to run the application with compatibility issue.
Right click on the app and run properties then compatibility

<p>no, this is not an application specific issue, it does this in windows without anything running. My research into this issue has lead me to believe that this is a "feature" of windows ink. However where disabling windows ink would fix the problem in earlier
 versions of windows, the problem remains even if I go into gpedit.msc and disable windows ink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far no one has been able to provide a fix for windows 10 when I google the issue. Microsoft technical support has no clue. I just can't believe the guy who programmed it this was thought it was a good idea</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You should be able to just move it to the location you want it to open and then close it. Most all 'installed' programs will open in the same position they were when last opened/closed.<br />
They will also remember the window size as well.<br />
<br />
The exception to this is popups and program installations. These have been programed to come up in certain locations. This is likely not something you can change.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 latest update corrupted my laptop, only option is to take laptop apart.... its like the dark ages&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This morning 23rd Jan 2018, I got around to installing Microsoft's latest **** up of an update. I thought we were past the days when MS released half ass'd updates..... When I turn on laptop it goes directly to a recovery screen, asks me to select a kb layout,
 then gives me choices "Choose an option" Continue: Exit and contine rollback - this does nothing. Use a device, Use another OS, troubleshoot (this does nothing) also.&nbsp; So the options, call support and have to pay someone or the community which I have rely
 on. So please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to take&nbsp; my hdd out to recover data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lptp is a lenovo so I could force a restore, but I will loose my data, I don't have a windows 10 disk (if there is even such a thing anymore)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a usb to usb transfer possible?</p>

            Hi Fearghal.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can rescue files to external USB device using the booted media following this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to access Command Prompt to rescue your files from first link.  
<br />
<br />Close CMD box, move USB device to another PC to confirm files are all there, then click Install Now, Custom Install, at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to auto-format and begin install. 
<br />
<br />If you fail to rescue media, then dont' delete or format at the Drive Selection Screen, just choose C and click next.  This will archive your files in a c:\windows.old folder for later retrieval.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Ch61sha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just need to make sure if you are signed in on the correct account. This normally happens if the Skype account linked to the email address was already deleted. You can try checking if you have previously created a
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username). You can ask some of your colleague to check&nbsp;your&nbsp;Skype profile in their Skype app to&nbsp;get your Skype name.&nbsp;Let me know if you still have questions.

    <title>&#91;Win 98, IE 6 SP1&#93; Windows Update redirect loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tgp1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Win 98, IE 6 SP1&#93; Windows Update redirect loop</h2>
                    It seems like whenever I try to access Windows Update from my Windows 98 SE virtual machine (yes, it's old :P But Windows Update is still supported, right?), Windows Update seems to send internet explorer into some kind of redirect loop. It will never
 load the page, but it will just keep trying to jump between http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/default.aspx and http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us. I've tried accessing windows update with multiple
 versions of IE 5, as well as IE6, and SP1.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this issue? I know most of us are familiar with Windows Update in the form of a program that we can launch from the start menu (using Vista and 7 here as well), although this issue seems like one that was introduced recently. I hope this
 doesn't mean Microsoft is trying to erase 9.x forever.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click -<br />
RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<h2>            Sony Vaio &#34;Driver_IRQL_Not_Less_or_Equal&#34;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I just received my new Sony Vaio in the mail today which is equipped with Windows 8.<br />
It was working perfectly until I shut the lid and it went to sleep. <br />
Once I opened the lid the screen read an error that said something to the effect of
<b>"Driver_IRQL_Not_Less_or_Equal" </b>with <b>"iaStorA.sys"</b> after that. <br />
It also said to look that error code up online after it restarted, which I did. I came to find that some people were getting a code like this due to third party antivirus programs such as AVG.<br />
Well, I had installed AVG nearly as soon as I figured this computer out, so I thought maybe that was the problem?
<br />
Nope. I uninstalled AVG but even after that I still encountered that same error code about an hour later (again, after shutting the lid and reopening it).<br />
So, I'm guessing it wasn't AVG's fault, but something else. The question is, <b>what</b> is making this error come up?<br />
To be honest I'm really frustrated with this as this computer is brand new, and I have been anxiously waiting for it for a while now.
<br />
I got this computer because I needed a new one that would be reliable for me, but if this error keeps coming up I'm not sure I got my money's worth.<br />
I'd really love to solve this problem without having to ship it back to Sony, so if anyone has any idea of what's wrong or what I could do I'd be very grateful to hear it!<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advance! <br />
<br />
