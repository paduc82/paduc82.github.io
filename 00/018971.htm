<p>If you have previously upgraded to published W10 RTM from activated W7 or W8.1 OS on that pc, you should be able to get clean install of build 10565 activated without product key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With introduction of build 10565 Microsoft has added the ability to use your pc activated W7 or W8.1 product if you incur activation problem.You use that activated key by going to activation and click change product key. Then you enter activated key.</p>

<p>I don't think single language would be a problem if you have already had other Th2 insider builds installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had activated W10 Home on your pc, I would use Windows 10 download site and download W10 ISO file. Use it to clean install W10 Home then upgrade to build 10565 after re-joining insider program.</p>

            <strong>Hi Azrael´s Kiss Thanks a lot dear brother....</strong><strong>one big hug.
</strong>You have saved my life. Your tip was very helpful. I could activate my windows 10 with old windows 7 product key that I got from the label behind the battery. My thanks goes to
<strong>IgnacioSP.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well! My computer story: Two years ago I have cloned my HDD drive to a SSD drive using a free software EaseUS disk clone. I cloned it successfully. But later I realized that it was not a powerful and effective cloning. However my SSD was functioning well! Last
 July I have upgraded it to windows 10. I became faster and I loved windows 10. A few weeks back I wanted to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;a true clean install of
 my windows 10 &nbsp;</span><span>using the media creation tool (</span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
 I have created an ISO file on a USB drive. Then I started to upgrade my pc after backing up my documents. But upgrading has failed and I lost my Windows 10 on SSD and I did not know what to do and where my product ID was. You both helped me to solve the issue.
 Now I have my system on SSD. It runs much faster than on HDD.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Security Client Error during initialization 0x80096005</h2>
                    <p>I have had <em>Microsoft Security Essentials </em>installed for two years on a Windows 7 system. Recently&nbsp;<em>Windows Security Center&nbsp;</em>has started issuing the error box during Startup: "<strong>An error has occurred in the program during initialization.
 If this error problem continues, please contact your system administrator. Error code: 0x80096005</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens in the login for one user. The result is a black screen and the inability to run some programs. I could run MSE as Administrator and performed updates and scans. The History tab showed that several malware&nbsp;files had been detected and quarantined
 at about the same date the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used another Administrator&nbsp;user login to uninstall and reinstall MSE. A scan did not detect any problems and the&nbsp;initialization failure for the affected user&nbsp;is still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to run the System File Check with "cmd sfc /scannow" and found no problems.</p>

            <p>I booted up in safe mode and ran MSE. I did not get the error message and no infections were detected in a full scan. But when I started windows in normal mode, the error message and black screen were still there for my login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have resolved both problems. The black screen was due to a corrupted file
<em>Transcoded Wallpaper.jpg </em>in<em> AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Themes .
</em>After deleting it and selecting a desktop background, the screen was normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error in starting Microsoft Security Client was resolved by setting the shortcut for running Microsoft Security Essentials to "Run as Administrator". Even though my login is an Administrator privilege, MSE seems to need administrator&nbsp;permission to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps others with the same problem.</p>
<p>

<p>We have a client who wants to go in for a mix of Business Premium, E1 and E3. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Also, what is the difference between Skype for Business Online Plans that come between Business Premium, E1 and E3?</p>
<p>Also, can I restrict usage of all of the Office 365 services only through Office Laptops or Office Mobiles AND NOT personal or home laptops?</p>

<p>Hi Karthick,</p>
<p>As for OneDrive for Business, it is not feasible to totally block using it in external network. However, we can use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to prevent users from syncing files from OneDrive for Business. For your reference:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn917455.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn917455.aspx</a>.&nbsp;In this case, users are able to review files in OneDrive for Business Online.</p>
<p>About the other questions, below are my replies:<br />
<em>1. Basic difference between Business Premium &amp; E3 plan.</em><br />
Besides Ben’s reply, the E3 plan has two more applications than the Business Premium plan: Access and InfoPath. Skype for Business is available in both plans. For your reference:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office-365-platform-service-description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
detailed service comparison information of Business Premium plan and E3 plan</a>.</p>
<p><em>2. Difference between Skype with E1 &amp; E3 plan.</em><br />
The E1 plan excludes Skype for Business, which is included in the E3 plan. It is not feasible to download the desktop version for the E1 plan.</p>
<p><em>3. Have access to OneDrive &amp; SharePoint only from the company laptop &amp; desktop &amp; some authorized mobile devices, and other machines should be denied.</em><br />
It is feasible to achieve it. This article about <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh526961(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><em>4. Control the access like whom to provide access to ActiveSync, OWA, and Skype with external users, and access to OneDrive &amp; SharePoint from other than company system.</em><br />
To control the user’s access to the mailbox via ActiveSync or OWA, please refer to<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2416434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this article</a>.

<p><em>5. Use RMS to set up rights for any local document.</em><br />
We suggest you set up rights for documents by turning on IRM. <a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Set-up-Information-Rights-Management-IRM-in-SharePoint-admin-center-239ce6eb-4e81-42db-bf86-a01362fed65c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><em>6. Antispam, antivirus at email gateway is sufficient or do we need to go for additional scanning? Difference between ATP &amp; regular email gateway provided in other plans.</em><br />

<p><em>7. Integrate Office 365 emails gateway to scan from DLP from Force point or Digital guardian.</em><br />
DLP is based on transport rules, so it is part of EOP.</p>
<p><em>8. How does video portal work?</em><br />
If you have licenses of SharePoint in the E3 plan, it is feasible to get in to the Video portal and upload videos. Here is an article about
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-manage-a-channel-in-Office-365-Video-1fede4cc-13c0-435a-b585-e7fbf1c83bb2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><em>9. Send large files (approx. 1GB) to the client or customer, applying for only specific users.</em><br />
We can restrict sending files to the client or customer by setting permissions for SharePoint services. However, it is not feasible to restrict the size limitation.</p>
<p><em>10. Security &amp; leakage of confidential data.</em><br />
In SharePoint online, we can control the security of confidential data by setting permissions. Here is an article about
<a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Understanding-permission-levels-in-SharePoint-87ecbb0e-6550-491a-8826-c075e4859848?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
permission in SharePoint</a> for your reference.</p>
<p><em>11. Email access &amp; Skype for all users (200 users).</em><br />
If there are 200 users in the tenant, 200 licenses need to be assigned to these users for downloading and using Office.</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 Very Very Slow Paste - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikey mccollister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 Very Very Slow Paste</h2>
                    <p>My personal budget spreadsheet is something that I have maintained for years in Excel. It has a fair amount of custom VBA functions that I have written. This spreadsheet performance has been very good until I started using Excel 2013. While recalculation
 on Excel 2013 is a little slower, what is very bad is pasting cell values in my spreadsheet. On Excel 2010, a paste would take possibly a second, which I though was slow at the time. Now with Excel 2013, pasting takes about 30 seconds. When I paste values
 the bottom of Excel shows “CALCULATING: (4 PROCESSOR(S)): XX%” until XX% becomes 100%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could possibly be going on here? I will probably do some debugging on my VBA code to see if I am doing something wrong but this code has been used since at least Excel 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what is going on here? Is there someone at Microsoft that I can send a copy of my spreadsheet to for them to look at?</p>

            <p>Is the delay occuring during the actual pasting, or in the calculation following the pasting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your code, do you have application.Calculation=xlCalculationManual&nbsp; at the top of your code and application.Calculation=xlAutomatic at the end? That would ensure that you only calculate once, rather than after each cell value&nbsp;is pasted in.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The delay after the paste happens, sort of. For example, if I copy some cells from spreadsheet A to spreadsheet B then paste happens and I have to wait about 30 seconds for the paste options to come up so I can select paste as values. When that is selected
 I have to wait another 30 seconds for the values to come up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I find that while I'm waiting for the calculation to happen I can click on a cell and it becomes responsive. I just think that the "CALCULATING" at the bottom of the application should not be there.</p>

            It's going to hurt!<br />
<br />
You would realy need to write an addin that detects selection changed and then check whether the text in that box had altered. There's no way I know to detect a specific text box changing directly.<br />

<p>I understand that you wanted to move all&nbsp;of your&nbsp;emails in a single folder, let me help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you wanted to move all of your emails from a specific sender or contact, all you need to do is mark or check all the emails that you wanted to move. On the Inbox menu you should be able to see there the menu feature
<strong>Move to</strong>, click on it, then choose the folder that you wanted to transfer your emails.

</p><p>It has never been possible to change your Skype Name. And since the migration of Skype accounts to Microsoft accounts, the option to create a unique Skype Name has been
<em>removed</em>. This is because we want to focus on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in to Microsoft services with just one password.

<h2>            What&#39;s the Mac Excel equivalent of &#34;mso-data-placement&#58; same-cell&#59;&#34; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to open a HTML file in Excel. The HTML file has a &lt;br&gt; tag in it, which is supposed to make the data either side of the tag be on different lines, but in the same cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;br style='mso-data-placement: same-cell'&gt;World!&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, you must add style<code>=</code>"mso-data-placement: same-cell;" to the &lt;br&gt; tag, in order for 'Hello' and 'World' to appear in the same cell, but on different lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this doesn't seem to work in Mac Excel (I'm using Office 2016) - is there an equivalent which will solve my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to reply Joe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the application we've created actually writes the HTML directly to a file for Excel to open, so we need to be able to split data in the same cell by HTML (copy and paste is a bit long-winded for our users)</p>
<p>

    <title>Mail is not syncing across devices. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daisy brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail is not syncing across devices.</h2>
                    <p>I use Mac mail on my desktop computer as my primary devices for emails and work related tasks. I have checked with Apple Support and my computer is operating on the newest software, my wifi is connected and all is in perfect working order. I can send and
 receive mail, I can store and file my emails into folders, view my sent mail and my drafts and use the application to it's maximum potential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log into office365 on my web browser, the mail in my inbox is not in sync with that of my mac mail inbox. Nothing has been sorted. My read appears as unread and responded mail appears as though it hasn't even been opened, let alone responded to. I
 have checked with my recipients and responses have been received but office265 is not showing this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is set up with my emails but on my iPhone X it appears the same as office 365 and therefore out of sync. This is incredibly frustrating as I cannot see what is true, what has already been read and what I have responded to. This therefore means I
 cannot use my emails on the run, which is the whole point of my purchase in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed my email accounts from all devices and re-added them. They are all set up using EXCHANGE (not manually using IMAP or POP). I have called and spoken with representatives from Netregistry (my domain provider) Apple (my device provider) and am
 at a loss as to what to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help, advice and/or technical support to work towards fixing this issue as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanking you in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Daisy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my experience, since you can both send and receive emails, your account should have been connected to the server and the reason shouldn’t be related to your Office 365 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better help you, you can download the Outlook client on your Mac or Iphone. Then configure your Office 365 account, and see it the emails will sync between the Outlook client and
<a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App(OWA)</a>. If it all works fine between Outlook client and OWA, please contact Apple Mail support for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

    <title>Mail Merge Formatting - Keep Next Line At a Fixed Distance from the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david r. krumholz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge Formatting - Keep Next Line At a Fixed Distance from the Top of Page Regardless of Address Length</h2>
                    <p>I am merging a letter with an address block&nbsp;which can be 3, 4, or 5 lines. Following the address block I want a reference line that I always want to be at a fixed distance from the top of the paper,&nbsp;regardless of the number of lines in the address block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The merge is properly getting me the address block, but if the address block is 3 lines the reference line is higher than if the address block is 5 lines. How can I tell the merge to put the reference line a fixed distance from the top of the page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the address is on lines 4,5,6,7, and 8 (5 line address) the reference is on line 10. If the address lines are only&nbsp;lines 4,5, and 6, I still want the reference on line 10. How do I keep the reference on line 10 when the address block shrinks from 5
 to 4 or to 3 lines?</p>

            Where you want the address block to appear, insert a 1-cell table and give that cell a fixed row height sufficient to accommodate the maximum number of address lines. Then insert the address block into the cell.

<h2>            IE 11 &#40;Windows 7&#41; using my available 4GB of RAM very quickly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My IE has become almost unusable.&nbsp; This morning I opened three news stories to read on different tabs and IE became unresponsive.&nbsp; Task Manager indicated that each tab was taking about 1.2 to 1.3GB RAM, so my available 4GB of 8GB total was being maxed out.&nbsp;
 I don't think this is normal, and in the not distant past I did not have this problem (not sure about GB demand, but IE was working fine until recently).&nbsp; In trying to troubleshoot so far, I did the recommended disable/re-enable IE 11 and made sure there were
 no add-ons.&nbsp; This did not help.&nbsp; I downloaded trial malwarebytes and it did not find any threats. Lastly, I went to check Windows Defender, and it will not turn on.</p>
<p>Right now my available 4GB RAM usage is 40% with only Task Manager and this one IE tab open.&nbsp; Processor usage is 4%.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>The warnings on the hot fix scared me away.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am experiencing the problem only severely with MSN News articles as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Other web sites I visit (walmart.com, tirerack.com, espn.com, for instance) are working just fine.&nbsp; I am also getting the
 message "MSN.com is not responding" quite frequently.&nbsp; Perhaps it is truly an issue with MSN?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have not been able to resolve the issue, however, I also am not experiencing this issue on any other websites I visit.&nbsp; If I pull news articles from Bing.com they are lightning fast and problem-free, as well as other websites I use for sports news or shopping.&nbsp;
 The unresponsiveness, website not responding messages and long-script running messages are only occurring on MSN.com and the articles I read from that site.</p>

            Ouch. I don't suppose you have a backup of the pst? Cyclic Redundancy Check errors in the data file indicates there are hard drive errors - scanpst may be able to repair it. 
<br />How to use scanpst

            Hi MPSTH, the next steps would be to try to open Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins.

<br />If that doesn't work please create and try with a new Outlook profile:

            You've already run chkdsk /f on the hard disk? (That should be what the "microsoft disk tool" does.)  Typically, you use chkdsk to fix disk errors then scanpst to fix errors in the pst file.

            <p>Hi Mina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can send automatic (Out of Office) replies from Outlook whenever you want to let people who send you email know that you won’t be responding to their messages right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have 2 different ways to set up automatic replies. The methods you choose depends on the type of email account you are using in Outlook.</p>
<p>Accounts in Outlook:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-automatic-out-of-office-replies-from-Outlook-9742f476-5348-4f9f-997f-5e208513bd67?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#bkmk01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 for Business or an Exchange server account</a>.</strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-automatic-out-of-office-replies-from-Outlook-9742f476-5348-4f9f-997f-5e208513bd67?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#BKMK02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 home, Outlook.com, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo! or other POP or IMAP email
 account</a>.</strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-automatic-out-of-office-replies-from-Outlook-9742f476-5348-4f9f-997f-5e208513bd67?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#BKMK03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">If you are not sure of what type of account you have</a>.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For Office 365 for Business or an Exchange server account, Automatic Replies feature is only available while in Office 365 Home (Outlook.com, Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo! or other POP or IMAP email account) you can combine an Outlook email template with Outlook
 rules to simulate the functionality of the Automatic Replies feature that is available only to Office 365 for Business or Exchange Server accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note that in sending a reply automatically, Outlook must be running and configured to check periodically for new messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can’t remember which type of account you have, the easiest way to tell is to see if the
<strong>Automatic Replies</strong> functionality is available once you choose the
<strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<p>

    <title>ZUNE Marketplace doesn&#39;t update history - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cantu solutions  say:</h3>
<h2>            ZUNE Marketplace doesn&#39;t update history</h2>
                    
<p>I am having an issue with the zune hub on my htc hd7 phone that I hope somebody can help me.</p>
<p>If I play a song from the zune maketplace and browse somewhere else on the phone I can no longer go back and see what is currently playing on my zune. Which means that I cannot stop, pause, ff, rewind or anything. The 'history' shows something else, not
 the current song beeing played. It seems as if the phone is not aware that the zune hub is playing a song.</p>
<p>Can anybody help? Any infinite wisdom any of you would like to share?</p>

<p>When you look at the history, there is a large square for the current song being played (either from your collection of the Marketplace).&nbsp; Pressing on the square should bring you to the current song playing (or paused) where you can pause, play, ff or rewind.</p>
<p>If you press the start button and go to the start screen, if you have the Music and Video tile up, it should show the current song playing. On occasion, the Live Tile does not update for me but it does most of the time.&nbsp; Regardless of it updating or not,
 if there is a song playing it always is available in the large square when I press the Live Tile.</p>
<p>When I play (stream) from the Marketplace, the small squares of the history do not show streamed music ... only music played from my library.</p>

    <title>Creating Tent Cards in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating Tent Cards in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Avery 5305 and I'm trying to create name tent based on the template provided by Avery.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need the name on both sides with the top portion be upside down.&nbsp; In Word 2007, it doesn't allow the rotation of the text to be upside down.&nbsp; Any ideas how to
 make this work?&nbsp; The Card size is 2 1/2" x8 1/2". I tried to create 2 columns with tables, but can't get to work with the correct measurements.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Unable to add &#34;Holiday calendar&#34; to my calendar to my outlook.com account via my web browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to&nbsp;add a "Holiday calendar" to my calendar to my outlook.com account via my web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding the holiday calendar by clicking on the 'add account' button on top of the web page and clicking on the drop-down menu. However, a notice appears which says: "the list of holiday calendars isn't currently unavailable. Please try again
 later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting with Microsoft support which had referred me to a FAQ page with common issues with outlook.com calendar issues, however, i have not been able to find the solution for a few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Ryan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may arise due to missing or corrupted system file, your browser might need to be refreshed, your email server needs to be checked or your account needs to be reconfigured. For us to help you with regards to your concern, we'd like to get the following:</p>

<li><strong>Which browser are you using? Are you experiencing the same issue with the other browsers?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Hi, I have been using both google chrome and microsoft Edge; and i have refreshed all the browsers and done the steps you have suggested, but the problem still persists.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>What's the email domain are you having an issue?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The email domain that i am using is outlook.com</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Can you provide the link of the troubleshooting steps that you have tried from the Microsoft Support page?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft support had advised me to seek support from the support team from the outlook.com web page. They have advised me to refer to this link:&nbsp;</li><li>https://support.office.com/article/40676AD0-C831-45AC-A023-5BE633BE798D</li><li>In addition, i have also tried using the calcheck tool to identify any issue. The log indicated that there is no major issue to rectify.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I am alittle concerned because the solutions suggested to me like the calcheck tool appear to be targeted at the outlook desktop app. In my opinion, this may not be the source of the problem. This is because I have tried logging into my other outlook.com
 accounts in the very same browser and they can all add holiday calendar without any problems. I found it strange as only this email account is affected. Therefore, i think the problem is perhaps with my microsoft outlook.com account itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to 'reset' the account itself? I dont think tweaking any settings through the outlook desktop app seems to be working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the updates. With regards to resolving the potential missing or corrupted system file concern, usually you have to ensure that the browser you are using is up-to-date. If you are using Office 365, we recommend resetting

<h2>            &#34;Unknown Error Occurred, error code 0x8004011.d&#34;</h2>
                    I have formatted my drive, installed Windows 8 and MS Office 2010 Professional Plus.<br />
When I try to set up a new account in Outlook the error I have entered in the title of this message is displayed.<br />
<br />
I think it is important to add that I can add an email from Gmail with no error but when I attempt to add an email account from Comcast it completed the entire setup without error, connecting to Comcast and sending a setup message, until I click on "Finish"
 or "Add Another Account", then gives me the error above.<br />
<br />
I have copied the Outlook.pst from the previous installation of MS Office 2010 Professional on a Windows 7 Professional PC into the 'Outlook' folder under AppData as per instructions in the Microsoft Support section. I recently did this same copy and paste
 when doing an update to my wifes computer with no errors. This is the first time I have seen this error message.<br />
<br />
When I try to run Scanpst.exe the command is not found.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />

            I've tried repair. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling MS Office 2010. I've tried uninstalling MS Office 2010 and installing MS Office 2013. Same results. I've even gone so far as to reformat the drive and reinstall Windows 8 and then MS Office 2010
 with the same results. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, I've had Win 7 Pro with Office 2010 and then Office 2013, and Win 8 Pro (all OS 64bit) with Office 2010 and Office 2013 and get the same error message each time.
<br />
<br />
I have let Outlook set up the account and I've also tried setting up the account manually, and yes, I was setting it up as a POP3 account. All with the same error message.<br />
<br />
The only thing I haven't tried is installing the latest service pack before setting up the POP3 account.&nbsp; I'll try that when I get home tonight. Thank you.<br />

<p>
</p><p>That doesn't tell us what you saw.&nbsp; E.g. your symptoms sound like IE has been turned off but it also sounds like you are seeing bits of UI that we would not expect to be showing if that was the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another cause of a symptom description like this would be installing a third-party browser and that can happen unexpectedly by installing other third-party software such as Adobe Flash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why are you trying to use IE anyway?&nbsp; Why not use Edge since you seem to be confirming that it at least works.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>I am a newcomer to Windows 10 having migrated from XP, and I'm still trying to get to grips with the differences between the two. &nbsp;As such I'd sooner carry on using &nbsp;internet explore for a while, until I'm more familiar with Win 10. &nbsp;I do use Edge but cannot

 me.&nbsp; My operating system and IE11 worked for a while then 1607 installed itself again.&nbsp; This happened four more times even though&nbsp;MS support said that they had fixed the problem and that 1607 would not install itself again without my authorization.&nbsp; I gave
 up.&nbsp; It now takes about 30 minutes for IE11 to start.&nbsp; Meanwhile I am exploring other operating systems.</p>

<p>Hi again, problem still not resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have run IE in save mode via the command window, but it made no difference. The busy ring appears for &lt; a second, but other than that it does nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also restore to a version four months back, to a time when it was working, but alas it still does not work.</p>
<p>I do run Google Chrome as I have always done since purchasing the PC, which I need while this problem exists.</p>
<p>Any further help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So there is still an interferer that runs even in safe mode.&nbsp; Your security package would be a suspect then and you would have to uninstall it to test running without it.&nbsp; Again, though AutoRuns would work even in safe mode, so you might find a better suspect
 that way.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>FWIW my tack would be to run ProcMon to find out what is going on.&nbsp; Unfortunately ProcMon does not work in safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>How to minimize Onenote section file sizes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaimeluis  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to minimize Onenote section file sizes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have downloaded a onenote notebook from my friend's machine and now I would like to upload it to my Skydrive for viewing in my Windows Phone 7 Onenote Mobile. Thus far I have removed unnecessary pages and media and have chopped the sections to distribute
 the media into chunks of section files. However I have done this, even converting back and forth from 2007 format and 2010 format to remove unwanted metadata, it seems to me that some of the sections (particularly the parent sections) remain bloated.</p>
<p>Is there a way to minimize a notebook or section's file size either in 2007 or 2010 format? I am limited to filesized no greater than 50Mb for Skydrive.</p>

    <title>Auto fill table data based on another field&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelsnecropolis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto fill table data based on another field&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Sorry for the poor title. I really didnt know how to phrase the question.<br />
I have a table titled Rep ID. There are 2 columns: Rep ID, Mgr. It lists the name of a person and then that persons manager in the next column. I have a another table titled Error Tracking Log to which the records are saved to. The two columns in question are
 Rep ID and Manager. I have a form titled Error Tracking with two combo boxes for&nbsp;the Rep&nbsp;ID (cmbRepID)&nbsp;and the Managers&nbsp;(Mgrlist).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I save a new record I manually enter the Rep ID in the form. Is there a beforeupdate command or some other method, of automatically choosing the correct manager
 for the Rep ID based on the Rep ID table and saving it to the Error Tracking Log table.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'd like to be able to use the filterbyselection command on a manager combo box so that the Rep ID combo box only shows the Rep IDs associated with that particular manager.
 This is all on the form and not a report, btw.</span></p>
<p><span>Does that make sense?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

<p>I don't know how to say this delicately, but your table design needs work. Without the proper design everything else becomes that much harder.</p>
<p>You should not have a table name and a field name with the same name (like your Rep ID). How about tblEmployees for the table name? Btw we recommend not to use spaces and other funny characters in object names.</p>
<p>You should not name a field "Rep ID" and then store a rep name in it. By convention, the "ID" part refers to a number, likely an Autonumber. Such IDs are often used to tie tables together in a relational database design.</p>
<p>The standard design for an employee table with managers is:<br />
tblEmployees<br />
EmployeeID autonumber primary key<br />
FirstName text20, required<br />
LastName text30, required<br />
ManagerID long integer, required&nbsp; (Note: the top boss has herself as manager)</p>
<p>Then create a self-join in the Relationships window, and enforce it.</p>
<p>There is no need to record the manager in tblErrorTracking: it can be derived from tblEmployees. Only exception is if managers change a lot, and you want to record the manager AT THAT TIME.</p>
<p>Maybe before you build your db design, let alone your app, you need to study these concepts a bit more. Here is an interesting book to get started:<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470525746.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470525746.html</a></p>

<p>I appreciate the constructive criticism but currently I'm not interested in making my designs look nice by using standard naming conventions. I'm interested in being able to efficiently execute the various functions of my designs. I have gotten away from
 using spaces in many object names since I find using underscores and brackets a bit tedious. As you're aware I'm an amateur. I learn by trial/error, research, and from the assistance of experts like yourself. I have no formal training in VB or Access.&nbsp;Thank
 you.</p>
<p>That said, I'm still in need of assistance. Using my form, can I filter record results by the managers name so that only the particular names of employees are&nbsp;displayed in a Combo box?</p>
<p>Thank you again for the assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I fully agree with Tom's constructive criticism of your design. You've been lucky, but this will eventually get you in trouble!</p>
<p>That said... you can put some VBA code in the AfterUpdate (not BeforeUpdate) of cmbRepID to "push" the rep's manager into the field: just use DLookUp("[Mgr]", "[Rep ID]", "[Rep ID].[Rep ID] = """ &amp; Me!cmbRepID &amp; """") (assuming that Rep ID in fact contains
 a name).</p>
<p>To have the Rep ID combo box dependent on the Manager combo box, you don't need a filterbyselection at all; instead simply set the Rep ID combo's Rowsource to a Query referencing the manager combo box as a criterion:</p>
<p>Select [Rep ID].[Rep ID] FROM [Rep ID] WHERE [Rep ID].[Mgr] = [Forms]![YourFormName]![cmbMgr] ORDER BY [Rep ID];</p>
<p>Requery cmbRepID in the AfterUpdate event of cmbMgr and you'll be in.</p>

<p>Okay, I just ran a test.&nbsp; You want to&nbsp;use the sheet and range just like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; For Each objWsh In objWbk.Worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If objWsh.Name Like "*Stuff0" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set objRng = objWsh.UsedRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sWorkSheetName =&nbsp;objWsh.Name &amp; "!" &amp; <strong>Replace(</strong>objRng.Address<strong>, "$", "")</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next objWsh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
