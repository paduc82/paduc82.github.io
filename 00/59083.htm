    <title>Why can&#39;t I change my lock screen on my PC after Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I change my lock screen on my PC after Windows 10 installation&#63;</h2>
                    Okai so I got the Windows 10 from my free reservation. I didn't do a 'clean installation' because I do not have a back up and I am not tech-savvy. Basically, Windows 10 apps were crashing and not working. After a couple weeks it cleared up after updates
 and my apps now work, but my store app still does not load or allow me to install new apps. But I try to personalize my lock screen, and it refuses to allow me to personalize it. Whenever I try to click on the options (Windows Spotlight, Picture, or Slideshow),
 it is as if it does not register. And it does not allow me to pick a photo. I was stuck with having to have the Windows Spotlight lock screens for about 2 weeks, but I decided to let it go and figured it will be fixed soon. But now just a week ago, my lock
 screen is now just black. It has the time and date and updates in my calendar and I can log in, (as I know there is this thing with the black screen of death going on), but I cannot change the lock screen no matter what I try. I try to click on Windows Spotlight
 and it just shows a loading sign. And then I click on Picture and it does nothing, along with the Slideshow. It shows a blank screen when I am in Settings, trying to Personalize the lock screen. This is very annoying and I have tried and tried to fix this
 but I don't know why it won't work. Somebody please help??? I will show you the screenshots so you understand what I mean., though I do not know how to screenshot the lock screen, but all I can say is it is just black with everything else normal. The screen
 is black, but the time and date and calendar updates are there, and so is my cursor, and I can log on and stuff, but it is just a black lock screen. Which is very annoying.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6080a0a2-a22d-4151-b7b1-323eb0e64bc7" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd00e734-16c0-4af5-bb63-2611feb0ce44" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb573cab-7e08-402d-a48d-fc80be629242" />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</strong> to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Update Drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following article and update all the drivers available.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">How

            Thank you, I thought I was the only one. I've searched over 15+ hours on Microsoft and Windows 10 Forums to try to fix this problem and even resorted to trying some Windows 8 Forums and NOTHING I try has worked. I'm not good at computers but I'm learning
 from this experience but as of right now I still have a black lock screen. It's very annoying and I wish someone would fix it &gt;...&lt;

            What do you mean "turn off"? Are you saying that your computer is stuck in Safe Mode and you can't get into Regular Mode? What do you mean "turned on accidentally"? Please clarify your situation so we can help you.

            I don't think it is "stuck" I just don't know how to return to the normal operation or get out of safe mode.

<p>One way it can get "stuck" in Safe Mode is via the "boot.ini" file.</p>
<p>After booting to Safe Mode, do&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "msconfig"<br />
Then click on the "Boot.ini" tab and clear the checkbox in front of "/SAFEBOOT".</p>

                    <p>dvd drives OEM notebook installed -disappeared from device manager. I looked for help on this site. a 2015 suggestion was to delete both A channels</p>
<p>
</p><p>and reboot.&nbsp; no results. proceeded to you tube suggestions but stopped at changing registration values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>decided to undo the win 10 upgrade, but still no dvd in device manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried something else, and plugged in a Dell usb portable dvd-rom. Re-booted and....tada&nbsp; The device manager&nbsp; reported&nbsp;<span> 2 Drives. I played a dvd in each of them ,removed the USB drive. Bravely left the same disc in the internal player ,rebooted
 the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The reboot was normal, The dvd disc showed up in file manager and a I played one selection. I stopped the computer overnight.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The following day, no dvd again and my USB drive trick did not bring my internal drive&nbsp; back.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;A commercial repair shop estimated a clean install may work,&nbsp; but questioned the economics of spending $200.00 on a3 yr old $500.00 pc.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows DVD player won&#39;t work after update</h2>
                    My computer installed some Windows 10 updates last week (on or about 3/15/2017) and now my Windows DVD player app no longer works. &nbsp;I can open the app, but it closes all by itself once I put a DVD in the drive and try to play it. &nbsp;Not sure what to do about
 it. &nbsp;Wondering if anyone else has had this problem and how it might be resolved.

            <p>Hello Miss Lucy Costa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an LG E400 smartphone which comes, as Hula_Baloo has stated, a USB lead. This lead is also used to re-charge the phones' battery. To move items from your phone to your PC and visa-versa you need software from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Richard suggests contact Verison to see what software is needed. I actually use LG PC Suite software. I'm not sure if this is the same for your phone, but Version will be able to tell you. I suggest you also ask where you can download it from because
 I had quite a job finding the LG PC Suite on the LG website.</p>

<h2>            Disabling &#8220;Service Host&#58; Delivery Optimization&#8221;</h2>
                    I live in a very wooded area and have an extreammly small bandwith. According to my task manager the only process passively taking up bandwith is this delivery optimization. Iâ€™ve already tried to stop througg the firewall and by disabling it under services.
 If anyone knows how i can stop it or at least control the time when it turns on and off that would be great. Thanks!&nbsp;

            Hello TheRealFran, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the instructions below:
<br />
<br />-Open Settings.
<br />-Click on Update and Security.
<br />-Under Windows Update, click Advanced Options in the right side of Window.
<br />-Under Updates from more than one place, Click on the Choose how updates are delivered and then move the slider to Off position, to disable Windows Update Delivery Optimization or WUDO.
<br />
<br />You may also refer to the link below for more information.

            Hi ThereAlFran,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor and will assist you. 
<br />
<br />1. Have you tried limited the amount of Bandwidth used in Advanced Options?
<br />Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Delivery Optimization &gt; Advanced Options
<br />
<br />2. Have you tried changing Active Hours for a time period when you're not using the device?
<br />
<br />3. In Deliviery Optimization you may also Uncheck the Option &gt; Allow downloads from other PCs.
<br />
<br />Pat

            Tried all of those but limiting the bandwidth. I can only lower it to 5% but that might be small enough to not cause problems.&nbsp;

            Hi  Nilanjan
<br />
<br />This might be a compatibility issue with your configuration and Windows 10 1809. I recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            <p>When I upgraded to Windows 10 my Samsung ML-2010 initially worked fine. However, after upgrading the driver to "Samsung Universal Print Driver 3" (via the&nbsp; Windows 10 recommendation) my 2010 lost the ability for duplex printing, selecting "toner save" via
 software, and turned it into a basic printer. Samsung Canada help chat suggested I wait for a new driver, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, if your ML-2010 is currently working OK do NOT install the "Universal Print Driver 3" for Windows 10, or your printer will lose some functionality.</p>

<p>
</p><p>.. be brave and sit tight!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem but here comes the solutions: Samsung recommends further drivers further down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the one I downloaded and installed - works! During the installation it recognises my ML-2010, just tick the box and relax!</p>

            Hi jmndotme,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Can you try to update Windows Defender Definition and see whether this persists. You can download the latest definition manually and update.
<br />
<br />Download the files (.exe) from below link and double click on them install.
<br />
<br />32 Bit - <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=121721&amp;arch=x86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=121721&amp;...</a>
<br />64  Bit - <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=121721&amp;arch=x64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=121721&amp;...</a>

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Thanks, Vijay!</p>
<p>I ran the 64-bit version in Offline mode. It finished without any error messages, nor could I find a log file. In fact, there seem to be no log files whatsoever now on my PC! Don't know how that happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those @ files are still there. However, the majority of them now have a green tick next to them. Some are duplicated, like the Store exe, both with green ticks. Should I leave them, or delete the non-@ one? (I am presuming the @ files are the latest files,
 but why they would have installed is a mystery.) It seems that running your downloaded file has set the active Rules to their default setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Advanced Security &gt; Monitoring &gt; Firewall and saw that only the files with the green tick, including the @ ones, showed up there. The rest, being the ones I will never use and had disabled, eg Groove Music etc, did not show up, of course. I will
 leave them in case I need them in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Security Center settings now are as they should be and my PC is protected. Thank you! ;)<br />

 a long time. Itâ€™s just a clan tag that people use in Battlefield games so they can be recognize by other posters from this forum. Itâ€™s NOT a clan, but a community. Even though we bulldoze the players on the other team. Go away, itâ€™s my crate or flag! Feel
 free to add this gamertag. You cannot be friends with all the people that post on this forum because of the friends limit. If you do add this tag, make sure you have your privacy settings to everyone. Mainly, your online status and messages. &nbsp;My gamertag is

<p>Hi! Thanks for the reply and also confirming that this problem isn't just on my end. I don't mean to seem rude, but it would be nice if Microsoft actually acknowledged this problem. Got Resident Evil HD on launch and I wanted to post lots of videos as I
 played, but now I can't.</p>

<p>Good job for finding that. This is pretty annoying - my favourite game and I can't share videos of it? The thing we need to figure out how is who's at fault; CAPCOM or Xbox LIVE. This needs to be fixed!

<p>Yep, same problem here. At first when I tried to snap a video it said that I either needed to insert a disc &nbsp; &nbsp; or start a game from hard drive. Leaving the menu and trying again it actually let me record a video. It renders the video just fine, but as it
 goes from rendering to sending I get the error (0x80040206).</p>
<p>Frustrating not being able to share videos from one of my favourite game of all time.
</p>
<p>EDIT: Posting this message gave me an error message on the first try as well. </p>

<p>It certainly is frustrating. Another thing I have noticed is that it is only saving the videos locally. Plus, as you say, the video will render perfectly but reveal the error message as it starts to upload it. I hope that once this is fixed, the videos we
 have already taken will work...</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Hippen-Queen,</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Verify iPod touch Driver/Service Installation</p>
<p>iPod touch requires two important pieces of software to operate properly on Windows. First, the driver must be installed; for iPod touch the driver is USBAAPL.SYS. Second, Apple Mobile Device Support must be installed as a Windows Service. If these are not
 installed, see the Reinstall iTunes section below.</p>
<p>Verify that the driver is installed by connecting iPod touch to the computer and following these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Start menu, click Run.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the Open field, type devmgmt.msc and click OK. A list of devices will be displayed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroll down to Universal Serial Bus controllers and click the small plus sign to expand this group. iPod touch will be listed as either Apple iPod touch or Apple Mobile Device depending on the version of the driver installed.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click Apple iPod touch (or Apple Mobile Device) and choose Properties from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Properties window opens, select the Driver tab.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Driver Details to view more information.</p>
<p>Verify that the Apple Mobile Device Service is installed and running using the Services MMC snap-in using these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Start menu, click Run.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Open field, type services.msc and click OK. A list of devices will be displayed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;View the list In alphabetical order and verify that the "Apple Mobile Device Service" status is "Started."</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the status does not indicate the service is started, right-click Apple Mobile Device Service and choose Start from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If the service is installed and started, right-click the service and choose Restart from the shortcut menu.</p>
<p>If the driver is installed and the service is installed and started, check the Event Viewer for error messages.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On the Start menu, click Run.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the Open field, type eventvwr.msc and click OK.</p>
<p>Reinstall iTunes</p>
<p>Make sure you are using latest version of using iTunes (9).&nbsp; You can check the version of iTunes you are using by choosing About iTunes from the Help menu. Visit the Apple Support download page to download and install the latest version or choose Help &gt;
 Check for Updates in iTunes.</p>

            Hi JTS6005, 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the VLC Player, it is fully featured and plays just about every media format there is . . .
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />If the DVD plays correctly in that app, then the 'Windows DVD Player' app is corrupt, if it does not, then the issue is more likely to be your Graphics card device driver . . .
<br />

            You don't have to delete it, but you can make VLC Player your go to. I use it to watch all my DVDs, works great. Glad you found it helpful.
<br />
<br />If you do want to delete it, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows DVD Player
<br />Select it then click Uninstall

            <p>This installation is counterfeit - unless you are a subscriber to Microsoft's MSDN or other similar services.</p>
<p>There are also signs that the the installation may have been tampered with in an attempt to bypass Activation and Validation requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the BIOS date, it's likely that this machine shipped with Windows 8 installed - is there a sticker on the case saying which version of Windows it's licensed for?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only way I could get it to work was to turn off the Windows Defender Domain Firewall. Both the Private and Public firewalls are still on.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Computer shows vertical lines after registering for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have a HP laptop with Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>after I read about being able to register for a Free Windows 10 upgrade, I checked if my laptop was and indeed it was eligible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I hit the register button and then even got an email that I was successfully registered to receive a windows 10 upgrade which will arrive in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>in the meantime, I had installed Adobe Reader updates and it asked me to reboot so I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now my computer won't start and just shows vertical colored lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what just happened? Is my laptop dead now and do I need to restore or is it installing Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>need urgent help!!</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Atul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description your computer won't start and just shows vertical colored lines and you are on Windows 8.1. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue could be due to the incorrect/incompatible graphics card drivers installed on the computer or</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> due to missing boot files\corrupt system files. I would suggest you to boot the computer/surface
 in a low resolution mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try below mentioned methods and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>If you are using any external keyboard, the trick is to hold the Shift button and mash the F8 key, this will
<em>sometimes</em> boot you into the new advanced â€œrecovery modeâ€,&nbsp; where you can choose to see
<strong>advanced repair options</strong>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You will need to click on the Troubleshoot option.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f511x500ximage32.png.pagespeed.ic.ftK7mUB1cE.png" height="500" width="511" /></p>
<p>Now select Advanced Options.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f509x500ximage33.png.pagespeed.ic.Ka8cTrg5bI.png" height="500" width="509" /></p>
<p>Now choose the Windows Startup Settings option, by the looks of things we were never meant to find Safe Mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x381ximage34.png.pagespeed.ic.J3Dk0QcKYa.png" height="381" width="650" /></p>
<p>Finally hit the Restart button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x347ximage35.png.pagespeed.ic.r7Sf0hLCRJ.png" height="347" width="650" /></p>
<p>Like magic, when your PC reboots you will be able to see Advanced Boot Options screen. Select the option Enable low-resolution video from the list by using down arrow key.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Ramesh.</p>
<p>i tried the Shift+F8 Method 1 but I do not get the menu you described. As soon as I reboot the machine, I see the vertical lines and no matter what I do, I cannot make any other words appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>still trying the other methods you mentioned..</p>
<p>Will let you know if anything works..</p>

            <p>The same here, Acer laptop, was not turnet on for some month, now decided to install windows 10 and did that Reservation, and also updated the 8.1 with latest updates what has been there in that month, after 8.1 updated it required the restart and after
 that now my screen shows only pattern with horisontal and vertical lines, so Method 1 is not applicable as I can see only that pattern on screen. Tried to put in Ubuntu from USB flash , but has no idea does it works, as again, on screen are only lines in one
 or another pattern. Will try to make USB with windows , but have no big hopes at the moment as I guess it again will only be those paterns.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>not yet. However one improvement I was able to make was to connect my home PC monitor to the laptop.</p>
<p>you might want to try it. At least you can work on the laptop and try to fix the display drivers etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>looks like my laptop itself is working when connected to an external monitor display. I tried to update the graphics drivers but it is not helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like my windows update service is also not working 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>am hoping the windows 10 upgrade will fix it all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I even cannot use external screen to see what is going on while on windows, there simply is no signal to external screen. As I cannot change boot order in bios without screen, my only option now is to open the laptop, diconnect hard drive, connect usb flash
 drive with Linux Ubuntu , tur on and after some time Ubuntu starts to run as a trial option and after that connected external monitor starts to get a signal and I can see that Ubunty trial is working from usb flash drive, but I cannot figure out what to do
 next and how to get Ubunty in hard drive so that atleast I can use notebook with external screen and try to fix drivers while on linux if its possible.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>just to complete this topic, I finally had to take my laptop in to the local Dr Cellphone repair folks who worked on it for a week and then finally fixed it.</p>
<p>their initial assessment was that the LCD screen had to be replaced but then they ended finding that they had to simply clean the internal connections, atul least that is what they told me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the laptop is back with me and has been working for about a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it might have been one of those freak coincidences that it stopped working when we subscribed for upgrading to Windows 10 as my company's desktop team said windows 10 should not technically break the screen. Also that HP screens did have quality problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways thanks to all those replied!!</p>

<h2>            Feedback Hub did not delete Windows Feedback successfully.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i understand that the Anniversary Update is introducing the "Feedback Hub", which is installed automatically, and discontinuing "Windows Feedback", which is supposed to be removed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, Feedback Hub was installed but Windows Feedback was not removed successfully. There are still remnants:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c87c182b-e8ab-47ae-9176-5936f01e6606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c87c182b-e8ab-47ae-9176-5936f01e6606" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The icon is gone, the app cannot be started or removed, it is just there and annoys me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I remove it? How can I reset the applist? What can I do to get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas are highly appreciated. Many thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Martin</p>

            <p>Hello Martin,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove the remaining unwanted files of the uninstalled apps by performing Disk Cleanup on drive C:\. Here is how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type "Disk Cleanup" on the <strong>Start</strong> search section and press <strong>
Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>2. Choose the drive <strong>(C:)</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Now, you are in <strong>Disk Cleanup for (C:)</strong>. You now have the option to select the files that you wanted to be cleaned up. We suggest you select all, but please be careful on selecting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>NOTE: This may also delete the files that might be important such as Temporary Internet Files (Cookies) and Downloaded Program files.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click OK. A pop-up will appear asking if you are sure. Just click Delete Files radio button to proceed.
</p>
<p>5. Allow it to finish and restart the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check if you can still see "Windows Feedback" on <strong>Start menu</strong>. If you can still see it, you can use the "<strong>Cleanup System Files"</strong> command button
<em>just below the Disk Cleanup window</em> and follow the same procedure above. </p>
<p>

    <title>How to safely disconnect USB hard drive on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billm508  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to safely disconnect USB hard drive on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a USB external hard drive connected to my Windows 7 laptop... everything was great until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There had always been a "safely disconnect" icon ("hidden", but easily found) in the Taskbar, which I'd click when I wanted to disconnect the hard drive, so it wouldn't disconnect in the middle of an I/O operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That icon has disappeared and I can't find it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it back?&nbsp; (This is relatively urgent, since I disconnect/reconnect the external drive fairly often, and of course I need to keep the filesystem intact!)</p>
<p />

<p>Are you seeing the 'Eject' option when you right click the drive in 'This PC/Computer'? When selected that should give you the 'safe to remove' prompt, but if this option is unavailable then we need to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Thanks, Ric.</p>

<p>No, not seeing that option (from, e.g., right-clicking on F: (the USB drive) in Windows Explorer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the icon back, however, so it's no longer an urgent issue... but even right-clicking on the icon doesn't *always* work.&nbsp; Sometimes, it acts like there's some existing data transfer in process, so it won't let me disconnect.</p>

<p>Hi again - yes I get the 'busy' alert when I go to disconnect sometimes... If that happens I usually just leave it until I have next shut down and try to remember to disconnect it then!</p>
<p>Glad it's no longer urgent at least... Cheers, R.</p>

<h2>            Using Windows 7, Dreamweaver MX crashes when selecting &#34;help&#34; or &#34;commands&#34; from top bar</h2>
                    I'm using Dreamweaver MX on Windows 7 machine. In Dreamweaver when I select the "help" or "command" options from the top of the screen, Dreamweaver crashes and shuts down. Anyone know of a solution?<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is not listed in Windows7 compatibility center; here is the link to check compatibility:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</strong></a></div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Install Macromedia Dreamweaver MX in Compatibility mode.</strong></div>
<div>However it is compatible with windows XP.<br />
So, I would suggest you to try running it in Windows XP service pack2 compatibility mode and check if it works, here is the link:<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> If this doesnâ€™t help, then yes you can install Windows XP mode and check if it helps, here is the link:</div>
<div><strong>Install and use Windows XP Mode in Windows 7:<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Clean Boot Mode</strong></div>
<div>
<p><span>I would recommend you to place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
