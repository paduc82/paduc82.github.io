review of the new Xbox 360 Dashboard update</a> this morning.</p>
<p>Here's what Mr. Whitten has to say:</p>
<pre>Dear Xbox LIVE Members, 

Today, we're launching a new Xbox 360 experience that connects you with your favorite entertainment and<br />games like never before and makes finding and enjoying entertainment as simple as it should be. 

It's a vision we shared at E3 and I'd like to thank you for all of your valuable feedback along this incredible ride<br />and share a little more about what we have in store this holiday - from Beacons, cloud storage and Facebook sharing, to our latest entertainment offerings. 

Building upon our great lineup of partners, we've teamed up with nearly 40 of the world's leading TV &amp;<br />entertainment providers to bring you an array of live and on-demand TV, movies, games, sports and music experiences. <br />The first wave of new partners rolls out today with experiences like EPIX and TODAY (MSNBC) in the US, <br />LOVEFiLM in the UK, Sky Go in Germany, Premium Play by (MediaSet) in Italy and Telefonica España - Movistar Imagenio in Spain.<br />And we'll continue to roll out more entertainment content to Xbox LIVE in the coming months. 

Beyond entertainment, you'll find a number of features designed to make your Xbox experience more personal, social and effortless.<br />The dashboard has an entirely new look and feel and a completely reimagined interface that makes your entertainment accessible<br />through simple voice commands. Now, using voice search with Bing on Xbox,<br />you can find and play the programming you want across multiple entertainment providers without having to search for a remote control.<br />&nbsp;In the mood for 'The Office?' Just say "Xbox, Bing, 'The Office,'" and Xbox will display all episodes available from various entertainment apps across the console. 

We're also bringing you Beacons and Facebook sharing, further integrating social into your Xbox experience.<br />&nbsp;Before jumping into an episode of 'The Office,' you can activate a Beacon to let your friends know that you want to play,<br />say, "Gears of War 3." Then, sit back and relax with the Dunder Mifflin crew.<br />&nbsp;The Beacon will let you know when a LIVE friend is available for a round of Horde in Gears.<br />After the game, use Facebook Sharing to tout your achievements and showcase your in-game accomplishments through direct posts. 

While we're proud of our capability to connect you remotely to the global community of more than 35 million Xbox LIVE members,<br />sometimes there's nothing like being with your friends and family. And so we've added cloud storage so you can<br />access game saves and your LIVE profile, including achievements, from your friends' consoles as well. 

Lastly, with the ever-expanding library of content available, we realize Xbox is enjoyed by all members of the family.<br />Rest assured that our parental controls have improved in parallel with this new content.<br />Parents can manage their child's console activity, sharing on social networking sites as well as regulate access to games,<br />movies, television, and music. Additionally, the update brings enhanced navigation to Xbox 360 Family Settings to better integrate with Kinect. 

We strive to continually innovate and bring meaningful experiences to each and every member of the Xbox LIVE community.<br />Currently, our community is already enjoying 2.1 billion hours of entertainment each month. We imagine this number will only continue to grow<br />as you discover enhanced entertainment on Xbox this holiday that is instantly searchable, easily discoverable and enjoyable in extraordinary new ways.<br />We hope you enjoy this new chapter in the evolution of Xbox and continue to push us to write the next. <br /><a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/328426/xbox-360-dashboard-update-microsoft-writes-letter-to-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />http://www.computerandvideogames.com/328426/xbox-360-dashboard-update-microsoft-writes-letter-to-community/</a><br /><br /></pre>

<p>Have to say, really unimpressed with a lot of the new "features" of the dashboard, I mean bing...never going to use it on the console for anything, the social stuff with beacons...hell a message over live does the same job as well as knowing what my usual
 party chat peeps are playing anyway. <br />
<br />
The new Media streaming stuff is just a natural progression really so...yeah, it is what it is but...still a bit meh, a bit too "MS had a focus group with ten people and two of them said we liked the idea" so they ran with it</p>

            You do not format any CD-R,&nbsp; DVD+R or DVD-R disks.&nbsp; These are&nbsp; "write once" media and any formatting done on these, before you write the info to the media, will make the disk un-usable.<br />

<h2>            How do I stop my screen from going black after about 3 minutes of not touching it&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried changing the sleep settings but that doesn't seem to work. When I am watching a video or something and I am not touching my screen it goes black after about 2 or 3 minutes and the video stops. Then when I touch the pad it comes back on again?
 (I have a windows 8.1 and it is just a laptop, not a touch screen). Thanks .

            <p>Well there should be a option to change when the display turns off (seems like you tried that, it's with the sleep settings). But if for some reason that's not working there is always this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.pcworld.com/article/232225/mouse_jiggler.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>a little a program to keep your mouse active so your display doesn't go off.</p>

<h2>            Help with Code 43 on WIndows 8 for USB Controller</h2>
                    <p>Hello. We installed Windows 8 and since then USB ports have not worked. I ran the trouble shooter and the message is that Windows has stopped running the Intel(R) 82801 FB/FBM USB Universal Host Controller (code 43). The issue only shows as detected with
 no solutions. Ideas?</p>

<h2>            Follow up on filed complaint through xbox live</h2>
                    I am interested in following up on the status of a complaint I filed through xbox live regarding a player who was somehow able to disrupt my internet connectivity because he was upset about an online game.&nbsp; I have been able to restore my internet access
 but I would like to pursue this as far as I can.&nbsp; My ISP could not provide any information about where this came from.&nbsp; I would like to contact his ISP and speak with them about this.&nbsp; Denial of service attacks are illegal under the CFAA and I would like to
 pursue this.

<p>DOS or DDOS attacks are something that your ISP would need to assist you in investigating. Unfortunately many ISP's can't or won't put the effort in to investigate for you unless it is a wide scale attack impacting many of their customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happens again in future and you are technically inclined then you might be able to get information about the attack by using a network sniffer (eg WireShark).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've been on XBL for over ten years and I've never had anything like this occur.&nbsp; It is disheartening.&nbsp; I am not technologically inclined to the extent that I would be capable of doing my own counter intelligence on this type of thing.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>It is bad enough dealing with people that cheat in game but to be exposed to this sort of attack over xbox live is very poor.&nbsp; Sure would be nice to have a more secure platform, especially since I appear to be on my own in defending against this.</p>

<p>Xbox is only a middle man, so to say. Your public IP information can be obtained by anyone, to be frank with you. You could be on Facebook, someone can get your IP and then DDOS you, but Facebook isn't responsible for seeking justice with you.</p>

<p>Hi Reactive,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps auto update in the store but can be removed or added at anytime. As stated above by Njal, it only seems to be available on Xbox One and PC and was likely removed from the Xbox 360 app marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now TV customer support may be able to give you more information on the apps current availability for Xbox 360.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Internet Explorer Update to Version 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Downloaded and installed from Windows IMPORTANT update INTERNET EXPLORER 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC had Windows 7 64 bit AND WINDOWS 7 32 BIT Internet Explorer 9.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After "Successful" install I no longer have the Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I nervously did a restore back to original IE 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possibly the new IE 10 covers both 32 bit and 63 bit.&nbsp; How would I know this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any answers would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Internet Explorer 10 contains both 32 and 64 bit versions,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default, when started, runs the 64 bit version as the base and each tab runs the 32 bit version to allow most add-ins to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to run the 64 bit version in all the tabs you must go to tools (Gear in tool bar),&nbsp;<strong>internet options</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and under the advanced tab, down by Security,&nbsp;check&nbsp;<strong>Enable Enhanced Protected Mode.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To go back to 32 bit, you must uncheck this option.</p>

            <p>Hello Jaya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better:
</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></li><li><span>Are you getting this message "</span>CHKDSK is veryfying indexes<span>"?</span></li><li><span>When exactly are you getting the message?</span><br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run check disk from Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To boot into Windows Recovery Environment, refer to the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</span></a><br />
Note: Expand “To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer” in the above article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When at the system recovery options, select Command Prompt from the list of tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> While at the command prompt, type the following commands and press enter after each command.</p>
<p><strong>chkdsk /f/r</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>

    <title>OneDrive Camera Roll Missing From File Explorer in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj carlson  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive Camera Roll Missing From File Explorer in Windows 10</h2>
                    I just discovered that my Camera Roll from OneDrive is not available in File Explorer on my Windows 10 PC with confirmation from Microsoft Tech Support. &nbsp;Does anyone know a workaround for this? &nbsp;It means that if I want these easily available on my PC I
 need to download them to a folder on my visible OneDrive, effectively duplicating them. &nbsp;Thanks for any help.

 it is a folder that gets synced to your pc automatically.&nbsp; Click OK to save and you should see that folder now under C:\Users\<em>your name</em>\OneDrive\Pictures\Camera Roll</p>

            Be careful with this. If you have a convertible or tablet with anything less than 256gb, the cameral roll&nbsp;sync will quickly consume a huge amount of space on your hard drive. OneDrive in Windows 10 does not keep files in the cloud like it did in Windows
 8.1. It&nbsp;downloads each and every one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I did not find it in the Pictures folder, possibly as I already had a Pictures folder prior to moving to Windows 10. &nbsp;I changed Save Locations in System/Storage to put new PC pictures on OneDrive and I changed OneDrive to save screenshots to OneDrive.
 &nbsp;This caused a folder of mine named Old Photos to be renamed to Pictures (giving me 2 folders with the same name, one with a different folder picture in explorer) with the Camera Roll in it. The folder is stilled call Old Photos in the OneDrive Sync list of
 folders but it appears as Pictures in file explorer. &nbsp;The Camera Roll may have been in my Old Photos folder before and I had not noticed as I had not looked in that folder in sometime. &nbsp;With its new name, I looked and found it. &nbsp;How can I get the folder name
 to match everywhere? &nbsp;Can the Camera Roll folder be moved to the top level OneDrive directory safely? &nbsp;BTW, I renamed my old Pictures folder to another name so I would not be confused. &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>All that is possible, but it can be a little advanced.&nbsp; The screenshots and camera role folders on your PC are special.&nbsp; If you move where they go, it changes where new pictures captured
<em>from your PC</em> go there.&nbsp; But pictures you take on your phone will still go to the original Camera Roll folder inside the OneDrive\Pictures folder. It doesn't exactly cause duplication but it means you have two Camera Roll folders.&nbsp; Screenshots is similar.</p>

<p>

<p>The folder name might be being customized by a hidden "desktop.ini" file inside it.&nbsp; This is used often for the "My" folders as they used to be known "My Docs, My Pics, My Videos, etc".&nbsp; When you browse from a network, it would automatically replace it with
 names like "Shawn's Docs, Shawn's Pics..".&nbsp; Very fancy, but it causes confusions like these, and is especially true if the folder is or was redirected into the OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example.&nbsp; So if your C:\Users\Name\Pictures folder is being redirected into C:\Users\Name\OneDrive\Old

<p>
</p><p>I see that Pictures in OneDrive is a special folder that is redirected to Old Photos. &nbsp;When I try to change the Location tab target back to the default it gives me an error saying Access is denied, the folder can't be moved here (I say do not copy files

            <p>Wow my reply got cut for sure, there was also an image or two.&nbsp; Hmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I think at this point easiest way to fix it involves a quick registry edit. Standard disclaimer: don't do unknown stuff in the registry.&nbsp; Luckily this one is easy, it sounds quite similar to an issue I had at work when my Shell:Favorites folder was
 nested inside my Documents folder. Usually if you are trying to set one special folder into another it will give a warning about how they can't be separated, but that's not really the whole truth.&nbsp; You can come here to fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're comfortable continuing, open Registry Editor and go to this path:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once there, check the path value used for these special folders. &nbsp;If you do need to make any changes or corrections, I would recommend first choosing
<span>E</span>xport from the <span>F</span>ile menu, and saving a backup (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here for more information on registry backups</a>).
 You may also wish to set a System Restore point prior to making the change. &nbsp;I can tell you from my experience that I was able to modify these values and fix my system without ill-effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you've made all the necessary corrections, reboot your computer and see if the issue is resolved. &nbsp;Note, however, that this will fix the paths used, but will not actually move any files or folders: you'll still need to move anything stored
 in the wrong location back to the preferred folder.</p>

            Thanks. &nbsp;I changed My Pictures back to normal (%USERPROFILE%\Pictures) in regedit leaving the special names (key values) at the top of the list alone. &nbsp;Immediately after rebooting it appeared that nothing had happened but magic appeared before my eyes
 as file explorer corrected itself. &nbsp;

</p><p>Hello&nbsp;Fearless Rob 82,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Pre-orders are not eligible for MyVIP, and therefore not eligible for VIP Boost&nbsp;offer. This is mentioned in both our MyVIP&nbsp;FAQ:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What content on the Xbox Store is eligible for MyVIP?</b></p>
<p>Normally, most purchases for Xbox 360 and Xbox One from the Xbox Store qualify, including full Games on Demand titles (excluding game pre-orders), arcade games, indie games, game add-ons, game Season Passes, movies, TV shows, TV seasons, themes and avatar items. In-game consumables, Xbox Live Gold memberships, Groove Music Passes, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV Season Passes, and the purchase or redemption of Microsoft Points or Xbox Gift Cards, still do not qualify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the FAQ&nbsp;for the offer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Which content is eligible for this offer?</b></p>
<p>You must spend at least $XX before tax on qualifying MyVIP content from the Xbox Store and Microsoft Movies &amp; TV during the offer period. Most purchases for Xbox 360 and Xbox One from the Xbox Store qualify, including full Games on Demand titles (game pre-orders do NOT qualify), arcade games, indie games, game add-ons, game season passes, themes, and avatar items. From Microsoft Movies &amp; TV, qualifying content includes movies, TV shows, and TV seasons. However, in-game consumables, Xbox Live Gold memberships, Groove Music Passes, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV Season Passes, and the purchase or redemption of Microsoft Points or Xbox Gift Cards do not qualify.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since your purchases since November (with the exception of your Rainbow Six Siege Pass) have all been pre-orders, they have not awarded payback. Since your purchases in February were pre-orders (except the Siege Pass), you did not complete the VIP&nbsp;Boost offer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding your wife's VIP&nbsp;Payback, without having her gamertag, we cannot provide a thorough investigation. However, it sounds like you are expecting payback early. From our FAQ:</p>
<p><b>When will my MyVIP Rewards Credits be deposited into my Microsoft account?</b>
</p>
<p>The total Rewards earned will be calculated at the end of each month. Typically you'll receive your MyVIP earnings in your account by the 15th of the following month, though this is subject to the program's current deposit
<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms</a>. Be sure to keep an eye on MyStatement on the
<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyRewards</a> page to track your progress and watch your Rewards Credits total grow!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We only recently&nbsp;calculated last month's MyVIP, so you may have missed this Credit event.</p>

<h2>            My screen brightness is completely stuck.</h2>
                    <p>A few days after installing Windows 10 on my HP pavilion G6 laptop, I noticed my screen brightness wasn't changing. After some testing, I realised the hot keys weren't changing the brightness as well as going on settings. Even though it is stuck on full
 brightness, when I click on the battery icon on the task bar, it says 0% brightness. Has anyone else had brightness problems too and/or can you help fix this. Thank you for any contributions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to Update display/graphics drivers for Windows 10 from device Manufacture's website and check if it helps. Moreover if you find the option is working fine with previous OS, then
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

            I couldn't do exactly what you said, but I gave it a try. I installed a windows 8.1 driver instead of windows 10 driver because it said the driver was installed during the upgrade and didn't allow me to install it. It hasn't worked and so I'm still stuck.
 But thank you for trying to help.

<div>yeah, you really can’t delete the graphical overlay.&nbsp; it needs to be uninstalled so that it can reinstate the previous versions of the system files, like explorer.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>if possible boot up to safe mode via the f8 key.</div>

<div>then once logged in, you can execute the system restore feature and restore the system to a date before the unstable software installation.</div>

<div>
<div>I’m not familiar with the extension.&nbsp; however, when desktop overlays are installed, they usually rename the genuine system files before substituting them with the custom one.&nbsp; so I am not sure if the explorer.scf is the copy of the genuine explorer.exe
 or the customized version for that overlay.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>also, if I recall, the desktop overlays usually create copies of all the original system files they replaced and placed them inside a special folder.&nbsp; but you would have to research this at that programs home site.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>you might try to rename explorer.scf to explorer.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>but there may be other system files with that scf extension that need to be restored.</div>

<div>incidentally, if renaming the explorer.scf file proved futile, then rename it back or execute a system restore point.</div>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Open GL for old intel chipset.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Recently i got a new computer for school and it is very old. Lenovo X200 and as in school i need newer programs i upraded it to Windows 10 which runs fine but I have an problem with OpenGl. I can't get version 2.1 as i need it for 3D printing software, but
 I saw some discussions that it is compatible with my laptops hardware. So my question is - Is there any way i can get OpenGl 2.1 or newer for my laptop or no ?</p>
<p>My chipset is Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Chipset Family with WDDM 1.1</p>
<p>If you need any more specs just ask.</p>
<p>Thanks and sorry for bad english.</p>

            Yes, it is not. But I really need to fix this issue and I know it is possible to one point not to end. I am asking for some drivers that were made for windows 8 and they are working for windows 10. I know there are some, but i cant find them.

<h2>            USB 3.0 MicroSD&#47;SD Card Reader keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; I'm having in issue with a&nbsp;Sabrent USB 3.0 MicroSD/SD Card Reader.&nbsp; Once plugged in, it constantly connects and disconnects.&nbsp; I can't get any data off of it since it won't stay connected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In my device manager, I see three things under USB controllers:</p>
<p>-Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtesible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)</p>
<p>-USB Mass Storage Device</p>
<p>-USB Mass Storage Device</p>
<p>-USB Root Hub (USB(3.0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an issue specifically with usb 3.0 devices?&nbsp; I can't figure out what the issue is.&nbsp; My first guess would be that this is a voltage issue?&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            MSN Weather - Live Tile Is Broken</h2>
                    <p>I've clean installed several PCs this week and found the same issue on all of them both 1803 &amp; 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Weather live tile is currently not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer is first booted, it displays the weather information for London which is the default. When I launch the app it shows my correct location but then the live tile goes blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am signed in with a Microsoft Account but the issue affects other users too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a glitch with the latest version of the Weather app as it affects both 1803 &amp; 1809 the same way.&nbsp;</p>

            The issue seems to have been solved by the Cumulative Update just distributed today. Once the Computer has installed the Update (new start is required) clicking on the Tile, the App opens. Closing it, the current location appears in the tile and the tile
 remains live (at least this is the behavior on two PCs where I just made the update).&nbsp;
