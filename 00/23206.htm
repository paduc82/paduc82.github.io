<h2>            Get NDR from deleted users</h2>
                    <p>We had two users permanently deleted from O365 for more than half a year. They also used to be members of one specific DL but got deleted later. Last week our CEO sent a mail to this DL but got two NDRs from these two non-existed "users".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked if any transport or forwarding rules which are related to these two users but got no such results.</p>
<p>I also tried doing message trace, got below results:</p>

            <p>Hi Equilibrium86,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the information in PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, about the group issue you mentioned, according to the mail header in the NDR you provided, it seems the email is not sent to the distribution group directly, instead it‚Äôs sent to several recipients. Can you please confirm if the sender was
 sending the message to the group alias created in Exchange Admin Center or to a personal contact group created by the sender him/herself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, even though the message is sent to many recipients directly, if the specific users are deleted from Office 365 and on-premises already, the NDR message should be recipient not found or address rejected. Therefore, to check if the specific recipients
 still exist in Office 365 or on-premises, please perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your on-premises Exchange server, open the Exchange management Shell.</li><li>Then type <strong><em>Get-recipient | where {$_.emailaddresses&nbsp; -match&nbsp; ‚Äú<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>‚Äù} | fl RecipientType,name,emailaddresses
</em></strong>in PowerShell (please change the email address to the problematic one), then check if &nbsp;any results return. If so, please locate the user using the information in PowerShell results and remove/delete the user.</li></ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. After that, force a sync on the AAD sync server by referring to:&nbsp; <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rmilne/2014/10/01/how-to-run-manual-dirsync-azure-active-directory-sync-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rmilne/2014/10/01/how-to-run-manual-dirsync-azure-active-directory-sync-updates/</a> and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo Yu</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in the community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to clarify first on what option you have selected when you deleted the group as there is no current options to delete it, only to "<strong>Delete the Conversation"</strong> or "<strong>Leave Group"</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have <strong>deleted the conversation</strong> of the group you created, it will only show up again when one member of the conversation send a message. Otherwise, if you
<strong>left the group conversation</strong>, there is no option to remove the members unless they add you again to the group.

<h2>            Downgrade from Office 365 Personal 2016 to 2013</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am using Office 365, and the last time I went to my account and download Office, it's 2016 version. The problem is it does not work with MathType, and I really need MathType to do my homework in university.</p>
<p>I've make some research on this forum but I can only find the link to download Office 365 Home and&nbsp;Office 365 ProPlus, not for the Personal one.</p>
<p>So, can you please tell me how can I install Office 2013 with my Office 365 Personal account?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you very much</p>

            The safe way to set up multilevel lists requires that you make use of paragraph styles. See&nbsp;<a href="https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>

<h2>            Account has been locked</h2>
                    <p>I opened my account three days ago, I verified the recovery email and all that.</p>
<p>I have sent 5 emails with no problems whatsoever. I have also received 5 emails no problem</p>
<p>But today I tried to send an email and I keep getting this message</p>
<p>"Please verify your account. We've noticed some unusual activity in your Outlook.com account. To help protect you, we've temporarily blocked your account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>then there are teo buttons one says Verify the other says cancel. I clicked verify. It opens a new browser there its asking me for my home, work, and cell numbers. the next line its asking for my social security number, the next line its asking for my state
 driver's license, the next line is asking for my birthdate, the last line is asking for my credit card and bank account and routing numbers. if I don't give this information I can't use outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM NO FOOL, I will never give any of this information to an email nor any other service. the address on the other page is a Microsoft URL and its https protected I checked the certificate and it belongs to Microsoft it expires in 2018 it was issued 2013.</p>
<p>If I can't get this stupid lockout removed then I guess i'll have to go back to Google Mail aka: Gmail</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway I do not have a cell phone , or a cordless phone. They both are a huge security risk and people believe they are secure they are not secure at all not one single bit. the digital age has made it even easier for your info to get into the wrong hands</p>
<p>I can get a programmable radio scanner and listen to any cell phone within a 20 mile radius when you push your number buttons it displays the numbers you are pushing. this type of radio can be bought for under $100 at most electronic store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway can someone&nbsp;PLEASE tell me how to get my account unlocked so I can send and receive my emails using my outlook com account?</p>

    <title>Merging Skyp Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chriswoodhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging Skyp Accounts</h2>
                    <p>I've had a Skype account with a Skype userid for many years. &nbsp;Now I have a Microsoft Live account, I have a separate Skype account associated with that Microsoft Live account. &nbsp;I don't use this Skype account however as I have a lot of contacts who know and
 use my old Skype ID. &nbsp;I would like to merge these two Skype accounts for two reasons...</p>
<p>(A) I'd like my contacts to be able to continue to use my old Skype ID, but still be able to access that account from my Microsoft Live account. &nbsp;I leave myself logged in to my Microsoft Live account on my web browser on my computer. &nbsp;This means it is tedious
 to manage my older account as I have to log out of Microsoft Live and log in to my older Skype account. &nbsp;Once I've done what I need, I then have to log out of Skype and log back in to my Microsoft Live account.</p>

            From within Word, you don't, really: you can use File-&gt;SaveAs... To save a new copy of the file under a new name, but then you will also need to go into your Mac's Finder to locate and delete the old file.
<div><br />
<div>The other way to do it is in Finder. Ensure the Word file is closed, locate and select it in Finder, then either right-click and use the rename option, or click the name so it becomes editable, and modify it directly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One advantage of the former approach is that the new file ends up in Word's "recently used files" list, so it's simpler to re-open if you use it again in the near future.</div>

<p>AFIK, you no longer can view pictures in draft view, in Word 2007 and 2010 in DOCX format files. Apparently you can stil see them in the new programs if you use 2003 DOC format files. I found this link using Word Help:</p>

                    Hi. My device Microsoft Lumia 650 appears a message that says that the memory is full. It seems that the system use 10.6 GB of the memory instead of 5.3 that it used to use some time ago. I cannot find a reason why. There is nothing new happened in the
 phone. The battery needs always to be charged at the time. What can I do for it?

 itself up after I synced my contacts. My friend is moving out of the country in a few days, and we were practicing doing video calls on my new Dell. She called me first, and she was already a contact. I did not know how to answer the call because I had no
 notification buttons on my open Skype screen. I managed to disconnect the call, and she called me back. This time, there was a notification box at the lower right and had the answering options of audio or video. I picked video and we connected. She saw me
 on her end, and she also saw herself in the little box in the corner...so that must mean her camera was working. On my end, I saw myself in the little corner box, but I never saw her...just her avatar in the center of the screen. Our aud

            I replied via outlook and received a delivery failure to Hotmail, so I am replying here. I have a windows10 laptop using Microsoft Edge browser and open Outlook to view mail.&nbsp; When I open up an email and pass cursor over an advertisement,&nbsp; a popup appears
 with the link address and actual code for the link.&nbsp; After passing cursor over the object, the popup disappears.&nbsp; It is very annoying to keep seeing the link code popup appear when moving cursor over objects.&nbsp; Screenshot attached.&nbsp; Thanks Again.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52e98bdb-996b-42dd-88a3-ff5db6cf65e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52e98bdb-996b-42dd-88a3-ff5db6cf65e7" /></a>

            I used an app called Smart Switch that saved all the info on my Samsung phone. Then you do a factory reset. Once the phone is "reset" you can rebuild your data from Smart Switch choosing the info you want. I now regularly back up my phone.&nbsp;

<h3> leahjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create Training Manuals in OneNote</h2>
                    We want to move our training manuals into OneNote. Trainees should not be able to edit course content. However, they need to be able to make notes on the material being presented.<br />
<br />
So far the snag is that If the material is "read only" they will not be able to take notes on the material. But if it is not "read only" they will be able to edit the core material.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to make read only core material with the capability of taking notes? The entire manual needs to be easily searchable.

            How about packing the notebook into a onepkg file and sending to them. They will open it locally and will be able to edit/take notes. This will not make any changes to the master copy.<br />
<br />
An alternative is linked note taking. They can dock a second OneNote window to the side and take their notes in there in a different possibly local notebook where they have write access to. Though most folks don't like this because you can only go from notes
 to content and not from content to notes.

<h2>            Excel 2013 xlsx documents crashing randomly without reason or trend.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a client who runs Office 2013 on Windows 7 Pro 64bit, this client uses multiple Excel '.xlsx' spreadsheets saved as templates for various jobs. They open these templates, enter their data and save it to a client folder. I'm not too familiar with
 the construction of these templates but they seem to have many cell formula's and links to external documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These documents were created on a previous version of Office as '.xls' but have been updated to '.xlsx'. Since updating to '.xlsx' our client experiences random Excel application crashes, it seems to relate only to '.xlsx' files but has no particular relation
 to any one document or part of a document. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My client had Excel crash on them twice in a row today when they entered data in a particular cell, they entered numbers into a specific cell and it crashed Excel, they re-opened the document, typed numbers into the same cell again and it crashed again (this
 cell has no formula's or external links to it, just a general cell) but when I arrived on site minutes later and attempted to replicate the crash by entering data into the exact same cell and document nothing happened!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a repair on MS Office 2013 and took a screen shot of the crashes event log (attached below) but this doesn't shed much light on the reason for the crash, I was hoping someone from Microsoft could help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've advised the client to let me know if it seems more stable since the repair but I'd still like to shed more light on the logs created by the crash, any advice would be much appreciated. Below is a text excerpt of the crash details.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the issue occur on multiple computers or specific user?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally repairing the Office 2013 installation should fix the issue, however if issue still persists, you may try the steps in the following article and check:</p>

</p><p>Yes the issue does occur on other PC's but not always the same file, the files are stored on a network drive. I will take a look through the information you have provided too.</p>

<p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue occurs on multiple PC‚Äôs with accessing Excel files on a network, you may also post your query in the Excel IT Pro forum. Refer to the following link to post your query:</p>

            <p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing a similar problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My configuration is:</p>
<p>Lenovo T530</p>
<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>MS Office 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symtoms:</p>
<p>1) A crash any time I worked on any XLS / XLSX file for more then three minutes or after performing more then 15 actions within the file.</p>
<p>2) Failure to open XLSX / XLS files from a remote drive mapped via Windows Explorer</p>
<p>3) Generally slow performance on Excel startup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other issues:</p>
<p>The Online-Repair of Office 2013 did not work (stalled with an error 30029-4)</p>
<p>The Offline-Repair did not help</p>
<p>MS Excel does work fine in safe mode (CTRL pressed during startup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the solutions provided by Microsoft in article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2758592/en-us worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions is quite strange, but works great:</p>
<p>Access Control Panel/System/Advanced System Settings/</p>
<p>Select tab "Advanced" and click button "Settings" in section "Performance"</p>
<p>Select tab Visual Effects and (this seems to be the surprising trouble maker) uncheck item "Enable desktop composition"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea, how this all is connected, but I can replicate the solution every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that helps some of you folks with the need to have your Add-Ins activated, maybe it helps the guys at MS to provide a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Fritze</p>

    <title>External users accessing shared mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> novice588  say:</h3>
<h2>            External users accessing shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone from our group wants an email account to be created for a single purpose of receiving emails from and sending emails to a customer's regulatory group. I was going to create a shared mailbox for him. However, he wants 2 external consultants to have
 access to this shared mailbox. These 2 consultants will occasionally access the emails and reply to the customer if necessary.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can create a shared mailbox that external users who are not in our group can access? Or does this mean I have to add a new email account which means a new monthly fee? Thanks.</p>
<p>

                    <p>This file appeared 3 days ago, it is impossible to remove. After deletion it reappears after reboot.</p>
<p>It seems to interfere with streaming music ( from Classics Online) and since the Boost file appeared my streaming music is now interrupted by loud running water sounds. These sounds are connected to a site myNoise.net and I cannot get any advice from them.
 There is no sign of an app&nbsp; for myNoise.</p>
<p>I wonder if Boost is promoting advertising for myNoise, since boost seems to be advert related.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Boost.Interprocess </strong>simplifies the use of common interprocess communication and synchronization mechanisms and offers a wide range of them:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>‚Ä¢ Shared memory. <br />
‚Ä¢ Memory-mapped files. <br />
‚Ä¢ Semaphores, mutexes, condition variables and upgradable mutex types to place them in shared memory and memory mapped files.
<br />
‚Ä¢ Named versions of those synchronization objects, similar to UNIX/Windows sem_open/CreateSemaphore API.
<br />
‚Ä¢ File locking. <br />
‚Ä¢ Relative pointers. <br />
‚Ä¢ Message queues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you to <strong>run Microsoft safety scanner </strong>
and check if this issue is caused by any virus or malware.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            This is (at least as I see it) more of a UI design glitch. You get the "Show all" view (showing all opened notebooks along with the sections of pages of the selected notebook) by clicking on the "&lt;" symbol to the left of the menu. This is only displayed if the "Show All" view is not active.
<br />
<br />I am quite confident that one of the next updates will clarify and fix the navigation view menu.

            If you can't do it with the QAT, you could potentially open a borderless popup form, positioned near there, with a text box displaying CurrentProject.FullName.&nbsp; I've tested this and it works in principle, but in practice it could be tricky to get and keep
 it positioned right.
