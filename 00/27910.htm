    <title>Visio 2016 Issue Using the Swimlane Master in a custom stencil - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visio 2016 Issue Using the Swimlane Master in a custom stencil</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom stencil that contains a swim lane master the I dragged from the cross functional flowchart Visio-provided stencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stencil and the usage of the swimlane master has worked well in MS Visio 2010 professional.&nbsp; When the LAN staff upgraded us to MS Visio 2016, using the master from my custom stencil stopped working.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, whenever a user attempts to drag
 the swimlane master from my custom stencil, Visio 2016 shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little trial and error research uncovered that if the Cross functional Flowchart stencil is open in my Visio document, dragging the swim lane master from my custom stencil works fine.&nbsp; MS Visio 2016 seems to require that the Cross functional flowchart
 stencil to be open in order to render the swim lane master, even though the swimlane master is being dragged from my custom stencil.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the Cross functional Flowchart stencil open seems to work consistently, however if a user of the Visio file closes the Cross functional Flowchart stencil, any attempt to drag the swim lane master from my custom stencil, will cause Visio 2016 to shutdown.&nbsp;
 I'm looking for a way to get the swim lane master to render successfully without the dependence on the Cross functional Flowchart stencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one that has experienced this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you copy the custom stencil shape from the working drawing which using the Cross functional Flowchart template to a new blank Visio drawing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, we are not sure if any properties for the custom stencil shape is blocked to prevent from other template using. If you can copy it to new blank drawing, I suggest we can save this custom shape as a new shape in a new custom stencil with Visio
 2016. Then drag the new saved one and confirm if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Let me try to explain the issue again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using MS Visio 2016.&nbsp; I had created a stencil&nbsp;of&nbsp;masters that I use often.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stencil includes&nbsp;modified masters from various Visio stencils and some&nbsp; masters that I created from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to
 include the Swimlane master from MS Visio in my custom stencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bring up the Flowchart -&gt; Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil that comes with MS Visio.&nbsp; I then drag the swimlane master from this Visio stencil onto the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I select my custom stencil of masters, right click it and select edit.&nbsp; At this
 point I drag the swimlane shape from the drawing onto my custom stencil and then save the custom stencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first everything looks great.&nbsp; I can drag this new swimlane master from my custom stencil and use it.&nbsp; The problem comes in when I close the Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil.&nbsp;&nbsp; With that stencil closed, every time I try to drag my swimlane&nbsp;master
 from my custom stencil, MS Visio shuts down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work fine in MS Visio 2010 Professional.&nbsp; Although in MS Visio 2010, every time I dragged the swimlane&nbsp;master from my custom stencil, Visio would automatically open the Flowchart -&gt; Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil, before it let me
 place the swimlane master onto the drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>This only became a problem in MS Visio 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like MS Visio 2016 does not &nbsp;automatically open the Flowchart -&gt; Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil, as it did in Visio 2010.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I need a way to use the swimlane master from my custom stencil
 without having to open the Flowchart -&gt; Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real concern for me because other people use my custom stencil and if they drag out the swimlane master with the Flowchart -&gt; Cross-Functional Flowchart Shapes stencil closed, MS Visio 2016 crashes, consistently.</p>

            Visio have some automation under&nbsp;Cross-Functional Flowchart Add-on (CFF or CFF14). This add-on can work
<strong>ONLY</strong> with original masters, which was created by MS.

            <p>First, let me apologize for taking so long to respond.&nbsp; I was off the grid on a Caribbean cruise for a week and am just getting back up to speed.&nbsp; My wife wouldn't let me get the WiFi option on the cruise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my excerpt may have misled you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to use a MS original master (swimlane).&nbsp; But, I am using it from my custom stencil.&nbsp; It is the original MS swimlane master.&nbsp; All I did was drag it onto my custom stencil so that it is along side my custom
 shapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MS Visio crashes every time I drag this MS original master (Swimlane) &nbsp;from my custom stencil, if the Cross Functional Flowchart&nbsp;stencil is not open as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the MS CFF stencil first, open my custom stencil next and then drag out the MS original master (swimlane), everything works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue is I don't want to have to direct a user to open the MS CFF stencil, just to prevent Visio from crashing.&nbsp;
 Is there a way to use the MS original swimlane master from a custom stencil?</p>

<p>I think, you can't ! Because build-in MS add-on CFF (or CFF14) can works ONLY with original masters from original stencil !&nbsp;</p>
<p>May be M$FT employeуs can advice ?</p>

            <p>I'm afraid you may be right.&nbsp; I only raised the issue because this used to work in Visio 2010 Professional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Visio 2010, the MS original swim lane master was saved onto my custom stencil.&nbsp; Whenever a user dragged out the MS original swim lane master from my custom stencil, Visio 2010 would permit the user to successfully drop the&nbsp;swim lane&nbsp;master onto the drawing&nbsp;and
 it would even automatically open the CFF stencil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This stopped working when we were upgraded to Visio 2016.&nbsp; Now, Visio 2016 just crashes when the user tries to drop the MS original swim lane master from my custom stencil.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no solution to this from MSFT, I will be forced to remove the MS original swim lane master from my custom stencil and direct my users to perform the extra step of opening the CFF stencil whenever they need to add a swim lane.&nbsp; It's not the end
 of the world, but it is a whole lot easier to get novice users up to speed if the masters they need are all on a single custom stencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            LUMIA 950 - Rs. 45K down the drain - feel cheated and let down</h2>
                    I preordered and got my L950 Dual SIM (black) in december from a microsoft store in chennai, India. Within two days of use the device got EXTREMELY HOT even with light use, assuming it to be a defective product i got it replaced with another new one from
 the store. but the same continued.. thought it was some software bug and microsoft's promise on updates to the W10 mobile will solve the issue.. but 3 updates, alas that still continues. I loved my L720 and its zeiss lens, hence bought this advanced phone
 and must say love the camera(sadly no panaroma)! off late too many crashes. See ppl the point is, i know you guys are big players in the technology biz and i for one believe in your product line and philosophy.. But then I have invested my hard earned money..
 L950 being a flagship feels like a crazy experiment.. I must say i'm truly,terribly let down and feel CHEATED buying the device,, it is unbecoming of a flagship device to crash so many times, to become so HOT and battery my god th

            <p>Hi. We understand where you're coming from. To address the phone being warm, try the below workarounds. For the battery issue, see:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/battery-saving-tips-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/battery-saving-tips-mobile</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your phone.</p>
<p>Try to minimize the apps and functions you are using at any one time.</p>
<p>Make sure your phone doesn’t have any pending software updates or app updates. If there are any pending app updates in the Store, complete or cancel them.</p>
<p>In most cases it is normal for your phone to feel warm, for example, when you are using multiple high-performing apps, listening to music for an extended time, when downloading extensive amounts of data or when your phone is charging.</p>
<p>Your phone meets manufacturer’s high standards for device safety and also meets the international standard for safety (IEC 60950-1) and country-specific requirements.</p>
<p>To avoid getting too warm and to protect itself, your phone may automatically slow down, close apps and, if necessary, switch itself off.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your 'stock reply' for phones getting 'warm' when i mean 'HOT'. I for one always update my phone to the latest builds hoping for better performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you haven't addressed the frequent crashes,<span>I have updated my phone to the
 latest anniversary update (OS build 10.0.14393.67). Now there is a new problem coming up -&nbsp;</span><span>the
 screen suddenly starts pixellating with yellow colour, then when I am operating it suddenly switches off and a strange screeching sounds comes from the phone which stops only when i pull out the battery.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Help me please(I preordered the phone back in 2015 at chennai, India). Currently
 I am in Dubai</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am feeling terrible for having bought this phone.</p>

            The last person to save the document is listed in the Last Author built-in document property. This pre-supposes that the last author in question accessed and saved the document using his or her own log-in data.<br />
<br />
An easy way to view the built-in document properties (and a load of other stuff) is to view the document with the variables etc editor from my web site -

<h2>            Cracked screen on Nokia limit 930</h2>
                    I dropped my phone face down on a very sharp rock whilst taking a close-up photo of a Bee (which then made me jump like an idiot!) The screen was really badly smashed but surprisingly it all still worked fine and it didn't prevent me from being able to
 read what was displayed. however my Son knocked my phone out of my hand a few weeks later and at first I kept seeing colourful lines across the screen and now it is all black! obviously it is now damaged on the second layer and I was wondering if anyone has
 had this kind of repair done on their phone and if it was actually successful? I know people who have paid £80 to repair an I-phone screen and found that it didn't fully fix the problem. I LOVE my phone and still have a year and a half of the contract left
 ( and no I didn't get insurance) but don't want to waste more money if it is completely beyond repair.&nbsp;

            Hi! We suggest sending your phone for repair to have it physically assess. Note that the process will delete all the files and settings saved in it. Expect charges as physical and liquid damage will void your device's warranty. You may visit this link:

            <p>Hi Jay,<br />
<br />
Generally, you can set up the UM via the button like the screenshot shows below. May I confirm whether you have done?<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Reminders - Annoying behavior</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to get the reminders to simply put up a dialogue box along with&nbsp;an alert in the&nbsp;tray&nbsp;and not pop up on the screen in front of whatever you're doing at the time? I find this very annoying. I've searched through options and didn't find anything
 that changed this...&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks</p>

Sadly for you MS appears to have listened to the complaints about that behaviour in 2010 and reverted to the 2007 and previous altert method.

            &lt;SIGH&gt; Yes, it appears that way... Would it be too hard to have an option that set reminders to 'Always on Top' or not? It looks like I'll have to wait two Office versions&nbsp;(Office 2019?)&nbsp;until it changes back.&nbsp;&lt;G&gt;

            <p>Hello EdK11,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thnaks very much for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sounds very much like a hardware issue. Maybe there is something wrong with microphone.</p>
<p>I would therefore suggest to contact the vendor or your Mobile Operator to get a replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>Dear Recoiln8, Welcome to the Nokia Forums!<br />
<br />
We appreciate your feedback and suggestions on further improvements to the Symbian platform, however it would be best to raise your concerns with at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">developer site</a> where
 your suggestions will be seen by the development team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As MX Video app is specifically for Android im afraid it is up to the developers to develop the app for Symbian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any particular video files types that you are trying to play on your device that are not working?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to hear back from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>some email not received at outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> permutations  say:</h3>
<h2>            some email not received at outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Questions about email not being received have been posted before, and the responses from Microsoft have all been canned and unhelpful. There's a problem on the Outlook.com server, it's been there for years, and I wonder if it's possible to get someone at
 Microsoft to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people have described not receiving forwarded email. I have that problem, too, but I just discovered that it's not just forwarded email. Sometimes email sent directly to an outlook.com email address is not received. But it's intermittent - sometimes
 it's received and sometimes not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not related to the sending domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not related to forwarding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a whitelisting problem: (1) all my sender addresses are whitelisted, and (2) the mail is not in my junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's either a prefilter at Outlook.com that discards emails incorrectly identified as spam BEFORE they even get to the Junk mail folder. Or there is a major bug in the mail set up and some email is lost for no reason at all. Whatever it is, Microsoft needs
 to fix this!!!! In a competent software company, there is a way to report bugs, and the developers care and fix the bugs. That no longer seems to be the case at Microsoft. I wish someone would prove me wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I know I'm right about the nature of the problem? Because I have a PHP program that demonstrates it. A handcoded page on my site sends email to me when people respond to a poll. The mail is sent to an account that is forwarded to outlook.com. It used
 to reach me at outlook.com, but no longer does. I created a small test program that does nothing but send email. It works - the email is forwarded. But the exact same code in the poll does not appear on outlook.com. When I change the setting on the forwarded
 account to leave messages on the server, I can see that the poll program is sending mail just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not a forwarding issue. When I change the send-to address to a MICROSOFT OUTLOOK ADDRESS, it still never arrives at Outlook.com. Outlook.com is rejecting this email, whether it's forwarded or sent directly. I know it's not my program because it
 arrives just fine at my POP3 server. And I know some mail sent in this way arrives at Outlook.com because of my test program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way I know that my email lis configured correctly is that I cc:'d&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which autoresponds with a diagnosis of your mail setup. Mine passes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This experiment proves that the mail never received at Outlook.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is not being sent incorrectly.</p>
<p>- Is unrelated to forwarding.</p>
<p>- Is unrelated to the junk mail filtering available to end-users at outlook.com.</p>
<p>- Is unrelated to the sending domain.</p>
<p>- Is intermittent - perhaps random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the chances that I will not get one of those useless canned responses from Microsoft personnel here that shows this email was not even read? Is there anyone at Microsoft with enough intelligence to understand the problem, and who actually cares
 enough that there's major problem in an important Microsoft product to do something about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last note: I tried changing my setup so Outlook.com polled my POP3 servers rather than forwarding my email, but Microsoft has stupidly decided not to apply spam filtering to polled email, so that is an unacceptable solution. There have been many complaints
 here about no spam filtering for POP3 email going back 2 years, but Microsoft has done nothing to fix it.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Bhanusekhar,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open an Administrator CMD window.&nbsp; If you can’t find a way, use these steps:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Press CTRL+Shift+ESC to open Task Manager. </span></li><li><span>Click File &gt; Run New Task </span></li><li><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
</span></li><li><span>Type CMD</span> </li></ol>
</li><li><span>Type the following commands at the CMD prompt: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(155, 0, 211, 1)">sfc /scannnow</span></span></span> </li><li><span><strong>If EITHER command does not show a good outcome</strong>, we need to stop and repair Windows. We have 3 options:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Go Back: If there are other significant issues, or if the customer is not sure of using Windows 10, Go Back. The plan from there will be to clean up the configuration to prepare for an upgrade.
</span></li><li><span>Reset: If possible, remove Antivirus/Sec Software and perform a Reset (keeping data and settings). Customers will need to reinstall apps with this option.
</span></li><li><span>In-Place Upgrade: If the customer is unwilling, we can try uninstalling the Antivirus/Sec Software and try an in-place upgrade. We should set expectation.
</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If the above commands both completed and show no remaining issues, run these commands:
<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">powershell<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(155, 0, 211, 1)">Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></span></span>
</li><li><span>Check to be sure this command ran, showed a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be an larger problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; Try again.
</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Check to see if the issue is resolved. </span>
<ol>
<li><span>If not, restart the PC. </span><span>In this case try as a new administrator user account.
</span></li><li><span>If the new user also fails, go up to the steps for “3. If EITHER command does not show…” above. We need to repair Windows.
</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>VBA for Importing rearranged tables from Microsoft Excel into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA for Importing rearranged tables from Microsoft Excel into Microsoft Access</h2>
                    <p><em>Hi, </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to import an excel file into Microsoft Access. I have multiple tables in Access, and I want to import just the columns I need from the excel&nbsp;spreadsheet&nbsp;to the specific table in a different column order that it was in excel. What VBA code can I write
 for that rearrangement and selection of specific columns from the excel to access import? Also, if I am doing this process over and over, is there a way to create a button that do all the process for the front-end user in a multi-user database form?
</p>
<p>I also would like to know how to write code for exporting data to Excel. I want to send the data in a specific order, and only the data I want. How can I manipulate that export from Access to Excell.
</p>
<p>Are there more tools for the import and export? Or just writing VBA code should perform my requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Angel</p>

<p>I am just talking when importing data from Excel to a table in Access. Let say the excel has 5 columns, A-E, then the table I want to import the data has three columns and I want them in the order: C, A, D.

            You can have a button that runs a macro that runs import and append functions.

    <title>Word 2016 preview &#34;hangs&#34; when simply selecting text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidekelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 preview &#34;hangs&#34; when simply selecting text</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just installed the 15.10.0 update to Office 2016 for Mac Preview. I've tried every Preview release so far and keep having a problem with Word. If I load ANY Word document - and I've tried everything from a couple of pages to 544 pages - and then simply
 try to select some text by dragging my mouse across it, Word becomes unresponsive and I get the dreaded spinning coloured beachball. I also get sections of text flashing in the areas between Word's page display and the boundaries of Word's window (i.e. I have
 Word in Page View mode and the page display doesn't fill Word's entire window - the text flashes in the areas on both sides of the page display, within Word's window boundaries).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word continues to do this for a few minutes and then eventually highlights the selected text. I've tried everything I can think of to fix this, but nothing works. Word is totally unusable like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used Word's built-in reporting mechanism to report this to Microsoft - I've done so with EVERY Preview release, and have (somewhat optimistically) included my email address, but no-one responds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Office for Mac 2011 installed since, well, 2011, and its version of Word still works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this problem? - I haven't seen any other reports of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions of how I can fix this (without killing some preference file that will also muck up my Word 2011 installation)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thanks Marcus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating a new "test" account but the problem still occurs. Word 2016 Preview is still unresponsive when trying to select text in a newly-opened document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did notice - and found the same behaviour back in my normal user account - is that after about 2-3 minutes, when Word has become responsive again, then the problem no longer occurs. I can then scroll through the document and select text happily.
 It appears to be a once-off/startup problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further diagnostic or rectification advice would be great...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Word 2016 is not intended for use in production: it's a beta version, and there's still a lot of things that are on the list to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I notice is that it is very unstable when used with documents that are stored online or in email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try saving the files you want to the Documents folder on your computer's startup drive. &nbsp;Chances are you will have better luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any form of "external" drive is going to be troublesome, currently. &nbsp;That part of the code is not baked yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>I Just tried out the update 15.10 Word 21016 I received the following symptoms</p>
<ul>
<li>unresponsive.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Spinning wheel.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If trying to select a letter or word &nbsp;the display flashes, on and off rapidly. when in this mode the only way you can shut down word &nbsp;is either Force quit or, hold down Start button until computer quits. Tried several times with same symptoms.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I then simply open 2016, and not doing anything else, went to Word Preferences to File location and Reset location of Normal.dotm File to location in<br />
<strong>User Library/~home/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.OFFICE/User Content.localized/Template.localized<br />
<br />
</strong></li><li>Then quit.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Tried again same thing.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Finally I looked for com.microsoft.word.plist<br />
Located : /Users/~Home/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I then renamed the file changing .plist to .old and Restarted Word 2016.<br />
<br />
</li><li>This time Word Open and exhibited no symptoms &nbsp;at this point Rock solid.</li></ul>
<p>You might try quitting Word Removing the plist file for 2016 to trash then restarting.&nbsp;If still acting up reset location of normal.dotm , them remove the plist file.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Phillip.</p>
<p>I tried both of your suggestions and they made no difference. I'm a bit tempted to try TOTALLY removing both Office 2011 and Office 2016 Preview, then deleting any leftover plist files, etc, and then re-installing Office 2016 first and testing it. (Followed
 by re-installing Office 2011.) Let me dwell on this for a while - I might try it one evening early this week...</p>

            <p>Don't remove office 2011. After giving my advice, I tried this morning and it went back same issues with Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just decided that the 15.10 update for Word is a Total Dog. I sent in a sad face report of my symptoms.</p>
<p>Maybe they will fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi GiselPresno,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask what your Office 365 subscription is? To use Skype for Business, it requires a Skype for Business online license, which is contained in Office 365 for Business, Enterprise, Education, etc.
 plans. If you are using Office 365 Home or Personal subscriptions, it's a normal behavior that you cannot log on to Skype for Business using your related Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to let me know if there is anything unclear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>
        </p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently been having problems sending mail with Outlook 2011. &nbsp;I can receive mail, but when I try to send a message with an attachment, it will hang in the Outbox and I get Error Message ("Not enough memory" Error code: -108). &nbsp;I've searched the
 Community and it looks like others have had the problem, and no solutions have been posted. &nbsp;The below message was posted as a solution, but it does not work for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>"<span>Open Tools/Accounts/that account/Options. Check Allow online access. Now you'll see a server account for the account in your Folder list. Go to it. You're now looking at the messages on the server. If you know which is the problem message

 will be fine - send &amp; receive all."</span></i></div>

I will get it occasionally with my GMail account, but it is currently stuck trying to communicate with my iCloud (Apple / @me.com) account. &nbsp;I believe both are accessed via IMAP - but I'm not super-technical to understand the differences (I know it is NOT Exchange,
 of course). &nbsp;The "Incoming server" is imap.mail.me.com, but my problem is sending messages, not receiving. &nbsp;All inbound messages come through with no problem.

<h2>            I am unable to attach documents to emails.</h2>
                    <p>I use an Apple Mac Mini at work running Safari [Version 10.0.1 (11602.2.14.0.7)]. The MacMini is running El Capitan 10.11.6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company use Microsoft OWA for emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can compose and send emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to attach any file [docx, xlsx, pptx or PDF], I can browse for and select the file but there is no button to click to get back to the email without losing the attachment. This is the dialogue which opens.</p>
<p>

<p>You can see that I can select a file but what do i do next? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions indicate that I should click on "Attach" but that button does not appear. There is no scroll down or up or right or left. This is a screen shot of the dialogue box I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only click on the traffic light buttons at the top left, click on Choose File (browsing the disk again), Choose More Files or click on the link at the bottom right which downloads Silverlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help to rectify this issue would be gratefully received.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Rose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already installed the latest version of Silverlight. It still did not let me attach a document to the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on another website, I discovered that Silverlight is not enabled by default in Safari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is necessary to go to Preferences, Security, click on Plug-In Settings, tick the box beside Silverlight and in the box to the right hand side, make sure the option is set to 'On'. Not 'Off' and not 'Ask'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it was a very long walk around the park to fix something very trivial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

    <title>Excel Slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zadagron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Slow</h2>
                    Is anyone else having major problems with Excel the last month or so?&nbsp; When I do the same types of workbooks I've always done (roughly 3-10 worksheets of thousands of index-match formulas), it now takes LITERALLY hours to either save or calculate.&nbsp; It's
 rendered Excel completely useless.&nbsp; I can't wait 4 hours in between updating a cell and calculating a sheet/book.&nbsp; I'm on a relatively fast machine that never had these problems before.

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. irst try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel"") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />1. Open Excel
<br />2. ALT+F11
<br />3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window
<br />4. Type ""? application.StartupPath"" without quotes and press enter
<br />5. You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />
<br />4. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />5. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.
<br />
<br />8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />
<br />    Open Excel.
<br />    Click on file, Options.
<br />    Go to the Advanced tab.
<br />    Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.
<br />    Click ok and restart Excel.

</p><p>Since Skype for Business is included in Office 365 for business package, we are supporting this kind of issue in the community (if it is related to pure cloud or hybrid environment).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the issue is related to Skype with Windows OS. Please correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the start, please repair your Office 365 - Control panel&gt; Programs&gt; Programs and features&gt; select Office 365&gt; Change&gt; Repair&gt; Quick repair and test whether the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please send me the additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skype for Business (Office 365) version number.</li><li>Do you have Skype for Business on prem server, or you are pure on cloud, or hybrid?&nbsp;</li><li>Which OS version do you have?</li></ul>

<p>I did try now and before posting but no! using in Desktop mode makes no difference in that "Start Screen" will stop opening after I have been using my machine for a while? I do know I can toggle back and forth from Start to Desktop at first, but it stop
 working after awhile! I would say how long but I do not know at least several minutes!

<h2>            Installation of Office 365 on a dual boot PC</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Installation of Office 360 on a dual boot PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have purchased Office 365 Home Premium with the five legal installations contract.&nbsp; I have a dual boot PC, one system is Windows 7 and the other is Windows 8.&nbsp; If I install Office 365 on both Windows systems on the same PC, am I charged for one installation
 or two?&nbsp; Again, it's the same PC, only one system can be up at a time.</p>

            Try it and see ... let us know<br />
<br />
On one hand, I agree with Aravinda's logic. That is the way that activation of LOCAL INSTALLS works. The activation system collects various data points about your hardware and OS, using that to generate a unique "signature". Changing the OS, ie "upgrade", requires
 Office to be reactivated.<br />
<br />
But, the documentation I've seen on multiple device install of Office 365 are keyed on the PC name and your account.&nbsp; I just don't know if Office 365 still collects all of that underlying signature information or not.<br />

<p>Hello carfred3,</p>
<p>If the reboot doesn't work, there is also a download available from T-Mobile for the HD2 that fixes this issue.&nbsp; Please contact them for more information.</p>

    <title>Camera Software Bug on Nokia Lumia 810 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> efeistel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera Software Bug on Nokia Lumia 810</h2>
                    
<p>In mid-December 2013, following a recent Nokia software update, the camera on my Nokia Lumia 810 now no longer supports the ability to tap the screen in order to take photos or video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, I am forced to use the physical camera button which tends to cause slight movement of the phone and blurring of pictures, especially since the 810 lacks the anti-shake feature found in more advanced models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume this is a software bug because I have searched for a&nbsp;setting that would allow me to re-enable the tap to take pictures capability and have found nothing of the kind.</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can fix this? Will Nokia be releasing a software update to address this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would appreciate a response soon as one of the best things about this phone&nbsp;has been&nbsp;the camera and right now the camera experience is just&nbsp;awful because of this issue. Several photos from Christmas were ruined by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eric</p>

<p>tapping the screen in the new camera app will focus there. You can tap the camera icon on the screen to take a photo (or press the button)</p>

<p>Nope. No tap to focus and no icon that results in taking picture. Previously, I could tap the screen.&nbsp;Keep in mind, this is still&nbsp;GDR2+Amber since T-Mobile has yet to roll-out GDR3+Black. But in mid-December there were some updates from Nokia. Not sure what
 changes were included, but tap to take pictures disappeared afterward.</p>

<p>Problem solved ... sort of. After a little further investigation, what I haved learned is this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) When first opening the camera&nbsp;mode on a&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 810 (running GDR2+Amber), the functionality for immediately taking a picture can only be accomplished by pressing the physical button on the handset. The ability to simply&nbsp;touch the screen (anywhere
 or even on an icon) to initiate a snapshot is no longer operational.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Added now appears to be&nbsp;the option to select a lenses, any one of several installed camera capable apps on my phone. Once an app is selected, it is then possible to touch the screen to snap a shot from within these apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in summary, what&nbsp;was once&nbsp;a two step process to take a picture (i.e., 1. enter camera mode, 2. tap screen to take photo) is now a three step process involving an extra step in the middle to select a lense before tapping the screen and taking the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would prefer that the&nbsp;camera would continue to support the&nbsp;previous two step picture taking process, but at least now there does appear to be a way to take photos by tapping the screen in specifc apps, such as Smart Camera, which is important in order
 to avoid shaking the camera (which can&nbsp;happen when using the physical button).</p>

<p>Also, Sophielens for Nokia appears to be a good replacement app for the basic camera functionality that is no longer supported on the Lumia 810. I've pinned the app to my home screen and can now once again take simple photos via a tap on the screen.</p>
