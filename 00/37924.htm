            Did you try pairing again? You should not need drivers to "pair". Restart your Surface and try again. And what issue were you having that you decided to "forget" this device?

            Yes, that's basically what my research showed me. :) You just need to check for the latest drivers for your model and download them.

<p>OK, but what you need to do is reinstall the drivers for that HP Photosmart 5520, so you can successfully Uninstall it. Reason is, programs need the info in the installer pkg. in order to be successfully Uninstalled. Do you have the Installation CD that
 came with that Photo Smart printer? If so, use that and reinstall it. After which, restart Windows to complete the install. THEN Uninstall it and reboot again. Make sense? :D&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have the original CD, download that PS552x64.msi installation pkg. on HP site and install that instead. That'll give you the installer pkg., so you can successfully Uninstall it. That installation pkg. likely contains newer drivers, but it should/may
 work. Let me know if that's not clear.</p>

<h2>            Surface go tablet, keyboard not automatically opening</h2>
                    <p>I've got a surface go tablet running Windows 10 home premium (it might not be home premium but not got it turned on to check. Either way it's been upgraded from the standard windows s (I think it's s). It's always run in tablet mode cause I don't have a
 keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the on screen keyboard hardly ever pops up when trying to enter text in a field. Seems to work on chrome for entering urls but not always. Doesn't work for non windows products either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard icon is shown at bottom of screen so I can open it manually. In the typing settings, the box is ticked to open keyboard automatically when in tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried changing the services for both the touch keyboard and it's dependices to automatic, fully up to date windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other annoyance is when it does open, it blocks the field where you are trying to enter the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reaching the end of my tether with the tablet cause this is making it unusable.</p>

<h2>            Halo 4 screen resolution problem</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Readers , i was not able to find any way to mail or contact microsoft or 343 itself , so i hoped i would find a solution here, on my xbox360 i have never had a problem with pixalated text or ugly edges,&nbsp; i played halo reach fine and it was awesome ,</p>

<p>i just bought halo 4&nbsp; , and i started out on the campaign the subtitle were blurry , the tooltips were blurry , al the text was blurry and the game was not a sight for sore eyes but kind of a pain to look it meaning u have to ignore it all .</p>

<p>then i tried multiplayer, when i pres back to open the score screen , the text of my name and al other text around that size was blurry and overall visual doesnt look nice.</p>

<p>I have on my pc atm 1920x 1080 with it i play my other xbox games nicely and my pc games nicely .</p>

<p>Please any help with it ? i cant change any options in halo4 , i'm using an HDMI cable and im widescreen</p>

<p>thanks for reading , paid and expected alot cause of the reviews , so i hope i can enjoy this game .</p>

<p>Do you mean have it on a computer screen with HDMI? like for a desktop pc? because that shouldnt matter at all. What it sound like to me is that you arent playing on 720i or 1080i and the settings of your xbox are wrong.
</p>
<p>could you tell me how you configured your xbox, because i had this same problem, i just changed settings in my xbox.</p>

<p>i thank you hero coldfreeze zero , you might just be the one to rescue me , i use my computer screen with a HDMI cable plugged in
</p>
<p>it could very possibly be about 720 or 1080 cause (just for example) it feels like watching a 360 p video instead of a HD video on my xbox.</p>
<p>i did not configure alot realy , it couldn't find any usefull system setting or anything in halo 4 , further help would be nice</p>

<p>Hey there Trax! Can you confirm that you checked out the Video Settings on the console under Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Settings? There should be options for HD viewing in there. If that doesn't help, can you try hooking up to a TV and/or a different monitor
 to see if you get the same thing there? Let us know how that goes, thanks! </p>

<p>As mr gwyther said, it should be under those settings, it explains itself really, make sure you know the correct resolution of your screen, for example a 1080i setting won't work correctly on a 720p screen. Follow all the option and do not only change the
 resolution but there are other options wich would make it look better. let me know if it worked. If not we'll just check al your settings and see if you did something wrong.</p>

    <title>Blank Page on Homegroup Panel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blank Page on Homegroup Panel</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was trying to set my printer to be used by all members of a homegroup but, while doing it, I encountered a weird problem: on my other computer (the one that needs a connection with the printer) whenever I try to go to Home
 Group it gives me a blank page; no error message, no icons, there's just a blank page. I'm an average user so I don't know much about computer but I did find, in the events viewer, some error messages (I didn't open Events Viewer on purpose, I don't even know
 if it helps)</p>
<p>This is the error:<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7c84bb99-f0e0-4acd-b84f-fe03af67f27e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fci3.googleusercontent.com%2fproxy%2fMwbq6gHDWzjNNVslHeyRMPHqcim3u9sTr1fR7y0RWF9nUdmFSyjh-UE7qElpcRQjLL4u44Qfn87wUKK0fp7qoBzM0ZjJ8xuDs9LI511lYY3HoE0IyymB80TdW-13MpURANHncrRJrsQzwvd6Hd5f2sL0tRfYNsgJ-gGT1vPDKGSHVonhLYWbu8hGTh6r9fQ%3ds0-d-e1-ft%23http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7c84bb99-f0e0-4acd-b84f-fe03af67f27e" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi Tommaso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the PC?</li><li>What is the make and model of the PC?</li></ul>
<p>It could be possible that any system files may be missing or corrupted. Also, this could be due to outdated/missing/corruption display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Run System File Checker tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, type <span>
Command Prompt</span> or <span>cmd</span> in the <strong>
Search</strong> box, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:
</p>
<p>
</p><div><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest chipset and display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This are the softwares I recently installed:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8d8bf9b-c676-4c0c-a044-a5ab63fd7f52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8d8bf9b-c676-4c0c-a044-a5ab63fd7f52" /></a></p>
<p>I don't know when this problem actually started because the computer isn't mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Avast on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my model is Toshiba Satellite &nbsp;C45-ASP4206FL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to scan the files and it did find some broken files, but, when I restarted, the problem persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tommaso<br />

<div>Hello and thank you for your post. &nbsp;You mention that the audio is good and that your desktop from the laptop extends to your HDTV. &nbsp;It sounds like your laptop is the main monitor and your television is the secondary. &nbsp;Have you tried dragging your player
 to the television? &nbsp;From there you should be able to select full screen and watch the movie from the TV.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this did or didn't help to resolve your problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

            <p>I have the same issue, I payed for Win 3.11 for Workgroups, Win 95, Win 98, Win98SE, XP Pro, Vista Home Premium, Win 7 Home Premium, Win 7 Pro, Win 8 Pro. I cannot get Win 10 to activate after hours on the phone, Msoft recommends 're-install', right! Then
 sit 24 hours for updates (about 230) for it to Fail To activate. SO, I want my Win 7 Pro back! ISO only offered to me in Korean and French.
</p>
<p>Go to pirate bay and download a clean Win 7 ISO. If Microsoft wants to be this ridiculous, I say do what you have to do. Mint 17.2 awaits!</p>

            same issue. <br />
I have bought windows outright but lost the disc.<br />
I validate my product key in order to download an iso to do a clean reinstall. <br />
Microsoft accepts the valid key but only offers french or korean language options for the iso download - neither of which are the original or required language.<br />
Further more after over an hours searching there is no way to contact microsoft to fix this.<br />
all I need is an english iso download!

<h2>            WoW Blue screen error stop 0x00000116</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing WoW after downloading the Cata. update and now whenever i go into certain place, it give me a blue screen error.&nbsp; my computer info is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs
 Manufacturer: <span>Lenovo</span><br />
Model: Lenovo Vista PC<br />
Processor: Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5200 @ 2.50 GHz 2.5 GHz<br />
Memory (RAM): 4.00 GB<br />
System type: 32-bit Operating System.<br />
Graphics Card: Intel(R) G33/G31 Express Chipset Family (I'm not sure if this is the graphics card).</p>
<p>I think i got some of the error and what i think it is is Error Stop 0x00000116 (0x85D84D08, 0x8FADF550, 0x0000000D, 0x0000000D)<br />
i think. it may be wrong but the first part with the 0x00000116 is correct for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what i've read you can try to delete other drivers but this is my only one.&nbsp; i have reinstalled it and tried to update it but neither have changed anything.&nbsp; I have also tried safe startup and so on. If there is nothing i can do just say so. and if
 the only thing i can do is get a new driver then i have no idea how to tell if drivers are compatable with my computer and so on so if you have any ideas on what kind of replacement i could get, that would be very usefull.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There have been several reports of this error from those playing WOW so be sure to check<br />
with WOW Support and their forums.</p>
<p>Re-install the latest drivers and if that does not help then revert back to an older version to<br />
see if that helps. Also check with WOW Support and their forums as you probably are not<br />
the only one with this issue.<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo&nbsp;Support, on-line documentation, and drivers.&nbsp;Go to Lenovo and look<br />
for drivers manually. If the video device is supported by its maker (such as Intel, Nvidia,<br />
ATI, and others) check with their site for drivers and ask in their forums (if any).<br />

There can be other causes of that BSOD however it is usually the drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!</p>

            Hi Susan, no problem, when you said the above did not work, I realized it was the login you wanted to remove, here you go, this will do that for you . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

 still missing. How am i going to get all my files back?

            Hi ALVIN, this is happening much too often at the moment, you were logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />Restart your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into a Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You should look for your old files in following folders 
<br />
<br />1. Go to C\Users and see if you are some other User who matches your user name. Get into this folder and see whether your files are there. 
<br />
<br />2. Go to C:\Windows.Old folder and look for your files here. 
<br />
<br />These folders will be hidden, so you need to make it visible by opening File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden Items &gt; Restart your File Explorer.
<br />Now, you should traverse the folders appropriately to find your files.

            Alright, this what really happen: the windows 10 update happened probably a couple weeks ago. After the update, I did managed to find all my files under 'Users'. Everything was fine at that point. So, I kept using my laptop, just checking my files and
 everything. I remember this situation vaguely, after awhile, I came back and start using my laptop again and searching for my files and it's not there anymore. If i remember correctly, my files under 'Users', it's not there anymore. So, I seek a friend and
 what he did was restoring my laptop to the state before the update. After restored, there are some files that are restored but not all. I would say only 10% of my personal files are still in my laptop. The rest are all gone. I have no hopes of recovering all
 my personal files at this point.&nbsp;

<p>a lo que @lovelyvintage se refiere es que si es posible, sin embargo todo DLC es EXCLUSIVO y esta ligado al perfil en el cual es comprado/descargado si los demas perfiles pueden jugarlo es por cuestion de licencias, el DLC NO se debe compartir ya que esto
 incurre en una falta en los terminos de uso y condiciones</p>

<h2>            Why Windows 10 Wifi connected but internet doesn&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here the problem</p>
<p>1. My windows 7 laptop could connect to the wifi and work well</p>
<p>2. My windows 10 PC connected to the network properly but have problem with the internet</p>
<p>3. Browser cant even load a webpage&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When I try to ping any website, it shows request time out</p>
<p>5. I have tried any solution I found on the net such as flushing dns, resetting tcp, etc</p>
<p>6. I have tried reset the pc under windows 10 settings, yet it couldn't work</p>
<p>7. Finally, I have tried to reinstall the OS but it still couldn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what should I do now? should I &nbsp;just abandon Windows 10 and install Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Some&nbsp;computers have hotkeys&nbsp;or manual switches which could be involved. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Also be sure you are not somehow activating Airplane Mode. Check Start - Settings - Network &amp; Internet - Airplane Mode - "Airplane Mode" set to Off and "Wi- Fi" devices set to On.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Check these Windows Troubleshooters :<br />
<br />
Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshooter - "Network Adapter",&nbsp;"Internet Connections", "Incoming Connections, &amp; " Hardware and Devices".<br />
<br />
Fix network connection issues in Windows 10&nbsp; &lt;-- read this<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even if other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point :&nbsp; Start - type in --&gt; Restore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and click on it - then Create<br />
<br />
Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Network -&nbsp;write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Also be sure you do a Hard&nbsp;Reset - power off modem and router - wait 3+<br />
minutes - power on modem - when it is up and running then power on the<br />
router - when it is up and running restart the computers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi,  OhItsOn999 
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app on each computer and make sure that you are sign into the same account in each app. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this text into the Run window that appears and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, open Start, find OneDrive and start it
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                    <p>I am working with a Lenovo P400 touch that is locked in Auto Repair Mode. The machine unexpectedly did a software upgrade when I rebooted. Not understanding what was happening I held the power switch down to try and get the machine running quickly. This
 may have contributed to the problem I am having of being stuck in Auto Repair mode which prevents startup of windows10 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a solution to get the machine back operational. I have tried ISO DVD and USB accompanied with changes in BIOS unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unsuccessful installation of an update could be a possible cause why you are experiencing the automatic repair loop. To address this concern, we suggest running the Startup Repair tool using your bootable USB. This tool can scan and repair damaged system
 files. Follow these steps to run the Startup Repair tool:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Insert the bootable USB and boot Windows 10 from it.</li><li>In the Windows Setup page, select the language to install, Time and currency format and the keyboard or input method and click on Next.</li><li>Click on Repair your computer and select Troubleshoot.</li><li>Click on Advanced options and select Automatic Repair and select the operating system. You might also require changing the boot priority in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Modifying BIOS settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications
 of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about the result.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Thinkpad T520 touchpad horizontal scroll not working, vertical works fine</h2>
                    <p>Touchpad zones are setup correctly, but horizontal scrolling will not work. &nbsp;It brings up the small "arrow" diagram, but no scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person on the Lenovo forum is having the same issue, but no response from Lenovo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Dieter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response with the current status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the Synaptics Ultra-Nav driver and then try to reinstall the driver from manufacture website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Try to install the latest synaptics drivers from the Lenovo website.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t520</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 2</strong>: Then try to install the driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on
<strong>‘Properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Click on the
<strong>‘Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer
 and check if the issue persists.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
