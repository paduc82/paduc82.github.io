<h2>            BSOD When a USB 3.0 Device Is Plugged In. &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around early January this year, I upgraded to Windows 10 (from Windows 7). After I got past all the "agreements/sign-ins and what-not" I got the BSOD almost immediately after seeing the desktop with the following error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>*SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (asmtxhci.sys)*</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And after Windows automatically rebooted my PC, it crashed again once I was at my Desktop (same error)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did some looking around on the internet using my phone, I found out that this is related to "ASMedia Technology Inc". I saw one Reddit post saying that this has to do with your USB 3.0 device controller. So I took out the only 3.0 device I had (2794GB
 Seagate Expansion+ Desk SCSI Disk Device USB - (SATA)) and booted up my PC again. This time, I was able to use my PC without encountering any issues.
<strong>(Please keep in mind that I WAS ABLE TO USE THIS 3.0 HARD DRIVE PRIOR TO UPGRADING, and yes, the HDD has a 3.0 head on it)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured I could just use the 2.0 ports on my motherboard until I can find a fix (which has worked so far). But I recently found out about this program "BlueScreen Viewer". (analyzes the .dmp files created during a system crash) And since I wanted to fix
 this issue so I could actually use the 4+ "USB 3.0" ports on my PC, I decided to purposely make my PC crash (by inserting the HDD into the 3.0 port) so the program could analyze the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very technical with computers, so if anyone who knows what they're doing could take a look at this image I took, it would mean a lot to me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 210px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47cf5071-5966-4253-8e10-41a1eb833550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47cf5071-5966-4253-8e10-41a1eb833550" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help is vastly appreciated as I'm at a loss as to what EXACTLY the issue is. I understand that the issue is from using the 3.0 ports, but why is this only occurring now? Thanks in advance...</p>

            <p>Good evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some steps you should follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check if a system BIOS update is available for your computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't already know, a BIOS is something that manages many parts of your computer. In short, without a BIOS, your computer wouldn't work.</p>
<p>To find out what BIOS your computer is running, enter "msinfo32" in your search bar, and find "BIOS Version/Date". Now, visit your BIOS manufacturer website and see if an update is available. Many manufacturers have released BIOS updates to resolve such
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Install the latest drivers for your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the latest drivers should fix many problems with your system, and it is a step you should always follow.</p>
<p>Of course, you can install all the latest drivers manually, but doing such is hard work. The only tool I have found that claims to automatically update all found drivers on the system can be located&nbsp;<a href="http://driverslk.driverdl.revenuewire.net/driverdl/download/?blog-fix-usb-blue-text1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a>&nbsp;Unfortunately
 I have not yet validated the security risk of this product, so I don't recommend downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Use Automatic Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the last step you should take. Automatic Repair is a program that tries to diagnose and fix errors detected on the PC. To launch Automatic Repair, go to 'Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery&gt;Restart now'. Now, you will boot into Automatic Repair.
 Select Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced options&gt;Startup Repair. (Make sure your USB drive is inserted.) &nbsp;Your computer should restart. Select your account at the screen that is shown, and enter the password for it. It should diagnose and fix the problems on your PC,
 and if not, simply perform a shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I could help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Carson</p>

            Some files?&nbsp; What is "some files"?<br />
<br />
That could be, but if you want to know what is going on, you need to provide some more information.<br />
<br />
Some Windows files that are "in use" cannot be defragmented after XP starts (like the hiberfil.sys, pagefile.sys, registry files, etc.), so you must defragment these files before XP finishes loading up.<br />
<br />
Get PageDefrag and other good tools, videos and commentary by Mark Russinovich, the master of Windows troubleshooting here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021</a><br />
<br />
Page Defrag will add an entry to the registry to run the page defragmenter on the next reboot.&nbsp; The registry entry is automatically removed after the system reboots.<br />
<br />
These files and other system files will be defragmented on the next reboot.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
The defrag reports lists files that cannot be defragmented - is that what you are talking about and what are the names of the files?<br />
<br />
You can save the report to your desktop as a text file and then copy/paste the contents back here.<br />
<br />
If you are running low on disk space the Windows defragmenter may have difficulty defragmenting your hard disk.&nbsp; XP needs 15% of the total hard disk capacity to run properly (you would get an informative message if you don't have enough room).<br />
<br />
The XP defragmenter cannot defrag files that are in use (like the registry files, event logs, pagefile.sys, etc), so they may show up as fragmented files in the defrag report.&nbsp; These files must be defragmented before XP loads up all the way and starts to use
 those files.<br />
<br />
On a healthy system it is certainly possible to have zero fragmented files (according to the XP report) by using PageDefrag.&nbsp; It does not always mean you will suddenly see more free space on your HDD though, so don't let your expectations exceed reality when
 you get to zero defragmented files and still have no more free space.<br />
<br />
You can read about and download PageDefrag download here:<br />

There are many free third party defragmenters you can download from the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some folks like the other tools better than the built in XP defragmenter, although you can see from the report above, the XP defragmenter is certainly capable of a result of
 zero fragmented files.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of third party tools that you can investigate:<br />
<br />
Some people like the Piriform suite of products and their Defraggler application which you can get here:<br />

    <title>How can I permanently cancel install of Feature update to Windows 10, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r0sebud_51  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I permanently cancel install of Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I started downloading / installing this update and then re-considered doing so because I was concerned how it might affect the operation of my home PC. However, Windows has been relentlessly trying to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and found that I could block the download and installation of this feature update by setting my un-metered wi-fi connection to metered. This seems to be working but what are the consequences of identifying my wi-fi connection to Windows
 as metered? I did notice a few nagging messages prompting me to pause OneDrive to reduce network charges. I also think my Norton anti-virus software may have briefly displayed a message about using an metered connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, I would like to permanently cancel the Version 1709 update, if that's possible for a tyro like me, and revert back to a "non-metered" wi-fi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            Unfortunately this is the new model Windows where there are regular Version Updates replacing the Service Packs and you'll need to progress in order to avoid Security or Performance issues that will far outweigh the inconveniences of setting a Metered Connection.  
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would do is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If problems persist go over this Checklist to optimize the install for upgrade: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            You can only hold the major "upgrades" off for 2 years. After that MS will not support your version.  
<br />
<br />So, use the technique to hold the upgrade off until you are ready. A time when you have a day or two to recover if the "upgrade" does not work out for you.  Do a full image copy backup to an external Drive, with a tool that can restore back to the known good backup if things don't work out. Then as Greg suggests, do a "clean" install rather than an upgrade.

<p>Also Outlook pops up with a notification that you are using a metered connection and you have to enable synchronizing every time you start Windows.</p>

    <title>Override network computer name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tszl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Override network computer name</h2>
                    I am attempting to temporarily locally override a network share by overriding the computer name using my hosts file, but Windows seems to retain the connection information.
<div><br />
<div>I added a line to my hosts file specifying the same name as a network computer name routed to localhost. This works for routing the IP, as I can verify via ping. I then shared a local folder, which I can access by my IP, but when I attempt to navigate
 explorer to the aliased computer name, I get "logon failure: the target account name is incorrect". That makes sense considering that previously this was a network share from a different user/machine, but apparently just updating the hosts file doesn't reroute
 the network share.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As an example, I had access to a network share at "\\NETWORK-MACHINE\SHARED-FOLDER". I want to override this locally, so that on my machine, "\\NETWORK-MACHINE" goes to my local machine and "\\NETWORK-MACHINE\SHARED-FOLDER" goes to a folder shared on my
 machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I clear the cached network store information? Any other way I can make this work?</div>
                </div>

            I'm not surprised the host file won't reroute a share.&nbsp; The browsing service and other possible network services (e.g. NETBios) are involved in accessing shares.<br />
<br />
I don't think what you want to do is possible short of temporarily changing the computers name if there's some kind of development reason for what you're trying to do.<br />

    <title>Surface 3 with MicroSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dndmaster2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 with MicroSD</h2>
                    <p>So, I recently bought a Lexar 128GB High-Performance 633x microSDXC UHS-I 95mb/s memory card, for my Surface 3 (NOT a pro 3, to be clear) in order to expand my memory. Now, everything I've ever read everywhere, says that MicroSDXC cards should work in the
 memory card slot in the back of my surface, but yet, I can't get this one to work properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows up in file explorer, but won't properly read/write to it, says it had a hardware issue, can't create new folders on it, etc. I have formatted it, and it seems to have 2 options</p>
<p>- exFAT </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>- NTFS</p>
<p>
</p><p>tried both, same problems come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me I didn't waste my money on this because it wasn't cheap. ANYONE know how to fix this problem. Right now i'm using a SanDisk 32GB Ultra and it's working perfectly on my Surface 3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got ANY ideas? i'd appreaciate it, thanks.</p>

<div>I can't get ANY 128GB cards to work on my Surface 3. Lexar, Samsung, Transcend,</div>
<div>PNY, Patriot. I can mount the cards but they disappear after hibernate or they</div>
<div>cause issues when heavy file I/O happens and stop working. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are a couple of other threads about similar issues. Unfortunately, there</div>
<div>has been no official response from Microsoft. (I find it hard to believe that</div>
<div>every card I tried is out of spec.)</div>

            <p>huh, that's weird. Because I have read many threads before that state this should work just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to do some more research, and try contacting Surface support again. But the funny thing is, I have a USB MicroSD Card Reader that came with it, and when it is in that, then plugged into my Surface USB, it can read the card just fine. That's the
 part that confuses me.</p>

<h3> stevenlloyd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype sign in message &#34;Your friend misses you&#34;</h2>
                    Why did I receive a message from skype when I signed in saying something like "Your friend 'X' misses you, send them a message"? Was that something 'X' sent through skype or is skype trying to get me to send them a message? If it was skype, why? Why this
 particular friend? How does skype know they miss me? Why could I not just close the message but have to click the button?&nbsp;

            This form of prompting is extremely rude and distressing. Making assumptions about the personal feelings of the contacts of people, whom, I assume, you have no information as to what their relationship is. It could be former romantic partners or spouses
 whom you have the presumption to tell people that they miss them... Really?

<p>You have got to be kidding! What idiot thought this was a good idea to push on users by default. Do you realize how this message looks? &nbsp;You are impersonating a contact and claiming they ‘miss’ the recipient without permission!! &nbsp;How dare you pretend to
 be me and potentially embarass me with a business contact. You may run into legal issues wirh this. &nbsp;REMOVE IT NOW!!!</p>

<p>Sounds like a permissions problem.&nbsp; Do you have another account you could test with?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alternatively, what others who have your symptom have done is just create a Desktop shortcut to the most important folder involved:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\WinX\Group3</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately it looks as if this feature has been optimized (why?) which makes it difficult to diagnose conventionally, e.g. using ProcMon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you may have a use a real debugger to try to understand what is going on.</p>

Then that&nbsp;could explain your symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry I gave you the wrong variable to use.&nbsp; You are right.&nbsp; It should be in&nbsp; %LocalAppData%&nbsp; not&nbsp; %AppData%.&nbsp; My %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming does not have a WinX in it either.</p>

<p>Even my Guest account has this.&nbsp; So copying from there could be a simple fix.&nbsp; I don't know what a designed repair would look like.</p>

    <title>windows 10 video editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r bancroft  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 video editor</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching for a video editor for windows 10 without success. I have not seen an understandable answer to questions about a windows 10 video editor and the editors that I have downloaded have not worked for me. One seems to be malicious, even
 though I downloaded it from the Microsoft store. Does anyone have any advice on a windows 10 video editor so that I can clip a video that is too large to send as it is?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            You can use the new Video editing features in Fall Creators Version 1709 explained here:  <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/feature/356750/how-to-edit-remix-video-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcmag.com/feature/356750/how-to-edi...</a>
<br />
<br />Hi Luis.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />if problems persist with the new version then you can roll it back and hide it with the Hide Updates tool to wait for it to mature more:   <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />Hide Updates Tool:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hi Declan , 
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing. 
<br />
<br />Please try the Windows Desktop Version of Skype and see if this helps (you are currently on the App version):-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the drop down arrow and click 'Get Skype for Windows' instead of 'Get Skype for Windows 10'.

            If you are calling on a landline/mobile number, your Caller ID may be the problem.
<br />Some people block incoming calls from callers with unkown Caller ID's. Try to enable Caller ID by following these steps:- 
<br />
<br />1. Sign into your Microsoft/Skype Account here:- 
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview</a> 
<br />2. Under 'Manage Features', Select 'Caller ID'. 
<br />3. Select your country and enter your mobile number in the appropriate boxes. 
<br />4. You should then receieve an SMS to verify the number. 
<br />5. If all goes well, the Caller ID should be activated within 24 hours. 
<br />
<br />or if you have a Skype Number, after step 2, you can simply select your Skype Number as the Caller ID.

            Have you been calling the same person? Are you able to call the Echo Sound Test? I'd double check by calling more than one person if you haven't done so already because it sounds like the other contact may have either blocked your caller id or as a contact.

            <div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><font color="#FF0000"><b>If you are overclocking try resetting
 your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.</b></font></em></em></div>
<span>If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.</span><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

<p>&nbsp;Everything that ZigZag3143 suggested applies, but special attention should be paid to the line in red(overclocking), Google Chrome, and the questions of whether or not you have the latest and right version(32 or 64 bit). Also check to see if there are any
 32bit plugins attached.</p>
<p>In two of the five crashes, Google Chrome was identified as the faulting module.......FWIW.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro Keyboard only lets me press a key once then I have to press another key before I can press it again</h2>
                    Woke up to have trouble signing into my surface, had to use the touch keyboard. When using it I then discovered for some reason each key would only work once to use it again i would have to press another key first. Its really annoying especially when deleting
 words or when a word uses two of the same letters in a row.

    <title>Random Shutdowns after Clean Win10 Install onto SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiyogi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random Shutdowns after Clean Win10 Install onto SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I first upgraded on my existing HDD, and experienced no issues. Then I purchased a SSD and clean installed Windows 10 onto the SSD via USB creation tool. I have experienced random PC shutdowns using the SSD
 OS, some during OS installation, and every time I've tried to use the SSD OS since. The HDD OS still works without issue, but I would very much like to have Windows 10 installed on the SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe this is a power issue, my power supply supports up to 750W and I have approximately 500W committed. Could this be a CPU overheating issue? Is Win10 that much more taxing on the CPU than Win7?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this issue on other forums with no resolution, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
