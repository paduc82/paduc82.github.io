    <title>Docx email attachments show original size, but when opened in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dblair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Docx email attachments show original size, but when opened in Word 2010 they are blank - empty.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>In our office, when someone sends me an email with a Docx attachment (using Outlook 2007), the attachment is there, shows correct size, and when sent to multiple people can be opened by others&nbsp;consistently. &nbsp;When I try and open,
 Word 2010 opens up to a blank document by the correct file name. &nbsp;If I save the attachment, it is an empty Docx file.</span></p>
<p><span>Antivirus (Sym corporate) the same throughout the office. &nbsp;Windows XP Pro on Domain. &nbsp;I can also forward the email to pretty much anybody else and they can open it. &nbsp;Does not happen every time, but have not figured out what's
 different and when. &nbsp;Have already uninstalled and re-installed Office 2010. &nbsp;Am still on older Outlook 2007 (did not install 2010) as I like it.</span></p>
<p>Thanks - DAB</p>

<p>Sorry it took so long to get back here, but I have fixed the problem. &nbsp;Uninstalled Office 2010 (Home and Business), uninstalled the Compatability Pack (which is believe is the root of the problem), re-installed Office and it seems to be working just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not get the opportunity to test the clean boot. &nbsp;Hope this info helps someone else out there.</p>

    <title>making compilation CD from my CDs on Windows 10 Media Player or on VLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smorz9  say:</h3>
<h2>            making compilation CD from my CDs on Windows 10 Media Player or on VLC media player or CD DVD burn on my new Windows 10.</h2>
                    I want to find printed instructions on making compilation CDs on my new Window 10, using Windows Media Player, VLC media player, or the DC DVD Burn that came with the program.&nbsp; With the old Windows Media Player it was absolutely easy. I'd insert one of
 my CDs, click onto the tracks I wanted on the compilation CD, removed that CD, and do the same with other CDs from which I was extracting tracks. When I do a search for this online, nothing comes up.&nbsp; For example, I enter "Windows 10 Media Player, making compilation
 CD" or the same substituting VLC or CD DVD Burn, I find nothing.&nbsp; With my old Media Player, there weren't things like mp3 involved.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks/

            Here are the steps to do that using Media Player, you need to have your CD's already ripped and saved to the local hard disc and accessible through Windows Media Player.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4870134a-3716-4cae-9a9a-c125d596b9d4?upload=true" />

<h2>            Getting Back My Apps</h2>
                    On my Nokia Lumia 521 the "blue screen of death" kept popping up, so I reset it by doing that down-volume-off-button ritual. The help forum showed me that a button would appear during the start up process that would let me recover my apps and contacts
 and stuff but it never appeared. I added back my live account to the phone, yet none of my apps are coming back. Is it possible to get the apps back?

<p>The blue screen had an icon, right. Don't know where you got the screen as described on a Windows phone.</p>
<p>What you did with the volume down and the power button is a soft reset, like pulling the battery.</p>
<p>You can't add your account back without a phone reset.</p>
<p>To reset your phone go to settings, about, phone reset.</p>
<p>Connect to wifi , enter your account info and select restore from your phone backup.

<h2>            Complete Fresh Install of IE</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC with IE10 on it.&nbsp; It came with IE9.. It has been behaving poorly on some websites.&nbsp; For example, I cannot logon to ebay.&nbsp; When I enter my credentials, the screen blinks and comes back to the logon screen again with all my credential entries missing.&nbsp;
 This loop continues as long as I keep trying.&nbsp; How can I bring IE completely back to the way it was before any customizations?&nbsp; I mean even to delete anything that may have been saved into an IE folder.&nbsp; I need to wipe whatever is causing this issue and I
 do not want to rebuild the machine.&nbsp; I have already tried dropping back to IE9.&nbsp; Same issues in 9.&nbsp; I did a reset and still have the issues.&nbsp; I went to Programs and Features and turned of IE 10, then reinstalled after reboot and the problem persists.&nbsp; I'm
 not sure when this started, but it has been relatively recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I simply want to effectively wipeout IE to it's as shipped form.</p>

ebay is not the only other site with issues.  when I use the Walmart **** to refill an Rx, the checkout fails and i have to use Firefox. 



I have tried Compatibility View and it makes no difference. 



I do not receive an error message while trying to logon to ebay.  After entering my credentials and hitting {Enter}, the screen flickers and goes back to the logon screen without the values I entered. 



I tried going back to IE9 and got the same results, even in Compatibilty View. 



I may try creating a new account and seeing if it has the problem.  



The webpages display fine, they just don't work in IE.  But, IE9 on my work laptop does not have this problem.  That's why I want to completely purge IE from my home PC and reinstall it fresh. 



I'll try clearing the SSL State, too.

It's irrelevant as to what ebay account I use, and I have two.  The issue is the same when I use IE.  I am forced to use Firefox, or any other browser.  So long as I use a different browser, I can login and use the Walmart **** refill website.  FYI: I have also tried clearing cache. 



So, I am still trying to find out how I can bloww IE out to square one as a fully clean install. 



I have created a new account, but I am having some other difficulties that have nothing to do with IE.  When that is resolved, I can move forward with my testing of IE in the new account.

<h2>            Search all mails in all mailboxes from and to a specific domain</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have to find and export mails sent&nbsp;<strong>from</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>to</strong> a specific domain in the last two years.<br />
I have to search in&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> mailboxes, including the Online Archive of these mailboxes as well as in Shared Mailboxes.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can accomplish this?<br />
<br />
I can't manage to accomplish this with&nbsp;in-place eDiscovery because I can only search recipients and senders.<br />
I cannot specify only a domain.</p>
<p>Also I'm not sure whether the eDiscovery is searching in Online Archives.</p>

<p>hi ait448,</p>
<p>from your description, i know that you want to export the mails sent/received by a specific domain.</p>
<p>if it is the case, i have run a test and found that i can search the mails of a specific domain via
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/praveenkumar/archive/2013/07/19/single-item-recovery-in-new-o365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office 365 ediscovery</a> (note: i can search the mails in the&nbsp;online archive mailbox according to the test.) the detailed steps are:<br />
1.&nbsp;connect to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center (eac)</a> with
<strong>an admin</strong> credential.<br />
2.&nbsp;click ‚Äúcompliance management‚Äù&gt; ‚Äúin-place ediscovery and hold‚Äù&gt; ‚Äú+‚Äù (create a search)&gt; ‚Äúspecify mailboxes to search‚Äù&gt; ‚Äú+‚Äù (add the mailboxes which are related to a specific domain. such as, ‚Äòonmicrosoft.com‚Äô domain)&gt; ‚Äúinclude all content‚Äù&gt; ‚Äúnext‚Äù&gt; ‚Äúfinish‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>note</strong>: when choosing ‚Äúspecify mailboxes to search‚Äù, all the mailboxes in your organization are listed. so, we can choose the mailboxes related to a specific domain to search.</p>
<p>for ‚Äúyou can only search recipients and senders‚Äù, i‚Äôd like to confirm whether you choose ‚Äúfilter based on criteria‚Äù when performing the ediscovery. see the following picture:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=978b0381-440d-4674-bf20-fb5b87aa4028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d978b0381-440d-4674-bf20-fb5b87aa4028" /></a></p>
<p>if it is the case, please try ‚Äúinclude all contents‚Äù and check the result. you can also upload the related screenshots if the issue persists. to upload a screenshot: click ‚Äúuse rich formatting‚Äù&gt; ‚Äúinsert media‚Äù.</p>

<p>I don't think you understood my question...</p>
<p>I'll try to explain:</p>
<p>There is an&nbsp;<strong>external</strong>&nbsp;domain where mails are sent to and received from.<br />
I want to search in all mailboxes in our organisation for mails sent to and received from that particular domain.</p>
<p>In your suggested answer I have to choose in which mailboxes to search.<br />
That's not important. I want to search <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>in</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong> our mailboxes in&nbsp;<strong>OUR</strong>&nbsp;entire domain.</p>

<p>Hi AIT448,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>Given the situation, it is not feasible to do so. However, your idea about exporting (searching) the mails sent to/received from an external domain really strikes me. So, I‚Äôd like to suggest you submit your feedback via the link
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office365.uservoice.com/</a> to our related team to get your voice heard. Many products‚Äô features have been designed or upgraded based on customers‚Äô constructive comments.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding and effort.</p>

<h2>            does Onenote 2010 has clip to current page function using shortcut key&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I face some strange misfunction in onenote 2010, when I use "copy part of screen into onenote as an image" button from ribbon bar , clipped image directly comes to my current page I am working on, but when I use shortcut key "windows + s" I face a dialog
 box which asks me where to save it and this image goes to new page. Or clipboard.</p>
<p>Also in "options -&gt; send to onenote -&gt; screen clipping" I don't have "to current page" option.</p>
<p>In onenote 2007 I could do so easy.Not in 2010 it is so hard!</p>
<p>Any one had solve this?</p>

<p>Solve what?<br />
Honestly speaking I do not see what you might be after and what might be<br />
harder now than in ON2007.</p>
<p>ON ON2010 there was no way to insert a clipping&nbsp; <strong>directly</strong> in the<br />
currently page.<br />
That this can be done know from the "Insert" Tab in the ribbon.<br />
That's a huge advantage.</p>
<p>As the destination in ON2010 there only was a global setting for<br />
Clipboard and Unfiled Notes.<br />
No we have a dialog to select the destination.<br />
A huge advantage.</p>
<p>What might be wrong?</p>

I used to use alt+c to capture screen shots directly in current page. Now it needs more effort that reduces my speed.</p>
<p>I mean more click and pasting.</p>

            <p>This is what Pooyar is talking about. There is no way to send screen clippings to the current page as a settable default. &nbsp;Please the see the menu below. &nbsp;Like he said this feature was present in 2007 and VERY USEFUL. I miss it dearly. &nbsp;MS, please bring
 it back. &nbsp;Anybody have any other thoughts?</p>

            <p>Yes Microsoft,</p>
<p>We need "send screen clip to current page" option in the Screen Clippings drop down.</p>
<p>Otherwise we will have to reset the default page every time we start working on a new page.</p>
<p>Also, an option to not include the "Screen clipping Taken: date time" text would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an exchange account that I access through both apple mail (high Sierra) and the outlook web app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several subfolders in my inbox. Some have rules and some don't. Recently I created a new folder with a rule specified from the web app and from my apple mail. The rules work. However, sometimes when I manually move some emails from my main inbox into
 this particular sub folder they disappear:completely. &nbsp;It only happens with this particular subfolder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the things suggested in this mailbase previously as a fix but to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These emails have well and truly disappeared.</p>

<p>Hello Annabee1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to the specific folder, have you tried to delete it and re-create a new one? You can try to do it to see if there is any difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the same behavior still exists, in order to narrow down the issue, please do the following tests and let me know the results:
</p>
<p>1. Please move some test emails both in Outlook Web App(OWA) and Apple mail client to see if it happens in the 2 clients.</p>
<p>2. If it happens both in the 2 clients, it is suggested to remove the rule that works for the specific folder, and do some tests to see if the same issue happens.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Have you searched these missing emails in the deleted items folder and the recover deleted items folder? If so, and you cannot find them, you can also try running a content search to check if these missing emails can be searched.

<h2>            Help we have the &#39;system tool&#39; virus</h2>
                    My husband picked up this virus on his laptop from somewhere.&nbsp; He was on facebook when the computer screen started showing that he was at risk and had 32 viruses, etc.&nbsp; The last time I looked he had norton security on the computer, but it was not there,
 I tried to bring up windows defender and open spybot, but the virus apparently locked out these items. Right now the computer is toast.&nbsp; Since it appears I can access the internet to a point - I will try this and hope for the best.&nbsp; any positive results from
 anyone else?<br />

            Restart your computer in safe mode by pressing the F8 key when it is restarting at the black screen before the&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;logo appears. A&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;help link should pop up to use system restore. Use system restore, and restore your computer to a date before

<h2>            Creating a custom list that includes documents from multiple libraries</h2>
                    
<p>All,<br />
<br />
I am having a hard time trying to do the following :<br />
<br />
I have documents on multiple libraries and on multiples sites and subsites.<br />
<br />
My aim is to create a custom list that I can customize, importing all documents from all sites / libraries but with at least&nbsp;7 or 8 filter in order to display only 20 documents (Basically those document are spread everywhere and I try to create a place to find
 them all)<br />
<br />
I read some post regarding existing solution with SharePoint designer. Is there any other way to do it without SharePoint Designer ?&nbsp;I also tried the queries webapp but without, furthermore with this queries app I cannot customize the page displaying customize
 columns.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help,</p>

 from 8.0 to 8.1 and then to 10.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query. The availability of Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;Mobile as an upgrade for existing Windows Phone 8.1 devices will vary by device manufacturer, device model, country or region, mobile operator or service provider, hardware limitations, and
 other factors. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you revert the current operating system (OS) build on your Lumia 929 to Windows Phone 8 by using the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a>.</strong> This tool will remove everything else, including your apps, games, texts, call history, music, and photos.
 Therefore, creating a <strong><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup</a></span></strong> on your phone before using the tool is important to avoid
 data loss. Please be advised that the <span>Windows&nbsp;10 backups aren‚Äôt compatible with Windows 8 phones. It is not recommended that you restore a Windows 10 backup to a Windows 8 phone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your Windows Phone 8, you will need first to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12662/windows-phone-update-your-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update it to Windows phone 8.1</a></strong>,<span>&nbsp;
</span>by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone Update</strong> &gt; <strong>
Check for updates</strong> &gt; tap <strong>Download</strong> once the update is available. Please be informed that
</span>Windows Phone will let you know when new updates are available. If you check manually for an expected update and your phone appears to be up to date, it may be that it isn't available yet for your specific phone, mobile operator, or market.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For you to get the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade, we recommend that you download and install the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13778/windows-10-mobile-upgrade-advisor-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upgrade Advisor app</a></strong> on your phone to check for your handset eligibility for the upgrade. Once your phone is eligible, this tool will also
</span>help free up space on your device&nbsp;to prepare&nbsp;for&nbsp;installation and you can install the upgrade from there.</p>
<p><br />
<span>Once you‚Äôve upgraded your phone to Windows 10 again, you can </span><span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/98182238-d509-50d1-eadf-9a73b2f1f4d1/restore-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restore</a></strong></span><span>
<span>Once you‚Äôve upgraded your phone to Windows 10 again, you can </span><span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/98182238-d509-50d1-eadf-9a73b2f1f4d1/restore-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restore</a></strong></span><span>
 your backup when you set up your phone and make sure to use the same Microsoft account you‚Äôve used when you created a backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference, you can visit <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10599/windows-10-mobile-how-to-get" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to get Windows 10 Mobile.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Should you have any further clarifications, please let us know and we‚Äôre always here to help.</span></p>

<h2>            A question about malwarebytes.</h2>
                    Hello , if i prevented malwarebytes from running at startup , my system performance will be the same as before installing malwarebytes . So , If it's turned off , ( prevented it to run at startup ) , it will only run when i will open it right ? if it's
 closed it will NOT run ?, no process from malwarebytes will run&nbsp; ? Because i want to use this antivirus raretimes , just to scan my pc once a month , and i want to keep my system performance like how it needs to be ( the best performance ). This is why i want
 to keep it closed , i dont want it to eat ram.&nbsp;

            Although the marketing of Malwarebytes 3.x Premium "<em>claims</em>" it can be used as a replacement for an existing anti-virus, it is

            Hi Marinel
<br />
<br />Yes that is correct, stop MalwareBytes from starting with Windows and only scan with that when your need to, that is the best way to use MalwareBytes, there is no need tot have that running in the background . . .
<br />
<br />Once you stop that from auto-starting, no background process will be running and it will have no affect on your system performance . ..

<p>If that does not help, try to remove and read the email account in Outlook 2011 and check if it helps.</p>
<p>If that does not help, you may create a new Identity in Outlook and check how the account works in the new Identity.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How can I get my saved emails back in my mailbox? &nbsp;I have numerous file folders and emails in my old mail box. &nbsp;I did not use Outlook in Windows 7, but I have them imported into my account on my computer. &nbsp;Where have they gone and how can I retrieve them?
 &nbsp;Windows 10 boasted that all of my setting etc would remain the same - so why cannot is my information missing? &nbsp;My mail is not stored on Microsoft Outlook online nor has my computer been hacked. &nbsp;My emails had been saved on my computer. &nbsp;If I go back to Windows
 7 will they be there?</p>

            <p>I purchased a new computer and it came with Windows 7 and bought the MS suite but Outlook was extra. &nbsp;So we have been using the mail application that came with the computer and linked it with our own email (from our internet provider). &nbsp;Within this program,
 I had created folders and subfolders to organize and maintain my emails. &nbsp;Now after the update to Windows 10, all of my old saved emails and settings in mail application are gone. &nbsp;I have not been able to sync my emails yet with Windows 10. &nbsp;In the FAQ, all
 email and settings were not suppose to change, so this is quite a surprise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions -</p>
<p>1) No, I am not using MS Outlook online</p>
<p>2) I am using a custom domain email - from my internet provider</p>
<p>3) I had made no changes to my email prior to the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how I can find these emails - they must be saved on my computer - yes?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carolyn</p>

            <p>Based on the link - I would say I was using Window Mail or Windows Mail Live. &nbsp;It was the app that was available on the system that came with Win7, I then accessed my mail from the ISP with pop address and stored them on my computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would continue to use this same email system if it was available on my computer - but since the update to Win10, all my email information and saved emails have "disappeared" My personal email address and ISP have not changed, only change was my update
 to Win10.</p>

            thank you for your help - as I had to show hidden files - it appears that I have Window Live or Windows Mail, but not Windows Live Mail. Do you think it could be elsewhere? or could I restore Windows 7 and have them show up? Any other suggestions? &nbsp;Your

            I have window 10. my microsoft office is offline, no I don't use outlook web app, my email is the same for years *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I did not make any change to my email account. My folder "important messages" as the name said, contain many important emails.

<p>Did you find the other posts on Windows 10 forum with this same issue. All those users had combination of intel/nvidia video adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your intel HD 4000 video adapter have "July 2015 Microsoft Software Compatibility Publisher" driver (see device mgr.)?</p>

Can you uninstall Nvidia software and drivers completely and then see if brightness can be adjusted?

<h3> sharathus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network problems after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Microsoft 640XL from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 about 3 months ago. Of late I'm facing network issues. Call drops, mobile data not getting on once I shift to different states, 3G not getting activated, etc.. Usually a restart of phone is required
 to set this problem right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However call drops &amp; bad voice clarity is a perpetual problem, which were not available while I was using Windows 8.1. Sometimes network mobile data is shown as available, however internet does not work.</p>
<p>I keep checking for phone updates &amp; my phone is always up to date.</p>
<p>Is this a common problem with Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Let's get this resolved by performing a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't resolve the issue, back up the phone and perform a hard reset. To hard reset the phone, go to

            <p>Yup. It's pre-release software and not everying works. I would start reading through this thread</p>

<p>and maybe look for some support at the Windows Phone developer forums. </p>

<p>You will find those here are much more user focused than developer. </p>

<h2>            Call &#43; SMS Filter missing in Nokia Lumia 925</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a Lumia 925 which has the GDR3 (installed via developer preview) update. However, the call + sms filter is missing. I've tried to install the extras + info xap, the call + sms xap by doing what's mentioned here..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/EC6C7063-C637-4D29-B7EF-3F59D67D9C1A">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-Lumia/call-filter-missing-in-925/td-p/2077066</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.. but that doesn't work. The market store installer says that the app is incompatible for my phone!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any one know why this could be happening and how I can restore this functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Thanks,<br />

            hi mate, Calls + SMS Filter was provided as part of the Lumia Amber update and has nothing to do with Update 3 provided by Microsoft (for developers). have you tried performing a soft reset on your device, and also checking that you have all the latest
 Nokia system app updates from the Store? The Calls + SMS filter should appear in your Settings list if the above is maintained and correct.

            I know GDR3 has nothing to do with SMS+Calls. I reset the phone twice and the option is still unavailable. It was there when I got the phone initially.

            sadly only option now is to perform a hard reset, or you can just wait until Lumia Black is released in early 2014 and install that update when it is presented.

            Did you solved? Tell me how. Lumia Amber sms/call filter has 1.7.1.4 and lumia Black has 1.7.3.1. I did everything I could with my 820.

<div>This is what I have so far, which works (up to a point) if all the names are used. However, it does seem to allow duplicates. And when the number of available names outnumbers the available cells (number of people assigned to a particular duty) there are
 duplicates. Also not sure how to set the variable number of cells.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd use a different approach. This code prompts you to select the names and then select the range to fill. Assuming the range to fill isn't too large it will fill it with unique names from the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub RangeRandomize()<br />
Dim SrcRange As Range, FillRange As Range<br />
Dim c As Range, r As Long<br />
Set SrcRange = Application.InputBox("Select source names", Type:=8)<br />
Set FillRange = Application.InputBox("Select Fill range", Type:=8)<br />
If FillRange.Cells.Count &gt; SrcRange.Cells.Count Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Fill range too large"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End If<br />
r = SrcRange.Cells.Count<br />
For Each c In FillRange<br />
Do<br />
c.Value = WorksheetFunction.Index(SrcRange, Int((r * Rnd) + 1))<br />
Loop Until WorksheetFunction.CountIf(FillRange, c.Value) &lt; 2<br />
Next<br />
End Sub<br />

<h2>            Why would I EVER be told that I don&#39;t have permission to save a Copy of a PrintScreen that I made myself on my own personal Windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This crazy thing happens to me about every day as I attempt to crop a PrintScreen to post it on Facebook. So, quite obviously, there can be no licensing or trademark problem (sarcasm).</p>
<p>What's even stupider is that after it displays this, I just click CLOSE and the box goes away and then I carry on doing whatever I was doing without even needing to reopen the image.</p>
<p>And please don't blame a virus. Its been doing this both before and after last week's Hard Reset.</p>

            Hello C.H.Goh,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies
<br /><a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>
<br />- clearing browser caches
<br /><a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>
<br />
<br />Alternatively, open in private mode ("incognito mode") or try with a different browser
<br />
<br />Otherwise, clear your DNS revolver caches: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>cmd.exe</code> then key in <code>ipconflig /flushdns</code>
<br />
<br />Please ensure that your browsers have

            Please check 2 isues.<br />
First possibility is that your microphone connector is loose. It has a locking (by turning) mechanism, but if it only plugged and not locked sooner or later it will get loose and intermit the mic signal.<br />
Other possibility is that your Bluetooth connection is in bad shape. It depends from the position of the junction box. If it is very well shielded by installation it might cause this effect, too. But - in this case you should also have poor sound quality on
 your side. If you open your installation and let the box hang outside it should disappear if it¬¥s this one.
