<h2>            Excel 2013 Filter Drop Down Menu Icon Not Shown On Column Heading</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apply Filter on my 7 worksheets. all work well&nbsp;except one sheet that returning with 2 rows. It should be 1 row because&nbsp;all&nbsp;data is unique. I don't know what happen until I notice that sheet when&nbsp;enabling the filter, the drop-down arrow
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fofficeimg.vo.msecnd.net%2fen-us%2ffiles%2f614%2f473%2fZA010186549.gif" />&nbsp;is not on my&nbsp;column heading,&nbsp;rather on the second&nbsp;row, which is&nbsp;my first data row.
 If I delete that first data row, and insert a new row with same data, my return filter data is correct, i.e. 1 row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering how I get that in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>MS Access 2013 won&#39;t display information on property sheet for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tome &#40;dublin&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2013 won&#39;t display information on property sheet for Form design</h2>
                    <p>I have a database that I&nbsp;created in MS Access 2010. The database has several forms that are used by our associates so the form has many buttons, lists, etc. When I open the form in design view, the property sheet will display information on the various tabs
 (Format, Data, Event, Other). I can see where I have assigned macros on the On Click event and I can edit those if I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently got a new laptop for work and Office 2013 was installed. When I open the same&nbsp;database(s) in 2013 and go the design view for my forms,&nbsp;I don't see any information displayed on the property sheet for any existing field I have on the form. I tried
 dragging a new Command Button onto the form page to see if it would let me assign an On Click activity but nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to update some of my forms but I'm not sure why Access 2013 won't display the fields I can see in the earlier version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information you can provide would be appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If the property dialog doesn't display it might simply be off the screen. Some times when working with a higher resolution screen you might save a form design with the property box very near the bottom or right side of the screen. When you open Access with a different screen resolution, the property box may be off the visible screen. 
<br />
<br />I would try change the screen resolution or connect to a higher resolution monitor. There is probably something in the registration that saves the location but I'm not sure where this might be without a lot of digging.

            First, you need to stop what you are doing IMMEDIATELY. You said the app was built with Access 2010. Have all the users of that application been upgraded to Access 2013? If not, you CANNOT do any design work in Access 2013. If you do, you could make the application unavailable to anyone still using Access 2010. You can only do development work in the lowest version that you users might use. 
<br />
<br />So it may have been a good thing you couldn't do this. It is possible this is because it was developed in an earlier version and is using features no longer available.
<br />
<br />Just to make sure we are on the same page, the Property dialog does display and you can can select the tabs, But there are no property values displayed for certain properties? A screen shot of this might help.  But, again, unless your users are all on 2013 or later, you should NOT do any development in 2013.

<p>That was it. I resized the Property Sheet and now I can see what I was looking for. What's weird is I'm using the same monitors I had with the old laptop. Oh if everything were that simple...

<h2>            Another scam... &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last night I got a red screen and an automated message saying I need to call a number to get this fixed.&nbsp; My screen was locked and I could not get rid of the message.&nbsp; I was not savvy enough to copy the screen.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the number and was told I had a Microsoft network security breach.&nbsp; I guess stupidly I allowed the computer to be cleaned up and then was charged over $900 for a three year protection plan.&nbsp; I need to know if Softech Solutions/Giltedge Solutions
 is a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP.. and what do I do if this happens again as I fear it will.</p>

<p>Of course it was a scam and the very first thing you should do is call your bank or card company&nbsp;if payment was via a credit or other card and ask them how to stop payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've done that, you'll likely want to fully wipe out and set up your PC again, since once you've allowed an unknown person (they lied, why would you believe anything they've told you) access, you can no longer trust that they may not have left software
 on the PC that allows them access again&nbsp;in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will only happen again if you allow it to.&nbsp; The message itself is fake, an ad that often makes the screen difficult to close, but nothing more and should always be ignored, since no reputable business operates in this manner, ever!&nbsp; Not Microsoft, not
 their partners, not 3rd-party computer businesses,&nbsp;no one.</p>

<p>How did you pay the $900?&nbsp; If this was via a credit card or some other payment method that can be reversed this should always be your first action and also be done to protect the&nbsp;account from being abused for further fraud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is unimportant to this and should just be turned off until the urgent financial issue is dealt with.&nbsp; It can't be trusted and so shouldn't be used for any critical or financial communications until it's been repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the many possible offers of online pages and options for fixing the PC are pointless if you don't know how to do them or are unwilling to learn.&nbsp; If you want to save money, you can review those and try to do them yourself with aid from some of the
 reputable online sites&nbsp;already recommended, but if you either don't feel sure about doing them yourself or have the money to&nbsp;pay someone else to fix it, then that's what you should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have the money&nbsp;if you get the $900 payment stopped, since that's far more than this should cost.&nbsp; The best way to get it fixed is to take it to a reputable local PC repair shop if you live&nbsp;near a town that has this, since then you know whom you're
 dealing with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online world is dangerous today and requires understanding and careful consideration, so if you don't feel you can do this effectively, it's often best to limit your activities to those you do understand.&nbsp; Always be suspicious of anything&nbsp;which you're
 not fully aware of&nbsp;and comfortable with before making a decision and simply turn off the PC if you're feeling uncomfortable, since your gut feeling is usually right if you think something's wrong.</p>

 jump to 2,002 files remaining, then back to 1,998. It's been stuck 1,998 for hours. I'm at a loss. I checked all my file names and they all conform. The sync started with about 3,500 files and it was going quick until 1,998. How do I find out which file this
 is? Can I skip it? Please help!!!</p>

                </div>

<p>This kinda difficult for you to identify which file is stuck. MS has a way by getting the sync log from you and point out which file is that. Definitely you have a file that doesn't meet the sync requirement.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>In this case, I suggest try the following steps:<br />
1. Make sure that the total items synced are not over <strong>20,000</strong> items and items synced in an SharePoint Online library are not over
<strong>5,000</strong> items.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738
</a><br />
2. In system tray, right click<strong> OneDrive for Business icon</strong> &gt; <strong>
repair</strong> if the function shows. Capture a screenshot of the error for further troubleshoots. You can upload screenshots by clicking
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> &gt; the first <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.<br />
3. Clean OneDrive for Business cache.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Stop syncing all OneDrive for Business folders according to<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Stop-syncing-a-library-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-app-a7e41f1f-3a98-4ca7-9443-f10250688330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Stop-syncing-a-library-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-app-a7e41f1f-3a98-4ca7-9443-f10250688330</a>.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Clear all IE browsing history via Internet Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Internet options &gt; Delete ‚Ä¶ in General tab &gt; select all boxes &gt; Delete.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Clear credentials via Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials &gt; remove all Office 365 related credentials.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix it tool</a> to clean OneDrive for Business cache.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Re-sync the library.</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please let us know. We will move on to collect OneDrive for Business logs for further investigation.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan</p>

<p>i was not able to make this stop. this was on my desktop when i go to work monday morning. the issue began over the weekend on my laptop. nothing i did stopped the endless microsoft upload center from doing this. over and over again. i had to rename the
 mysosync file in order to stop it. this is not how a sync folder system should work. my googledrive does not do this. dropbox does not do this. i upload files to these services and it just works. onedirve..,. not so much.</p>

 how I can keep the calendar visible and functional?

            All programs are installed, particularly anti virus, for all users. So if it works under my wife's account, it cannot be the anti virus or any other program, which suggests to my mind it may have become corrupted and needs to be deleted and reloaded. How
 can I do that? Otherwise there may be a reported bug in a few days time when Windows 10 goes live.

            With the invaluable assistance of Microsoft under the "Assure" system, another new account was set up, in my name this time, and all worked well until I was asked whether I wanted to connect with something (I forget what) and immediately Calendar stopped
 working in exactly the same way as on my main login account, so I have deleted the new account in my name and, since Microsoft seems to be unable to assist with this problem, I have instead downloaded and installed the program called "One Calendar" which so
 far works well.

            <p>There are programs that create installer EXEs and other file types.</p>
<p>I've used one called CreateInstall for years; there are full, "light" and free versions available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>INNO Setup also seems popular (and is free, I believe).&nbsp; There are others, free and at all sorts of prices.</p>
<p>Your main problem, I expect, will be in telling the installer app where to put the files.&nbsp; Most of them won't have built in "Put it in the Word Startup Folder" commands.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;Authentication failed because Outlook doesn&#39;t support any of the available authentication methods.&#34;</h2>
                    I have just installed Office for Mac 2011. &nbsp;In outlook i am able to send out messages but get an error message when trying to receive messages. &nbsp;The error message reads "Authentication failed because Outlook doesn't support any of the available authentication
 methods. &nbsp;Details:&nbsp;Could not retrieve mail.&nbsp;Account name: "Rogers"&nbsp; where Rogers is my mail server. &nbsp;Error code is 17897.
<div>All the settings are correct according to my mail server. &nbsp;Any solution for this problem??

<p>
</p><p><span>Some users might be experiencing a glitch with starting the Threat Service (Windows Defender Antimalware Service) that was delivered on Patch Tuesday. So the first thing to try would be manually restarting the PC lots of times, with a break between
 the restarts (Start button &gt; Power &gt; Restart), as suggested by Le Boule in this thread:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-virus-threat-protection-restart/9215a1e1-d386-477b-b22f-d608365b255a"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-virus-threat-protection-restart/9215a1e1-d386-477b-b22f-d608365b255a</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might also be related to the known glitch where the Security Center Service needs to be restarted in order to get Windows Defender up and running ‚Äì so try this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Manually restart the Security Center Service, and then attempt to start the Windows Defender Antivirus Service:</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.&nbsp; Press <strong>Win Key + R</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Type ‚Äúservices.msc‚Äù and click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. &nbsp;Right-click on <strong>Security Center</strong> and click <strong>
Restart</strong></span></span></p>
<p>4<span>.&nbsp; Right-click on <strong>Windows Defender Antivirus Service</strong> and click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other suggestions for starting Windows Defender are presented in this Forum Article:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/problems-starting-windows-defender-in-windows/808253bb-db89-4db9-a4e5-1c91a86489e9"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/problems-starting-windows-defender-in-windows/808253bb-db89-4db9-a4e5-1c91a86489e9</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hadn‚Äôt noticed that <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3450c403-9bae-4dcb-8bc5-7730d8c93162" title="PrashantKumar96">
DisableAntiSpyware </em>= 0<strong> </strong>in his forum article. Before you do that, you should always try just deleting any possible entry for
<em>DisableAntiSpyware </em>= 1, since that setting might have been added by another program or by malware ‚Äì and that setting will always prevent Windows Defender from starting. For the sake of both ease and safety, this should be done with a REG command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Type ‚Äúcmd‚Äù in the search box; and then right-click on <em>Command Prompt</em> and select
<em>Run as administrator</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And then copy, paste, and enter this command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)"><span>REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>This is the proper way to enable Windows Defender when it's been turned off via Group Policy</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We can see that there‚Äôs a general confusion with respect to this Group Policy setting by the way that Brink equates deleting the
<em>DisableAntiSpyware</em> entry with setting its value to 0. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>DisableAntiSpyware</strong> DWORD<br />
<br />
(delete) or <strong>0</strong> = On<br />
<strong>1</strong> = Off</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5918-turn-off-windows-defender-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5918-turn-off-windows-defender-windows-10-a.html</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But this setting actually uses a three-state logic, where the absence of the setting specifies the normal
<strong>Automatic Disabled</strong> compatibility mode for Windows Defender. Setting
<em>DisableAntiSpyware</em> = 0 sets Windows Defender's operational state to ‚Äúalways on‚Äù [<em>DisableAntiSpyware</em> = 0 (logical ‚Äúno/never‚Äù)], whereas [<em>DisableAntiSpyware</em> = 1 (logical ‚Äúyes/always‚Äù)] sets Defender‚Äôs operational state to ‚Äúalways off‚Äù;
 and where removing the <em>DisableAntispyware</em> registry entry simply returns Defender to its default operational state ‚Äì where Defender will be automatically disabled by the installation of any third-party AV app, and automatically enabled when a third-party
 AV app is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Defender operational states</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Truth Value of <em>DisableAntiSpyware</em></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p><span>Undefined (unspecified) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Automatic Disabled (default)</span></p>
<p><span>True (1, logical yes/always) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Always Off</span></p>
<p><span>False (0, logical no/never) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Always On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Therefore, setting <em>DisableAntiSpyware </em>= 0 should only be done as a last resort, after first deleting any
<em>DisableAntiSpyware </em>entry, and after all of the following troubleshooting steps have been fully applied, since having to resort to this ‚Äúalways on‚Äù setting means that there‚Äôs something seriously wrong with the system; and because this setting will have
 adverse and unforeseen consequences. For example, I set Defender to ‚Äúalways on‚Äù after installing Avast Free in order to see what effect this would have ‚Äì and although I didn‚Äôt see any prompt to restart the Windows Defender Service in the WDSC app itself, the
 prompt did immediately appear in the Windows Defender Antivirus UI, and this turned on Windows Defender (complete with real-time protection) after just a moment's hesitation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So we need to be clear that setting <em>DisableAntiSpyware </em>= 0<strong>
</strong>will allow Windows Defender to run alongside any third-party AV app with its real-time protection enabled, which would result in all kinds of different performance and operational issues in the event that a third-party AV app was installed at some
 future point in time. So this setting is something that should be avoided if at all possible, and you should always try the REG DELETE command provided above, and then follow these troubleshooting steps, before setting Windows Defender to "always on":</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If none of the above steps allow you to restart the Windows Defender Antivirus Service, then you can try setting the Group Policy for Widows Defender to ‚Äúalways on‚Äù.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Type ‚Äúcmd‚Äù in the search box; and then right-click on <em>Command Prompt</em> and select
<em>Run as administrator</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And then copy, paste, and enter this command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)"><span>REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then click the <em>Restart</em> button (it might be necessary to restart the PC first).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this REG ADD command fails to resolve the issue, then run the REG DELETE command above to delete the
<em>Disable Antispyware </em>entry, and then temporarily install a free third-party AV solution. Replacing Defender with a third-party AV app will provide the system with real-time AV protection, and allow you to connect to the internet safely:</span></p>

<p><span>Apply this rule after the message arrives<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 latest insider build</h2>
                    <p>Hi, sense the last windows insiders build update. My start will not load up after i have signed in to my PC. All I get is a black screen. I do not know how to correct the problem. The only thing it is letting me do is sign in. I have tried to every thing
 I have been able to find on this issue. Nothing works. From I have been able to find out about the cause of this. Is that windows 10 is not reading my graphics driver. How do I get into my system to go back to an earlier version of windows 10? When the start
 page does not appear? And one more thing. How do I get someone from Micro Soft to guide me through or connect to my PC to fix the the problem I am having? Can't find anything to call a tech to help me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problem a lot of help from windows tech support. Don't ask me to give the whole process. If you are having this same problem your just going to have a tech guide you through. If you can get him or her to understand the you need to go back to
 an earlier version of Windows 10. Should tell them that you need to go back to earlier build. If that helps you better than it did me. Good luck, &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I see that this is now resolved. For anyone else finding this, you can get to a boot menu that includes "Go back to the previous build" by using SHIFT-Restart from the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another menu option found here is to launch Windows using low-resolution video, which may have enabled you to switch to a workable display adapter driver on the more recent build.</p>

<h2>            WMDC 6.1 no longer launches when I try to sync my phone</h2>
                    <p>I have an HTC MDA Windows 5 phone that has been syncing just fine for many years on my Windows 7 Professional 64-bit PC using Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1. But today the WMDC won't launch when I connect the sync cable from the PC to the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried launching the WMDC from the PC, but it still won't launch even though I have the phone connected with the USB sync cable. There is no error message displayed but nothing happens. The phone's screen does not indicate that there is a sync happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting the PC but WMDC still won't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I uninstall WMDC 6.1 and then reinstall it? If so, do I restart the PC after uninstalling, and then do the reinstall after that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<blockquote>The data was imported into the spreadsheet. The 13:40:50 is text. What is the process for changing 13:40:50 to a number/time value?</blockquote>
<p>There are many ways.&nbsp; If the data are a column or a range of cells one column wide, one way is:</p>
<p>1. Select the cells or column.</p>
<p>2. Right-click, click Format Cells &gt; Number &gt; Time, and select the form that you want.</p>
<p>3. Use the Text To Columns wizard (in Excel 2003, click Data &gt; Text To Columns), clicking Next each step.&nbsp; When you get to the last menu, click the Text radio button, then click Finish.</p>
<p>A more general method:</p>
<p>1. Put the number 1 into an unused cell, and copy it (press ctrl-C).</p>
<p>2. Select the cell(s) or column again.&nbsp; Right-click, click Paste Special &gt; Multiply &gt; OK.</p>
<p>3. Right-click, click Format Cells &gt; Number &gt; Time, and select the form that you want.</p>
<p>That can become tedious if you are importing frequently.&nbsp; In that case, you might want to review your import procedure to see if you can avoid entering the time as text.&nbsp; Usually, an import wizard and paste interpret 13:40:50 as numeric time.&nbsp; How did it
 become text in the first place?</p>

<p>
</p><p>My phone is set to English, and my regional settings are Swiss German (de-CH). So the results should be in English or then in German, but not French. How Microsoft has the idea, I want to read in French?</p>

            Hi. Are you still experiencing this? If yes, we'd love to help. What's your last activity on your phone prior to this issue? Did you change any settings that may cause this? Where did you purchase it, BTW? Under your phone's language, try&nbsp;removing other
 added languages if there's any. Reboot the phone by pressing the volume down &amp; the power keys together &amp; see if it makes any difference. We look forward to your reply.

            <p>Hi, yes. Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>Phone is purchased here in Switzerland at a Swiss Telecom Company.</p>
<p>That happens directly, after I'm using my phone with my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>And it happened which each Lumia I did own. Also after a Hard or Soft Reset.</p>
<p>As language I have only English and German, absolutely no French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wait until i get Windows 10 on my phone, when the error is still there, I switch.</p>
<p>Every iPhone or Android Phone is able to show a English UI with a German keyboard and without a French content.</p>
<p>I assume Microsoft has a false fallback algorithm, because we are using mainly 3 languages (to be exact 4) here. de-CH, fr-CH and it-CH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>for several days I had the same problems as discrebed in the question from 31.12.2012 from another user. You will find that question below. I did all the things writen there with the same results. Now it seems that the mailserver of outlook.de manages to
 download the emails from gmx.net via pop3 again, but there is still a problem.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;outlook.de account is configured to delete the mails&nbsp;after they&nbsp;have been downloaded from gmx.net. With some mails&nbsp;the&nbsp;mailserver is doing it correctly but a lot of mails&nbsp;are
 not&nbsp;deleted after the server of outlook.de has downloaded them. Please help. If you need the account information, please&nbsp;let me know.</p>

<h2>            How to unistall windows 10 technical preview on a hard drive partition</h2>
                    <p>Hi I've had problems with windows 10 which I am running on a hard drive partition.</p>
<p>What is the best way of uninstalling it, reformatting the drive in file explorer or deleting the partition whilst in windows 8, or some other way?</p>
<p>As far as I know there is no way of doing it from in windows 10 when it is run on a dual boot system.</p>

            On my Windows 7 dual boot I went into my Windows partition. Then Administrator Tools, then Computer Management and deleted the appropriate partitions. Before I did that, I went into the control panel (Windows 7), device manager, advanced systems settings,
 advanced, settings and changed the time to display list of operating systems. I changed it to zero and now Windows 7 boots with no delay. At the current time I planning to leave my primary computer at Windows 7 and I am not going to dual boot. Waiting for
 final release to upgrade from Windows to Windows 10. Saying this I do have another computer that is dual booting Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 and I will leave that one at dual boot for the time being. At this time I am updating that computer to build 10130.

<p>Will the PC still think its there when booting up though and did you delete the partition or format it?</p>

            <p>I have a 2 terrabyte drive. It is formatted at NTFS (one big partition). After I deleted the Windows 10 partitions I am back to where I started. I strongly encourage you if you do not know what you are doing leave it alone because you might make you computer
 unbootable or destroy critical files for your existing system.</p>
<p>Simplest way is to make Windows 8 your default OS. If you look at my prior instructions you can change the time Windows 8 boots. You can change the timer but give it time to boot into your other system if necessary. Maybe try 15 seconds to see if works for
 you. You can always change the time once you are certain your computer is booting properly.</p>

            If you are joining by dial in a call in number (i.e. you are not having internet connectivity, hence you want to join through phone), you will be asked to enter conference ID after you dial in the call in number.
<br />
<br />If you are having internet connectivity, then better to join through web link. If you are clicking on a web link to join a meeting, then you require neither call in number not conference ID.

Is the software still activated?<br />
Use File-&gt; Office Account to find out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, contact Microsoft Support by phone. Issues regarding subscriptions and activations are free of charge although you might need to provide credit card information to get to talk to an actual person.</p>

<h2>            Inserting a picture in a word template</h2>
                    <p>I have a template that various text boxes and an insert picture box. I want users to click on the insert picture icon to insert a photo. The problem is when they click on the icon and insert the photo it doesn't completely fill the square shape. Is there
 a way to make it so that whatever image they choose, it will fill the box shape on the page? Using word 2013 and the picture content control from the developers tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>
