<h2>            Using Windows 8 Pro Retail Licence Key To Change From Windows 10 Home To Windows 10 Professional Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a newer refurbished laptop with Windows 7 Home refurbished licence installed and in the future wish to upgrade to Windows 10 (the Get Windows 10 icon has appeared but I have not reserved as yet).</p>
<p>I also have an old laptop that will be scrapped and that laptop has a retail Windows 8 Pro licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: If I wished upgrade (the Windows 7 Home laptop) FOC to Windows 10 Professional (rather than Home) would I need to fully install and activate Windows 8.1 Pro on the Windows 7 Home laptop (before I could upgrade to Windows 10 Professional) or will
 I be able to simply use the Windows 8.1 Pro key during the Windows 10 upgrade process to confirm my upgrade to Windows 10 Professional was valid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would plan to download and instal from a Windows 10 ISO rather than use Windows Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: &nbsp;If I must fully install and activate Windows 8 Pro before upgrading to Windows 10 Professional, could I upgrade initally from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home (standard upgrade) then later (on the same computer) clean install and activate the
 Windows 8 Pro licence and then upgrade FOC to Windows 10 Professional?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 3: Would I be able to transfer the, now unused, Windows 7 Home refurbished licence to a different computer and use that to upgrade to Windows 10 Home?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, you can get a free upgrade for each of your eligible Windows devices. All you need to do is make a separate reservation for each device you want to upgrade.</p>

This represents an unprecedented change in Microsoft's business model of requiring purchase of a license. Windows 10 will be offered two ways to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 users. You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed. Also for persons with limited bandwidth, this will be an excellent way avoid the need to download the update more than once if you have multiple computers. So lets take a look at upgrading

</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition of&nbsp;Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER. a. Software Other than Windows Anytime Upgrade. You may transfer the software and install it on another computer for your use. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between
 computers. </p>
</span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Question 3: Would I be able to transfer the, now unused, Windows 7 Home refurbished licence to a different computer and use that to upgrade to Windows 10 Home?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refurbished licenses do not have transfer rights.</strong></p>

            <p>Hello Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On March 4th 2013 you were asked -</p>
<strong>What is the deal with Windows 8 licensing? Where is the retail full version?</strong>
<p>To this your reply was -</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"There are no full retail versions of Windows 8."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you need a full version, you will need to purchase the Windows 8 Pro OEM from New Egg. "</span></p>
<p>So can you please confirm that the majority of people who purchased a retail copy of Windows 8 actually just purchased an upgrade version and therefore they will have to buy Window 10 if they wish to perform a clean instal or change the hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is correct and I install Windows 10 over the top of my existing OS (as a standard upgrade) what happens if that hard drive fails?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm that I will NOT be able to install Windows 10 on the replacement drive but will in fact have to first install Windows 8 and activate it then instal Windows 10 afterwards? But that will still be an overwrite installation and if I want a "clean
 installation" I will have to perform a second reinstallation of Windows 10 (using the recover tools)? I.e I will need to perform three separate installation procedures just to get my new hard drive working as a "clean installation"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are numerous third party articles stating that Microsoft has said that a clean installation of Windows 10 is possible. The only things I have read from Microsoft are that a clean REINSTALL is possible, but that you dont need your previous Windows 7/8
 keys anymore. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But a CLEAN REINSTALL is, as I'm sure you know, NOT the same as a CLEAN INSTALL. A clean reinstall needs the previous OS to be in place so it would seem that at the very least you have to fully install Windows 7 or 8 onto your replacement drive before you
 can then reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful if Microsoft just clearly stated exactly what you can't as well as can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone is running Windows 10 (obtained via normal Microsoft upgrade) and their hard drive fails what will they need to do to install their FOC version of Windows 10 (as a clean installation not an overwrite) onto the replacement drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

            <p>To further the curiosity you may well have to change BIOS to UEFI in a changeover and thus you must do a cold install.&nbsp; This would not be supported under some older retail OS's so it makes sense to do a cold install with Win 10 so you are current with drivers
 and such.&nbsp; But you are really just transferring your old machine over, it just has to come over in steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sounding like you'd want to finish doing this in Win 8 before going to Win 10 just because of the licensing challenges?&nbsp; And I speak entirely of Retail licensing, meaning you purchased the full boat prior to Win 10 knowing full well you needed to have
 the right kind of license for the ability to upgrade hardware down the road.&nbsp; Just once you have converted to a Win 10 key and tried to cold install that is a difficult time to discover you've run afoul of the licensing gods :)</p>

            Probably wrong version.... I went through same thing. You have to most likely download Windows 10 Home. Then it will activate. Since you didn't mention which version windows 8.1 you had the only logical thing I can think of.

            If you did a clean install of Windows 10 then you will not activate without a retail product key. &nbsp;If you did a clean install then you need to reinstall Windows 8.1, activate it, and then
<em>upgrade </em>to Windows 10. &nbsp;When you <em>upgrade </em>activation is automatic.

 your previous version of windows"..it then repeats the process over and over, etc. &nbsp;Will not boot up. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hello Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret any inconvenience this has caused. We'll be glad to help you fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's proceed with few questions.</p>
<p>a) How are you trying to upgrade Windows 10?</p>
<p>b) When exactly the issue started? Was the installation completed successfully?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer the below article and check if it helps:</p>

<h2>            Can not install Windows updating KB2919355. Error code 80073712.</h2>
                    <p><span>I am using Windows 8.1 64bit, upgraded for free from Windows Store from my original registered OEM Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>I can not install the famous KB2919355 update</span> (error code 80073712 "Windows Update ran into a problem"<span>) and very concerned because I read that it is mandatory in order to receive continued future updates.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I do it manually (downloading
 the file) the installation seems to complete (the green bar&nbsp;reaches 100%) but after&nbsp;a long waiting, a message says I failed to install.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>I guess it is because I updated to Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p>

</span></span>I checked these partitions, just in case. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I got very concerned noting that they look to be empty.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is what I see in Disk Management:: </p>
<p>EFI System Partition<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capacity 300 MB / Free Space 300 MB</p>
<p>Recovery Partition<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capacity 900 MB / Free Space 900 MB</p>

<p>Recovery Partition<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capacity 20,01 GB / Free Space <span>&nbsp;</span>20,01 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal ?<span>&nbsp; </span>Could it be that the DISM command cancelled it, no warning was in your site where you indicated to use these commands ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the long message but I am very concerned, you can understand.</span></p>

<p>I would suggest you and&nbsp;me stop wasting time, only a last question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an 8.0 license officially upgraded by you to 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of common sense&nbsp;I should be allowed to get from you a 8.1 media. Could you explain how to get such a media?&nbsp;&nbsp; If
 this is unfairly denied, I will go back to my 8.0 obviuosly. Bad story.</p>

            <span>Hi
</span><span>Valerio,<br />
<br />
As you have Windows 8 OEM installed on your computer. You have to contact your OEM if you need media. For issues related to KB 2919355, I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Install the latest Windows 8.1 Update<br />

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This may happen if the update isn't installed correctly for the first time, or if the Windows Update settings can't detect the update although it appears that it is installing successfully.
<br />
Just to make sure, we need to know if <strong>KB2990967 </strong>and <strong>KB3063843
</strong>is installed on the machine by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <strong>Control Panel.</strong><br />
2. Click <strong>Programs and Features</strong><br />
3. Then, click on <strong>Show Installed Updates.</strong><br />
<br />
Check if <strong>KB2990967 </strong>and <strong>KB3063843 </strong>articles is listed there. And if so, uninstall them. We recommend that you restart your computer and update through Windows Update.<br />
<br />
If you determine that <strong>KB2990967 </strong>and <strong>KB3063843 </strong>is not installed, try resetting Windows Update components by doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Download the <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Reset-Windows-Update-Agent-d824badc/file/182979/1/ResetWUEng.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Reset Windows Update Agent.</strong></a><br />
2. If prompted, click <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
3. Extract the folder (right-click and click Extract All) and run <strong>ResetWUEng.</strong><br />
4. Restart your computer and run Windows Update.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ntdll.dll file is a file created by Microsoft that has a description of "NT Layer DLL" and is the file that contains NT kernel functions. This file is located in the
<strong>c:\windows\system32. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;lot of programs use NTDLL.DLL. This file is a bridge between user and kernel mode of Windows and used for loading programs that do not rely on the Windows-own mechanics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes NTDLL.DLL is also related to nvidia driver. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the display driver. Follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Uninstall or Reinstall a Device</strong></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you uninstall the <span>
display </span>driver I would suggest you to download the latest version of Display driver from the manufacturer of your computer and then move further to uninstall the display driver.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Installer for Windows 10 has stopped working - how can I fix it when it won&#39;t let me run anything</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really miffed with Windows 10 - every since upgrading my new system is littered with bugs, and I can't enjoy the benefit of a brand new laptop I've purchased. Aside from not being able to download and run something as simple as Adobe Acrobat Reader or
 iTunes, this week the system also stopped Windows updates, Anti-virus updates ... and now I can't download and install any program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking into this issue a little further, it looks like the Windows Installer is not working properly. I've tried the Troubleshooter; it doesn't work. I've tried a Disk Clean; it doesn't work. I've gone into the system and tried to disable and restart the
 Windows Installer but it doesn't allow me to. I've tried to download a Windows Installer for Windows 10<span>&nbsp;to
 correct it, but that doesn't exist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 has brought my entire system to a standstill. Can anyone help with this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Richard&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and compatibility with Canon printer MP240</h2>
                    I was upgraded to Windows 10 from 7 by Microsoft without my permission. Now I can't get my printer to work. I chatted with a service rep who said that my Canon was not compatible and he could restore Windows 7 for me. Has anyone had this problem and had
 7 restored successfully? Do you have a Microsoft contact as I lost my contact with this person.

            <p>You're right there are no drivers but Win 8 drivers MAY work. Funny thing is, there are programs for Win10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something must work if Canon decided to make programs for this printer. For Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the programs dont work, then whats the point in having them on the Canon site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if you connect the printer and check for updates? Do any appear in windowsupdate?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error message "Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected." is usually occurring if there is a write protection tab on your hard drive or the partition file system is corrupted or damaged due to malware infection or
 other unknown reasons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to provide an accurate solution, we would need you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li><li>What changes have you made to the device before this issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest entering the command <strong>chkdsk E: /f /r /x</strong> in Command Prompt. Take note that you should replace
<strong>E</strong> with the drive letter for your PC's hard drive or USB drive. Once done, check if the same issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Important</em>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found when chkdsk tries to repair that sector, any data available on it might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Thanks, for the response. I was able to run chkdsk from the new safe mode on 10 but I can't run it from the run command while in windows 10. When I type in chkdsk with parameters all it does is flash on the screen but it doesn't run.</p>

<h2>            Mapping to a network drive failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am working with Windows 10, trying to map to a network drive, to use an application called Atalaya. I am able to remote into the application program, but I'm
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unable to map directly into the network drive</span>. I never had this issue with Windows 7, so maybe someone knows something I don't. When I try to map into the network drive I am given this prompt. I know I'm not spelling
 anything wrong seeing as how this was how I mapped into the network drive on Windows 7. When I click the
<strong>diagnose button</strong>, I am prompted with a window that tells me, the problem cant be found. If anyone knows something about this, your input would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3> just-a-learner  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to grant local admin access to a specific app in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There is an application that is programmed to ask for local admin password as soon a user tries to launch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only 3-4 users out of 1500+ users who need access to this application and as per the current protocols, these users in question are not meant to have local admin access. However, their job needs them to use this poorly coded application that needs
 local admin access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm trying to find a solution on how to permanently grant admin access to just 1 specific application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a lot of online resources that show how an app can be run as an admin but that will only work till the time admin password does not change. I'm trying to find a better solution, if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/advise is greatly appreciated :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Just-a-learner.
<br />
<br />It is not possible to share admin rights only for one tasks. At least I have never heard that something was changed in this area.
<br />
<br />Anyway you always can clarify this question using this community:

            Hi Sameoldstory,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for using Microsoft Answers!&nbsp;I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with Windows 7, lets see if we can resolve the issues you're having!</div>
<div><br />
<div>What specific programs are you having trouble with?</div>
<div>Have you ensured that these programs are Windows 7&nbsp;compatible? I'd recommend searching for the software
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;to ensure they are compatible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If Compatibility Mode didn't help resolve the issue, have a look at Windows 7's XP Mode!&nbsp;Windows XP Mode lets you run older Windows XP software right on your Windows 7 desktop. Designed primarily with small- and medium-sized businesses in mind, Windows
 XP Mode comes as a separate download and works only with Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, and Enterprise.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows XP Mode also requires virtualization software such as Windows Virtual PC. Both are available free on the Microsoft website. To download Windows XP Mode or learn about its system requirements, visit the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=160668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Virtual PC</a> website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully that helps resolve your software issues. I anxiously await your response!</div>
