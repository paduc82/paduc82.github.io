<h2>            Excel 2007&#58; Can I make the Find &#38; Replace cell more easily visible&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;HI,</span></p>

<p><span>I find that searching for a cell in large spreadsheet is not easily visible as the result cell is only very lightly shaded with white at the darker background.</span></p>

<p><span>Is there anyway I could set the result cell to have red outline&nbsp;in light yellow color ?</span></p>

<p><span>This will make the result cell more obviously seen.</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<h2>            IE 10 overriding Adobe Reader 11 print settings</h2>
                    When printing a PDF from web application, IE 10 defaults to "Actual Size". &nbsp;Have adjusted the registry entries for Adobe Reader 11 which defaults printer settings to "Shrink oversized pages". &nbsp;Need to know if there is a registry setting for the Adobe Plug-in
 which will allow for the default setting of "Shrink oversized pages" to persist. &nbsp;Or is there a way to default the radio button to "Shrink oversized pages" in IE 10. &nbsp;

<h2>            Publisher Auto converts from a Print Publication to a Web Publication upon save&#33;</h2>
                    I have created a Newsletter in Publisher 2007 and saved as a Print Publication but every time I re-open the file it auto converts to a web publication.&nbsp; I have browsed the net and it seems many people have this same problem but so far I haven't seen a
 solution.

<p>Did you start with a newsletter template and was it a print publication or web publication to begin with?</p>
<p>When you go to File &gt; Convert to a print publication a dialog comes up that gives you the option of "Yes,&nbsp;save my web publication and then convert to a print publication" or the second option of "No, do not save my web publication before converting it to
 a print publication". Sounds like you may be choosing the first option and then opening the web publication again. Try the second option and see if this fixes your problem.</p>
<p>Why does it matter if it is a print or web publication...what problem does that create for you?</p>

<p>Hi thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Newsletter was originally saved as a Print Publication for Publisher 2007 although later had to be converted to a Publisher 98 file so I could also edit on another PC with only Pub 98 on it. &nbsp;&nbsp; But this didn't seem a problem for about 2 weeks as it was
 still opening as a Print Publication and all was fine (on both PC's) .. until yesterday, (and I can't seem to fathom why something I did was so different yesterday)!</p>
<p>The reason it is a problem is that the 'Word wrap' option won't work in a Web Publication (as I discovered in the help documentation) and this is how I realised there was a problem as I have lots of text boxes which include text wrapped around pictures in
 the document and suddenly they weren't wrapping any longer.</p>
<p>I've tried both options on the Convert dialogue box (several times) and I've even tried saving to a different folder but neither option seems to make a difference.&nbsp; All that happens (in both options) is that open document reverts to a Print Publication (which
 I can continue working on) but when I save (I have to always 'save as' to ensure it saves in 98 version) and then open again I can see (for about 2 seconds) that it opens as a Print document then immediately auto changes to a Web Publication!</p>
<p>Apologies .. when I mentioned 'many people have this problem' I was referring to other forums across the web!&nbsp; I couldn't actually find this problem listed in this forum - hence my entry!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>OK then, it sounds like the problem is associated with your conversion to Pub 98 file format&nbsp;which is a different file format than Pub 2003 and newer. In other words you can open a Pub 2003, 2007 and 2010 file in any of those versions, but not in Pub 98.
 And though you can open older versions of Publisher in the newer ones sometimes the formatting will change. In fact there is usually some sort of warning to that effect when you save as an older, incompatible version.&nbsp;When you save as a Pub 98 file and then
 reopen in Pub 2007 that appears to create the problem.</p>
<p>It also sounds like you will probably have to live with the problem as long as you are jumping back and forth between Pub 98 and Pub 2007. Even though you assert this to be a common problem, I don't think there are too many people converting back and forth
 between Pub 98 and 2007. Perhaps someone else will have an idea, but all I can think of is to open a blank print publication in Pub 2007 and copy and paste the content from your original publication and save it...and then save as a Pub 98 file. Maybe there
 is something associated with the original Pub 2007 file being a web file that is creating the problem.</p>

<p>Hi yes my first impression was it would be something to do with the 'version conversion' but I couldn't explain why it was ok using it this way for 2 weeks before the problem occurred!&nbsp; I know some of the others (on other forums) with the problem mentioned
 converting between 2007, 2003 and 2002 also but some just didn't mention so it is likely that this is the cause and I just 'got lucky' for 2 weeks!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it happens I have now been assured the PC with Office 98 that I work on will be upgraded to 2007 within the next week or two so hopefully my problem will be eradicated from there!&nbsp; I will let you know what happens!</p>

            So.... no answers? &nbsp; I have almost exact problem.&nbsp; Why is this happening and how do we stop it?&nbsp; Interestingly enough it reoccurs with every new created document but doesn't seem to reoccur with older documents&nbsp; ie those first created before the problem
 first emerged <br />

            Hi Evelyn
<br />
<br />When you try to open Skype, are you getting an error or does it just not open at all?
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can try accessing it through Skype for Web:
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Check if you can access it.
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />
<br />Please uninstall Skype 12 and install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.30.0.50.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The
<strong>coverage for the other countries are only for landlines</strong>. Calls to mobiles are not covered.

    <title>Current Alt - Tab implementation - Nice Work, Microsoft&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Current Alt - Tab implementation - Nice Work, Microsoft&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I just wanted to post some positive feedback.&nbsp; There are some things being done right...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen shown on Alt-Tab is now good, in my opinion - NIGHT AND DAY better than that which was in prior Win 10 TP releases.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Partial transparency that does not obliterate the desktop, and all the open windows are still back there.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>No "Desktop" entry.&nbsp; I never want to "minimize all", and accidentally doing so on a Shift-Alt-Tab is very disruptive.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Icons are still big enough to easily differentiate windows.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This exactly matches a suggestion I made via the Feedback App some months ago.&nbsp; Perhaps I wasn't alone.&nbsp; All I can say is:&nbsp; Thanks, Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only improvement I can still think of (we can always dream of better) is that it
<strong>would be AWESOME if the ordering of the windows in the list could be configured to match the Z-order
</strong>(i.e., make it&nbsp;the ordering used in the time of XP again).&nbsp; If I minimize a window, why not have it go to the end of the list?&nbsp; I still haven't shaken off my old muscle memory / mental image, set apparently by my usage of Windows before Vista, of where
 the applications should appear in the list.&nbsp; Microsoft forgot, when they changed away from the Z-order, that people well in tune with the way their desktop is ordered often don't even need to look at the Alt-Tab display to get the right application up.</p>

<h3> jeniferhordge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the Qarantine notification Configuration frequency to every 12 hrs</h2>
                    
<p>currently the quarantine notification configuration frequency is only from 1 to 15 days however our users would like to receive the notification twice a day, so every .5 days.
</p>
<p>are there any plans in the future to allow for the configuration frequency to be changed to allow for .5 days or hour increments?

            Hello! I am an independent consultant.
<br />I recommend you check if you have an older version of office on the same computer you can not run it
<br />It can also be enabled. Running multiple versions of Office on Windows is not supported when Remote Desktop Services (RDS) is enabled.
<br />Here is a link to the recommendations of the office to install and use different versions of Office on the same PC.
<br />

            It sounds like you have a trial version of Office 365 on your new computer (very usual).&nbsp; You need to uninstall it.

            Hi  JawadSCSA 
<br />
<br />You likely have a trial installed that is conflicting with your personal copy of Office.
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Proceed to reinstall your personal copy.
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

<h2>            Console windows do not open at the correct size&#47;dimensions</h2>
                    <p>The last several Fast Ring builds have an issue where the any console window (or PowerShell, or Bash) do not open at the correct height/width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The defaults on the dialog&nbsp;for me say 120x35 but they always open far smaller. I have to manually resize each window to the correct size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work but broke about 3-4 builds ago. Known issue? Fix on the way?</p>
<p>

Type <strong>PowerShell</strong> on the Windows search bar, right click on the <strong>
Windows PowerShell</strong> and select <strong>Open file location.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> and select <strong>properties</strong> from the drop down.</p>
</li><li>Click on <strong>Layout</strong> tab, set up your choice console size and click on Ok.
</li></ol>

Hope this helps. We look forward to hear from you. </p>

<p>
</p><p>When I look at the properties tab, it says 58x13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I look at the defaults -&gt; layout tab, it says 120x30. It's not opening that size.</p>

            That's not helpful. SFC and DSIM are not relevant here. This happens to many people and is an issue with the fast ring. It's not specific to one PC either, this happens on both of my fast ring ones. And yes, they're on the latest flight. This started happening
 3-4 flights ago.

 cannot find any details about how or where to return a phone under warranty.

    <title>Create a Birthdays and Anniversaries from My Contacts in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amma904  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a Birthdays and Anniversaries from My Contacts in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook 2016 Home and Business (but as a home user, only) that does show "File" (so the desktop version?)</p>
<p>My goal is to have list of birthdays and anniversaries - by month then day&nbsp;so I can&nbsp;acknowledge&nbsp; the events - and also have a list&nbsp;that I can share with my children for their information.</p>
<p>Years ago, this used to be easily accomplished (back before Outlook 2000?) - as I remember it, you just clicked on "Lists" -&nbsp;but it's been a long time ago!</p>
<p>I have seen there are "Business Contact Reports" in which&nbsp;content can modified - but the directions say "In the Ribbon, click on Reports" - I can't find&nbsp;"Reports" anywhere so I can't follow the path - If this is what I need to use, how, specifically, do
 I get to "Reports" (e.g. Open Outlook 2016, click on Contacts, Click on ______, Click on _______, etc.)</p>

<p>You could try mounting the official public ISO that you get after running the Media Creation Tool and "upgrading" to the same version, by running setup.exe from it. But that really should be the same.</p>

</p><p>Additionally, if you are an Windows Insider who wants to stay on the Windows 10 Creators Update – you will need to go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Insider Program</strong> and press the “Stop Insider Preview builds” button.

<p>A menu will pop up and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">you will need to choose

                    <p><span>I have ribbon customisations set up for all my Office apps. For whatever reason, Outlook keeps resetting the customisations on the Read Mail view. This happens apparently
 at random, sometimes when starting Outlook, sometimes when just paging through emails.

</p><p><span>This only started when I was switched from Office 2016 to Office 365.</span></p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the online repair and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode disables all customisations, so isn't helpful in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving views doesn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my custom ribbon:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c637b6b2-9d6e-407a-a7e6-5ef18dd59236?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c637b6b2-9d6e-407a-a7e6-5ef18dd59236?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the ribbon that </p>
<p>Outlook keeps resetting itself to:</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're already aware of this issue and our developers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. For the meantime, you may use the classic Skype 7.41 or Skype for Web to continue receiving notification alerts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) does not start up automatically, you may need to pin the Skype app on the taskbar or send it to your desktop screen to access the application easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>
