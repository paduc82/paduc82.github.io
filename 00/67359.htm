    <title>Start menu not working in windows 10 creators update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rasta vybz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu not working in windows 10 creators update</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to windows 10 creators update only to find that my start menu and notification center stopped working. I tried to go back before the upgrade but my computer said sorry we can't do that because the files needed are no longer available.
 I also tried doing a system restore and I realized that all previous restore points were deleted by the upgrade and a new one was created. I read some articles on the internet and decided that most of them I did not want to do like deleting all my apps and
 starting over or most just didn't work according to their replies. I finally came up with a very simple solution that fixed this problem. Simply go
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and download the upgrade again by clicking on "Download tool now" and when you install make sure that the options to keep your files and settings are checked. It worked for me and should for you too.</p>

            The solution to download the upgrade again and reinstall fixed issues I had after the Creators Update. Cortana and the Search Box would not open and no other fixes worked. Thanks!

            Hi Mahdimiri.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Read over this Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 slow start up problem -- Onedrive starting up takes a few minutes</h2>
                    My Lenovo X230 has a slow start up problem recently. Every time I restart the computer, the Onedrive icon on the right lower corner shows that the Onedrive is starting up, and the HDD light keeps blinking. After a few minutes, everything comes back to
 normal. Is it normal for Onedrive to start up so slowly since there is no changes to the onedrive folder?&nbsp; why would it take so long even though there is nothing to sync? Thanks.<br />

            <p>OneDrive doesn't know if there had been no changes if it was shut down, so upon installation it goes through every file and compares it to the one on the server to see which one has been changed.&nbsp; Then it has to compare the meta data to find out which one
 "wins the version battle" to become the synced version.&nbsp; So yes, it's normal for disk and network traffic to be highly utilized as it starts and initializes again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I would recommend using "sleep" instead of full shutdowns.</p>

            I know this answer is going to be unbelievable, but Microsoft for some unknown reason does not allow web pages to be saved from the Edge browser
<br />
<br />My advice - use a different browser!

<h2>            Can&#39;t Add PayPal Payment Option</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click the link to add PayPal as a payment option in the account settings, it takes me to a page that says "Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>Is there a way round this, or is there something I need to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>If the problem is a security breach why is Microsoft not saying something, all I keep getting as a response is "try this page" and "do you have a PayPal account". Do we need another Sony incident, no. I hope the issue can be resolved quickly though.</p>

<h2>            opening photos in File Explorer on my Dell laptop</h2>
                    I save photos on my iphone in an icloud folder. But when I open those photos on my Dell laptop in File Explorer, the photos are upside down. The icon shows the photo as right side up, but when I click on the photo to open it, the photo is upside down.
 Very frustrating. Any help?

<p>That's super odd.&nbsp; Before we try any corrective action, can we explore a little to see if we can determine the scope of the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:&nbsp; right-click a picture file, point to&nbsp;<strong>open with&gt;</strong> and choose a different program from the list.&nbsp; Try a few of those other programs and see if the upside down issue only happens with one of them, or all of them.</p>

            Okay, I opened a few of the photos that were upside down when opening in Microsoft Office Picture Manager, using ArcSoft Photo Viewer, and they opened correctly. I also tried by using something called "Photos" (which I think came with my Dell laptop),
 and with Paint, and the photos openly correctly in both of these. So it appears to be a problem with Microsoft Office Picture Manager.

<p>Well, I have some bad news (or maybe not depending on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Picture Manager was discontinued back in 2013.&nbsp; Since it's a discontinued "dead" product, it won't ever get any updates to make it work with new picture formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you take a picture on a phone, the phone records what direction is "down" (based on the sensor in the phone, the same thing that makes the screen rotate when you turn the phone around).&nbsp; But the Office Picture Manager is too old to know about that kind
 of technology, so it can't read it and show the picture the right way up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really the only thing you can do is use a more modern program that is built to understand modern picture formats.</p>

<h2>            graphics glitches on 1x</h2>
                    <p>My xbox 1x seems to develop a problem after a few hours of gameplay, particularly on Destiny 2.</p><p><br /></p><p>After a period I get stray flying polygons and other odd graphical glitches suck as elongated, flickering objects. I've only noticed this on Destiny 2, but then again I don't tend to play a lot else at the moment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Back in my PC days this was a symptom of the graphics card overheating. Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

            <p>It is possible for the Xbox to get GPU&nbsp;artifacts like a PC&nbsp;does, since they are essentially the same kind of&nbsp;device.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep playing normally and see if the problem gets worse. If possible, check if other games exhibit this issue as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ensure that your Xbox has adequate ventilation to prevent overheating. If it continues to show these graphical artifacts&nbsp;at a predictable rate, or it gets to the point of abruptly shutting your Xbox down, then it is indeed an issue with the Xbox&nbsp;GPU&nbsp;and your console&nbsp;will need to be sent in to Microsoft for repair.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, I've just assembled a new PC and am getting frequent BSOD's with error code 124 (unrecoverable hardware error).</p>

</p><p>On day 1, the blue screens were about an hour apart.. now (day two), it blue screens within 30 seconds of Windows loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't blue screen in safe mode.</p>

<p>I removed the video card (Gigabyte R2 290X) and am using the onboard graphics for now. I uninstalled the Gigabyte software and drivers.</p>

<p>Hi i am having the same issue, its has been almost a year now and its its still not fixed.</p>
<p>I have had an XBOX One from launch day and One Guide has worked fine up until late last year when ITV HD disappeared from its slot between BBC 2 HD and Channel 4 HD.</p>
<p>I can find the channel if you scroll right down the list and it is there but without any programe info, if you click on it you can view it. There are a few other channels like it as well.</p>
<p>I know its not a tuner issue as it finds and tunes all the channels fine but it isn't where it should be in One Guide.</p>
<p>I did raise it as an issue back before Christmas but never got any feedback from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you change your provider to You View, the channel returns to the correct place but it and lots of other channels dont have any program data.</p>
<p>I have done resets, retuned many times and as you can see even tried other things but nothing works to get it back the way it was.</p>
<p>I have just brought an XBOX One X for another room and a TV tuner for that as well and its still the same with that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft look into this issue as it is preventing me from using just the XBOX as our primary source for TV as the missis wants Coronation Street on now and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has got to be such a simple fix to associate the ITV HD channel info with channel 103 so why is it taking so long to sort.</p>

    <title>Unable to sign in to my Skype account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to sign in to my Skype account &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; for no reason - username and p&#47;w are valid</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been using this account&nbsp;*********** for years. I just bought a new iphone and I tried to download the app and log in. My username and password are all valid but then I get a message that due to unusual activity (obviously it’s unusual logging in from
 a new device) Microsoft needs to verify some info. My yahoo email address hasn’t been used for years (again years ago I tried to reset my p/w without success and I never heard back from anyone in yahoo so since then I have been unable to use that email account)
 so I cannot get the code you would send there. When I click “I don’t have this account anymore” it prompts me to fill out a form for recovery with verification questions. I filled out this form twice, providing even the day I last purchased skype credit, the
 last digits of my credit card, my contacts, etc but both times they emailed me back saying they were unable to authenticate the ownership of the account. This has been really frustrating as there is no way to speak to a representative. I provided the info
 that was required for verification but it got rejected. I would be more than happy to provide any other kind of proof but there's no way to access my yahoo account.I have spent hours trying to find a number to call or an email address. For a company like Microsoft
 this is quite disappointing. I need access to my account. Please advise asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Maria</p>

<p>Hello MariaStavrinou,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I encourage you to keep trying to recover your account one more time from the methods you've tried if you remember any new details that might help, but it may be time to consider creating a new account instead.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try below tips:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Fill out the form from a computer that you have successfully signed into.</span></li><li><span>Fill oout the form from a network location where a previous sign-in occured.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that Microsoft takes your security very seriously, but to protect customer privacy we can’t do anything to an account beyond helping customers verify their ownership through the steps we’ve already tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you!</span></p>

            <p>If it's an Xbox gift card that adds currency to your account, it is not possible to use that to renew gold. Gold can only be purchased via credit card/PayPal or by purchasing a prepaid gold card from a retailer.</p><p><br /></p><p>If it's a prepaid gold card but you have a balance you owe, you would need to first pay off the balance you owe before you can use the prepaid card. If you need further assistance, you would need to contact support and speak to billing. Http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</p><p><br /></p>
