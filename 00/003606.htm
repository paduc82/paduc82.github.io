<h2>            WIndows says it is scheduled to restart at a certain time when I boot into Windows 10 preview</h2>
                    Every time&nbsp; boot my PC into Windows 10 preview build 9926, I get a notification that Windows is scheduled to restart at 12:00am to finish installing updates.&nbsp; When I check the Windows update settings, in the update history, all updates have installed successfully
 and the only update installed is the update for Defender definitions.&nbsp; Is there something I'm missing?<br />

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you are getting the prompt to restart the computer after the Windows updates whenever you logging to the computer. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which version of Windows 10 TP ins installed on the computer? Is it Windows 10 TP Pro or Enterprise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have recently installed one Windows update on the computer, that update might demand a force restart. You might have postponed the restart till now.&nbsp;Some update requires a restart to complete the installation completely so I suggest you to restart
 the computer when it is prompted and check if it repeats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.
</p>
<p>

            The version is the WIndows 10 TP Pro.&nbsp; I had tried all the registry hacks I found in this forum regarding Windows update issues, nut none worked.&nbsp; I had rebooted several times, at least 10.&nbsp;

            PS, I have been trying to use the Windows picture log-in feature, too.&nbsp; It will go through the entire process and tell me it was successful, but it won't show up when I log in.&nbsp; I try it again and it does the same thing as if I had never set it up before.&nbsp;
 I don't think the 2 are related, but I thought I would mention it.<br />

            To this point, Windows 10 is working wonderfully.&nbsp; I have resolved all issues.&nbsp; I have one concern that it keeps trying to install the NVIDIA HD sound driver.&nbsp; When it installed it before, it would lead to BSOD intermittently when I tried to play a game.&nbsp;
 I re-installed the original motherboard sound drivers and that took care of the problem.&nbsp; Recently, the NVIDIA driver was re-installed through Windows update (Tuesday).&nbsp; I have yet to encounter the same issue.&nbsp; If it comes back, I will post again.&nbsp; Thanks
 for your help.<br />

<p>I just had a situation that was disturbing.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, I got a message that Windows 10 (9926) needs to reboot at a certain time, about 5 minutes away.&nbsp; I can either click to reboot then, or reboot now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to shut down and reboot, and I have no idea what it was updating or why.&nbsp; But here's the concern:&nbsp; Suppose I'm playing music at an event, and out of nowhere it decides to reboot in five minutes -- or by itself if I'm not immediately in front of
 the screen.&nbsp; I'm happy to reboot and update, but right now???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had enough trouble with Windows 7.&nbsp; I would be playing music at an outdoor event.&nbsp; Suddenly it starts to rain.&nbsp; Shut down and put things away, quickly.&nbsp; I shut down the computer and get a screen that says, "Updating 1 of 57 updates -- do not turn off
 your computer"!!!!!!&nbsp; Stick it in the truck like it is, under battery, and hope it shuts off eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course with Windows 10 around the corner&nbsp;I suppose I won't&nbsp;be using Windows 7 much longer.&nbsp; But what can I expect fo find?&nbsp; Will my computer keep shutting down with surprise updates?&nbsp; Please tell me I'll have a little more control over this!</p>

            You should be able to adjust that reboot time or change it to let you reboot when you want.&nbsp; Go to System and a message will show notifying of the time of shutdown.&nbsp; You should be able to adjust it or turn it off until you want to reboot.&nbsp; As far as installing
 updates, you can change how Windows does updates.&nbsp; You can change it so that it only looks for updates and asks you permission to install or you can change it to not even look until you do it manually.&nbsp; These changes can be made in System - Update and Recovery.&nbsp;
 Look for the advanced options.<br />

<p>Most printers can't print to the very edge of the paper; instead, there will be a certain nonprinting area (required for feeding the paper through the printer).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to get a printer which is capable of printing "full bleed." Alternatively, you can print to a larger paper format and then cut the "excessive" white areas of the paper.<br />

<h2>            How to sync Outlook notes from an outlook.com account with an iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I configured an outlook.com account on my iPhone (iOS7) and just learned, that are only the following assets available for sync:<br />
Mails, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders.<br />
<br />
Is it true, that I cannot sync my Outlook notes with my iPhone anymore (via EAS)?<br />
Why would that feature have been disabled with outlook.com?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Best,<br />

            <p>Hi Thomas, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum. I am happy to assist you on your concern on syncing the Outlook notes with iPhone via EAS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For clarification, what do you mean of <em>"Outlook notes"?</em> Are you referring to OneNote file, Outlook contact note or something else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're referring to OneNote files, you can sync it to your phone by using the SkyDrive application for mobile devices.&nbsp; To download the app, please go to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case, please provide a detailed description of your issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Levi,<br />
<br />
thanks for your reply.<br />
What I mean are the sticky notes in Microsoft Outlook. Within the left panel there are different features like "Mail", "Calendar", "Tasks", and also "Notes".<br />
I used to synchronize them via Exchange, but it seems like EAS does not support Microsoft Outlook Notes synchronization. Is that true?<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 and download of maps &#40;HERE Drive&#43;&#41; to SD &#40;Lumia 640 LTE&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a Lumia 640 LTE (WP 8.1 Update 2 -- 8.10.15148.160)</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not anymore possible to download and save the map(s) on the SD Card - all maps are saved on the internal Memory.</p>
<p>Assuming that an upgrade to Windows 10 is possible (which will take more internal Memory space), will it then possible to save the maps on the SD Card? I would be disappointed if this would not be the case. Thank you for your Feedback.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 conflicting with chart.dll</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Office 2016, Outlook will not operate.&nbsp; Click on 'new email' (or doing just about anything) and this dialog box pops up...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4fdace1-4340-4959-a0ac-9774c6dacd9e" /></p>
<p>Outlook then shuts down and tries to reopen and gets into a loop of freezing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other Office programs work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking online I've tried these fixes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install the chart program with this .dll file and that didn't remove the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the .net framework installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall Office 2016 and then reinstall numerous times: still no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10, desktop PC.&nbsp; Office 2013 worked fine and I wish I could go back to it!</p>

            <p>Yes the version is 16.0.6001.1034.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem would occur in safe mode or normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, the program would start but clicking on any part of it would produce the "chart.dll error" dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            You're lucky the problem went away. It's still happening on my computer. I reverted to Office 2013 on two other computers, and have left 2016 on this computer so I can check if the problem is resolved. It still isn't.

            <p>Yes, the same problem occurred on 3 computers. I reverted two of them to Office 2013 so they could be used for Outlook. I have kept the third on Office 2016 so I could monitor if the problem gets resolved. So far, it hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the OffCAT tool and it generated a report. It reported no errors, 6 warnings and 5 informational issues. The 6 warnings are duplicate entries for two issues, neither of which seem relevant:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>2 x "The path for the 'Cache' value under the 'User Shell Folders' key is not the default value</li><li>4 x "Possible Outlook search or indexing issue (event 10023 or 10024).</li></ul>
<p>The first issue can cause issues with images displaying in html e-mail messages, according to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753594. I do not have that issue. I went ahead and checked the registry key anyway, and found that it is actually set to
 the same path as the default value, but specified as a full path (starting "C:\Users\") rather than the default that uses a system variable (starting "%USERPROFILE%"). Just in case, I changed the value of the key to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entries for a search issue were triggered by a single occurrence of event 10023 a week ago, where a protocol host process did not respond and was forcibly terminated. The issue relates to errors in the Outlook search function with the PDF filter. Again,
 I do not have that problem. My PC is configured to use the Microsoft PDF filter. I went ahead and followed the recommendation to rebuild the search index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, neither of those actions has helped. The issue continues to occur every time I launch Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, unfortunately, OffCAT does not seem to have helped with this issue.</p>

            <p>T9 is such a bad method for texting. You have a full keyboard. Just choose your language from the keyboard settings. Yes, it's a change to get used to, but holding on to T9 at this point is dumb. T9 was designed for phones without keyboards. This phone has
 a keyboard.</p>

            Ehhh.. Ok, a strange thing to say since I want both options. This is in fact the safest way doen for a producer, taking these decitions for the users. T9 har of course full keybord as an option, this is definively my last Windows Phone. It is impossible
 to tuch one key at the time, or the right key!

            I'm not sure if you are serious... I have had the newest business phones since the 450 system..., several iphones and android phones. Most actors in the Phone marked thrive to develop better and better products. This is in fact the first time I have seen
 some backwords, and om top of that with poor excuses. Windows 7 is the reason why I will by a new phone tomorrow!

            If you've had iPhone and Androids, I'm not sure why you're having problems with the keyboard then. T9 is going backwards. The iPhone doesn't have T9. Android can probably get a T9 hack. So why single out Windows Phone?<br />

            Both android and iphones have the possibility to choose smaller keyboards, I don't care what they are called, but it is totally uneccesary with a full keyboard, and much harder to use with one hand. Thats why

            Well, you got the TITAN. Smaller Windows Phones are easier to use if you have smaller hands. So it's not the software, but the hardware.<br />
I would suggest choosing a smaller model if the TITAN is too big. I too cannot type one handed with the TITAN.<br />

            I see that you are not going to take me serious as a customer, this is a waste of time. I'll just repeat this one more time for you: with that many keys on a relatively small space you are bound to hit the wrong key all the time, THAT is the problem

            I suggested TextTextRevolution to help improve accuracy. Please note the MVPs do not work for Microsoft.<br />
<br />
In my own experience, I'm actually less accurate on an iPhone due to the keyboard setup and the very tiny screen compared to the phones I'm now used to. I constantly end up closing the keyboard when typing.<br />
<br />
If you feel there are too many keys, you can suggest a reduced keyboard set at the
<a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">suggestion box</a>.<br />
<br />
It's just, in the year and half I've been dealing with Windows Phone, you are the absolute first I've seen to say there are too many keys on screen.<br />

            <p>Here's an app you might want to check out:</p>
<p>T9 Keyboard:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=f29b9598-65e6-4cb5-a626-6e55fe456127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=f29b9598-65e6-4cb5-a626-6e55fe456127</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, typing with the onscreen keyboard will most definitely improve for you as you continue to use it.&nbsp; It's almost like the phone goes through a conditioning period when you first use it and adjusts its sensitivity to more closely match your touch.&nbsp;
 If you stick with it you'll see what I mean.</p>

    <title>Unable to connect to WHS V1 after upgrade to Preview build 10159, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davezavah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to WHS V1 after upgrade to Preview build 10159, 10162, or 10166</h2>
                    <p><span>I'll try to make this easy to follow...</span></p>

<p><span>Somewhere between the back to back updates to 10159 &amp; 10162 I noticed that my access to my HP MediaSmart server (WHS V1) was blocked.&nbsp; It was stating that my user ID did not have access
 to the folder (main WHS folder).&nbsp; This had happened with my initial beta testing for Win8 and my initial clean install of&nbsp;Win10 preview&nbsp;but was solved using Credential Manager each time.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Prior to noticing the loss of access to WHS I had been struggling with my Login PIN not working for the 3 MS accounts on the PC &amp; 1 MSA on my Venue 8 Pro.&nbsp; I was pointed to the PIN solution
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_security/pin-still-missing-in-build-10159-is-there-a-fix/b6d227a4-3b20-437d-a971-621704546d5c">
HERE</a>.&nbsp; It basically involved deleting the stored user info (I think)&nbsp;and recreating my PINs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I mention this because I am testing Win10 on 3 PCs.&nbsp; The 2 mentioned above, I fixed the PIN issue, now both no longer have access to the WHS.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I hadn't bothered fixing the PIN issue
 on the 3rd PC &amp; it still has access to the WHS folders.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling the connector software on the primary PC but during install it is saying that the Home Server password is incorrect.&nbsp; I KNOW it is correct &amp; have confirmed
 by remote desktop-ing into the admin account of the server.&nbsp; The DV8P has never had the WHS connect software installed. &nbsp;I found the server in the file system and created a short cut to it.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I will try a clean install from the 10162 ISO next but had hoped to avoid that if possible.&nbsp; Does anyone have any thoughts?</span></p>

<p>At about this time I was prompted if I wanted to block cookies (strange, unusual pop up, haven't seen it before). So I decided to block all cookies.

<p>Note: in case it means anything, I recently had to use the admin user on this laptop. I was in my usual user account when all this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook came back with the usual screen; my user name and pw were present. Click on ok and the screen went to the 'retrieving e-mail' message and then immediately back to the log in screen. This continues as long as I want to play this game with the silicon
 intelligence.</p>
<p>I have checked the credential manager, there is only one entry for Outlook and the pw there matches what I am using.</p>
<p>Another thing, when the login fails the screen comes back with the 'forgot your password' hypertext; so I clicked on it a couple of times. This repeats ad infinum also. I can enter the text and submit and I get another screen that asks me to enter the visible
 text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on this? I hope to use this for business tomorrow.</p>

            <p>I am confused here.</p>
<p>I have a microsoft account whereby I go to the forum where I posted this problem. I have two e-mail accounts I use; one with a local ISP; the other is through the outlook program.
</p>
<p>I do not use any microsoft e-mail account. I may have one somehow but I have never used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, getting back to the link you sent me. This takes me to changing my pw on the microsoft account. Is this the outlook pw? or another pw to an account I am not familiar with? In other words were I to change this pw would it be for the outlook account;
 the pw for logging in to the forum? or another account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget, I cannot retrieve anything through outlook at this time so resetting the pw and having a temporary one sent to that address would do me absolutely no good. I know of no other microsoft e-mail address. I may have one but am not aware of it and
 do not use it - I don't need a lot of e-mail accounts and don't want a plethora of them. Two is enough; one for personal, one for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did mention that the system, when I tried the 'forget your password' link in outlook, would only return a screen with the robo prevention code changed.</p>

<p><strong>I am having issues with my OutlookOFFICE365 account.</strong> NOT the run of the mill microsoft outlook account.</p>

<h2>            Office Standard 2016 Volume License Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about Office 2016 volume license and its updates.</p>
<p>In my company I installed some Office Standard 2016 with the volume license in several laptops with Windows 7 that are in a workgroup environment&nbsp;and not a domain, apparently I am not able to receive updates for office directly from Microsoft server. Is
 this a limitation of a volume license that I can only receive updates from my WSUS server with machine joint to the domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. These options are independent and can be executed in any sequence. Do let me know if these don't work for you. If not, I will provide further troubleshooting steps to you to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this.

            I think I've solved the issue. Before I tried your suggestions, I stumbled upon this 'inspect document' option. And it turned out that there was some 'hidden text' that was causing this issue. I don't know how it got there or how to insert such text in
 word. Anyway, thank you.

</p><p>When you click the <strong>Download now</strong> button and receive the <strong>

    <title>Toggle One or Multiple Chart Series On or Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil hageman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toggle One or Multiple Chart Series On or Off</h2>
                    <p>I have created an Excel data model for daily inputs to ten data points, and want to chart all ten series for two years on a single chart. Workbook layout is 24 worksheets, one worksheet for each month with sections for daily input of the ten data points,
 and a worksheet for charting.<span>&nbsp; </span>Worksheet names: Jan 2013, Feb 2013….Charts.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Problem is, a ten-series chart is too cluttered to analyze.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A solution would be to toggle any one or multiple series off and on to clarify the chart and make series comparisons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon Peltier has a great idea using formulas and checkboxes on his web site at:
<a href="http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Charts/ChartByControl.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://peltiertech.com/Excel/Charts/ChartByControl.html</a> <span>&nbsp;</span>, but the solution I want is to add check boxes on the chart itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a thread on OzGrid, <a href="http://www.ozgrid.com/forum/showthread.php?t=21832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ozgrid.com/forum/showthread.php?t=21832</a> , Andy Pope and others discuss the topic using code and even a UserForm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet a third discussion is at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/delete-chart-series-with-toggle-button/4e62d26e-ffab-4241-9c0a-a8d1edfaff8c">

</span>The idea of using a single macro for the various worksheets seems efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these discussions are very smart, and have great ideas.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this model, code/checkboxes is my choice for a single chart for the two-year project.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can someone help me create this toggling feature?<span>&nbsp; </span>Would really appreciate any help.</p>

            To create the checkboxes on the chart itself will cause several problems, checkboxes on a userform is a better way.<br />
<br />
I did not look at the files that Andy Pope provides in the thread you mention, I guess that solution did not work for you, because you've created this thread, right?<br />
<br />
My basic idea is to use hide or show the series itself, each series has a Format object which has a Line object with a Visible property.<br />
<br />
But as we did not know how many series are in the chart, we must create the checkboxes on the fly on the userform and use a class module for the predefinied event routines.<br />
<br />
Sounds compilcated, but it isn't. Add a class module and name it "MyEventHandler" and paste in this code:<br />
<br />
--- schnipp ---<br />
Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Dim WithEvents CHB As MSForms.CheckBox<br />
Dim WithEvents COB As MSForms.CommandButton<br />
Dim S As Excel.Series<br />
<br />
Property Set Series(Value As Object)<br />
&nbsp; Set S = Value<br />
&nbsp; 'Set the checkbox if we have both objects<br />
&nbsp; If Not CHB Is Nothing Then CHB.Value = CBool(S.Format.Line.Visible)<br />
End Property<br />
<br />
Property Set CheckBox(Value As Object)<br />
&nbsp; Set CHB = Value<br />
&nbsp; If Not S Is Nothing Then CHB.Value = CBool(S.Format.Line.Visible)<br />
End Property<br />
<br />
Property Set CommandButton(Value As Object)<br />
&nbsp; Set COB = Value<br />
End Property<br />
<br />
Private Sub CHB_Change()<br />
&nbsp; 'Hide or show the line<br />
&nbsp; S.Format.Line.Visible = CHB.Value<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub COB_Click()<br />
&nbsp; 'Close the userform<br />
&nbsp; Unload COB.Parent<br />
End Sub<br />
--- schnapp ---<br />
<br />
Then create an empty userform and add this code:<br />
<br />
--- schnipp ---<br />
Option Explicit<br />
<br />
Dim MCBs As New Collection<br />
<br />
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()<br />
&nbsp; Dim C As MSForms.Control<br />
&nbsp; Dim MCB As MyEventHandler<br />
&nbsp; Dim S As Series<br />
&nbsp; Dim Y As Single<br />
&nbsp; Dim W As Single<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; If ActiveChart Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Select a chart and try again"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unload Me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'For each series<br />
&nbsp; For Each S In ActiveChart.SeriesCollection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Add a checkbox to the form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set C = Me.Controls.Add("Forms.CheckBox.1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Get the name from the series<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.Caption = S.Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Let it shrink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.AutoSize = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Move it below the last checkbox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.Top = Y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Calculate the position for the next checkbox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = Y + C.Height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Get the max. width<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If C.Width &gt; W Then W = C.Width<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Create a new handler for the event routines of the checkbox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MCB = New MyEventHandler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Store the objects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MCB.CheckBox = C<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MCB.Series = S<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Keep it alive in our collection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCBs.Add MCB<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'Add a commandbutton below<br />
&nbsp; Set C = Me.Controls.Add("Forms.CommandButton.1")<br />
&nbsp; C.Caption = "Done"<br />
&nbsp; C.AutoSize = True<br />
&nbsp; 'Move it below the last checkbox<br />
&nbsp; C.Top = Y<br />
&nbsp; Y = Y + C.Height<br />
&nbsp; If C.Width &gt; W Then W = C.Width<br />
&nbsp; 'ENTER and ESC call this button<br />
&nbsp; C.Default = True<br />
&nbsp; C.Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp; 'Create a new handler for the event routines of the commandbutton<br />
&nbsp; Set MCB = New MyEventHandler<br />
&nbsp; Set MCB.CommandButton = C<br />
&nbsp; MCBs.Add MCB<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'Resize the form to show all controls<br />
&nbsp; Me.Height = Y + Me.Height - Me.InsideHeight<br />
&nbsp; Me.Width = W + Me.Width - Me.InsideWidth<br />
End Sub<br />
--- schnapp ---<br />
<br />
Create a normal module and write a sub to show the form as you like e.g.<br />
<br />
Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; UserForm1.Show<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Close the VBA editor, click on a chart, press ALT-F8 and run the macro.<br />

<p>If you want a Step by Step process, with a blank document on the screen, from the Tools menu in Word, select Letters and Mailings and then Mail Merge then in Step 1 of 6, select Letters, then in Step 2, select Use the current document, then click on the
 Next: Select recipients link, then select the Use an existing list, item and then click on Browse to browse to your data source, then click on the Next: write your letter link, then click on the More items... to display the Insert Merge Fields dialog and via
 that dialog, insert the merge fields that contain the data in the configuration that you want them.&nbsp; (You will need to position them so that they display correctly in your window envelope, then click on the Next: Preview your letters link, and when satisfied,
 clcik on the Next: Complete the merge link, which will take you to the final step where you can select whether you want to execute the merge directly to the printer (which will need to be loaded with your marketing flyers loaded in the correct manner, or alternatively,
 you can click on the Edit individual letters link which will create a new document that contains one page for each address in your data source.&nbsp; You can then print that document.&nbsp; Creating a new document containing a page for each address maybe more prudent
 than executing the merge directly to the printer as you can try printing just one page to make sure that everything is correct.</p>

I love the fact that I can have my text messages backed up with the My Phone service, but it would be much easier if I was able to display the texts online in the same "conversation" format that I am able to use on my phone.&nbsp; Having all of my sent texts separate

            You make a good point blcklbrtn and one that several users have expressed in previous discussions.&nbsp; The MyPhone team has been very diligent in viewing the comments made in the forum and are aware of this request.&nbsp; Although I do not know what is in store

            <p>Hi Jferguso,<br />
<br />
Please be informed that in SharePoint Online, file name paths can have up to 256 characters. (For example: C:\users\administrator\OneDrive - o365test\folder1\subfolder\document2.docx, the whole path can't exceed 256 characters.)<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202</a><br />
<br />
About this issue, could you check the following?<br />
1. Check whether there're folders deeply nested, if so, go to the deepest folder and check whether the whole path exceeds 256 characters.<br />
<br />
2. Move all the files in the Documents library to another location, e.g. c:\backup\ , leave only one file e.g. 123.docx and perform the steps again, does the error occurs?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for responding James..</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please be informed that in SharePoint Online, file name paths can have up to 256 characters."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my original post: <em>Using a tool called TLPD&nbsp;, i was able to determine that no file or path in Documents is greater than 224 characters, which i believe should be fine.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Move all the files in the Documents library to another location, e.g. c:\backup\ , leave only one file e.g. 123.docx and perform the steps again, does the error occurs?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that's my next step.&nbsp; The problem is that the user had made&nbsp;previous attempts&nbsp;at setting up his Documents library in&nbsp;OneDrive, and the result is that he now has 3 copies of the same&nbsp;data residing in the Documents library.&nbsp; It looks something like
 this..</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\UserName\Documents\<em>CompanyName</em></p>
<p>C:\Users\UserName\Documents\<em>OD</em></p>
<p>C:\Users\UserName\Documents\<em>OneDrive for Business</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The last folder in each of the above three examples (<em>CompanyName</em>, <em>
OD</em>, etc)&nbsp;contains the same data with a few minor differences.&nbsp; And unfortunately there's about 10 gig worth of files in each one.&nbsp; I don't want to create a OneDrive scenario where he's syncing everything in triplicate, but sorting it all out will take
 some time.&nbsp; I believe it's this configuration which is causing the problem.&nbsp; Make sense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Jferguso,<br />
<br />
Please confirm the following information:<br />
1. As James suggested, move the local Document Library to another folder, and then check the outcome.<br />
<br />
2. Does the issue occur when moving some specific folder? Or no folders have ever been moved?<br />
<br />
3. About the three examples (<em>CompanyName, OD, OneDrive for Business</em>), please share with us the screenshot, and confirm which example you’re moving the local Document Library to.<br />
<br />
4. Please share with us the detailed steps and screenshots for us to reproduce the issue, especially the destination path and the structure of the local Document Library.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>
</p><p>No folders have been moved.&nbsp; It fails a few seconds after I click "OK" to move the Documents library inside the OneDrive path.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I already described the detailed steps in my first response to Cliff.&nbsp; Please review that response above, dated July 8th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached the screen capture.&nbsp; As you can see, there's three folders all inside the documents library, and&nbsp;their contents is&nbsp;about 95% identical.&nbsp; So, if I move the documents library, it grabs all three folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i'm all set with this.&nbsp; It's just going to take some time to sort out which folder the user wants to keep, then consolidate the contents of the other folders so there aren't three copies of everything.&nbsp; Once that's settled, move the consolidated
 folder to a new location, then re-home Documents and start syncing, then move the consolidated folder back inside the new OneDrive path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Install Skype for Business on computer with Microsoft Office 365 subscription installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own an Office 365 license for home use and currently use Office 2016 apps. Version 16.0.6366.2056. I use a personal email address to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to use my home computer for work, I need Skype for Business. I am entitled to a license for Skype for Business through a separate Office 365 Pro Plus account through work. I use my work email address to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to set up a login on my home computer for my work email address, thinking I could then download and install my Office 365 Pro Plus apps, thus getting me the access to the Skype for Business app I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the installer will not install an older version of Office when a new version is present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to give up my home license/newer apps. However, it seems there is no other way to be able to install Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Skype for Business through Remote Desktop control of my work PC, but certain functions that I need do not appear to be supported in that scenario... for example, live meetings with audio and/or video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a stand-alone Skype for Business app that I could download and install on my home PC as part of my work license? The only way I can think of to get this to work would be to uninstall Office 365 for Home from my PC.</p>
<p>

            Never mind... I was able to get the help I needed by contacting Microsoft's Skype for Business support by phone. Once I was finally able to find a phone number, resolving my issue was fairly easy and satisfactory.

<h2>            Find and Replace font with style</h2>
                    
<p>Word 2007</p>
<p>The font of some text in my document is Calibri (body). The Find &amp; Replace dialog box cannot find the font Calibri. If I add style (and there are a number of body styles--and I've tried each one), it still cannot locate the text.</p>
<p>Advice?</p>

<p>Not so much buggy as limited. Finding symbols has always been an issue with the find tool. Microsoft used to supply a template (macros9.dot) with a Find Symbol macro with Word 2000, that is still available and works in more recent versions -<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=73DBEAD3-B37A-425A-9AE8-DD3593B5675B&amp;displaylang=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=73DBEAD3-B37A-425A-9AE8-DD3593B5675B&amp;displaylang=EN</a>
 - however if you know the value of the character, as here a search for ^0183 should find it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your timely response. However, I apparently did not make myself clear. The bullet is an inserted symbol (·), in the midst of a paragraph, not a style or a bullet from a bulleted list. (It is being used for syllabification in a dictionary.) I can
 select it, copy it, and paste it into the Find control in the Find &amp; Replace dialog box. Find Next cannot find it. Why not?<br />
<br />
I went back to the document and realized the code for this bullet is Alt+0183. If I type that into the Find control then it finds all the bullets. If I just copy and paste, Find is useless. Problem resolved. Program buggy?</p>

<h2>            Outlook account won&#39;t validate</h2>
                    I was using my Android phone (Samsung I5801) to access my Hotmail account with no problems until today, when I was forced to "upgrade" to Outlook. I have correctly input my account details and password numerous times, but the Outlook account will not validate
 on my phone - although I have no problems accessing it on my laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you offer a solution please as this is most unsatisfactory.</div>

            Yes Allan, you guessed right. I'm getting the "authentication failure" message.
<div><br />
<div>The workaround you suggest doesn't work. I downloaded it yesterday but it tells me Hotmail has been upgraded to Outlook and I need to download the app. I did that. That's why I can't get access to my email account on my phone.</div>

<div>From this, and various other threads on the same subject, it appears there are lots and lots of people experiencing the same problem. The whole thing appears to be a shambles.</div>
