<p>yes nokia is making a big mistake killing the n900, come on, its not only the best device by Nokia, its one of the best devices ever, so i don't any idea why nokia is planning to kill the maemo 5, and leave all the n900 users with 10 apps from the ovi store,
 so i was doing some thinking and here is what you have to do nokia, first of all you will need to do something to win you some money and sell even more n900sbefore you revive it, so here is my idea, launch new n900s with different colors, lets say white, gray,
 the n97 mini colors, even a 2 tone colors would be nice, than start reviving the device, its not cool living a high resolution, 3d accelerator phone with that small number of apps, i'm not saying we want the meego on the device, but you guys should start working
 on putting the games we've seen in the ovi store( that rollecostar game...), and than we want that flash 10.1 on the device, and java would be nice, (go to
<a href="http://www.mobile9.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.mobile9.com</a> and the n900s section is full of apps, but they r all java), and how about a decent section in the ovi store for the n900, its an open source ! the android is an open source,
 and it has 10000 times more apps than the n900, so yes more games and apps please, and i have a nice idea two, how about a n-gage section for the n900, for more games and apps, i mean if you guys started launching more apps and games on this great device,
 it won't heart, because first of all all these games will be supported on meego, so you will be saving some time, and second of all i'm not saying all the apps and games we want are going to be free, the n900 is a great device, the maemo5 is awesome, and the
 interface is amazing, and i will like to see that the ovi store now has google maps for the n900, nimbuzz for the n900, fifa 10, need for speed shift, asphalte, flash player 10.1 beta, fring, rollercoster, document editor, twitter, facebook for n900( a good
 one with chat and all that like on the iphone), opera mobile 10, a call recorder, snaptu, a clock widget, ea mobile games, .......... i bet nokia will make a lots of money out of the ovi store if they did this, and they will sell tons of n900s. so please nokia
 try doing something for this wonderful device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. nokia dont make most of the ovi store apps. those apps are made by third parties and are then scrutinised by nokia before they hit the ovi store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. n900 is pretty much entirely open source. if you want open source apps, go to the apps manager and download section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. n gage games arent really that great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. facebook... just use the actual page, you can do everything you can do on a pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. there are call recorders and clock widgets in the apps manager sections. abi word is in the extras devel (or the other section)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. and half of those apps youve mentioned would need to be created by their respective companies, or a company that has the licence to redistribute them, like gameloft. last time i checked, nokia doesnt own fifa, of need for speed, so they technically dont
 have the rights to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and flash 10.1b is extremely buggy, especially with hardware acceleration enabled. perhaps it will be ported once they fix the bugs.</p>

<p>TBH I can't see why we have an Ovi Store for the N900, when we've got our own App manager. I've found everything I want from there, with the exception of a few gimmicks from Ovi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want now is PR1.2 followed by our MeeGo and a decent image editor, i.e. Gimp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've used AbiWord and although it's a bit buggy at present it does what it's supposed to do, except print straight to printer, this alone would be a massive boon for the N900.</p>

<p>define clock widget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>theres a clock on the n900 already. it sets alarms, shows the time, and shows world time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are also various widgets that involve clocks.</p>

<h2>            How to delete empty sheets &#38; ThisWorkbooks&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a fairly large spreadsheet used to calculate ball &amp; roller bearing life.&nbsp; I've been using this about 4 years (starting in Office 2003,and still using xls format under Office 2007).&nbsp; It includes 4 VBA functions.</p>
<p>I have 79 sheets (mostly empty).&nbsp; These are named Sheet 1 through Sheet 79.&nbsp; I also have ThisWorkbook through ThisWorkbook4.</p>
<p>I tried selecting each in turn, hitting Ctrl-A and then delete, saving, closing, re-opening.&nbsp; They are all still there.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet and VBA functions all work but I'd like to clean it up before adding more calculations to it.&nbsp; How to do this?</p>
<p>Of course, I am working on a copy of my spreadsheet in case something goes bump in the night.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Your question is not entirely clear. Are you trying to delete sheets that have no data on them? If so, are there formulas on them, or just typed-in data? If you don't mean that you want to physically&nbsp;delete the empty sheets, then what did you mean by "clean
 it up"?

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sheets I wish to delete are in the VBAProject editor, under "Microsoft Excel Objects".&nbsp; Most are empty.&nbsp; Actually, now all are empty since I double clicked on each in turn, hit Ctrl-A and then delete.</p>
<p>Some of these sheets also include the name of a tab in my workbook, which has 16 tabs.&nbsp; But they do not have any code in them.&nbsp; (Some of them had a line with "option explicit" and one had a copy of one of my functions.</p>
<p>I also have one module "Module1" that I wish to keep.&nbsp; It has the four VBA functions that I'm using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, the spreadsheet is working but I'm concerned about all those extra sheets.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Fred</p>

            The sheets listed in the VB editor window are the same as those in your workbook... they do<strong>not</strong> represent sheets with VB code in them. The only way to remove the sheets from the listing in the VB editor window is to remove the sheet from
 your workbook (which it does not sound like you want to do).

            I didn't see the previous posts from you and Rick.&nbsp; I misunderstood your question I think.&nbsp; Only use my macro if it was your intention to delete the actual sheets (i.e. the tab with that sheet name too) from your workbooks.

<p>Thanks for trying.</p>
<p>I tried Sub DeleteEmpties()&nbsp; by adding it at the end of my existing VBA functions and then using "Debug/ Step Into" and then "Run / Continue".&nbsp; Nothing seems to have happened.&nbsp; I also tried calling Sub DeleteEmpties() by entering =DeleteEmpties() in a blank
 cell &amp; hitting enter.&nbsp; This produced error msg. "The name you entered is not valid."</p>
<p>The 79 blank Microsoft Excel Objects are still there.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Delete empties is a macro, not a function.&nbsp; Put it in a new module and press "run."</p>
<p>It deletes empty spreadsheets, not worksheets without code.&nbsp; I tested it to this end and it works as advertised.&nbsp; So if you click on the 79 tabs in your file when it is open, any that don't have data or formulas in them anywhere would be deleted from the
 workbook upon executing this macro.</p>
<p>If this isn't what you were asking for, I'm still confused at exactly what it is you're trying to do.</p>
<p>As Rick has said, the sheets in your VBA code editor are just representations of the sheets in your actual workbook.&nbsp; If you're seeing sheets in your Project Editor that aren't also tabs in your workbook, it is because those worksheets are hidden.&nbsp; Simply
 right click on a worksheet and press unhide.&nbsp; This will unhide all worksheets in the workbook.&nbsp; If you want to delete only sheets that you see on your Project Editor but don't see in your workbook, simply do</p>
<p>Sub DeleteEmpties()</p>
<p>Dim ws As Worksheet, wb As Workbook</p>
<p>Application.DisplayAlerts = False</p>
<p>For Each wb In Application.Workbooks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each ws In wb.Worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;ws.Visible = xlHidden Or ws.Visible = xlVeryHidden Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ws.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
Next</p>
<p>Application.DisplayAlerts = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, in the VBA window, select the dropdown between the excel icon and the save icon and choose "module" and copy and paste either of my codes, depending on what it is you're trying to do.&nbsp; Then press the green play button.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>I tried this using your 2nd code.&nbsp; All I can see that changed is now I have a Module2 containing your code.&nbsp; All the Microsoft Excel Objects are still there.</p>
<p>I also right-clicked on several of the Sheets visible in Microsoft Excel Objects.&nbsp; I see a hide entry (not checked).&nbsp; When I tried clicking on one, the Project window vanished.&nbsp; When I re-opened the Project window, the sheet on which I had clicked hide is
 still there.</p>
<p>In my 79 Microsoft Excel Objects, it is the last 16 (numbers 64 to 79) that each have the name of one of my workbook tabs.&nbsp; For example, Sheet79 (Smax vs L10). This includes the name of my last sheet, which does a curve-fit on bearing life vs max stress.</p>
<p>Once again, my worksheet works.&nbsp; I am simply hoping to clean it up before adding new features.&nbsp; The xls file is now 884 kb vs 804 before I started trying to make is smaller.</p>

<h2>            Changing the Yammer URL and Primary Yammer Domain Name</h2>
                    
<p>Our company is rebranding, including a change to our primary DNS domain. We have an established Yammer network, based on our previous domain, which includes several merged domains - notably, one that we are planning to use in the future.&nbsp; We did this because
 we have already started issuing email accounts to new employees using the new domain.</p>
<p>How do we go about migrating the URL and primary network domain from one to another? We have not deployed any other O365 services yet, but are in the process of setting up AAD synchronization.</p>

<h2>            Icons on Address bar</h2>
                    The icon on the address bar changes from one to a different one. For example When I am on facebook and then choose a favorite the facebook icon will then be in the address bar and on the favorites menu. I am using IE8.

            Dear Oli,
<br />Each organization assigns a Benefits Administrator (BA), internal to their organization, to be responsible for managing the Home Use Program. Your BA can provide the assigned program code for your organization. 
<br />Microsoft Customer Service cannot provide you with the name of your Benefit Administrator or your organization's program code.
<br />More information can be found in this FAQ for HUP <a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/en-us/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/en-us/faq</a>

<p>Hi Ramses,</p>
<p>Based on the description, I understand that you cannot sign in to Exchange online with your Office 365 account in your new installation of Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new Outlook profile </a>for your Office 365 account and try signing to Exchange online again to see if any progresses will be made.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after creating a new Outlook profile for your Office 365 account, I’d like to confirm some more information to better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. Did this issue happen only to you in your organization?</p>
<p>2. To identify whether the issue is related to the Outlook client or the Office 365 account, would you mind configuring your Office 365 account on another PC’s Outlook client via
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-Outlook-for-Windows-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange connection </a>to see if the issue can be fixed?</p>
<p>3. Please also try setting up another Office 365 account into the Outlook client to see if the same issue occurs.</p>
<p>4. Would you mind providing us with the email address of the problematic Office 365 account which you cannot sign in to Exchange online via private message so that I can check the related DNS settings for you?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information above. Please follow the steps below to respond to it:</p>
<p>1. Please go to your details section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2. Click Private messages.</p>

<p>Hi Ramses,</p>
<p>I have read the thread through including the Private Message. Based on your private information, all the Office 365 mailboxes in your tenant work fine in Outlook 2013. Recreating a new profile in Outlook 2016 can fix the issue, only for two or three days.</p>
<p>So your network connection, mailbox settings and DNS records are set up correctly. To my knowledge, when creating a new profile, Outlook saves your logon information including server settings into a new local .ost file. From the logs you provided, your Outlook
 2016 cannot get the logon information and connect to the server. The probable cause is that the .ost files are corrupted and cause confusion. Considering the online settings are working fine and the issue is more likely to be related to your Outlook 2016 client.
 For such Outlook client related issue, we suggest you contact the specialized <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Client Support Forum </a>for effective assistance. If there is any setting related to Office 365 Online side, please let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Excel Template publishing in a Microsoft Teams site - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Template publishing in a Microsoft Teams site</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am just starting to use Microsoft teams and what I would like to do is the following:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a Teams space shared with an external party</li><li>Post a link on there to an excel spreadsheet template that I would like the external party to fill in, then the external party would complete the spreadsheet and save it on the team site.</li><li>I still want to keep the template as it is in it's original form and be able to update it (add in new fields etc.) but still have the external party able to then open it on their team site update it etc and save it without overwriting the master template.</li></ol>
<p>I am struggling to find the best way of doing this. I have set up 2 team sites one hosting the master excel template and one for the external party to go into to click on a saved URL and update and save the spreadsheet. It wouldn't work until I had added
 the external party to both team sites which then means that the external party could accidently update the master template and ruin it for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am looking for a way to have a team site with a url to the template that can be opened and saved on the same teamsite without the master being updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any way to do this please?</p>

<p><span>Hi Steve,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another better solution is to create a site content type with the customized Excel file in the team site and then deploy it to the site library.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a site administrator, you can click Site settings&gt;Site content type under Wen Designer Galleries&gt;click Create to create a content type&gt;select Document Content Types in Select parent content
 type from and select Document in Parent Content Type&gt;click Advanced settings&gt;click Choose File in Upload a new document template to upload the customized Excel template file&gt;navigate to the library you created&gt;Library settings&gt;Advanced settings&gt;click Yes in
 Allow management of content types&gt;return to Library settings&gt;click Add from existing site content types&gt;add the content type you created in Content types to do that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa0f4386-2593-4c9a-9676-bb34bfaafe96?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa0f4386-2593-4c9a-9676-bb34bfaafe96?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After doing that, you can share the library with the external users and they can edit the Excel template from +New and add new modified files in the library. The original template will not be affected
 as you add the template as a content type and you can edit the template via Site settings&gt;Site Content Types&gt;select the content type you created&gt;Advanced settings&gt;Edit Templates. The external users with the Edit permissions will be unable to edit the content
 type.</span></p>

<p>At this point I would do a hard shut down (hold the power button down until it shuts off) then restart it, what was the time period since you installed Win10? and is it the RTM or Preview version? after doing the above and it doesn't start working and it
 is the RTM version click on this link for RTM help</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;If Preview version come back and post info such as make/model 32bit/64bit/ home/pro, and if the above does fix it let us know.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Empty Outlook Trash in Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raider97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Empty Outlook Trash in Mac 2011</h2>
                    My entire Outlook 2011 crashed while deleting individual files in my Deleted items folder 2 months ago. I rebuilt my identity and recreated everything - huge undertaking!! To this day, I still can't delete anything from my outlook trash. Every time I try,
 Outlook shuts down and gives me this message: "Microsoft Outlook must be closed because an error occurred. Any unsaved work may be lost." - then i have to click "Quit". It shuts down and then i have to open it back up - since the original crash, i so far have
 been able to continue using without rebuilding everything/loss of information. Once i open Outlook, it wants me to select my identity and everything is good to go from there.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need to empty my trash - I get thousands of emails each month and they are really starting to stack up! Anyone know of a fix? I'm really starting to regret switching from Entourage 08. I've wasted numerous hours fiddling with '11 not syncing etc
 too... Help! I"m afraid I'll loose everything again!!</div>

<div>Hey&nbsp;Raider97,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry to hear you're having such a difficult time with Outlook. I'll be honest, I haven't heard of this happening before. However, I'd start with&nbsp;resetting the Outlook preferences.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Log into your main account, click on the link below and follow steps 1 and 2:</div>

<div>If that doesn't help, continue with the rest of the steps on that KB article.</div>

            When you say you rebuilt your Identity, did you use "rebuild" in database utility or did you start with a new Identity?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you did a rebuild. Rebuild often does nothing but allow you to open your Identity.<br />
<br />
Are any accounts IMAP where you could use your browser to delete messages?<br />
<br />
<br />
1) I suggest that you export all data as .olm file and import into a new Identity. If you don't get "Done" at the end of the export this means there is corruption. It's Ok if you get "one or more items didn't export something like still on server is mentioned".<br />
<br />
If the .olm fails, you can try dragging each folder to the desktop as .mbox file to import into the new Identity.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; Steps 2 &amp; 3 might help. Work off a backup if you try these steps.<br />
<br />

    <title>outlook.com sign-in blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sue1232  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com sign-in blocked</h2>
                    I've spent hours following help, support, reading forums, ect. Most links only bring me to the sign in page. Possible solutions force me to sign in first and I obviously can't do that. To post on these forums you have to sign in as well....which is ridiculous
 if you're trying to post on the forums because you CAN'T sign in. I've searched these forums and found someone with the same exact problem, but of course both solutions force you to sign in. Clicking a "contact a support agent" link brings me to the sign in
 page. One of the few links that worked said you have to sign in to your account to unblock it but I can't sign into my account because it is blocked. After borrowing a friends account (which I'm using now) I went back to try some of the help links and now
 that I'm signed into an account they all just bring me to "contact a support agent" page.<br />
<br />
So as the title says my sign-in is blocked. No idea why and I've literally tried everything, 3x. Including changing the password. I needed to get on my emails hours ago for school and am already looking at an F on several assignments because of this issue.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />

            <p>You can add the styles to the Quick Style Gallery on the <strong>Home</strong> tab. In the

<p>
</p><p>You can also customize the order in which styles appear in the gallery. In the
<strong>Styles</strong> pane, click the button (lower left corner) for <strong>Manage Styles</strong>. In the
<strong>Manage Styles</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Recommend</strong> tab. You can change the priority level of any built-in or custom style. The lower the number, the higher the style will appear in the gallery. If two styles have the same priority,
 they will appear in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can take a bit of work, removing from the gallery the styles you don't use, adding those you do use,&nbsp;and then fine-tuning the priority level of those that remain, but it is worth it in the long run.</p>

<h2>            Shared contacts - Search issues</h2>
                    <p>An assistant have access to our president contacts.</p>
<p>If she enters a contact in his contact list, it will be in the list but if she tries to do a search on this contact it won't find it. If I open the contact and change the fileAs to a different value save the contact and then revert it back to the default
 one ( last name, First Name ) then the contact can be found using the search on the assistant Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>But if our president do a search on the newly created contact even before the Fileas change he will find it. I tried to rebuild the Index, no difference.</p>
<p>I even change the assistant PC that didn't help either.</p>
<p>We are using Outlook 2013 in cache mode with an Office 365 back-end. She has full mailbox access.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be welcome ... I'm running out of solution</p>

<p>hi snippy26,</p>
<p>to better understand the situation, i’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. does the assistant just have full access permission of the president mailbox? or did the president share the contacts to the assistance before?
<br />
2. about “if i open the contact and change the fileas to a different value save the contact and then revert it back to the default one”, do you also have ability to access the president contacts? if no, please provide corresponding screenshots of how you changed
 the fileas for investigation. to upload a picture, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click the
<strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=42baf6ea-faa4-4c5c-accf-e393f608e818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d42baf6ea-faa4-4c5c-accf-e393f608e818" /></a></p>
<p><br />
3. if possible, please right click the president contacts from assistant side and select properties, in the pop-up window, navigate to permission, provide the screenshot of it for our analysis. we need to know what contacts permissions does the assistance have
 and do some tests using the same environment and see if we can reproduce the same issue.<br />
4. the affected os and outlook client version information.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>Hi Snippy26,</p>
<p>I have done many tests and found I can’t reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, the issue might be related to the “File as” information as you previously said that if you changed the “File as” information, “Daniel” could be found in Outlook 2013. In addition, as the contact item could be found on your president’s
 side, the issue might be related to your Outlook client.</p>
<p>Given the situation, you can troubleshoot the issue via the following steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Create a few contacts (4-5 contact items) with the workable “File as” information and check the result.
<br />
2.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new Outlook profile in Outlook 2013</a>.</p>

<p>HI Alan,</p>
<p>We have this &nbsp;behavior &nbsp;on two different computers with a brand new Outlook profiles so I guess we can eliminate the client side issue. We never had these problem with our On-prem server these weird problem started when we moved to 365 online services. To
 me it's clearly an 365 related issue. </p>

<p>hi snippy26,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>i have also run a test via referring to your methods:</p>
<p>1. i have 3 contacts (jack) in my contact list</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=af65767d-511b-438b-afeb-e6de5c863b7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3daf65767d-511b-438b-afeb-e6de5c863b7b" /></a></p>
<p>2. when i search “jack”, all the contacts related to “jack” are shown as below:</p>
<p>as i previously said that the issue can be resolved via changing the appropriate “file as” information, the issue is related to the “file as” information. also, i have done much research and found no article/blog regarding the contact’s “file as” information.</p>
<p>also, the issue might be related to the searching method. let me explain more: as you said that the issue occurred when you search for “daniel girard” via the key word “girard”, i’d like to suggest you try searching the key word “girard”, “daniel” or “daniel”.</p>
<p>also, you can share with us the searching results in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook web app (owa).</a></p>

<p><br />
No, it's not compatible with MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability and conflicts between
 programs, and can hinder the effectiveness all installed antivirus products. Even if you attempt to have more than one product installed, with one active and another disabled, the disabled product will likely still have active components and/or drivers installed
 that will conflict with MSE or any other resident antivirus program prividing real time scanning.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Issue with embedded YouTube videos in powerpoint when viewed on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhairi-m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with embedded YouTube videos in powerpoint when viewed on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a PowerPoint show on MS Office Professional Plus 2013 on my PC running Windows 7. I've embedded various YouTube videos into the ppt via Insert -&gt; Video -&gt; online video -&gt; from a video embed code. These play fine for anyone I've sent the ppt to
 using a PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that whenever I send this to someone using a Mac, the videos just show as black boxes with no functionality. I can't find a solution to this problem, I've had suggestions that it may be to do with Flash on the receiving Macs, but I can't seem
 to find a common factor. This has happened on Macs running Office for Mac 2004 and 2011. Does anyone know anything about cross platform issues like this? This is an elearning package which my employer is selling so it's really important I find a fix!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>YouTube videos are always linked, not embedded. They are not supported on any Mac version of PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best idea for widely-compatible presentation is to use a video in the same folder as the PowerPoint presentation and link it to the presentation. This article, though it mentions PowerPoint 2007, has lots of useful tips for ensuring compatibility with
 all versions:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-au/article/Cross-Platform-PowerPoint-Compatibility-0eebb4f1-c329-4c50-b83c-3af1bab640de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cross-Platform PowerPoint</a></p>

            make sure your storage card is in if they were attached to that. turn off and back on. if you still have nothing, try a hard reset as that will take it back to original. check your remove programs tab in settings to make sure they are all still installed.

    <title>Lumia 920 Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juhlyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, well basically my Lumia 920 has been with me for around 1.5 years, and&nbsp;for a while(around three - six months ago) problems started arising:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) My phone would randomly freeze on the lock screen, app pages, even the home page &gt;&gt; I did soft reset every time that happens, but the problem would persist for a while (at least 10 soft resets would be needed to solve the problem temporarily).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) The audio would appear jammed (a loud static sound could be heard suddenly for a period of time), and when this happens the buttons do not appear to vibrate anymore. When I soft reset it, it would be okay again but problem (1) may happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Sometimes after a soft reset, the screen display may seem a bit weird: the colours are of a strange hue,, and sometimes only half the screen is shown, or the display would keep flashing black and jarred images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) When I am calling, &nbsp;the speaker is unable to hear me unless I put the conversation on loud speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) Recently (around three weeks or so), the audio problem appeared again together with the vibration problem so I went ahead to soft reset the phone - &nbsp;but the problem was NOT solved. The buttons still did not vibrate, and the audio seemed to be gone forever.
 What I mean is that when I press the volume up and down button, the 'drop down menu' can be seen (as in, the grey bar) but without the volume bars. So all I can see is a tiny grey strip on the top, but without the volume adjustment bars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(6) Ever since problem (5) occured, I cannot watch videos ("The file is unsupported") anymore. The option to make a conversation on speaker mode cannot be selected anymore (The button is there, but it doesn't light up or change to speaker when I press it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(7) Just two days ago, my lumia 920 cannot detect my SIM card periodically, and when it can, no network can be detected and / or I have no service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried soft rest, and a hard reset (factory reset) but to no avail. There isn't any sound when I use the earphones, and the settings are the usual - except for the touch + sensitivity, where the option for the buttons to vibrate are gone. The current software
 is&nbsp;Lumia Cyan. Are there any solutions? And are these problems fixable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>The last troubleshooting step to try at home is the Nokia Software Recovery Tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please remove the SIM, let the phone update all its system apps over Wi-Fi, restore its backup etc.&nbsp;-&nbsp;and verify if it is reliable for some days without SIM. If so, request a new SIM from your operator. If not, you have done&nbsp;all you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not give you false hope, it sounds mechanically defective, but the above procedure is what a Nokia Care Point or approved workshop will do first, to determine if the phone is recoverable without taking it apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What's the error message that you're seeing? It would be a lot easier to help you out if we know a little more about the problem.</p>
<p>Just a guess, but I'm thinking that your server is looking for a cert and it's not installed on your device. &nbsp;Again, just a guess. &nbsp;Without knowing the actual error, it's hard to tell you what's wrong.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to Set the Default &#39;Company&#39; for Word 2016 Documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dziesmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Set the Default &#39;Company&#39; for Word 2016 Documents</h2>
                    <p>The question is relatively straightforward: I am using Office 2016 (NOT Office 365), and when I open a new Word file, the 'advanced' document property of 'Company' is
<strong>blank</strong>.&nbsp; I want to set the default Company name for <strong>all </strong>
new Word 2016 documents at a minimum, and would be satisfied with a change that sets the 'Company' value globally for all new Office documents generally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, what I do NOT need is instruction on how to change the value for a SINGLE file (<em>a common response by people</em>).&nbsp; I need to change it universally as a default for all new files I create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, if it is of consequence, I am also running Windows 10, but I use a local account (not an MS account) to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp; I'll be sure to check back in if I get a proper answer.</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
See Doug Robbins' answer and my response to a similar question in this thread: <br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/a-change-i-make-to-the-word-2010-template-does-not/e07b0462-b295-480e-abe4-ff56758a75fe">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you could use a macro that runs whenever a new document is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />

<p>Hi Charles;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doug's response is generally accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a concluding thought and to summarize for future inquirers, the method for Office 2016 is to edit the registry entry for the keys 'Company' and 'CompanyName' in the path HKEY_USERS\&lt;<em>YOUR_USER_ACCOUNT SID</em>&gt;\Software\Microsoft\Office\Common\UserInfo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my particular case, the 'Company' key wasn't there, so I had to create it.&nbsp; Without that key (and apparently relying on 'CompanyName'), the company name was there for all Office applications EXCEPT Word (ironically).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing/messing with the normal template was not necessary for me.&nbsp; Once the registry was edited, it immediately worked as expected for newly created files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, all of the advice for prior versions of Office is NOT applicable to 2016.&nbsp; That's a dangerous assumption any day of the week, where Microsoft is concerned.&nbsp; Clearly there was a change in the way Microsoft decided to store and draw on these values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thanks again for the quick reply.</p>

<h2>            Build 10586 Taskbar Locks Solid</h2>
                    Long outstanding serrious bug is when the Taskbar locks up so not of the buttons work when clicked with mouse. Start, Cortana, Action Centre all unaccessible. Seems to occur first thing in morning after startup after previous nights shut down. Suggested
 cure of restarting Windows Explorer in Task Manager does not work, leaving system with a blank screen requiring a CTRL-ALT-DEL to access the Restart button. Please make this a top priority fix!

            Thank you for the suggestions but I don't think they are appropriate as this problem occurs on both my insider preview 10586 system and my clean install 1511 10586 live system so it seems to be a system bug which is common to both systems that needs to
 be fixed. There is a further but associated with the taskbar in that it does not always load selected icons on the right of the taskbar - The Action Centre always loads but the Power, Wifi, Sound icons individually sometimes fail to load requiring the Windows
 Explorer to be restarted<br />

            It's early days but since cumulative update KB3118754 the problems seem to have been solved as I have had no problems since. As I said in my previous post that since it was occuring on both my two systems it would seem to be more likely a system bug that
 needed a Microsoft fix rather than a computer problem that could be solved with software tools. But as I said it is still early days.

            I have two 10586 running with one from an ISO I made...did not get those issues...sometimes on a new install you have to wait a bit before some updates arrive if you're lucky they will take, so I guess you were...keep on experimenting.*john&nbsp;

            I have had no problems on my updated system after a number of shutdown/restarts and I have now applied update KB3118754 to my other system and although the problem was clearly visable( missing power, Wifi and sound icons) before the update, the Taskbar
 was showing perfectly after the update. I am very impressed with Windows 10 and it is obvious that the Microsoft team responded extremely well to user feedback have worked very hard to make a new and exciting system stable and very useable. THANK YOU!!!!!!

            As I said in my previous post that this no longer seems an issue as I have not had any lockups or missing icons since the last update and this proves true for both my Windows 10 installations.<br />

<h2>            share back end on google docs&#63;</h2>
                    We have a FE/BE split AccessXP database. Can we put the BE on google docs and share it that way, making real time simultaneous&nbsp;changes to the data file, like we do when it is on our local LAN?&nbsp; If not, can we do it&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Access 2010 PLATFORM?

            <p>No. Frontend-backend relationships are VERY demanding in terms of bandwidth and stability. Connecting over the internet is neither fast enough, nor stable enough; you'll get dreadful performance and run a major risk of database corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2010 and 2013 support "web databases" but they are different in user interface (they use web pages with code rather than the familiar desktop-database forms and reports).</p>

            You can do this to some extent using Office 365. But the best solution is to put your back end on the WEB and create WEB apps to connect to it.&nbsp;

            <p>No, Google docs and equivalents like dropbox and skydrive are accessed over the HTTP protocol which does not support opening files and keeping them open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One option is to upsize your database to SQL Server, and host the server at some ISP. You can still access the back-end using linked tables and&nbsp;a standard ODBC connection. We have several clients running in this configuration. There are a few gotchas but
 by and large it works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other way is to go all web-based. If you are thinking of using Access for that, A2010 and A2013 both support creating BASIC web apps. You will want to use A2013 in this case because A2010 is technologically a dead end and A2013 is a restart on a completely
 different technology platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other option of course is to use Remote Desktop Connection to run a session on a computer on the LAN. Especially if you have just a few remote users this is a great option because it requires zero changes to your app. If you have more than a few remote
 users, you need Terminal Server licenses and an IT firm can set this up for you.</p>

Hopefully someone who knows more about Office 365 can chime in here. It is my understanding that you can "publish" an Access database to the WEB using Office 365. But I could be wrong on that.
