<h2>            chromebook &#47; office on demand &#47; track changes</h2>
                    <p>Howdies!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Um, so a colleague of mine recently purchased a Chromebook after her trusty laptop died. This has been problematic because we often work together on documents that require us to use Word's Track Changes features, and she can't install Word on her Chromebook.
 We've been attempting to use the Google Docs word processing online app, but this just doesn't do the trick. We've also used the free online version of Word but that also doesn't use Track Changes. My colleague and her husband share the Chromebook, and he
 happens to be a student.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sooo my question goes something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Office on Demand work on the Chromebook? And more particularly, do the Track Changes features work on the Chromebook?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, as a follow-up, is Office on Demand available through Office 365 University (it looks like it does)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

    <title>Audio recording in powerpoint slide presentation recording&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vkohli_md  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio recording in powerpoint slide presentation recording&#58; quality audacity vs laptop recorder</h2>
                    I am trying to record a slideshow whereby video of the screen will be incorporated and the audio of the speech will be simultaneously recorded. The audio quality is poor on recording. I have been using audacity with noise reduction for other slides where
 there is no simultaneous pointer position to be recorded. If I use Audacity as the recording software, I cant syncronise the pointer position all through the talk later when i try to correlate them. I tried screen recording but there I do not have a laser
 pointer (that would actually be fine if I get a laser pointer on my screen with chrome or any othersoftware (with screen recording it goes out of the powerpoint presentation.) I am using Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Windows 10 office powerpoint 2016. In built audio
 recocrder is Realtek.

<h3> grahamblaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 - Calendar Very Slow When Navigating</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Office for Mac 2016 for the past few months with no major issues, apart from the occasional applications freeze or bombing, until 1 week ago when Outlook calendar became v slow, you can move from Mail to any tab (People, Tasks &amp; Notes) in
 &lt;1sec, however when I hit Calendar it takes &gt;20secs to open and then any other Calendar request takes a similar amount of time i.e. moving from one week view to another or creating/opening a meeting entry...its crippling me!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I can potentially tie this in to is I was using Tempo as my iPhone 6 calendar (which linked to Outlook) and since they were acquired by Salesforce I haven't been able to delete my Tempo account! The app has gone and I replaced it with
 Sunrise but thought this may be linked to the problem also so I deleted Sunrise and now just use the native iPhone calendar but none of this has cured the problem!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the next Office 2016 for Mac update would cure this problem, which I updated today but I still have the same issue and as my business and social life is run via my calendar I'm somewhat crippled...Any suggestions??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>I think I have found the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one recurring meeting each month from an external contact that 'breeds', there are over 100 entries for the meeting on the same day/time - I've deleted the series for each and everyone but it doesn't delete the series, it only deleted that entry for
 that day in the diary. One day later and that day now has 6 new entries in and grows each time the diary syncs!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user has sent a cancellation notice but that doesn't work!!</p>

            I'm having the same problem. Nokia PC Suite ver 6.85.14.1 installed on Vista Business, Acer laptop with 2GB RAM.<br />
<br />
Tried using Ca-42 on both 6100 and 6020, failed to detect both models; then uninstalled the Connectivity driver that came with the suite and replaced with the drivers that came with the cable, successfully detected my 6020 but failed on the 6100. IR on the
 6100 is OK; only problem the acer is company property so not long term "ownership".<br />
<br />
Home PC is XP sp2, haven;t tried it out yet. Also tried using CA-53 and DKU-2 cables - failed on all counts.<br />
<br />
Really need help though I know both models are "dinosaurs".<br />
<br />
thansk &amp; regards,<br />

            Sorry, man. Thanks for the lead but the web link didn't help at all coz I'm using original Nokia CA-42 cable (though Made in Thailand).<br />
<br />
For my Vista machine, I'm running via IR so problem solved there.<br />
For my XP at home, it detects my 6020 but not my 6100. The 6100 detects the cable but not the PC Suite. I have restarted my PC several times, restarted the 6100 and also reinstalled the PC Suite but no joy! 8-(<br />
<br />
Under 'Device Manager', XP shows:<br />
1. Modems - Nokia CA-42 GSM USB Modem<br />
2. Portable devices - Nokia 6020 (red x)<br />
3. Wireless Communication Devices - Nokia CA-42 USB Phone Parent<br />
<br />
I have tried to 'force' install the driver(Nokia_6100_Cable_driver.inf) but XP says "The operation cannot be performed on a device information element that has not been registered"<br />
<br />
Looking for the VID &amp; PID didn't go well either. When XP reported "unknown Hardware", those numbers showed up as '0000/0000'. Paid a fair bit of $$ for the original cable. Looks like if I have to run the 6100 at home, will have to get an IRDa and won;t be sure
 if that, too, will work either.

            <span>Hi Everyone,&nbsp;<br />
I also bought this non-original CA-42 cable, and I had problems installing it. I read this thread and finally I figured it out myself so here is my solution, I hope it will help someone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This one regards installation on Windows VISTA, but I guess it will work on XP as well. my cable came in a box that looked like Nokia (fonts like Nokia) but in the manual they wrote "NOK" everywhere instead of "Nokia", the cable turned out to be a "Prolific
 PL-2303" cable.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, first of all, to start up clear unplug the cable, uninstall nokia pc suit and any previous installation of the CA-42 driver and anything related to that. after you done it, its important to reboot your computer. then when windows finished to load up, explore
 the installation CD and run "PL-2303 vista driver installer" for windows vista, or "Nokia CA-42 USB driver installer" for winXP.&nbsp;<br />
let it finish and ONLY THEN plug the cable in. if it went right you will see the "found new hardware" notification, and it should identify it automaticly and say something like successfully installed Prolific PL-2303 (COM X) if you use VISTA, or successfully
 installed Nokia CA-42 cable on XP.&nbsp;<br />
after that I recommend you to go to "device manager" and see that it looks OK under the category "ports (COM &amp; LTP)", on the same chance see on which port the cable is working, on my computer it installed it on "COM 8".&nbsp;<br />
now, you would like to install Nokia PC Suite, but don't install the version that came on the CD because it won't work. download the latest version from Nokia and install it. after yo done that you should open Nokia PC Suite and go to settings -&gt; manage connections.
 there you will see several options - 1)bluetooth, 2)IR, 3)Serial Cable CA-42, 4)USB. make sure the CA-42 option is marked with a "V", then click on it (it should be painted in blue background) then click on the settings button (it looks like a working tool
 for opening screws) there you shloud choose the serial port you saw the cabel is using in the device manager and click OK, if it wont let you use this port then plug the phone and it will let you choose the right port and recognize the phone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Goodluck!</span>

<h2>            Support for Windows 10 applications</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to appeal to you about the future of <strong>Windows 10</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will the application run the operating system on a netbook, a screen resolution of
<strong>1024x600</strong>? The current Windows 8.1 is installed on the netbook, but do not run MUI-application. I'd love to in Windows 10 everything was in order. I'm not one owner of the netbook, in the world of - millions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sincerely, Belek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp;I apologize for the grammatical errors. I do not know English. So I had to use a translator.</p>

<br />
Just thinking, do you log out of this site when you leave? It's the same Live ID so maybe you can't be logged into multiple sites at the same time???<br />

 did a complete virus scan and it was detected near the end. McAfee quarentined it but could not elaborate what it is.</p>

<h3> sneaky snake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 ISOs</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased MS Office 2016 and Project 2016 thru the MS HUP. &nbsp;I have the 32 and 64-bit online installers. &nbsp;However, I would like the offline ISOs to make backup media from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an option to purchase backup media for $16/title, but that seems excessive and unnecessary if I can just obtain the ISOs and build the media myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to get these files for Windows 7 / Office 2007 / Office 2010 (in the past), and Windows 10 (recently), for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the practice of furnishing ISOs for offline install coming to an end? &nbsp;If not, will these be posted for Office Pro 2016?</p>

            <p>I just tried this with no luck. &nbsp;Since I purchased thru the HUP, my license does not get associated with my MS account. &nbsp;Thus, I have no products available to D/L. &nbsp;Similarly, when I input my HUP product key the systems replies stating that it is unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called customer support today. &nbsp;Apparently, they hold the HUP licensees hostage with respect to offline images. &nbsp;You have to purchase the DVD for $16. &nbsp;Notwithstanding the fact that $16+10=$26 for the entire office pro suite 2016 is a good deal for the
 end user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am curious if the HUP Prod Key is only good to use on the backup DVD or if any offline DVD installer will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. &nbsp;:-J</p>

    <title>PC Suite and Nokia 6230i no supported - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hotspur---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Suite and Nokia 6230i no supported</h2>
                    I cannot down load the contacts folder names from my upgraded Nokia 6230i either by USB bluetooth or through a USB DKU-2 cable. My previous Nokia 6230 shook hands and transferred with ease in either connectivity. In the present set up, PC Suite refuses
 to download (though it recognises that the phone is connected) and puts up an error message saying the phone does not support the PC Suite software. I have downloaded the latest version of PC Suite, rebooted everything often, and even been give a replacement
 phone by O2 who thought (wrongly) that it was a 'one-off' error in the original phone. For information, the widows browser allows data, music and photo files to be downloaded but, of course, gives no route into the contacts folder which I seek.

            do you get an error saying there is a file missing? there have been other posts on the software board saying this, the solution is to get the firmware flashed onto the phone again. also, you dont mention what pc suite version you are using?

            Thanks for the message. I am using the lastest PC Suite download from t'internet. I am led to believe that my problem is the age of my mobile phone contract with O2 which began as a BT cellnet contract in 1987. Nowadays it is called 12 months all time
 75 and this doesn't, for example, allow photos to be sent as text attachments as that facility did not exist 20 years ago. Apparently I need to seek a SIM update from O2. I'll let you know how I get on. And thanks again, Hotspur

            bear in mind the software update on the phone though, there have been a few posts on the pc suite board where this has happend and been cured by a re-flash.<br />
<br />
i am not certain a sim update would affect the way the phone works with pc suite.

            This is exactly the problem I've been having with PC Suite. I'm glad to find out it's the same with a cable connection before I go out and buy one in an attempt to get some connectivity.<br />
<br />
It looks like the only option 6230i users have is a re-flash, which I understand is going to blank the data already stored in the phone. Nice.<br />
<br />
This is irritating as hell, because the only reason I stayed with Nokia when it came to upgrading my phone was the 'ease' in moving data from one phone to another. I was offered a Motorola RAZR (which comes with a data cable...) but thought this would be easier.<br />
<br />
I guess it shows that the free software supplied by Nokia is worth every penny. Buying a 3rd-party solution seems to be the best answer and will certainly give me better options for my next upgrade.

            by all means you can go get the v3 and its mobile phone tools - but it doesnt do what pc suite does, in fact what it does do it does badly.<br />
<br />
simply take in the phone for a reflash, the engineers can retain all your data - i know as this was done for mre a few months back.

<h2>            Nokia 3500 &#38;quot&#59;no music files found&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    I used the Nokia Software Suite Music Manager to copy AAC music files from my PC to the 256mb MicroSD card in the phone. These files can't be found by the Music Player. I have the latest firmware (v05.51) and the latest version of Nokia Software Suite.
 The phone can play the files through the Media Player, but not through the Music Player. I have tried placing an AAC file in the Music directory, in the top level directory, even in the Tunes directory, but the phone doesn't see it anywhere. Please advise
 how to use the Music Player.

            It turns out to have been a **bleep** Nokia-branded memory card. With a new card, it worked perfectly.

<h2>            Build 16215 - The good, the bad, and the ugly &#40;for me, at least&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Last week I <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/im-considering-swaping-my-insider-preview-laptop/ee1c0158-01b4-4e71-bf36-4853a3b4d8f1" title="I'm considering swaping my Insider Preview laptop with a newer one. Am I missing anything?">
wrote</a>&nbsp;about my indecision on continuing to install Insider builds on my oldest laptop or switch to a newer one.&nbsp; After reading about all the potential issues with Build 16215, I decided yesterday to keep using&nbsp;the old one as the Insider.&nbsp; Now here's the
 good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Good</span> -&nbsp;Although it took quite a long time, the download and installation went flawlessly.&nbsp; The wifi still works.&nbsp; Strangest of all, after the My People/People Bar not working correctly for me&nbsp;in each prior
 build since&nbsp;it was first&nbsp;introduced, it is actually working properly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Bad</span> - Trying to open a music or video file set to use Windows Media Player by default gives the error message "Class not registered."&nbsp; WMP is intact and will play a file if it is open prior to selecting
 the file.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; Then there's the Start Menu crashing almost every time it's used.&nbsp; It sends an error report every time, too.&nbsp; At one point I found 6 instances of Windows Error Reporting at the same time&nbsp;in Task Manager.&nbsp; Here there's only one, but
 after many had already been sent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I upvoted on these issues in Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Ugly</span> - This is the slowest and most resource-intensive build I have ever seen!&nbsp; Desktop Window Manager's memory usage keeps growing and growing out of control, making the system painfully slow!!!&nbsp; I've upvoted
 on entries in Feedback Hub regarding this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully we'll only have the good to talk about next week.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen any of the anomalies you mentioned except that my memory usage went up from around 2.1 GB in previous builds to 3.0 GB in this build. Should I consider this ugly ?</p>

            With the higher-end components in your PC it's not so bad, but mine's on the lowest end of the spectrum.&nbsp; With only 2 GB of memory, it's devastating.

<p>"<span>You have reached the forwarding rule limit. To add a new forwarding rule, please delete an existing one"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is the limit really ONE forwarding rule?</span></p>
<p><span>Gmail allows 20.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; Is only one selection criterion allowed per rule?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I enter (for example) Sender's address there seems to be no facility either to enter other sender addresses or To or Subject fields in the same rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Again this facility is available in Gmail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. Is only one action allowed per rule?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once I select one action, I cannot select another as well.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I cannot select forward and delete in the same rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Again, available in Gmail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5. No exit facility</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There seems to be no "do not process other rules if this rule is true" facility.</span></p>
<p><span>This is very useful for complex processing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Gmail also seems to lack this facility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>6. No way of ordering the rules.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There seems to be no way for me to set the order for rules.</span></p>
<p><span>This is an important feature for logical testing, especially where early exit (above) is not supported.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Gmail is clumsy doing this by either:</span></p>
<p><span>- edit/save all relevant rules to get the order correct</span></p>
<p><span>- export to an XML file, re-order and import</span></p>
<p><span>but at least it can be done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>7. Can filters be set to generate mobile phone alerts?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Some time ago I alerted you, via this forum, that the&nbsp;claim on the filters options page that the option to "set alerts for your mobile phone" is NOT available and this was CONFIRMED. Its time to remove this claim if its still not available. Note this
 does not refer to retrieving emails on a smartphone but to getting an SMS text message notifying the receipt of an email.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There's a lot of issues raised here so take some time to read them...</span></p>
<p><span>My questions relate to Outlook's general stup, and NOT to my account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Kilmolin</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Since you have multiple concerns which are mostly with email rules, then let me answer those one at a time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; New emails arriving into my Outlook.com email account via the Outlook POP3 client bypass my new mail filtering rules.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>Could you provide us the the email rule setup which are being bypassed when on POP3?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; There seems be be a maximum of ONE forwarding rule in Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>Yes, in Outlook.com, you are only allowed to hae email forwarding rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Is only one selection criterion allowed per rule?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>Yes, you are only alloved one criteria for that matter. You will have to create another one for another contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Is only one action allowed per rule?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>Yes, only one action per rule. You will have to creat a new rule for action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. No exit facility</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>That feature is yet to be available in Outlook's email rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. No way of ordering the rules.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ </strong>For this matter, please be informed that the first rule that you have setup is the first action that the system will do. What we are trying to say is that, you will have to manually setup your email rules depending on which action
 you want the system to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Can filters be set to generate mobile phone alerts?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ That feature is yet to be available in Outlook's email rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for the&nbsp;time and trouble you have taken to address my queries. I have some comments in reply, outlined below.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Since you have multiple concerns which are mostly with email rules, then let me answer those one at a time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; New emails arriving into my Outlook.com email account via the Outlook POP3 client bypass my new mail filtering rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Could you provide us the the email rule setup which are being bypassed when on POP3?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I will do more tests on this feature.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There seems be be a maximum of ONE forwarding rule in Outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Yes, in Outlook.com, you are only allowed to hae email forwarding rule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OK, very clear but very limited.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Is only one selection criterion allowed per rule?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Yes, you are only alloved one criteria for that matter. You will have to create another one for another contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You may need another rule for the SAME contact. For example, you may wish to delete all emails from A but only with subject B. That does not seem to be possibe.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Also, it would be possible to workaround the Forward limit if criteria such as sender =A or sender = B were allowed, though the Forward would have to be to the same target email address.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Is only one action allowed per rule?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ Yes, only one action per rule. You will have to creat a new rule for action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OK, very clear but very limited.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>5. No exit facility</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ That feature is yet to be available in Outlook's email rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OK, very clear but very limited.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. No way of ordering the rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ For this matter, please be informed that the first rule that you have setup is the first action that the system will do. What we are trying to say is that, you will have to manually setup your email rules depending on which action you want the system
 to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You have misunderstood this question. My point is&nbsp;that I am fully aware that the order of the rules normally is critical, especially with no exit clause; my reference to Gmail highlights this. There seems no way to guarantee this order in Outlook.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>However this may be irrelevant in Outlook. I have tested another configuration.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For example, and following on from the one action per rule limitation, I created two rules, first a forward, then a delete, targetting the same email.&nbsp;Irrespective of the order in which I created or edited these rules, the delete rule was always
 saved and listed first.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>However, it still works as I intended. Where the same email is targetted by:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 1, sender=A, delete</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rule 2, sender=A, forward</strong></p>
<p><strong>The email is actually both deleted and forwarded, so though the first rule specifies delete, the email is still available to forward.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>And back to the basic question:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there a way of setting the rules order or does it not matter in Outlook?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Can filters be set to generate mobile phone alerts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€¢ That feature is yet to be available in Outlook's email rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then have&nbsp;the claim that it is available&nbsp;removed from the website.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I wasted some time trying to figure out how to enable it before posting a query.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then I learned that this feature doesn't exist.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As I observed and reported myself. However, in software configurations, these features should be defined and documented, not discovered by experiment and test as I had to do.</strong><br />
<br />
About the mobile phone alerts, please provide us a link of the site where this feature is being advertised so we may report it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Go to Inbox&gt;Options&gt;Rules for sorting new messages</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>where it says:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"You can set up rules to automatically handle messages as they come in. You can flag messages, move them to folders, set alerts for your mobile phone, and more."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sadly less, not more, as you cannot set alerts for your mobile phone. Of course a smartphone can access email, without any filter or rule,&nbsp;but that's not the same as an alert, which would be available as an SMS message on any phone - if the feature
 was supported, as it is in Gmail.</strong></p>

            <p>This is ridiculous.&nbsp; What is the use of having a system to prioritize and order rules, when MS goes behind the scenes and arbitrarily applies their own order to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to set a series of rules that categorize the emails and then move/forward them based on that categorization.&nbsp; The current rules system that MS deploys will not allow that because it will execute the MOVE/FORWARD before any of the categorization rules
 are applied.</p>

<p><span>Are you and your contact

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What type of

<h2>            Split text from one cell to multiple cells every 50 characters</h2>
                    <p>I want to split text from one cell to multiple cells every 50 characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally i would prefer not to "cut" words, meaning that if the 50th character "cuts" a word, then the text to be split in the space character before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls check the example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>my cell A1 currently contains the text below (180 characters):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"AUTOBIANCHI A112 CINQUECENTO FIORINO PANDA SEICENTO UNO LANCIA Y10 SEAT FURA IBIZA MARBELLA TERRA ZASTAVA YUGO TERRA ZASTAVA YUGO KADETT MANTA MONZA ROVER 2000-3500 SAAB 90 900 9000 99"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a formula in another cell B1 that results in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"AUTOBIANCHI A112 CINQUECENTO FIORINO PANDA" = 42 characters otherwise it would "cut" the word SEICENTO</p>
<p>
</p><p>then a formula in cell C1 that returns:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"SEICENTO UNO LANCIA Y10 SEAT FURA IBIZA MARBELLA" = 48 characters</p>
<p>

    <title>Remove links from Word documents - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove links from Word documents</h2>
                    <p>For years I have been able to remove links from Word documents by selecting them and clicking Crtl + Shift + F9.</p>
<p>That keystroke combination no longer works in Word 2013 and 2015. There <em>must be
</em>another way to "unlink the fields" in Word.</p>
<p>I've tried searching the commands available to the Quick Access Toolbar but to no avail.</p>
<p>I should add that someone in another thread suggested Command + 6 to unlink the fields. But I have no idea what the "Command" key is.</p>
<p>(Another suggestion was Option + F9!) I'd really appreciate some help.</p>
<p>BTW, the F9 key alone used to update the Table of Contents. Alas, that tool no longer works either, though I was able to add the command to the Quick Launch Toolbar.</p>
                </div>

<p>The Metadata for your initial post indicates that you are using Office 2013 running under WIndows&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;If that is the case, references to a Command key are not relevant.</p>
<p>ALT+F9 does NOT remove links.&nbsp;What is does is toggle between the display of the field codes { } and the result of those fields of ALL of the fields in a document.&nbsp;SHIFT+F9 does the same thing for ONLY the field that is selected.</p>
<p>If you use CTRL+a to select everything in a document, CTRL+SHIFT+F9 will unlink&nbsp;ALL of the fields in the document, converting their results to ordinary text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the clarification regarding the "removal" of links.&nbsp;I did learn to undo the Alt+F9 (after a good deal of panic) by pressing the combination again, so I understand the idea of "toggling."</p>
<p>I&nbsp;used the Ctrl+Shift+F9 "unlink fields" combination (which I had learned&nbsp;from Suzanne Barnhill) to convert links to "ordinary text"&nbsp;for many years.&nbsp;What prompted my original post was that for some inexplicable reason,&nbsp;the combination was suddenly not working.
 The F9 key would not&nbsp;update Tables of Contents either.</p>
<p>However, those combinations are&nbsp;now working correctly. I did run the online repair, so I can only guess that whatever caused those functions to stop working was as mysteriously fixed. Since I don't understand anything about displaying&nbsp;field codes, I will
 avoid Alt+F9 and Shift+F9 in the future.</p>
<p>"All's well that ends well." Thanks again.</p>
<p>Regards, Grandpa</p>

<h2>            My Nokia X6- 16 GB will not turn on</h2>
                    
<p>A few days ago my nokia screen got frozen so i switched it off, when i tried to turn it back on it will not work, i have tried charging and also swopping the battery but no luck it will still not power on!.</p>
<p>If i wanted to give it in for Repair-which&nbsp;i can not do,because i can't back up my phone&nbsp;from&nbsp; images, videos, music etc.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to know if there is a way in which you can back up your mobile even though there is no power? also if there are any suggestions to make my mobile have power again?</strong></p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<p>When you try to switch on do you get the white screen with the blue Nokia logo? Or does it just sit with a black screen like nothing has happened?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can you plug the phone into a PC via USB mass storage mode, does the PC recognise the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid it sounds like you don't have much choice other than to take the phone to a Nokia Care Centre and explain to them (I'd ask to see the engineer who will be working on the phone, don't just speak to the desk guy/gal) that you have data that you
 want preserved if at all possible.</p>

            no data will be lost but you cant turn it, on does your pc recognize the phone the other option is to reformat but all data will be lost after that its a visit to a nokia care center.

<p>I would plug the phone into the mains charger, then while it is charging try connecting to your PC via USB and mass storage mode. If that doesn't work... then really the only option is to visit a repair centre.</p>

            this is the last resort<br />
<br />
To hard reset, press and hold the green call button + red end call button and the camera capture button, then turn on the phone using the power button while holdling the other buttons until you see the Nokia handshake.<br />
<br />
Nota that you will lose all your data in your phone unless you already have a backup of your phone.

            Hi Loyd, thanks for the quick reply. I'm gathering the information. I need to get my hands on another phone and set it up, and reach out to a colleague who also uses a Windows Phone and test some things. I'll be back asap!

<div>Hi Loyd, I'm back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>I've tried it with the same setup on a different mobile phone, with the same results. Forward AD-lookup works fine from the contacts-app, but when the device is called the AD-name is not resolved and it shows the mobile phone number instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have two Lumia devices in my posession for testing purposes. One Lumia 950 XL and one Lumia 650. Both devices are freshly installed and fully up-to-date.</p>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>The 950 XL is signed in with my own work-account, connected to Azure AD and enrolled in MDM.</li><li>The 650 is signed in with another work-account, also connected to Azure AD and enrolled in MDM.</li></ul>
<div>Both accounts have a mobile phone number registered in the AD. The forward lookup works for both accounts, on both phones. So both phones can 'see' the other account's mobile phone number in the AD and resolve their AD-name when calling them. But, when
 I get called by the other person/phone, only their mobile phone number will show up - not their AD-name.</div>

            <p>Hi...if you did not delete the Windows .OLD folder then you can go back to previous build if you really want/need to...</p>
<p>Whats wrong with 14393? <br />
Go to 'Settings'&gt; 'Updates &amp; Security'&gt; &nbsp; and select 'Recovery' &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>you will see 'Go back to earlier build'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will keep all your files&nbsp;&nbsp; but just in case&nbsp;&nbsp; copy your files and programs to a usb disk or external drive first.</p>

    <title>Inserting tables into Outlook templates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting tables into Outlook templates</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add a Word table to an Outlook templates but no matter what I do with the table, get the font down to the smallest size, adjust the row height, it keeps saying the table is "too big". How small do they have to be? I know I put a 3 column 6
 row table with very little writing and had no problem. Admittedly this table is much bigger but before I spend any more time trying to get it to fit, I just wanted to see if anyone can advise how small tables have to be or is there some other way I can make
 the Word table smaller to insert?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            HI Linda,
<br />What is the exact error message?  The only real limitation is on the width - you don't want it too wide that it scrolls.
