    <title>Skype voicemail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype voicemail</h2>
                    On the old Skype this was a no brainer. On the new one, I cannot find anywhere, how to leave a message for someone, who is currently unavailable. When I click on the phone symbol, it starts ringing and there is nothing else to click on to just leave a
 voicemail or video-voicemail.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>You can only send a voice message to a contact if they have activated their voice messaging feature on Skype.

<p>Hello Kenneth,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. I have only tried to send a voice message to one contact on the new Skype, to someone who sends me voice messages regularly, so they must have voice messages activated, no?</p>
<p>I just do not see any options to even try a voice messaging on the new Skype.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply,</p>

<p>I am sorry, but this reply does not make any sense to me. My friend is on the other side of the world and she has no problem voice messaging, I do. She does not know how to operate the communication with you. I also have no idea, what level of Skype she
 has.</p>
<p>I have no voice mail option on my new Skype. It is not that it does not work, it just isn't even there.</p>
<p>Please adjust the system, so there would be an obvious voice mail option like it used to be.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>If your contact sets up his/her voicemail, once the call&nbsp;does not&nbsp;answer you can leave a voice message and send it to him/her. As mentioned, we have successfully sent a voice message using the new Skype even if that person is currently unavailable.

            Thank you for your second reply, Marites. I went to the "How to use Skype messaging according to your advice and did what you said. However, the article is about receiving calls/voicemails not making them, so I imagine it will not help my problem.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b7dbe1b1-45eb-4aef-b702-c069deba5a6d" title="BronislavaVolkova">
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to leave a message once the call beeps end. A&nbsp;generic message will be played and you can leave your message after it. But this still depends on the privacy settings of the user you need to send a voicemail to. If the privacy settings of
 an account is set to only allow people on contacts list,&nbsp;then the same applies to any incoming voice messages. If the settings is set to allow anyone to call the account, then anyone can leave a voice message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, are you calling a user who's part of your contact list or someone who isn't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>It can be because the person you want to leave a voicemail with has not set it up for his account. As a suggestion, please have your contact enable his voicemail settings&nbsp;in his profile by following the steps on this article:

            Thank you for your reply. Why has a new Skype been installed on people's computers that is so much more complicated to operate and yet has inferior features to the old Skype? It sure has made me waste a lot of time for no gain. The old one was just fine.

<h2>            DVD Problem - all discs showing blank</h2>
                    
<p>WIN XP SP3 plus all updates.</p>
<p>This is a follow-up from newsgroups.</p>
<p>Back in Dec 2009 I purchased a new LiteOn IHAP322-22x DVD.</p>
<p>I have recently been using it to boot my computer as I have been getting intermittent BSODs so I have been using an iso boot disc when needed or my OEM XP SP2 disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks later it ground to a halt, so returned it to the supplier.</p>
<p>Having been able to start the computer, without needing the boot disc, I took the opportunity to do a backup with the new dvd.<br />
After doing this I checked to see that all was safely on the disc only to find it was blank - nothing showing.&nbsp; I put the disc into a laptop and all the backup folders were there.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;tried different types of discs, DVD Video, music video, <br />
other backup discs and saved text discs and all are blank.<br />
I have also checked in hardware manager - device working properly - no warnings - tried to update driver[Microsoft 5.1.2535.0] but the one I have is it - no driver to offer in roll back.&nbsp; Tried the troubleshooter and no help there.&nbsp; Uninstall/install no help.&nbsp;
 Lite On confirmed I had the correct driver.</p>
<p>I returned the item under warranty to the supplier - I was informed that the dvd was faulty - new one sent.</p>
<p>This had the same problem as the one returned.&nbsp; No2 was collected and again was tested and found to be faulty - new one sent - same problems - No3 collected and found to have same fault as others.&nbsp; Was told that the next one[No4]] would be tested before
 shipping.&nbsp; No4 did not operate either. The box had been opened so assumed it had been tested.</p>
<p>On receipt of each new item I did the following -</p>
<p>Ckecked in Device Manager - no problems showing - tried the 'troubleshooter' - negative.&nbsp; Uninstalled/installed driver - negative.</p>
<p>Tried run/regedit entry -<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
But there were no Upper or Lower Filters showing, so could not amend/alter etc as per -<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116</a></p>

<p>Hi Damascus,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the feedback. Well there has to be registry entries somewhere that were not correct<br />
and/or a corrupted driver issue. Seems like it could be caused by competing programs though many<br />
claim they have had the issue with no added installations for the CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
Since this may come up again try this.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
Right Click on and EXPORT that key.<br />
<br />
Do the same for any of the "Numbered" ControlSetxxx (where xxx) is a number that has an Enun/IDE<br />
key such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
Do the same for this key :</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
If the issue returns then compare all of those keys and their subkeys to the same ones while you<br />
have the problem.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
I know you have seen this before however pay close attention to the sections about some programs<br />
not working.</p>
<p>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982116</a><br />

Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can Google DVD Decoders and find several good ones. Usually one is included with the System<br />
or the CD/DVD drive.<br />
<br />
You are right that sometimes its easier to re-install Windows however most of these CD/DVD issues<br />
can be fixed in a step or two. Occassionally nothing works except a re-installation.<br />
<br />
Only you as the person that started the thread originally or a moderater can mark this thread as<br />
answered. Even if I could mark it&nbsp;I am not sure which if any replies should be marked.<br />

            Hi  Jack-C
<br />
<br />You cannot actually set a default folder to open Windows File Explorer on. .. 
<br />
<br />What you can do is, right click your preferred folder and choose 'Send To - Desktop (create shortcut)
<br />
<br />You can leave that shortcut on your Desktop, or right click the new shortcut and choose 'Pin to Taskbar' if that is where you like to open File Explorer form
<br />
<br />Then use that shortcut to open File Explorer on that folder . ..

    <title>Windows Vista &#34;Complete Back up&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista &#34;Complete Back up&#34;</h2>
                    Hello and thank you ahead of time for an answer. It seems impossible to find help for Microsoft products now a days unless I pay a fee to get help for a product I all ready paid for.<br />
<br />
To the point: I can't find my CDs that came with my computer and I am having many problems with my Vista edition right now. I wanted to either: try a new windows (windows 7) or try something else while still having windows vista on the computer. I'm trying
 to figure out if there is a way to do a complete back up of my computer as is so if something happens I don't need to figure out where those CDs went to. If there is no way to do a complete back up of Vista Home premium then how do I do a dual boot thingy
 to run 2 different OS on my computer?

            Hi Chioto,<br />
<br />
Vista Home premium doesn't have any 'advanced' backup facilities unlike Vista Business/Enterprise and Ultimate. Sadly your only option is to use a third party imaging/backup application. You might like to take a look at this free one
<a href="http://www.paragon-software.com/home/db-express/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xxxxxxx/</a>&nbsp;I haven't used this one personally, but I have reviewed other Paragon products and have been impressed. Another alternative, which unfortunately isn't free is Acronis True Image
<a href="http://www.acronis.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acronis.com</a> . Acronis is the application I use and can recommend it.<br />
<br />
As for dual booting it really depends upon what you want to do. The first pre-requisite, of course, is either two seperate partitions or two seperate hard drives (assuming you system BIOS allows booting to both hard drives.) If you are going to dual boot Vista
 premium and Windows 7 then all you really need do is install Windows 7 onto a second partition or hard drive. Problems start to occur when you want older operating systems installed, say Windows XP. Microsoft's instructions for dual booting is 'always install
 the 'oldest' operating system first, followed by the newer operating system.&nbsp; However, if you were thinking of installing Windows XP as a dual boot then this link from my website will give you some pointers:

 to work better with my 4-year old laptop, including the HDMI connection which now works perfectly.</p>

<h3> jadejaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0x80070001 when trying to sync Windows 10 Mail with my Outlook account.</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, I keep getting error code 0x80070001 whenever I try to sync my email with the new ap. This was&nbsp; not a problem in Windows 8.1 for me, so the update has something to do with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really even want to sync the email. What I want to get to work is the Calendar ap. The new ap did not sync any of my appointments from Outlook Calendar. I looked it up and it turns out that, in order to get the Calendar ap to sync, you need to sync
 to the mail ap (which isn't working).&nbsp; I really don't want to have to go through and manually schedule all of my appointments again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>J</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Just tried to sync to my gmail account, and it won't seem to work either. I didn't get error codes for it, though.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I do run Avast, which I know sometimes have issues with blocking certain programs, but I've tried a few solutions and none worked for it. Since there are so many complaints about this same issue, I really do not think my problem is with Avast.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be an overheating problem and that&nbsp;is normally the main reason for your problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If it was a Hardware problem, it would tend not to restart.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is possible to have a hairline crack in the Motherboard, etc, which only becomes obvious once it heats up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html</span></a></p>
<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            CPU spikes on foreground programs when moving mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem that is bugging me for several months and has passed even to Windows 10. Starting a few months ago I noticed in Task Manager that when I move my mouse a little bit faster, the program that is currently on foreground starts spiking the
 CPU in the range of 10 to 30%. When it started, I was on Windows 8.1, but it continued to my Windows 10 upgrade, then on the fresh install. To summarize my problem:</p>
<p>- every program that is currently on foreground spikes my cpu when moving the mouse;</p>
<p>- not malware, as it survived on several installations of windows and an upgrade;</p>
<p>- not mouse related, I've tried 2 other mice and they have the same problems;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the computer is quite powerful so the polling rate doesn't affect it that much; I'm keeping it at 500hz but the cpu spiking decreases by a bit when I go on 250;</p>
<p>- when I did the Windows 10 clean install I've tested the issue after every program installation and it seemed to start after installing my AMD gpu driver and control center. On the other hand, Windows Update might have downloaded drivers in the background
 because when I uninstalled everything gpu related with DDU the problem was still present but the spikes decreases to about 5-10%.
</p>

            <p>Hello again and sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've written in my first post, &nbsp;<strong>the issue is still present in safe mode</strong>. The only difference in safe mode is that
<strong>Windows Explorer</strong> shares the CPU spike with&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Client Server Runtime Process&nbsp;</strong>and also the spike is not that big (8-9% both), which is funny because the same thing happens after
 I uninstall Catalyst Control Center and drivers. (check first post)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regarding the <strong>clean boot</strong>, I've done that step and
<strong>the issue is still present</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I've run SFC, DISM you name it. No problems found. I would remind you I've had the problem on Windows 8.1 also.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Later edit: </strong>I've discovered something interesting. If for example I'm on desktop and open a context menu and move the mouse fast there is no CPU spike for
<strong>explorer.exe</strong>. The same thing happens for <strong>Chrome</strong> and the other foreground programs. I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Did you even read what I wrote above? &nbsp;The issued happened on several installations of Windows, including 8.1 and 10 (one of them being a reformat). Also, several of my friends with different hardware/software have this issue, but they started experiencing
 it after the Windows 10 update. I have the update settings on auto so I always have the latest Windows updates. Again, drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What more of an indication that is a windows 10 problem do you want further than the fact that several people I know experience this problem, it's not malware related and invoking a context makes the issue go away. Do you want me to debug it for you?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, it's about 1.5 years later and several windows updates since I wrote my original post and I still have this problem. I have asked other people about it and some have it, some don't. The good thing in this whole situation is that it doesn't affect you
 in everyday use, let's say like gaming where you need to move the mouse a lot, but it's annoying to know it's there in the first place when it shouldn't be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you write here, you will get the usual copy-paste indian tech support response and I guess that Microsoft developers don't have the issue on their radar or they don't have it that high up the list to take care of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe with the April Creators Update...</p>

<p>
</p><p>CPU spiking to 15-30% above normal, youtube videos stuttering, if i move my mouse in games the framerate drops from 120+ to 15fps, mouse gets choppy and i can't aim properly in the few games that the fps doesn't drop so much</p>
<p>In some games without even moving the mouse it's gone from an average of 120+ to 10fps and if i move my mouse or click the game freezes completely.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen of Death&#58; error critical_process_died on Windows 8 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david.kirk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen of Death&#58; error critical_process_died on Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have looked all over for answers specific to my problem, haven't seen any so here goes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a Lenovo u410 back in August and upgraded to Windows 8 Pro a month ago.&nbsp; Several days ago, I got the Blue Screen of Death with the following error: critical_process_died</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic repair does nothing, kicks me to a screen where I have to select a keyboard layout.&nbsp; From there, I have the option of troubleshooting or just powering down the PC, literally those are the only two options on the screen for me to select.</p>
<p>When I select the troubleshoot option and try to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refresh: I get error message "The drive where Windows is installed is locked.&nbsp; Unlock the drive and try again."</p>
<p>Reset: "Unable to reset your PC.&nbsp; A required drive partition is missing."</p>
<p>System restore: "To use System Restore, you must specify which Windows installation to restore.&nbsp; Restart this computer, select an operating system and then select System Restore."</p>
<p>System Image Recovery: "An internal error occurred.&nbsp; The following information might help you resolve the error: The system cannot find the file specified. (0x800700002)</p>
<p>Automatic repair can't repair the problem (whatever it is)</p>
<p>And then I have the command prompt available.&nbsp; The weird thing here is that it shows up as X:/windows/system32.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that weird?&nbsp; I am used to C:/windows etc.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate your help.&nbsp; Lenovo wants to charge me $89 to send me a disc with Windows 7 on it (and my computer doesn't even have an optical drive :-/) to then reinstall Windows 7 and then re-upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, which seems like a crazy
 amount of hoops to try and jump through.&nbsp; The Lenovo support lady seemed to think that Windows Update had something to do with the crash, but I don't really trust her knowledge...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for any help you can give me.</p>

<strong><br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:</strong><br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />

            <p>i had the same problem before the computer just started and went to the bluescreen instantly saying critical process died. i also read many people talking about this problem and i found MANY of them using SSD. so i went to ocz website and upgraded firmware
 of my SSDs in raid 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so try:</p>
<p>1. update the firmware of your SSD, i am using ocz agility 3 x2 in raid 0 mode. you have to switch back to AHCI mode or IDE mode to upgrade the SSD. But for other manufacture i consider their process is more or less the same</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. try run your computer on just 1 drive and 1 memory stick. It might be a bad memory or even your board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope this can give you a little hint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best luck</p>

<h2>            Autodesk AutoCAD &#40;Possible RegEdit Issues - No Search Results Have Helped&#41; Error 1606 E&#58;&#47;</h2>
                    I've tried absolutely everything I can to circumvent this issue. Regedit seems to be out of the question, as every Google result I've followed as best I can and I just can't seem to work around this problem. I'm wondering if it's perhaps an issue caused
 by using an SSD as the OS HDD and an independent drive for everything else. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

                    <p>PGR has been one of my favorite racing games since the original Xbox. The latest one I've played was on the Xbox 360, PGR 3, and it was a good game. From the graphics, to the cars, tracks and everything else was beautifully done. PGR is what Grand Turismo is to PlayStation. It looks as good as the simulator racers, but fun like Need for Speed.&nbsp;I'm shocked that it hasn't been made BC, especially it being a must have if you owned any Xbox console. Hope you guys read my post and other post I've made as well. It's plenty of gems on the 360 and OG Xbox.</p>

            <p>Hello ShantaunuGogoi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some computers with poorly-built cooling systems will get hot while you are doing those kinds of things on them and they will shut themselves down to protect your data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try blowing a fan into the vent on the back of the computer and see if that solves the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Not a lot to go on - but I will repeat what the other responder has suggested about "heat" being a possible explanation.&nbsp; Make sure - especially if this is a laptop, but even if a desktop type computer/tower system - that your system has enough room for the
 fans to function.&nbsp; That means a place to take in air as well as a place to expel it.&nbsp; A lot of people will put their laptop on a soft surface and that usually blocks the air intake or keeps it from being able to blow the air out - make sure you use laptops/notebooks
 in a place where they can have free airflow all around (a hard surface where the feet on the bottom give them the space needed.)&nbsp; As for desktops - make sure they are not in enclosed spaces like some older desk designs have them - unless they also have some
 airflow built in to expel the hot air from the desk (some desks actually have fans in these compartments.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In addition - make sure you clean out the system of dust with the compressed air cans for such.&nbsp; The air cans limit the amount of moisture expelled when they are used in comparison to other methods - and you just want enough air power to blow off the dust -
 not other small components. heh<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Now - it could be software related - so here is what I suggest on that front...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">MalwareBytes (FREE)</font></a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</font></a></li></ul>
<p>Removing <i><b>everything</b></i> they find.&nbsp; Restarting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">eSet Online Scanner</font></a>. Remove <b><i>whatever</i></b> is found.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
Uninstall all Internet Plugins (Real Player, QuickTime, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, Adobe Air, Microsoft Silverlight, K-lite codec pack, etc.) from your computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Restart.<br />
<ul>

[side note: if you do not have alternate browsers installed at this time, try some:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Mozilla Firefox</font></a>,
<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Google Chrome</font></a> and
<a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Opera</font></a> are decent ones.]<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Install the following plugins:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Adobe Reader</font></a></li><li><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Adobe Flash Player</font></a></li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Apple QuickTime</font></a></li><li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Microsoft Silverlight</font></a></li><li><a href="http://java.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Java Runtime Environment</font></a></li><li><a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/KLite-Codec-Pack-Basic/1094057842/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">BASIC K-Lite Codec Pack</font></a></li></ul>
Be <b><i>careful</i></b> when installing each of them <u>NOT</u> to install anything other than the application.&nbsp; No extra software like toolbars or virus scanners or whatever - uncheck the extras as you install (go through the steps of each and
<i>READ/COMPREHEND</i> what you click on!)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Come back and let everyone know how things are working.<br />

    <title>Share function in Edge won&#39;t work, for e-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erwin_837  say:</h3>
<h2>            Share function in Edge won&#39;t work, for e-mail</h2>
                    <p>When I try and share a website when using Microsoft Edge, and click on the share icon, it gives me the option to share a screenshot or a link, using Mail or One note.&nbsp; When I select Mail, it doesn't do anything, almost like it not hooked up to my Outlook
 2013 e-mail address.&nbsp; There was some sort of e-mail set-up when I first clicked the share icon after installing Windows 10, but not sure how that worked or why it did not set up my e-mail account properly.&nbsp; I think this current Mail icon is associated with
 a Microsoft mail account, which I do not have or use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same thing on a Laptop with Windows 10 recently and the Share function is set up with my personal e-mail, twitter, one note, etc, and the all work fine, so not sure what I did different on that computer.&nbsp; Right now, I just want to reset this somehow
 so I can add in my personal e-mail or somehow&nbsp;just add in my personal e-mail so&nbsp;I can share websites etc. &nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for quick response and suggestions . I did not have an existing account with the Mail app, so nothing to delete there, but I did add my personal e-mail account to the Mail App account.&nbsp; I also switched from signing in with&nbsp; a local account to signing
 in with the Microsoft account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then rebooted.&nbsp; Nothing has changed with the Edge Share function.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have mentioned in my original e-mail that I had decided to hide the "Mail" and One Note " in the Edge Share app options and then unhide them to see
 if that would make a difference but now they completely gone when I try to share something, and there is no provision to unhide them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now when I try to share a website or a screenshot, I get a message that I do not have any apps to share stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do install apps within Share to share stuff?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed on my other computer that it has Twitter, One Note, Mail, Messenger and my personal e-mail as apps available to Share, I have no idea how they got there during the initial set-up, but they are there and it works.&nbsp; On this computer, I only had the
 Mail and OneNote apps from the start and now I have hid both of them, and have nothing to work with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I still need to know how to install my personal e-mail app within the Share program and how to install the Twitter app and how to restore the hidden One Note app.&nbsp; This should not be that hard to do but I find it very frustrating to work with.&nbsp; I think
 something got screwed up during the initial set-up of the Share function and now it is locked up or unresponsive, and no way to change it that I can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

</p><p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you hid OneNote and Mail from Microsoft Edge share option. Could you tell us how exactly you did that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if you have set Mail app as the default app by following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + I to open settings.</p>
<p>2. Click "system" and click "default apps" on the left pane.</p>
<p>3. Under Email, choose Mail App to set as the default application.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>To hide OneNote and Mail on Microsoft Edge share options, I used the mouse right click on the OneNote icon, and it gave me an option to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did that but there was no option to unhide after that.&nbsp; The right click had no effect after that.&nbsp; I see now
 that on the latest versions of Windows 10 share, this hide option is no longer there, it just has an option to "pin", so possibly Microsoft has fixed this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You missed the entire point of my question, I did not want to set the Mail app as my default application, I wanted to set my personal e-mail account as the default.&nbsp; It would not let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a long story short, I reinstalled Windows 10 and then when I first set up the Share, I made sure to set up my personal e-mail account and it worked fine this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you screw this up somehow, I don't think you get a second chance and you have
 to reinstall Windows 10 again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I am done with this for now.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But have another question on this subject -when you use this share function in Edge, it keeps the e-mail addresses of the 5 or so most often used addresses in a list for easy retrieval. &nbsp;But if you want to delete a e-mail address off this list, there is
 no way of doing this, why not?</p>

            I'm jumping into this discussion rather late but my concern has a different twist I believe. I have MS Outlook and really have no desire to start/support another email application and whatever that leads to. I'm amazed that Microsoft makes both Outlook
 and MS Edge but apparently does not support Edge passing information to Outlook! Why in heavens name would one want to make the MS Mail the default program for email when one has a perfectly good Outlook application for email?? Is there some work-around for
 this issue ... at least I see it as an issue.

    <title>Windows boot loader insists on booting from secondary SATA drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> littlenoodles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows boot loader insists on booting from secondary SATA drive</h2>
                    I just bought a new PC (HP P7-1380t, motherboard:&nbsp; H-Joshua-H61-uATX) with Windows 7 and a GPT partitioning scheme.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to add the SATA drive from my old XP system as a secondary drive on the new box - both to copy files over and to have as a backup drive.&nbsp; The old box was set up as a dual boot XP, Linux system with the grub bootloader in the MBR.<br />
<br />
When I plug the old drive into SATA1, the windows boot loader tries to boot from it when I select Windows 7 from its menu (the only choice there).&nbsp; Prior to that it displays a progress meter with the message "Windows is loading files".&nbsp; Then it displays the
 grub boot menu (presumably from the old drive's MBR).&nbsp; How could this be happening?&nbsp; Does the Windows boot loader have its own sense of drive ordering separate from the BIOS? When I tried disabling SATA1 in the BIOS's 'legacy boot order' section (the EFI boot
 order section doesn't list individual hard drives - just the windows boot loader), The windows boot loader starts, but when I select Windows 7, it says 'drive not found'.&nbsp; In other words, even with SATA1 disabled in the BIOS boot order, the windows boot loader
 is trying to boot from it.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, if I plug the same drive into SATA3 instead of SATA1, Windows 7 boots normally and can see the drive as F:.&nbsp; But plugged in that way, the BIOS doesn't see it, and neither does a linux system I booted from CD.&nbsp; I'd like the option to dual
 boot, so I really want to make this SATA1 (or make the BIOS see it as SATA3...).<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated - including links to detailed documentation on the EFI windows boot process, with info and locations on whatever config files are involved.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rob<br />

Not quite.&nbsp; I'm trying to boot from the new system's drive in SATA port 0, which works without the old drive plugged into port 1.&nbsp; I want the old drive in port 1 as a backup, but don't want to wipe it out until I have everything copied to / set up the way I
 want on the new drive.&nbsp; But with the old drive in port 1, windows won't boot off of port 0.&nbsp; It loads the grub bootloader, presumably from the MBR of port 1 - even though I told the EFI boot loader (which had to have been loaded from port 0) to boot windows
 7 - also on the port 0 drive.<br />

            What I mean is that in sata3, the BIOS doesn't include it in its boot order - I don't know if it literally 'sees' it or not.&nbsp; But when I boot a linux CD,
<i>that</i> doesn't see it.&nbsp; So I was assuming it's the BIOS's job to tell linux what drives are present.<br />
<br />
That said, with the drive in SATA3, Windows <i>does</i> see it, by which I mean its XP partition is there as the F: drive, and I can copy files from it to the new drive.&nbsp; But the linux /home partition is not visible, so I can't copy files from there.&nbsp; I suppose
 I could put the drive into SATA1, boot a live linux CD, and copy files to a new linux partition on the new drive.&nbsp; I had just hoped I could plug it into SATA1 and have both Windows and linux see it.&nbsp; I'm sure Windows
<i>would</i> see the drive in SATA1, but I can't get windows to boot with the drive in SATA1.&nbsp; The Windows boot loader insists on trying to boot from the old drive when it's plugged into SATA1, even though windows 7 (and the boot loader itself) is on SATA0...<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that if I wiped the old drive, I <i>could </i>boot windows with it in SATA1, but I don't want to wipe it until I have everything set up, copied, backed up, etc...<br />

            If you have a UEFI BIOS then you have not installed Windows in UEFI mode.  The presence of Active partition means it is installed to Legacy BIOS (or CSM) which is NOT taking advantage of any of the features of the modern UEFI BIOS - as I said this is like disabling all of the safety features on a brand new car. 
<br />
<br />To install correctly using UEFI create the bootable media using the Media Creation Tool so we know it's UEFI compatible, booting the media ONLY  as a UEFI device, deleting all partitions off the drive during install so that it resets the formatting to GPT required for a UEFI install.  
<br />
<br />Then follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> Beforehand enable UEFI in the UEFI setup accessed by one of these methods: 
<br /><a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />When you install to UEFI you should have the other hard drives unplugged so they don't interfere.   The other SSD will no longer boot until it is reinstalled after the first one is done, then it should be reinstalled the same way and this will create a Windows Dual Boot menu.
<br />
<br />Until you do this then you have one bootable SSD Disk0 booting in Legacy Mode..  You said you have another you want to Dual Boot.  If this is DIsk1 and you know for sure it previously booted OK, then you can install EasyBCD to the working Windows, add the second OS on the Add OS to Boot Menu tab, by drive Letter, type and name.  If there is a usable Windows install on Disk1 it will be found and added to the boot menu this way:  
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/EasyBCD+Basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/EBCD/EasyBCD+B...</a>
<br />Download and install Easy BCD, no email or name needed:

<p>I bought back it when it was new. I hadn't really discovered achievements at that time. So I just played through and beat game without trying to unlock any. I think I might blow the dust off it and unlock what I missed.</p>
<p>[/quote]All this talk makes me want to play through it again lol.&nbsp; I think I'm going to have to earn some more achievements for it as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those who don't know anything about the game, there are some good videos <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/thedarkness/videos.html?tag=tabs%3Bvideos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have been working through The Darkness for a while now, think it cost me the grand sum of 2.99£ and its been worth every penny. I have spoke to someone who has played some of the sequel and he thinks its come on alot since the first game and the new cell
 shaded graphics really fit the game nicely.</p>

                    <p>After multiple trys to resolve this issue i cant think of anything else to do apart from a fresh install that may help. Back story:</p>
<p>i started getting a pop up from what looks like a program called Fishinggame.exe how ever i have never installed a fishing game before so tjought it might be a virus did all the checks with WD malware bytes etc but cant get rid of it. It might be linked
 to Unity engine in some way but the file location says its acces denied manual search for it reviels thsts theres nothing called fishing game or&nbsp;<span>RVT-DNmodule in my files nor on google/youtube.</span>&nbsp;Does
 anyone know what it could be and how to get rid of it.</p>

            Hi WookieAdam ... I would recommend resetting your PC.
<br />This will wipe all applications but you can do the option to keep files.
<br />Best to do this when malware accidentally got installed.
<br />To do this go to start - settings - update and security - recovery 
<br />Click Get started for Reset.
<br />Make sure to select the one to KEEP files.       
        </p>

            Yeah looks like the best way. If i download the creation tool for the bootable usb will that boot straight away when i plug it into the infected computer? Because i cant do anything at the moment no bios no login screen just a blue screen that resets its
 self everytime.

                    <p>Purchased new computer with 10 installed. &nbsp;Mail is a joke. &nbsp;Is there another program that can be installed that can replace the current mail program. &nbsp;Going to google as this does not work. &nbsp;No folders can be added, cannot switch between a mail being read
 and new mail, etc. &nbsp;No contacts can be transferred, etc. &nbsp;I think Microsoft designer of this program has never used email.</p>

            Yes I am talking about the Mail program in Windows 10. &nbsp;There is no way to add a folder to save specific emails. &nbsp;Also, there is a problem in sizing some emails to fit screen. &nbsp;This program is a joke. &nbsp;I have used windows since they came out in the 90's
 and this is the worst program, it moves windows back to stone age. &nbsp;As a personal user I do not want to spend $150.00 to purchase Outlook to receive and save mail. &nbsp;Windows 10 will make me look at Apple on all new computer purchases as I do not want to learn
 a new system.

            <p>It worked fine with 2 mail accounts, one outlook (the inlog one) and one (old) Hotmail. But in december 2015 something changed; Now all I get is that due to a system error it does not work any more.

            <p>So true, the program is a Abomination.<br />
<br />
Infact, i install PC's for people a lot, and almost all of the people i have helped upgrading to Windows 10 where complaining about Functionality being over simplified, which leads to reduced functionality, simply put, you can't hardly do anything with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it looks ugly, and your mail isn't very well organized, the tabs for a single mail are so big that you can only see a few mails on the left side, it sucks plainly said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to agree with the OP that i'm inclined to believe that the programmer who made it hardly ever uses mail apps on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old Windows live Mail was 10x better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that Microsoft wan't to make things look all "Metro", and in some cases it does the Job, but in some cases, it messes up all functionality, i personally think that maintaining Windows 10 PC,s has also become more of a bother because they hid a lot
 of configuration features behind simple menu's that don't clearly state where it leads too.</p>
<p>It took me a lot of googling to find everything, it's bothersome.</p>

            <p>The good news is Windows Live Mail does work quite well under Windows 10 as I am still using it as my primary e-mail client. I'm using the 2008 version, build 12.0.16.06&nbsp;at that. The bad news is Microsoft is currently changing&nbsp;the way how Outlook.com works
 that it will soon cause&nbsp;compatibility issues with Windows Live Mail. See attached. As I really don't care for the Windows 10 Mail app either,&nbsp;I will soon be needing to move to something else.

            <p>I know, i'm still using it too, and the mail you got from Microsoft is the exact reason why i replied to this thread, i know it's a long shot to give a reply like mine, but somewhere i'm hoping they fix up the Mail App to be more like Windows Live Mail,
 but i won't hold my breath for that, cause i really don't believe that anything we say change the designers minds, although i think it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should actually make Polls about stuff like this to see what users want from them.</p>
<p>Instead of always stubbornly doing their way.</p>

            This is the last straw. I have used Windows Live Mail for a long time and love it. I have switched several people over to it because I like it so much. I maintain my brothers computer also and we are shopping for new ones since ours are 7 years old. I
 am going to the Apple store then changing to something like Firefox or Thunderbird.

<h2>            XBox 360 System Video Player App gives No Videos Found message when trying to stream videos from Windows 8.1 PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Windows 8.1 PC and the Xbox 360 video player app is no longer working.&nbsp; I can see the root Videos folder, but no content.&nbsp; Same for Pictures and Music.&nbsp; This is still working fine from my old/previous PC.&nbsp; I've tried everything I found in this
 thread:</p>

<p>
</p><p>But nothing there helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new PC has been joined to the homegroup, I can share files from the Videos folder to and from my old PC.&nbsp; And, the Play To feature in Windows Media player works with the XBox 360.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to setting up the network connection as a public network.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Public network: </strong>By default, the public network location type is assigned to any new networks when they are first connected. A public network is considered to be shared with the world, with no protection between the local computer and any
 other computer. Therefore, the Windows Firewall rules associated with the public profile are the most restrictive. This blocks the following apps and services from working: PlayTo, file sharing, network discovery, and automatic setup of network printers, TVs,
 and other devices. <br />
<br />
<strong>Private network: </strong>A private network location type can be for home or small office networks, or when you know and trust the people and devices on the network. This setting allows your PC to connect to a homegroup and devices on the network, such
 as printers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to change the network type on your computer to private <span>and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I would say your Wifi is simply scanning&nbsp;continually for data connections in range, which is normal behaviour. &nbsp;It will only pick up phones where they have been set up as Wifi Hotspots, presumably because the user has an appropriate data contract. Your own
 mobile phone won't be detected if it doesn't have that capability , or if you haven't turned on the feature on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any time, I can see the Wifi Networks of several of my neighbours and also a number of other wifi devices in range, all sensibly password locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue you might want to check is whether your computer is set to share updates across the internet, which does allow others to share your internet connection: Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Choose how updates are delivered : Is "PCs
 on my Network, and PCs on the Internet" selected? If so then other devices will be able to access the update files on your computer via your Network connection.</p>

            <p>It is normal for other Wireless networks to be seen in the Network under Win7 to 10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are wide broadcasting their network to others,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you will notice unless it is open network meaning no SSID or Password required you can not connect to them and they can not connect to use if you are using your ISP security SSID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just part of the Broad casting of the wireless networks so users can see who near their surrounding area if you switch off Broadcasting in your Modem wireless section you will notice you can no longer your network being displayed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happen is it becomes a hidden network for the 4g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5g Networks can still be seen but if you turn off both noone else in the house can connect to the wireless connection as they will not be able to see the connection in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the main computer will be able to detect the wireless network when broad casting on both 4g and 5g are switched off.</p>

            <p>THE SOLUTION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that my new router for IPv6 had WPS enabled. I never use that so I disabled it and now no phones show up.
</p>
<p>I assume that the want-to-connect device shows up in the Windows network because many routers have a physical button on the side to press to simplify connection without typing in a password, and this is a sensible way to show that the device is ready to
 connect. Now that I have explained it all to myself it seems sensible, and I am happy.</p>
<p>The steady march of a huge range of phone that I was seeing must be from passing cars, with maybe a neighbour sometimes.</p>
<p>I hope this helps others.</p>

            As you can read below this was a router configuration issue. I had already checked through the Microsoft networking configuration. Thank you, Deepika, for the reply that tried to 'light' the way.

            That's the temporary location of the update file prior to installation. Windows update will place its junk of the drive with the most space.<br />
<br />
It can be removed.<br />
<br />
Check you add/remove area and you'll see that the update has been installed. Leave it.
