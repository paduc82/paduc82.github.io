<h2>            Outlook - 9 months of email disappeared from my Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I realised that all of my email from November 2016 to September 2017 disappeared from my Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>I tried contact the Customer Service from Microsoft and they keep saying it "just happened" with no real technical explanation behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Paid Customer I would like to know what happened to my email and have them recovered from your backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>M.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok, let's go through this again... [note that you answer appeared in almost every previous complain about the same issue]</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I use Microsoft Outlook.com for my business as a Paid User</p>
<p>2. Everyone talks about the cloud.</p>
<p>3. There are logs and backups... that's what you read in the news any time a serial killer shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Outlook is a professional tool, as it is would be the car, or the train (as a service). If my car explodes, there is liability involved. Or if I am injured because of a train accident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the Cloud is not reliable, I would like to know it and it should be an information of public domain. I realised that this kind of "accident" happened to a lot of other Users (see this forum). How can I make a backup if everything is stored in the cloud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Apart from the backups that for sure exist, the must be logs of what happens... I can't even imagine how Microsoft can assure the privacy and security of their systems without them. As a paying user, I want to know WHY it happened! It it not possible
 that EVERYWHERE there is the same GAP of missing email...</p>
<p>There are email dating back 2014 but TRASH, RECOVERY, RESTORE all report exactly the same gap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, as an advanced user, I pretend to know how this happened. I want to know which "remote IMAP" error (ERROR?!) could make these email disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not hotmail anymore, this is a (paid) business service from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll go on until I get a proper answer.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Well, I will still try, at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know how it happened, or otherwise I will have to give up using Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, even if I am not able to go against Microsoft for this, it's for sure bad karma for them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(so, interesting hypothetical question, terrorists use Outloo.com for their activities, they can leave no traces behind because Outlook as neither no backups nor logs?! ;-) Which, as well, has the logical consequence that NSA may instead having my backups!?)<br />

<p>Dear Franco </p>
<p>I want a technical answer, and you keep giving me management bs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I want to know how the email disappered? </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Corruption in one of the Microsoft Server? </p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Mistake during the transition to Outlook.com (as many users complained about on Microsoft forum) ?? This is a serious issue, considering Microsoft politics and core business (Cloud, Office 365). As an example, I do not keep my medical records at home,
 the hospital does! What if the hospital would lose all my medical records? Well, that's exactly what happened with Outlook. I pay Microsoft to host and be responsible of my data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. You said Microsoft has no backups, and User (Microsoft employee?) on the forum said Microsoft has NO BACKUP and NO LOGGING for Outlook!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. I am pretty sure that if tomorrow I am responsible of a criminal action, and the authorities come to you, my email will be found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. If it is true that Microsoft has no logs (and you tell me YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHY the email disappeared...) than please subscribe this statement because I will make a fortune selling Microsoft Outlook accounts to terrorist as it seems that Outlook email
 can be deleted without even Microsoft knowing how and why. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Purge/Recovery / Tech support is bs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Technical Support for me is that you give me a report of the accident. Now, I can not believe that 9 months of email can disappear for a "handshaking unexpected handling" (this was your first answer to me...).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. I can believe an email (or maybe even a bunch of them) are deleted incidentally... but not that they disappear from the Deleted Items, and Folder, the Purged Email, Recovered Email and Restored email WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3c. How can that email disappear when ALL EMAIL BEFORE AND AFTER are still there?? As I said, a technical answer gives me DATA (this happend this day, for this reason, due to this IMAP request/protocol/communication, from this IP and Client etc.! This is
 what is expected from me as a Chemical Engineer in my job... </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If Outlook is not reliable, Microsoft should say so! </p>
<p>4a. If you can not provide me an explanation is like to say "North Korea did this". Then what? I can't trust Office 365 either, because it can lose all my documents, and so on... and what about OneDrive?!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, dear Franco... I will go on, writing Microsoft every day until I get a PROPER TECHNICAL answer.
</p>
<p>And I write to every technical blog, journal, consumer association etc. until I get an explaination of what happened!
</p>
<p>Final note: I don't want you to talk with the "experts" for Outlook.com because I am pretty sure you don't exaclty know what do discuss with them in my behalf.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a Technical Expert to discuss with me the problem and find a solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I pay for Office 365 and it is not acceptable that it fails this badly... there is a lot of money in "damages" involved if that email will not reappear, so you can understand my frustration!
</p>
<p>It's almost 1 year of professional activity! Thanks, M. </p>

<p>
</p><p>November 30, 2017, 17:21 +0000 &gt; Hello Marco, &gt; &gt; I understand your frustration. But the answer I provided you was something I ran through with the subject matter experts for Outlook.com. I noticed you keep referring to us as Customer Service, and that you
 wish to have this discussed with Technical Support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>While most ISPs and Technical Companies operate under this system, Outlook.com does not have a separate desk for customer complaints and a separate one for technical support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly sorry to say that the answer we have provided, unacceptable to you as it is, remains the final answer for your situation. &gt; &gt;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Purge list draws from the last storage of emails an account can recover. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is not readily viewable from the Outlook interface, unlike the Recover Deleted Items list.
</p>
<p>There is no third storage we are hiding from you, Mr. Bertoldi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You have accessed all the allotted storage for your account. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player set as default might be the possible reason why it is continuously opened. We would like to clarify some information to better isolate the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is Windows Media Player automatically launching?</li><li>Is this the first time it happened?</li><li>Did you make any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player can't be disabled, but you have an option to uninstall it. Check the steps below on how to uninstall Windows Media Player:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Turn</strong> <strong>Windows features on or off</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Media Features</strong> and uncheck <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>. A prompt message will appear, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>See pictures below for reference.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Your first three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Windows Media Player automatically launching?</li><li>Is this the first time it happened?</li><li>Did you make any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>YES;</p>
<p>YES; and</p>
<p>NO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever caused the annoyance has 'stopped' overnight.&nbsp; When I booted my laptop today WMP did not launch AND has not appeared in the last two hours.</p>
<p>Again, I thank you for your reply&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; &nbsp;I will 'keep' it and refer it to my education.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joan;</p>
<p>I had checked with Apple and HP and they were of no help, but it was a microsoft issue. My PC was missing some microsoft drivers needed to upload the iphone. I contined to look on the Microsoft download site and low and behold it was there.
 So, if I had listen to you and everyone at MS that said it was not a&nbsp;MS issue I would have never got it to work. Apple and HP were right, they had done all they could do and they iphone was working with every computer except mine and my computer checked out
 and passed every test any ways I have no problems with it, it's working with itunes and I am glad. Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be bless</p>

            Hi, usually a new battery needs a few charges/discharges to perform optimal, but it could also be other things such as apps draining battery etc, or of course a bit of both.<br />
<br />
I suggest you ask your question here at the Maemo board: 
/t5/Maemo-Devices/bd-p/maemo<br />
<br />
There are a few geeks there who I guess a more than willing to help you.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you can take a look at this standard guide by illinjah on how to maximize battery life:

<h2>            How to change sub site&#39;s url logo to the parent url in SharePoint Online</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have a main site and 5 sub sites under it. </p>
<p>in each site i have the same logo, but the problem is that when i enter a sub site, the URL in the logo point to the home page of the current sub site, i want it to point to the parent site (main site Collection) .</p>
<p>How can i accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Mina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can do this via changing the coding of SharePoint master page by using SharePoint Designer. Here is a article for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://changecase.net/blog/2014/04/04/link-your-site-logo-to-your-root-homepage-in-sharepoint-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link Your Site Logo to Your Root Homepage In SharePoint 2013</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the question is related to how to customize the master page, if you encounter any problem, we suggest you go to our

<h2>            How do I check to find out and remove GozNym trojan from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been reading about the threat that GozNym poses to personal and banking information once it invades a person's computer.&nbsp; I can't find any safe way online to check and see if I have this virus/Trojan, and if I do how I can go about removing it.&nbsp; I<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
 do not </span>click on suspicious email links, only the ones that I know and trust.&nbsp; I am also very careful when I download anything, my Norton automatically runs a scan and if the download is unsafe automatically blocks its.&nbsp; Hopefully, I don't have this
 GozNym, but I don't have anyway to be sure.</p>

            <p>Just downloaded and ran the Emsisoft Emergency Kit (EEK) and encountered no issues…it worked as it typically does and was easily removed as always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you had problems with the EEK which is recommended by some folks who forgot more than I’ll ever know regarding malware removal procedures.&nbsp; If “they” quit recommending it and/or I start having problems with the program, then I’ll stop using
 and recommending it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated in my previous post your best option would be to seek advice from Norton since Norton is the antimalware program you employed to help protect your computer.&nbsp; Good to know you are doing that and hopefully Norton will help you resolve whatever malware
 concerns you may have.</p>

<p>I reflashed my Nokia 808 using Lumia Recovery Tool 5.0.7. Now, I cannot update the 808 Ovi Store directly from the original 3.30.012 to 3.34.013 to the Opera Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that I will have to update from 3.30.012 to 3.30.018 to 3.34.013 to the Opera Store.</p>

<p>I initially tried <a href="http://lr.ovi.mobi/store/new-symbian-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://lr.ovi.mobi/store/new-symbian-3</a>&nbsp;and it didn't work for me. I then click on the update button from 3.30.012 and the update failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have the direct link to 3.34.013 at the time. Thanks for the link. The new Opera Store is, as probably&nbsp;expected, missing the Nokia apps and paid software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed the PC store.ovi.com has now been redirected to the Opera Store as well. Have I lost Ovi Store My Stuff then? Opera Mini from the Opera Store is a .Jad (Opera Mini 5.1&nbsp;not .sis (Opera Mini 7.1). I am&nbsp;attempting it&nbsp;from a PC.</p>

<p>Opera Mobile Store does work. I have purchased a few days ago two applications for my 808, paid via PayPal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The applicatins are exactly the ones from Ovi Store (moved as is). However some appears to be missing, or I was not able to find them (like Sland Media Pocket Ruler, Dragon Sight Compass+, or Lanternsoft ScreenLight).</p>

<h2>            Selected text colour in Word 2016&#47; 365 problem</h2>
                    
<p><span>In Office 2010, when selecting text (clicking and dragging over text) it used to be temporarily highlighted in a light blue colour.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Office 2016, the highlighted colour is 25% grey. The same standard 25% shade of grey we use to permanently highlight edited documents in our office.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have looked at a few guides about changing the highlight colour using a registry edit but they only seem to work on Windows 8 or previous.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone know of a way to change the highlighted text colour in Word&nbsp;2016/ 365.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>For those permanently highlighted text, we can click the Shading (Home&gt;Paragraph) button to set a custom color which is different from 25% grey in Office 2016. We can also choose another color from the Highlight button to make difference from the temporarily
 highlight color.</p>
<p>If you really want to change the default temporarily highlight color, we suggest you post a new thread in our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?category=officeitpro&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office TechNet forum</a> to check if it is supported in Word 2016. It is a specific channel that handles Office applications usage related questions and issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I guess this would normally be an easy fix for most people, but I have been asked to find a solution to this as all our previous documents for years and years have used this 25% grey shade and we would like to continue to use the same in the future. Some
 users found it confusing with having selected text and permanent highlight the same.
</p>
<p>I have posted a thread on Office TechNet. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Are TEMP folders created after update fails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmaldr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are TEMP folders created after update fails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been having many failed attempts to install certain Windows updates. I have now noticed that there is about
<strong>165G</strong> on my <strong>Windows</strong> file alone... !&nbsp; Under C:/Windows, we now have about
<strong>1,050+</strong> TEMP folders...each with about 100mb of information. Each folder was created at the same time as the updates were attempting to install (I validated this with a forced update today...after which there were two failed installations....and
 two new folders were then created).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Are the temp folders due to the install errors?</p>
<p>2) <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Can I delete all of these temp folders</span></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note....these folders are NOT in my temp folder....they are all located within the Windows folder on the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders are named similar to this one...no two folders seem to be named the same...</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\TempFE08AE49-5484-96D3-FEF0-9B7FBB2372FE-Signatures</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within <strong>each</strong> folder, there are five files....four of them are .vdm files, the other is a .dll file. Each .dll file that I have checked is linked to Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would dearly like to delete all of these folders to recapture my disk space and enable my laptop to run smoother. I'll tackle the install failure at a later date. (By the way, the install failure at the time is with 4.8.204, Microsoft Essentials)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Nice move! Flash Player v18.0.0.203 was only released a few hours ago! cf. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>1. Did you (a) uninstall the McAfee free-trialware AND THEN (b) download/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed MSE on 18 December 2010?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>2. How long have KB2902885 &amp; KB3063917 been failing to install according to your
<em><strong>Update History</strong></em>?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your current version of MSE was released in September of 2012!</li></ul>
<p>3. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;CCleaner's Registry Cleaner &amp; TuneUpUtilities have&nbsp;EVER made to the computer's registry?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync audio recording to onenote items more than one page</h2>
                    
<p>Sync long audio recording to my notes is an killer application of onenote to me. However, I found I can only sync the&nbsp; audio recording to the text in the same page. As long as I add a new page/subpage, the audio is still recording but the link between the
 text of the new page and audio lost. I spend a lot of time to search the anser on the internet, but it seems no one reported the same issue as me. Is there any trick to sync audio recording to onenote more than one page? Thanks!</p>
<p>I am using win7 64bit on Lenovo thinkpad x200 tablet.</p>

<p>@ Ben,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I am really surprised onenote 2010 can't sync notes and audio more than 1 pages. I thought sync audio with more than one page is intuitive and easy to add this function...</p>
<p>Students take notes with many pages in a class. The sync function is almost useless if it can only sync notes of one page. I really hope microsoft can fix it with a patch rather than wating for another version. :(</p>

<h2>            Emails disappear instantly after they are read Office 2016</h2>
                    I'm running windows 8 on a brand new computer and downloaded Office 365. I set up email accounts using Outlook 2016 and that all seems to work fine except the emails in all of the folders disappear before my eyes after just a couple of minutes or less!
 Anyone else have this problem??

            Set the Data Entry property to Yes. This will allow the form to only be used to enter new records. If your users need to see existing records, make a copy of the form with the Data Entry property set to No and give them two options; Add New and View/Edit.&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia 6233 Memory card Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julie1---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6233 Memory card Problem</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
Please please please say someone can help me this is driving me insane. I have recently bought a Nokia 6233 it came with a 64mb memory card which is too small for me to add my songs onto so I recently upgraded to a 512mb memory card. I thought it would be nice
 and simple just copy the file from the 64mb to the 512mb and carry on as before but no that isn’t possible!!!!!!<br />
<br />
My problem is that some of the themes, wallpapers, screensavers, games and other great features that come with the phone are saved on the memory card, I thought it would be nice and easy and all I would have to do is copy that stuff off of the memory card and
 put it onto my new one. But no Nokia decided it would be a really good idea to write protect this and not allow you to any way shape or form copy it onto anything else.<br />
<br />
I have tried many different ways to unprotect it so that I can copy it but nothing has worked, I have even tried making a back up using the pc suit then putting it back on to the new memory card, but it didn’t put everything back and also mucked up my computer.<br />
<br />
If any one knows why I cannot copy it onto the new memory card or if can suggest a way of doing it please please tell me I would be very very grateful.<br />
<br />
Sorry for this post being sooo long I’m just so p****d off with this flipping memory card and it seems it was just a waste of good money trying to upgrade on the memory.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Julie

            Hi Julie,<br />
solution is easy: Nokia protect some of the contens, but you can copy the data (themes, music, games...) to the phone and back to the mmc. So now contens is unprotect and you can copy it to the PC!

            If the dasoft's instructions won't work, try this one.<br />
You can't copy stuff from microSD because of the DRM rights management, but fortunately Linux OS doesn't care about them.<br />
So if you know somebody with Linux computer, take the SD adapter from you new microSD card, put the Nokia microSD card in it and plug it in with some SD card USB reader to Linux machine and here it comes, you can copy all the stuff without any problem.<br />
Just don't be surprised, those protected files will have totally different names while copying than in the Nokia phone Gallery.<br />

            I tested it on my N6233 (i hear old versions had a problem, but mine works perfectly): I just moved e.g. \Extra\predefcollections\sensor_SD_EMEA.jar to the phone. Then run application, turn off and move application bact to memory card - voala: protection
 is missed and You can normally copy the file sensor_SD_EMEA.jar to my PC. Of course, You can copy only the files what You had moved to the phone and back to the microSD!!! But be carefull: You have only a few megabytes in 6233 phone memory free, Of course
 You can't move the whole N6233 microSD contens!<br />
Of course also linux solution should work, but not all users have correctly memory card reader under linux installed...

            that's a great trick... I managed to finally copy (safety backup to PC) some protected files of the pre-loaded memory card of my new Nokia 5300, simply by first moving them back and forth to the Phone memory.<br />
<br />
Thanks, dasoft!

            When you start up Word, you should see a little "picture" that includes the version (number) of Office. Without that information, it's difficult to impossible to help you, as there's no way we can give you the correct menu commands (steps) for achieving
 what you want to do.

<div>Very true. There was a period when I regularly sat on job interview boards and sifted job applications. I think if some people did that first, they would have a far better idea of what to put in a resume. Other than their personal details, the emphasis
 should be on their current (or last) employment and their highest education qualification details. That all needs to be on the&nbsp;<strong>front</strong> page because that will have the most immediate impact. The remainder of employment and education history should
 fit on the reverse of the page.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Finish off by stating&nbsp; <strong>in bold</strong> that a fuller resume is available on request. That will indicate to the invigilator that you have considered their needs. When sifting through hundreds of applications for even the most modest of jobs, there
 just isn�??t time to read more that the front page and if that fails to arrest interest, the back page certainly will not. A multi-page resume is just a waste of resources!</div>

    <title>Assigning C3 email button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjbb787  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigning C3 email button</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. I recently bought a C3 unlocked--I'm loving the build quality, and the phone mostly meets my expectations. However, there's one problem I haven't been able to wrap my head around: how do I assign non-stock-OS apps to the email shortcut button (the
 physical button above end call)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the Gmal app better than Nokia's stock email client, and I really want to assign Gmal to the email shortcut button. I was able to do this on my E63, but it seems like it's not possible with the C3? Any help is greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks guys/gals.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Folders Created and are not visible to the team</h2>
                    <p>We use Microsoft office 365 as a team for work. I created folders within SharePoint to save specific documents and then uploaded those document to sharepoint. My colleague tried to view the documents and she was not able to see them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and it looked like we all have access to see these but other users cannot see the folders created. Do you have any suggestions what the issue might be?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, Sheen for your reply. We figured out what it was. It's the check-in and check-out feature that we have in place. If one of us creates a new document and uploads it but does not check it in, the others cannot see it. I would have figured that it
 would at least show up in the folder, shown as checked out to someone else or you would get a "locked for editing" note when trying to open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, it will not be visible at all to other users until you check it in after uploading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the workbook is shared then that would grey out those options. Un-Share, make the changes you want then re-share.</p>
