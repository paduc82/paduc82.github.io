    <title>Raw Sockets stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Raw Sockets stopped working</h2>
                    <p>The app I am using has been working fine for years. Suddenly has developed the problem.</p>
<p>It outputs info to port 5500, to be viewed with a browser. Socket creation fails.</p>
<p>It also uses a socket to download updated info from the Internet. This fails as well.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox.</p>
<p>I have done a Repair Install of Windows.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled my modem driver.</p>
<p>I have tried the netsh commands.</p>
<p>I have used the troubleshooter to check for faults with IE. Finds no faults.</p>
<p>I suspect it is only raw sockets which no longer work because SABnzbd successfully sends its info to localhost:8080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Although the app was working withy them enabled, just in case I disabled, Security Essentials, Comodo Firewall. (Windows Firewall and Defender are permanently disabled.)</p>

Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community Forums. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
1. Is the app working fine now?<br />
2. Do you have any third party firewalls installed on your computer?<br />
3. Are you able to access all the websites now?<br />
4. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
5. Are you connected to domain?</span>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Working yet? No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) 3rd Party firewall? Comodo, but I did try with it disabled. And it worked before with Comodo installed. In fact, I have taken the app out of the list of allowed applications, and Comodo doesn't say anything. I presume this means that the app doesn't get
 as far as that, it has failed. In fact, to send data to a tracking app, the app tries to use a socket sending UDP packets to localhost:5500. The error message returned (in a console) is "connect() failed in make_client_socket()". That sounds like&nbsp; the raw
 socket cannot be created, rather than it can't be used. Which correlates with Comodo knowing nothing about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Access websites? The app cannot access anything network related, even localhost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Any changes? There have been Windows updates. I am not sure of the exact date of the start of failure (about 6 weeks ago). Some of my apps have updated themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Domain? No. Single PC at home. But set to location Public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell from the app's forum and bug-tracker, I am the only person with the problem. It has been working for some time. It still works with others. But, to be sure, I have just asked a contact for more info.</p>

The issue could be due to third party program causing the issue.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to perform clean boot. Clean boot. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clean boot will
</span><span>eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict

            <p>Unfortunately, clean boot made no difference.</p>
<p>The strange things is that ALL other sockets on my machine work, and also that I seem to be the only user of the app that has the problem.</p>
<p>And it is not a local copy problem. The app is regularly recompiled, and I down load the new version, and I have been having the problem for about 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Downloaded yesterday's compile this morning - no difference.</p>

            <p>Tried that. The app doesn't really install. The installer just unpacks the files and places themk in the correct folder. Deleted all the files and then "installed."</p>
<p>I think we can say that I have been through all the steps listed.</p>
<p>PC is up to date.</p>
<p>Bypassed the Firewall (and AV).</p>
<p>No system admin to contact.</p>
<p>App is up to date. Has been giving the problem for the last 10 to 15 builds.</p>
<p>No license - GPL.</p>
<p>Uninstalled and re-installed.</p>
<p>In contact with a developer - trying a two-pronged approach.</p>

<br />
The issue could be due to the user account corrupt. I would suggest you to create new user account and check if the issue persists.

    <title>My version of Windows 10 does not have DirectX - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kgaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            My version of Windows 10 does not have DirectX</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Windows 10 in early September 2015 and it does not appear that DirectX came with it (I ran Diagx and got nothing). Since I upgraded, I have been unable to use the organizer portion of my Adobe Elements 11 software - I get an error telling me
 to download DirectPlay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the Install Shield on the message, I get the following error: &nbsp;0x80071A90. Clicking on the 'how to solve this problem link', I get solutions for error codes&nbsp;0x800F0906,&nbsp;0x800F081F, and 0x800F0907. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to Update for the IDirectPlay4 API of Microsoft for DirectX 9.0x (DirectPlay) (KB839643)</p>
<p>it won't load because I need DirectX 9.0.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>So I go to the DirectX site to download DirectX, and guess what....it redirects me to the Windows 10 download site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received all recent Windows updates automatically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try updating the <strong>Display drivers </strong>from the manufacturer's website and check if the issue persists.
<br />
1. Press Windows key + X key and click Device Manager. <br />
2. Expand Display Adapter and Select Graphic. <br />
3. Right-click on the Graphic and click on Update driver software. <br />
4. Restart the computer and check. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>I suggest you to <strong>Open Windows Updates </strong>
and Install important updates and optional updates.<br />
1.&nbsp;Type setting in search<br />
2.&nbsp;Select update and security<br />
3.&nbsp;Select windows update and follow onscreen instruction<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>See if this helps <br />

<p>
</p><p>My display driver has the most recent update, according to the message I received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ATI Radeon HD 4200) 1/13/15 8.970.100.9001.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything has been updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did this program (Adobe Elements) work with Windows 7? &nbsp;Did I ever have to have DirectX to run it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that among the system requirements for the free upgrade to Windows 10, I would had to have had the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)"><strong>Graphics</strong></span>: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver.</li></ul>
<p>Should I remove and then reinstall Windows 10?</p>

            <p>You should mention what model computer you have as well the version of windows 10--32 or 64 bits. If it's a desktop replace the legacy card with a slightly better one. You cannot run newer fast expensive cards so it will be less than $50. If it has been
 less than 30 days since you installed win 10, you can use the rollback option to return to windows 7. That option only available for 30 days. Win 10 can run on almost any recent model computer but it does not run well on some older models. Win 7 might be a
 better choice until you can get a new computer.&nbsp;Reinstalling windows 10 will not help with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your version of Adobe Elements at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility center HERE</a>&nbsp;Maybe you need to update to a newer version which is expensive and all the more reason to return to 7.</p>

</p><p>When I went to Update for the IDirectPlay4 API of Microsoft for DirectX 9.0x (DirectPlay) (KB839643)</p>
<p>it won't load because I need DirectX 9.0.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>So I go to the DirectX site to download DirectX, and guess what....it redirects me to the Windows 10 download site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received all recent Windows updates automatically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I know this might be a LONG overdue issue for you and I don't if it still is but I wanted to be know to the community is that you can download the DirectX Runtime from an alternate site like CNET -(Link to DirectX Runtime) http://goo.gl/jDEqNe</p>

            <p>I did 'solve' my problem by switching back to Windows 7 with a lot of time and trouble. However, I appreciate the input and will keep it in mind when I am invariably forced to use Windows 10 again.

            <p>There's a few to choose from and it all depends on how much you want to invest. There's the Logitech G920, the Fanatec CSL Elite Advanced pack for XOne (costly but pretty sweet and use myself) or the Thrustmaster TX. They'll work with all the games you stated, however, you may need to look at adding a handbrake and that will increase the cost.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are cheaper wheels but they'd be my recommendations.<br /></p><p><br /></p>

</p><p>According to the link you sent, DISM is for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012. As noted in my original post, I am using Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 1. Your link instructed me to install the System Update
 Readiness tool, which I had already done, again, as stated in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no restore points on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run several anti-virus and anti-malware programs. None detected problems.</p>

</p><p>Sometimes SFCfix will actually fix some problems so it is a good things to start with when there are reported problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Microsoft Support Engineer "experts" here like to suggest running sfc /scannow they don't seem to know what to do when there are corruptions that SFC can't fix.&nbsp; I have never seen them actually fix any SFC reported corruptions.&nbsp; I'm sure if there
 is an example where that actually happened somebody will tell me about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do like to suggest SURT (System Update Readiness Tool), consistently suggest DISM commands that won't work (as you have learned), System Restore and other things that will just waste your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running AV scans will not fix corruptions reported by SFC or make missing or corrupted files magically appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you have any Restore Points?&nbsp; It will not help you with this problem but you might want to figure out why your system is not creating Restore Points like it should.</p>

<p>Good job.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering about this earlier today...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things might be easier for them if they would include instructions on how to delete all the old CBS log files,
<em>then </em>run SFC and get a fresh/new log of just the last SFC run.&nbsp; Files would be smaller since it would only contain results of one SFC run, less clutter from old runs, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem at MS Answers is the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" tell everybody to run SFC but when there are corruptions that didn't get fixed these alleged "experts" don't seem to know what to do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They only know about 6 troubleshooting methods (7 if you count reinstall):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>SFC /scannow&nbsp; (don't know how to fix corruptions)</p>
<p>SURT&nbsp; (don't know how to fix corruptions)</p>

<h2>            Getting error code 10 for Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I tried this suggestion many times it has not helped. It fixes the error in the current session. However as soon as I re-start the error returns.&nbsp; I also went to Logitech and down loaded the latest driver for my M325 wireless mouse. This also has not resolved
 the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see any problems this error is causing. My mouse works properly with-out any problems. I only see the error when I go into Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any other BlueTooth devices connected to this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Pavilion P7-1500Z purchased in 2013 with Windows 8 installed. Up-graded to 8.1 when it was available. Have installed all up-dates from Microsoft and HP.</p>

            <p>Hi Browne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How exactly have you installed the driver? Is it in compatibility mode? </p>
<p>2. Does it provide you any error while installing the driver? </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Code 10 error is mainly related to hardware and device driver issues or to compatibility issues between hardware drivers and additional software that is installed in Windows. Therefore, we recommend that you troubleshoot these issues by focusing
 on device drivers, on device configuration issues, and on hardware compatibility issues.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator comes into play when&nbsp;you plug the Bluetooth device without the driver wherein&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8 automatically installs its driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>A Code 10 error is generated in Device Manager in one of the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Manager can't start the device.</li><li>One of the drivers that the device needs does not start.</li><li>Device Manager has insufficient information to recognize the error that is bubbled up by the device driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> In this situation, the Code 10 error can be a very generic message that indicates some kind of unspecified driver or device problem.</li></ul>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in the article and check the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fix: "This device cannot start" Code 10 error in Device Manager in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/en-us</a></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After Windows detect Bluetooth device, it is controlled by Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator and not the third-party driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here's a way to install the bluetooth driver released by the manufacturer to fix problem. You may follow the steps mentioned by '</span>Shinmila H<span>' in the article provided.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/need-microsoft-bluetooth-enumerator-driver/164d70dd-7945-4cf6-8d5c-24c77f17742a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/need-microsoft-bluetooth-enumerator-driver/164d70dd-7945-4cf6-8d5c-24c77f17742a</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The steps mentioned are also applicable to Windows 8.1<br />
</p>
<p>To install the driver: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/wireless-mouse-m325?crid=398&amp;section=downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/wireless-mouse-m325?crid=398&amp;section=downloads</a></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>It looks like Windows 8.1 operating system is not listed in the supportive operating system in Logitech website. This can also&nbsp;be one of the major cause as the device might not be fully compatible with the operating system and it gives you an error in the
 device manager. However, since you have mentioned it is working properly, there is a chance it might have installed the device in Windows 8 compatibility mode.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/wireless-mouse-m325?crid=398&amp;section=downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/wireless-mouse-m325?crid=398&amp;section=downloads</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, you may try to connect a different Bluetooth device and check the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to contact the Logitech support team to see if there is a latest driver or patch available for the device to work smoothly with the operating system.

<p>I have had the same issues, ready many people &amp; forums where this same problems is being reported whilst trying to find a solution for myself.&nbsp; After trying every suggestion listed on every forum i still couldn't install and of the Live suite.</p>
<p>I have found a simple solution which may work for others too.&nbsp; I have run an older LiveMessenger Install (v8.1) which ran clean.&nbsp; Launch LiveMessenger and it forces an update which updated to&nbsp;a later&nbsp;version and gives options to install the other Live Essential
 Suite components too.</p>
<p>I have to as yet been prompted to patch to the 2011 version but i am sure it is only a matter of time and most importantly i have Messenger back!</p>

<p>This problem could be solved using the WLE <strong>full-offline installer</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.live.com/1rewlive4-all/en/wlsetup-all.exe</a> (Version 2011)</p>

<p>(if you want a different language, change tle "locale ID" in the URL)</p>
<p>It should work, because the full installer does not need to download the catalog file to install the programs (it's already included). If you have troubles, disconnect from internet and run the full installer as administrator (right click &gt; "<em>Run as administrator</em>").</p>

    <title>Epson Perfection V850 scanner - update driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonnie giddens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Perfection V850 scanner  - update driver</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Epson Perfection V850 scanner. A fairly high-end scanner for 35 mm film. It scans in 3 modes and the more advanced modes (Home &amp; Pro) are producing inferior results to the Auto mode. Epson tech support does not seem to want to consider
 that this is a driver (or another compatibility) problem, but I have personally had problems with a previous film scanner 5+ years ago. The date &amp; driver properties under Device Manager are the original Epson driver dates (2014). The latest updates are from
 2017. Shouldn't the driver date reflect the latest update date? If not, how can I tell if I have the most current driver? I'm afraid this is a situation where the universal Windows 10 drivers are overriding the manufacturer's driver. But after numerous uninstalls,
 clearing of registries, deleting twain files, the problem continues to happen. How can I force my computer to use the manufacturer's driver? Thank you in advance for your response!</p>

<p>I have reinstalled the Epson drivers from their website many times, in many different orders, rebooting, with the machine unplugged, plugged in, running ccleaner &amp; glary in between and the driver on device manager is still dated 2014. We even renamed the
 Twain_32 folder to twain_32old and reinstalled Epson to avoid conflicts with my existing Canon printer/scanner.&nbsp;It broke the Canon functionality but did not help the Epson functionality. It would appear there is a conflict that is not allowing the Epson driver
 to take precendence over the Windows generic drivers. See snips below of my Epson driver properties (2014 driver) and the latest epson&nbsp;driver online dated 2017.</p>

<p>I had to click on the "this thread" link to see what version of "Windows" you were running (this conversation was split from a Windows 7 base forum...

<p>This is a loaded question. &nbsp;It all depends on many factors. &nbsp;You have Windows 7, so you still have a DVD Codec that can play most DVDs out there included in the OS. &nbsp;If AUTOPLAY is on and no third party applications have taken over the built-in DVD playing
 (movies, etc.) association, it should just start playing. &nbsp;You might look at this conversation:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the thread this was split from, it likely should have just stayed together (ATTN:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5f052839-a9de-4c88-992f-34af987d565e" title="Don Varnau MCC: Content Creator">Don

    <title>Windows 10 Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianlarter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 on July 29th.&nbsp; I am very happy so far and really liked the calendar app for my daily appointments.&nbsp; All has been working fine so far, then after a cumulative Windows update on Friday 21st August, the calendar app doesn't allow
 any input or display.&nbsp; All my previous entries have disappeared, when I click the start button and the 'life at a glance'window comes up, I can see one of the next days appointments, but when I open the calendar it is blank.&nbsp; I cannot add any new appointments
 and it's as if the page is frozen because when you click on a day to "add a new event" nothing happens.&nbsp; I just have a blank week or month in front of me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>By the same token, I cannot get he Mail app to work as it will not sync with either my Gmail or local Telkom email.&nbsp; I've checked in the settings for both the calendar and mail and everything seems to be as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this sudden failure of the Calendar app have anything to do with the latest Windows update?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions to try and solve this problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, both the methods you gave me don't work.&nbsp; I am not a computer whizz but I can get around my computer quite well.&nbsp; Firstly, the search to find Powershell brought up nothing.&nbsp;
 I eventually found a Powershell (and many others) folder, clicked on the one I thought would work, type in the command you gave me (as administrator) and nothing happened!&nbsp; I understand that I first need to delete the Mail and Calendar app.&nbsp; On the Windows
 store it states that I already have the app and I can find no other way to uninstall it first.</p>
<p>The method 2 - I went to settings but there is no "Change PC settings", just accounts, and add or delete an account.&nbsp; Either way I cannot "switch to a local account", the system still won't recognize my local account or the GMail one, so I am at a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just strange that the Calendar was working perfectly up until the last Windows update last Friday.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions anyway.&nbsp; I have in the meantime downloaded another app called One Calendar and it works perfectly, but I would like to get the Windows one back again.&nbsp;Maybe this is just one of many small bugs in the beginning.</p>

<h2>            Friends are automaticly being deleted from list</h2>
                    
<p>Since I got the dashboard update since the second sign up availablility came up, I have had problems where I get new friends on my xbox 360 and they first show on my friends list and I type to them at times before I talk to them, a while later I notice that
 my xbox deletes them from my friends list and I send them another request and after that it wont even show them on "pending status", I havn't had anyone get into my account at all and my friends have no reason to delete me, I'm getting sick of this problem,
 if this keeps happening I dont think im trying out anymore beta's for microsoft,</p>
<p>Anyways I had a friend added yesterday and we had a good time typing back and fourth to eachother about playing borderlands 2 and joining eachother on the game on release, but now he doesn't even show on my friends list or neither does he show up on pending
 status when I send him another friends request on my xboxlive popup when I press the middle button on my controller,</p>
<p>this has been happening at times and its getting quite annoying, could anyone help me out with this problem plz?</p>

<div>
<p>Original title: <span>Getting MTP USB Devices</span></p>
<p>I have had similar problems with USB devices working in Windows 7 where devices worked at first, but then not working.&nbsp; Until now at least my Epson Stylus Photo R280 printer has usually worked.&nbsp; (When it didn't, rebooting the computer and turning printer
 OFF and back ON has worked.&nbsp; Now I can't get printer to work.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling the USB items in the past with limited success.&nbsp; They may be there the first time, but then not be recognized the next time.&nbsp; BUT, the solution instructions say to disconnect all USB devices (before deleting all items listed under
 USB in Device Manager)--but they don't say whether to reconnect them before rebooting computer.&nbsp; Does this matter?</p>

<p><span>Hi LG7test1,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using a USB hub?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Try connecting USB devices directly to USB port and then test the issue</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you’re using a USB hub, then try disconnecting your devices from the hub and then try connecting it directly to the USB port to see if the devices
 get detected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/</a></span></p>

<p><strong><span>BUT, the solution instructions say to disconnect all USB devices (before deleting all items listed under USB in Device Manager)--but
 they don't say whether to reconnect them before rebooting computer.&nbsp; Does this matter?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>USB devices are plug-n-play. So it doesn’t matter whether you connect before the reset or after the reset of your computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Downloaded app, and a random search bar came to the top of my screen.</h2>
                    So I downloaded this app called CamStudio. Once I read the "Code of Conduct" and that stuff. I click Accept. Randomly a search bar for internet explorer came to the top of my screen and won't leave. I would really like some help with this because I don't
 know what it is called.

<p>Hi Lydian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pop-up that you're getting is possibly due to a flash player content. Now, to determine if this is the case, it would be better if you could send us a screenshot of the search bar that is popping up on your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>The search bar that is showing on the upper part of the screen is a 3rd party search bar tool. This tool bar may have been included during the installation or when you installed the CamStudio on your computer. To take that off from your screen, we suggest
 that you uninstall the search bar tool. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on Start and click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Programs and features</strong> and click <strong>Uninstall a Program</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Uninstall or change a program</strong>, scroll through the list to check if there is any third party tool\search bar installed on the computer.</li><li>If yes, right-click on the tool\search bar and <strong>uninstall</strong> it.</li></ol>

<p>I bought GTA IV, A couple years back, and I redownloaded it last night, but as I don't have Xbox Live Gold on this account, I went on to my other account to play it, and it says I can't play it as I need to be signed in to the profile that bought the game.</p>
<p>Any way to get around this so I can play it on my other profile? Same console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi! Sorry about your issue. I had the same problem wtih dead space on my other profile. You cannot play on the profile if the profile didnt buy the game/ game content. You can only play on that specific profile to play the game you downloaded. Im sorry for
 the issue. Have fun in GTA :) You can click here for more info to try a license transfer.

<p>Not sure why Fluttershy said you couldn't play the game... If you originally downloaded the game to a different console, you will just need to perform a license transfer. Once done, you will need to re-download the game in order to refresh the license, and
 then you should be able to play on any gamertag on the console. (www.xbox.com/drm or from your guide button)</p>

            in the 6 month updates (Spring and Fall) MS is making significant changes to underlying code to make "new features" available.  Due to inadequate testing this leads to lots of problems with drivers, although this is the first time I've seen Realtek mentioned.
<br />
<br />Go to the Realtek support site and see if they have heard of the problem. They are more likely to have heard of this problem than, and if they have, have a fix or workaround for it.
<br />
<br />Here are some tips on how to replace drivers, just substitute Realtek for mentions of Video
<br />
<br />POSSIBLE FIX – UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER

<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-device-manager-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-devic...</a> 
<br />•	uninstall your display driver:
<br />•	In start menu search for Control Panel’ (icon view)
<br />•	Right click on Device Manager
<br />•	Select Run as Admin 
<br />•	double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall (ie Display Adapters).
<br />•	You have buttons for 3 options:
<br />•	if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the “Roll Back Driver button”
<br />•	or you can try the Uninstall button
<br />•	or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update “manually” is better)
<br />  - restart Windows 
<br />
<br />UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER

<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-device-manager-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-devic...</a> 
<br />•	This is a recent, VERY common problem being asked on the site. The current unverified best guess is to try resetting the Video driver: either roll it back, or uninstall it and let win re-install, or windows upgrade it or manually download upgrade from video system builder site
<br />- In start menu search for Control Panel’ (icon view) 
<br />- Right click on Device Manager 
<br />- Select Run as Admin 
<br />- Expand Display Adapters
<br />- double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall to display the Driver Properties dialog
<br />- You have buttons for 3 options: 
<br />- if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the “Roll Back Driver button” 
<br />- or you can try the Uninstall button 
<br />- or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update “manually” is better) 
<br />- restart Windows

<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions.

Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

            Hello Josh,
<div><br />
<div>
<p>The Surface Pro 2 has increased storage options and a new Intel chip designed to increase battery life. It has dual low-power memory options typically used in phones to extend battery life, allowing you to run more memory-intensive programs
 without compromising performance or power. It also has a dual-angle kickstand, so you can comfortably use your Surface Pro 2 on your lap.
</p>
<p>From the software side, the Surface Pro 2 comes with Windows 8.1 preinstalled including new and improved apps.</p>
