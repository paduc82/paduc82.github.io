</p><p>I'm not too sure why some of the questions that were asked would even be considered relevant to the Windows Insider program personally, but you're not being forced to take the survey or even give real information so I digress.</p>

    <title>Hate Windows 8.x&#63; Hate Windows 10&#63; Office 2013&#63; Here&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hate Windows 8.x&#63; Hate Windows 10&#63;  Office 2013&#63; Here&#39;s what we can all do about it</h2>
                    <p>Browsing the web, we've all seen endless complaints about how Microsoft has designed their newest products.&nbsp; These complaints come from all ends of the spectrum, whether it's the end-user complaining about&nbsp;eye pain with&nbsp;Office 2013, the developer who says
 that the errors in Win 8 don't give any useful information, the System Administrator who is sick and tired of working out the difference between a local AD account, an Organizational account, and&nbsp;Microsoft Account, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I watched the Windows 10 TP Jumpstart videos so that I would be prepared for the upcoming changes.&nbsp; What I saw was horribly frustrating.&nbsp; Instead of backpedaling from what they have already destroyed, MS is actually going full-steam ahead into the cloud
 - recurring revenue model.&nbsp; So instead of pulling back from the things that bothered people the most, we are on a crash course for the worst in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do we have to put up with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft knows that there is very good reason that they have about 90% of the market share on the desktop market.&nbsp; Linux is simply not enterprise ready on the desktop, and most Line of Business applications are written in .NET, C#, and ActiveX, so migration
 to any other OS is basically impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we can do something.&nbsp; We can talk with our wallets!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Linux distros are released under GNU or GPL, which makes them be free, virtually every Linux project has a donate page.&nbsp; Now, I'm not saying to freely donate to a Linux distro.&nbsp; But you do see that Linux developers are responsive to financial incentives.&nbsp;
 The money we&nbsp;will save on Microsoft licensing can be used to fund Linux developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think needs to be done: we can establish a site in which bounty's are offered to developers for producing a certain product. So, for example, there isn't a good alternative to Regedit and&nbsp;Group Policy in Linux.&nbsp; If we'd get together and offer a bounty
 for developing it (and I'm sure there would be MANY contributers to such a project), that problem would be solved for a fraction of what we usually spend on properly licensing MS products.&nbsp; The same can go for applications.&nbsp; So, say you use QuickBooks at work,
 you can offer a bounty, (which even Intuit can claim) to anyone who recodes QuickBooks for Linux.&nbsp; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This idea is not all mine: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Software_bounty</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a web developer, so I can't design this myself.&nbsp; But perhaps we can all get together and break out of Microsoft's grip.</p>

            <p>For me the word is disappointed instead of hate. &nbsp;It's true that competition makes companies listen much more closely to what customers want instead of using monopoly to leverage things, and crowdfunding is the new thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Azure, AWS, Google Cloud keep each-other offering better services at lower cost. &nbsp;Android and iOS rely on each-other to push innovation. &nbsp;If Windows 7 were back on RTM you can bet that its sales will outstrip Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 combined, but Microsoft
 has the power to designate Windows 7 EOL and since it's already gone to Extended support, and EOL is in less than 5 years, businesses aren't too keen on using it for new developments. &nbsp;On the other hand,
<strong>if Windows 10 is no better than Windows 8.1 (or worse maybe) then I do think that you will have the market producing alternatives and Microsoft stock taking a dive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But the bottom line is that for all of us, <strong>a failing Microsoft hurts us all. &nbsp;I want Microsoft to succeed in producing desktop operating systems that we need and love</strong> - but I think they're taking the wrong direction by taking the desktop
 market for granted and using the pain it would be to transition away from Microsoft on the desktop as leverage to push changes that are not to benefit the desktop user, but to benefit Microsoft's OTHER products and services, e.g. Bing advertising, Microsoft's
 Store, Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Instead of harming the desktop to push their other products, their other products should improve so that they are competitive on their own.
</strong>&nbsp;Bing isn't as good as Google's search. &nbsp;Make Bing better and people will come. &nbsp;Keep Bing second-rate and pushing it will not make it better. &nbsp;Bing's problem isn't marketing, it's quality. &nbsp;Same thing for all of Microsoft's other offerings - they're
 not lacking because of marketing, but only lacking where there is a competitor with higher quality. &nbsp;By lowering the quality of the desktop they are creating a market opening for alternatives.</p>

            <p>I think Microsoft are very worried about the changing face of the personal computing demographic. They perceive a threat from tablets and see that they are in danger of losing massive market share to the likes of Apple and Google. They are right to be worried
 IMO but the desperation in the release of Windows 8 was evident. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought Windows 8 was awful. I've always been an early adopter but that was the first time I actually stayed with a previous OS. Clearly they were trying to bridge the gap between the desktop PC and the tablet experience but they failed on both counts.
 M$ was built on the desktop PC and they rode the wave of 'casuals' buying PCs to browse the net and send emails. A tablet is a much better fit for those people and for them it is a better experience to just use an iPad or an Android tablet. The hardcore PC
 users who want to game and do proper work had a pointless tablet UI foisted upon them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Windows 10 to work because Windows 7 is getting outdated now. I was positive with the early builds which were headed in the right direction. This latest build reminds me of how the early 8 betas were OK and progressively got worse. They need to make
 the UI a much more aesthetic and useable experience with 10. They need to make the OS leaner and cut out as much superfluous **** as possible, stuff like Cortana and Modern Apps. They need to make privacy an important aspect of the experience, this is a reason
 why people are turned off when people start talking about the cloud. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Making Windows 10 good is going to be an extremely difficult task and honestly I'm not sure M$ are up to it - maybe the best we can hope for is 'not terrible'! ;D</p>

            <p>The right thing would be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put Windows 7 back on mainstream support, and commit to it for 10 more years before EOL.</li><li>Make a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">genuine Microsoft</span> ClassicShell-like start menu for Windows 8.1.</li><li>Delay Windows 10 until it's good. &nbsp;June is widely being discussed as the RTM but that's not enough time.</li></ol>
<p>To salvage Metro, if it's not too late:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make deals with important app developers for promotion in the Windows store, so that banking and other software that are available on iOS and Android are also in Metro. &nbsp;Provide programmers to these third parties if necessary. &nbsp;Make this happen, otherwise
 Windows mobile users feel shortchanged everytime there's a great new iOS AND Android app and Windows mobile isn't even mentioned.</li><li>Eliminate the fake apps even if they pad the "numbers" for marketing. &nbsp;Any genuine apps are lost in a sea of fake ones. &nbsp;No developer wants this.</li><li>Have a free app of the day promotion for paid apps, like Amazon does.</li><li>Provide a free secure password manager as a part of Metro (like Passwordbox or whatever).</li><li>Provide a pushbullet-like functionality in Metro, and enable it on Windows XP/Vista/7 as well.</li></ol>

            As an ex-programmer I'm so glad to be retired. Nothing like the emergency call at 3am to have to go in and find/fix rogue code. As for Linux, well, it runs nothing I use ie adobe, sony vegas and others, and none of Linux offerings can come close at least
 for me. I find win 10 quite easy to work with, much easier than Ubuntu, redhat, and such. Feel free to jump in and #bash away. &lt;snrk&gt;

            Hi RichardS_77,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Have you tried booting your Mac in safe mode and the same thing happens?
<br />
<br />If not, please give it a try:

<br />
<br />You can also try this version of the Autoupdate to see if there's an update pending.

<br />
<br />Finally, if none of those methods work, try reinstalling Office.

    <title>Windows 7 Phone Not Connecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andywisniowiecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Phone Not Connecting</h2>
                    Phone: Samsung Focus SGH-i917
<div>OS Version: 7.10.7720.68</div>
<div>Computer OS: Windows 7</div>
<div>Zune Version: 4.8.2345.0</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem: Earlier I was syncing my phone to my computer. Once finished I unplugged my computer as usual. Shortly there after I remembered a file I meant to put on my phone. Upon plugging in my phone again nothing happened.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Neither Zune nor my computer detect my phone. I've run through plenty of troubleshooting steps. Rebooting computer, phone. Soft restart of phone. Reinstalling Zune. Running the windows fix-it app; which by the way gives me this as a result:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The Windows Phone 7 or Zune device may not have been detected because of changes to hardware.</td>
<td>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffixitcenter.support.microsoft.com%2fPortal%2fassets%2fImages%2fUI%2fdiagnostic.error.v2.png" />&nbsp;Not fixed<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
</div>
<div>So that's helpful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The USB drives are working, I've tried them with other devices and all are detected. I've done everything I can think of short of a hard restart.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm hoping someone has some advice to prevent me from having to do that.</div>

            <p>Hello Andy!</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here are all the troubleshooting steps I can think of:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Update your PC</p>
<p>I - Here: <em><strong>windowsupdate</strong>.microsoft.com </em></p>
<p>Then try the steps in these 2 articles:</p>
<p><span>II- <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953933</span></a></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>III</span>- </span><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2410180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2410180</a></span></span></p>
<p>IV- Create a new user profile and try syncing to that - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p>V- Perform a clean boot - <span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Finally try a different computer with your phone or a different phone on your computer to see with which one the fault lies</span></p>
<p><span>Pardon me in advance if some instruction overlap with the KB articles.</span></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any further questions<br />
<br />
Have a nice day!</p>
<p>Andy<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile - Auto Update Timezone not working</h2>
                    <p>Been traveling lately, and my Lumia 640 that just updated to W10Mobile is no longer getting the time zone right.&nbsp; Have confirmed that the "auto set" time and timezone features are set, but no luck.&nbsp; Powering the phone on and off also not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not the end of the world to have to adjust the timezone manually, but this always worked seamlessly on past lumina phones (and I believe on this phone when it was running WM8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bug and I should hope for another update soon from ATT?</p>

<p>Hi, JHutton_Pro4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that auto update timezone is not working . Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
 Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this helps. Thanks! </p>

            You cannot use 'wdFormatDocument' or 'wdFormatDocument97' when using Late Binding from Excel. These are Word commands. You must use the numeric values instead and SaveAs2 to specify save switches. You can get these from Word's VBA help.
<br />
<br />
The command lines would be<br />
<br />
Dim strFilename as String<br />
<br />
strFilename = "c:\Path\" &amp; Who1 &amp; Who2 &amp; ".docx" <br />
wdDoc.SaveAs strfilename 'Default Word format i.e. docx<br />
<br />
or for DOC format from Word 2010<br />
<br />
strFilename = "c:\Path\" &amp; Who1 &amp; Who2 &amp; ".doc"<br />
wdDoc.SaveAs2 strfilename, 0<br />
<br />
or to specify the format - here DOCX<br />
<br />
strFilename = "c:\Path\" &amp; Who1 &amp; Who2 &amp; ".docx"<br />
wdDoc.SaveAs2 strfilename, 12<br />
<br />
You may not be able to save to the root of the C: drive with some operating systems, so choose a sub folder with read/write access as the Path. It will crash if there are illegal filename characters in Who1 or Who2. If this is likely you will need to add trapping
 for those characters.<br />

<h2>            Delete a checkbox from a spreadsheet - have tried all suggestions....</h2>
                    I've tried to delete a checkbox from my Excel spreadsheet - I've accessed it in design mode, and it won't delete; I've tried a macro to delete it from the page, no luck.... I've even tried to change its properties so that (at least) it isn't visible, but
 it keeps coming back and the properties revert to what they were before... as follows:<br />
<br />
(Name) HTMLCheckbox1<br />
AutoLoad False<br />
Checked False<br />
Enabled True (I've tried to disable)<br />
Height 21 (I've tried to make this 1)<br />
HTMLName receivedinvoices<br />
Left 144<br />
Locked True (I've tried to unlock)<br />
Placement 2<br />
PrintObject True<br />
Shadow False<br />
Top 15<br />
Value 27904 (I've tried to delete this value)<br />
Visible True (I've tried to make it invisible)<br />
Width 20.25<br />
<br />
When I move it, it doesn't move, it duplicates and a copy is moved - the original stays exactly where it is.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how I can get rid of it?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Bree<br />

<p>This is new behaviour. I have had Office 2013 installed since August. Since having to reinstall Win 7 and Office again, earlier this month, all was going well. This behaviour has started in the past week or so. The only things I have downloaded that might
 affect MS software are the Windows updates.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to verify if this is an issue with the account or email server, we need to perform some workaround to properly isolate the issue. Please perform the troubleshooting steps below and check if this will help resolve the issue:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Optimize your browser, clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that this is not a browser issue. You may also try to access your email using a different web browser.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
2. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, add-ins etc. feature.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Can you please check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-didn-t-receive-an-email-someone-sent-to-my-Outlook-com-account-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and confirm to us if
 this is the solution that you've found online. If yes, let us know if you have tried everything that is provided here.</p>
<p><br />
We will be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>

<p>1.&nbsp; It's not a browser issue.&nbsp; I have a 2nd hotmail acct, &amp; I'm not having an issue w/ it.&nbsp; There are hundreds of emails in the Junk Mail folder.&nbsp; But, as you suggested, I cleared the cache.&nbsp; Has not resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Again, it's not an ad-blocking problem or anything, b/c I am not having the same problem w/ my other hotmail acct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I've went thru each of the items in the link &amp; most of the settings &amp; options that I went thru in the link were the default settings (which makes sense b/c I don't remember making any adjustments to my email acct settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I have 2 problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1)&nbsp; For whatever reason, I'm not getting (at least) 1 person's email (that I know of).&nbsp; I've been getting other senders' email w/o any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2)&nbsp; My Junk Mail box is empty, as if anything going to the Junk Mail folder is being automatically deleted or something...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know of any other suggestions.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. Previously, you mentioned that you are not getting emails from certain people. But after you tried the steps suggested, we would like to confirm if this issue is now happening on just one person
 as you mentioned that you are getting other email's fine. You may also sign out from your Outlook account, restart your PC and sign back in to your account. If you've tried all the solutions provided and still aren't receiving messages from a sender, please
 let them know that their email isn't being delivered to Outlook.com. They can contact their email support to check if they have received a bounce message notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us with the results.</p>
<p>

<p>This issue is continuing to happen with 1 person that I know of. I’m not sure if it affecting other people who send me emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for logging off &amp; logging back in, I am constantly logging off &amp; back in, and the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as with anyone who has an email account, I should be receiving spam email, but the junk mail box is always empty. How am I not getting any spam???</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Since the issue still occurs, can you try to access your email using the "InPrivate" browsing. You can also try sending a test email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your other concern, we would like to confirm if your spam emails will just retain on your Inbox. We suggest that you add the email address or domain names to the Blocked Senders List. When you add a name or email address to this list, Outlook moves
 any incoming message from that source to the <strong>Junk Email</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for us to assist you further.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the settings on my browser or my computer.&nbsp; I have used my account on multiple devices &amp; multiple browsers, &amp; the issue persists.&nbsp; I should also tell you that I have multiple hotmail accounts &amp; this issue is only present on 1
 of the accounts.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that add-ins are preventing you from sending or receiving calendar invites in Outlook. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you open the Outlook app in safe mode and disable all add-ins on it. You may refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> and <strong>R</strong> simultaneously.</li><li>In the Run command, type <strong><em>outlook /safe</em></strong> (including the space between
<strong>outlook</strong> and <strong>/</strong>) and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>File</strong> and select <strong>Options</strong>. </li><li>In the left corner, click <strong>Add-ins</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom part, click the <strong>Go</strong> button beside <em>Manage: COM Add-ins</em>.</li><li>Deselect all available Add-ins and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Relaunch Outlook and check if the issue persists. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us all know how the step goes. Otherwise, we’ll be here if you need further assistance.

            It's odd, but it comes up with an error "Windows cannot find 'outlook'. &nbsp;Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again" &nbsp;I did put a space between outlook and /. &nbsp;I tried it with Outlook open and Outlook closed. &nbsp;

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What triggers the information for "last modified by" to be changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brief background: </p>
<p>Outlook 2013 (cached mode)</p>
<p>Exchange 2013</p>
<p>2 delegates for 1 calendar.</p>
<p>Delegate A's name is being shown when Delegate B is the one who added/changed the calendar item. At least when the item is looked at by Delegate A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what actually triggers that change? Strictly a change of calendar info (date/time/attendees/etc)? Just viewing the item?
</p>
<p>Why does the "last modified by" info show the wrong person?</p>

Were you calling a Skype Contact or a Number? This happens to me sometimes as well when I ring a number and it is unavailable. You could try to see if the same occurs on Skype for Web:-

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply, Raymond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completed step 1, but same issue.</p>
<p>Step 2. Outlook still tried to sync with the server and crashed, several times.</p>
<p>Step 3. My Outlook account disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now re-create my account and move on to Step 4. I'll let you know what happens...</p>

            <p>Step 4. Moved these three files to the desktop.</p>
<p>a) com.microsoft.Outlook.plist</p>
<p>b) com.microsoft.outlook.database_daemon.plist</p>
<p>c) com.microsoft.outlook.office_reminders.plist</p>
<p>I couldn't find the other two.</p>
<p>Started Outlook, which crashed immediately.</p>
<p>Returned b) &amp; c) files back to Preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to return a) I got this message, "A newer item named “com.microsoft.Outlook.plist” already exists in this location." So, I left a) on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I followed all the steps Raymond, but still had the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new user account at the server and my first test email to that account survived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's something wrong with my original default email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm not sure where I go from here. The new user account has a new email address, which I don't want to use. I need to use my original email address because that's the one all my contacts know. I also need to get all the log-jammed emails down from the
 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to think about it and chat to my web hosts tomorrow. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. In the meantime, I must go and have some dinner :-)</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Attachment Appearance - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Attachment Appearance</h2>
                    I would love to be able to change the appearance of the attachments on my Outlook emails so I have the "list view" instead of the large boxed view with drop down box.&nbsp; I receive a lot of emails that have multiple attachments and it is much easier to view
 the entire list the old way.&nbsp; It is terribly time consuming and annoying to have to scroll up and down and make sure that I have viewed all of the attachments related to this email.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you planning to upgrade with this option, if not I'm going to have IT
 change my programs back to Microsoft 2013.

<h2>            Microsoft should allow users to change the Internet search engine in the Search function</h2>
                    I've gotten used to using Search from the&nbsp;Start Menu and taskbar&nbsp;and I must say the performance is fantastic. Going anywhere on the Internet with one button press (Start) feels amazing. This feature cuts out having to open a browser window to search for
 software or visit a web address. The default engine, Bing, provides quality results, but I'd like to see an option to change the search engine. Although I personally have no problem with Bing at the moment, I want to see how this function can perform with
 alternative search engines like Google. I'm sure I speak for the entire community when I say this option needs to be included, even if the default is Bing. We have to be able to customize this function. A large percentage of users prefer changing their engine
 to Google over Bing and MS would catch a lot of flak for forcing Bing into another feature. Everything I see in the Tech Preview is stunning and it would hurt if the one feature I'd like to be able to change remained stat

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having this issue with my phone since a while ago. Whenever I try to open a website, it's starts to redirect to several websites and i can't stop it. I can't even see YouTube or Wikipedia because it immediately redirects me to a website full of adds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I already made a factory reset and it happens again.</p>

            <p>It worked for a few days. After that, it started to happen again. I did a factory reset again and started from scratch, after surfing for a few hours, it started to redirect the websites to another site where it says my phone has been infected. I kept deleting

<p>I use two different web browsers (IE and UC browser) and it happens on both, even if I'm using incognito mode.</p>

<strong>Settings&gt;phone update</strong>. If that doesn't help, you may try to recover the software of your phone using the Windows Device Recovery Tool on this link:

                    <p>Hi, I have a 6 mo new Dell computer and 1 mo ago financial data became static, ie, the green connection button came on for a split second then a red (no) connection came on, the all data became static, and manually would have to update. My fin provider said
 that Defender might be blocking it and need to make sure the exceptions and port# is correct. How do I do that? Thanks

<p>Instead of looking for defender to make an exception, try your firewall to make an exception rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May be local pc ,may be gateway firewall/proxy or all..&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2013 Duplicating Emails. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael pundt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 Duplicating Emails.</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Outlook 2013 and for every email that I receive, it duplicates 10 times. How would I go about fixing this issue?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: After playing around with the issue. I have come to find out that the duplicate emails are coming from "Send and Receive" duplicating them.&nbsp; When Send and Receive is hit the system will try and search for new emails that have come in after downloading
 2-3 emails Outlook will crash and then come back up and start to download the same emails.
<br />
<br />
I am using POP/SMTP email server to get the emails from Comcast. I am still not finding any fix to this issue.
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Things that I have done:</p>
<p>1. Clean boot</p>
<p>2. Windows Updates</p>
<p>3. Make sure there was only on process for Outlook</p>
<p>4. Repaired Office 365</p>
