<p>Hi Lois,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you select the title/heading card, an expand arrow will appear on the upper left of it.&nbsp; Expand it and then you can get to the image portion and delete it.</p>
<p>2. Copy/paste of text into a text box should work as you expect.&nbsp; You can also select a card or cards and use Ctrl+c to copy and Ctrl+v to past the entire card(s).</p>
<p>3. I'm not sure I fully understand your question.&nbsp; Can you include a screenshot of what you are seeing and what you saw and I can take a look.</p>
<p>

    <title>Deleted contacts birthday&#39;s still showing up in calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skippermark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted contacts birthday&#39;s still showing up in calendar</h2>
                    <p>I was experimenting with Outlook.com People to see if I wanted to switch from Gmail, and I added my contact list but now have multiple birthdays for the same contact - even though I've deleted all contacts from Outlook.com. See screenshot below. The days
 with multiple birthdays are&nbsp;all the same person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Gmail contacts I have some people people tagged with multiple labels like friend &amp; business I think Outlook.com refers to them as folders? because when I imported them into Outlook.com, it created folders and people that have multiple labels in Gmail
 appeared in multiple folders in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like when they imported into Outlook.com created a separate birthday each time a person appeared in a different folder, even if it's the same person. But, when it did that, it created duplicate, triplicate and more birthdays for those people in
 the Calendar - one birthday for the same person for however many folders they ended up in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I deleted all my contacts including from the "restore deleted contacts" area, but some of their birthdays remained behind. Now I have 3-4 and sometimes 5 birthdays for contacts that aren't in my empty contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? It's almost like all those contacts are hidden or in a hidden folder. I was planning on ditching Google and subscribing to Office 365 but the calendar and contacts are messed up, there's no point. Any thoughts? Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Diane, I disabled the birthday calendar overnight for over 10 hours, but all the duplicates after still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some tinkering a few minutes ago and posted some screenshots if you want to check them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to bed last night, I had no contacts in any contact list. I had deleted everything, including the area from where deleted contacts can be restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning the contact list is still, so I decided to import a partial CSV of my contacts again. George Hall's birthday appears 6 times in the calendar when all the contacts are deleted, so I wanted to check his info and see what was going on. When I clicked
 on Edit contact, a red exclamation point appeared by his name. When I hovered over it, it says his name is found in a bunch of places. What are these? Are they folders because he only appears in the All contacts area and in the contacts folder. If I delete
 his contact card from one of those, it removes it from the other and then he's gone from all contact lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to add that I'm mostly using a Mac with Chrome 69 as well as Safari 12, but I have a Windows computer too and tested this on both Edge, Chrome 69 and in the People app and everything looks good. No 6+ copies of anyone's info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some more testing after this in the calendar but will post about that in a separate reply. Thank you again for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Diane. I did some more testing and here's what I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all my contacts again and went to the calendar app and disabled the beta option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>George Hall's birthday appears 6 times, and when I clicked on his name, a list popped up on the right showing his name 6 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubled tapped his name on the right, and more detailed info about him popped up and gave me the option to view the contact or remove the birthday. I edited all 6 of the "contacts" that appeared in that list and changed his name to&nbsp;Fake Name born in 1900,
 thinking it might save it into my contact list so I could then delete it, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His new name &amp; birthday appear in the birthday calendar, but alas, my contact list is still empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leads me to believe that these contacts are hidden somewhere. I'm reluctant to click the delete birthday option because these contact's info is definitely saved somewhere. I just can't see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's weird.</p>

<p>I can also see this issue. There was a contact of mine who's birthday showed up twice in the same spot. So, I deleted the contact, but the birthdays remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is purely in Outlook online, I am using Outlook 2010 but everything I am doing is online, at live.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an interesting twist:</p>
<p>I turned the "Outlook beta" off and the erroneous birthdays disappeared.</p>
<p>Then, turned "Outlook beta" back on and the erroneous birthdays returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also mention that other non-deleted contacts' duplicate birthdays (in Outlook beta) are not duplicate in regular Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the issue seems to be with Outlook beta. Good thing it's a beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: So, I need to add that the birthday calendar that syncs with Outlook 2010 seems to be the "beta" version. So, even though online the non-beta calendar does not show the erroneous birthdays, and beta is turned off, the Outlook 2010 sync'ed calendar
 still has them. Yeah, so still annoying.</p>

<h2>            How do I unsync 2 phones that have the same microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I set up a microsoft account on my laptop (8.1) to key in all of my contacts to then sync with my new nokia lumia smartphone (8.1). My husband used the same account on his nokia lumia phone so he could have the contact data too. But, now when someone texts
 me it goes to his phone too. We're charged for 2 texts. And when I set up a reminder on my calendar, he gets it on his calendar too. Is there a way we can turn off this syncing without losing the contacts on either phone?

<p><strong>My problem is with auto page numbering in Word documents, exactly after printing out!&nbsp; when I insert the pages numbers in my own language (Arabic) they're OK and appear in (Arabic)&nbsp; on my PC and printing preview. But after printing out, pages numbers
 appear in English format. Anyone has a solution! I'll greatly appreciate that!</strong></p>

<p>After updating, I've encountered a bug - the phone doesn't play a sound of incoming SMS. Id does not depend on which sound is set. All other sound are played as usually, but the SMS sound is missing. What could it be?</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge - Can&#39;t get correct courtesy titles</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using mail merge to create address labels for my wedding, but I've run into an issue for unmarried couples who don't share the same last name. For example, I have friends name John Doe and Jane Rae. I'd like their names to appear as "Mr. John Doe and
 Miss Jane Rae", but the only options I can find are: "Mr. and Miss John Doe," which is incorrect, or John Doe and Jane Rae. For a formal invitation, courtesy titles are expected, so the second option isn't quite what I need. Is there any way to pull in both
 courtesy titles and both full names?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Not getting emails on outlook</h2>
                    <p>Since Wednesday 8th June I haven't received any emails.</p>
<p>I have tried the app,internet explorer and chrome on both my phone and the laptop.</p>
<p>I have cleared the history and cache and still nothing. It is nothing to do with my devices but a fault with outlook itself. The sooner microsfot own up to this the sooner outlook will be working again</p>

<h2>            unhandled exception has occured... What does this mean&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a recently purchased Toshiba laptop (May 2010) running Windows 7 Home Premium, i7 Intel processor, 4gb ram. I installed MSE on June 13 on advice from various forums extolling its virtues. I am happy with it.(most recent FULL scan (23 June) At the
 beginning of this week (21 June) I began receiving, upon bootup, message box from Microsoft.NET - Unhandled execption has occured in your application. If you click Continue this application will ignore this error and it will attempt to continue. If you click
 Quit then the application will close immediately.</p>
<p>Could not load file or assembly 'TSensLib= verion 1.0.0.0'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then goes on to give a long list of details (I have made a copy of this long list) and then it give me instructions for "involking just-in-time (JIT) debuggin instead of this dialog box"&nbsp; (what is that?)</p>
<p>I have not a clue as to what this all means. I have researched as much as I could "TSensLib" (was directed to some anti spyware sites and references were made to a Toshiba application) and also the term "unhandled exception error but to no avail.</p>
<p>The last few programs I have installed were MS Office Home and Student (31 May) and most recent, Corel VisualStudio X3 trial version which has not worked very well, giving APPCRASH errors.</p>
<p>I hope that the information I have provided here will help to point out what is causing this unhandled exception error dialog box and what it all means.</p>

<p>Try to download latest version of Microsoft.net platform from Microsoft website and update your Windows.</p>
<p>Try to uninstall Corel and see if it gone and then reinstall it.</p>
<p>Make sure your version is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Make support request to manufacture of Corel.</p>
<p>This issue is something with your application and is NOT issue with Microsoft Security Essentials probably.</p>
<p>Contacting corel support would help you to resolve it.</p>

<p>Corel has been uninstalled and I ran a registry cleaner (TweakNow 2010) to make sure it was completely removed.</p>
<p>I updated (MS.NET Framework updates KB982670) then restarted the computer.</p>
<p>The same dialog box returned.</p>

            Looks like some program that comes with your laptop is crashing when it tries to update.&nbsp; Can you see if the Toshiba website has an update for this software?

<p>So far the only update for my A505-s6030 has been a bios update which I installed according to instructions. The problem persists so I will attempt to find a way to contact Toshiba tech support (forums?) or some other way to explain my situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">have</span> ordered a Recovery disc from Toshiba which should be here in a few days. If all else fails I would restore the computer to original factory settings then then reinstalll the few programs I have installed
 on my new PC. I will do a back up to my external drive the files I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have an opinion on restoring the computer to a certain restore point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank you for your help so far. It has been all good advice.</p>

            Try to back System restore in earlier restore point and when you didn't have this problem. As long as Windows pre-installed in your laptop , Toshiba support will take care of your issue and resolve it.

            <p>No, it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2016 VBA is in a state of rapid transition, but currently it supports only the commands that were available in 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can expect improvements next month, they are actively working on this feature as we speak. &nbsp;Full parity with Word 2016 on the PC is the goal, but it may take a while to get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry: Your MVPs don't know what is coming or on what date: the only thing we know for sure is that we will get the lot eventually.</p>

<h2>            How to delete attachments from multiple emails at once&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a small question. How can I delete attachments from multiple emails at once (outlook for mac)? I googled this but there doesn't seem to be an easy answer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have found out, there should have been a function in older versions of outlook, but they were dismissed in newer versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there who could help me out? Would save me hours of time, since I have to delete attachments from the last five years..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>93tid's reply is accurate. Assuming you have your cell tied to your PC with the same Live ID they should appear in your People Folder on your PC.</p>

<h3> averyhulin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grey Legacy Box disappears When Typing and Backspacing in Word 2016 &#40;Fillaible Forms&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I m trying to make a word document with many different legacy grey fillible text boxes. I want to be able to type and the grey box expands as I type, staying grey. Although, every time I create a grey box and type in the box the grey box disappears. And,
 if I backspace to rewrite a letter or word the whole grey box disappears and I have to create the box again from the developer tab. Maybe I do not have a feature on? I m using 2016 word version. Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

            <p>If you are using Legacy FormFields, you must protect the document for filling in forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do that either by using the Restrict Editing button on the Review tab of the ribbon or the button with the same name on the Developer tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in the Restrict Formatting and Editing pane that appears, check the box under 1. Editing restrictions and from the dropdown, select "Filling in forms" and the click on the "Yes, Start Enforcing Protection" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you might want to consider using Content Controls as they do not require that the document be protected along with the restrictions that it imposes of not being able to format text, spell check etc.</p>

            Perhaps these are not actually form fields but MacroButton NoMacro fields; they are converted to plain text as soon as you click on one and type a single letter. But you can continue to type as much as you want. If you want the fields to be reusable, you
 need to put them in a template so that you are creating a new document each time you start.

<p>Thank you for the help.&nbsp; Apparently I can go ahead and set it up as either pop or imap, but will that enable the ability to synchronize the contacts and calendar with my Android phone?&nbsp;My current understanding is that Android requires Active Sync to do that.&nbsp;
 I paid ipage for the X-Open in order to get the Active Sync. </p>

            <p>Whether or not your phone can sync via EAS has no connection with whether or not Outlook 2016 can sync. It depends on the implementation used on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>POP and IMAP are mail-only protocols and cannot handle non-mail like calendar or contacts. POP doesn't even sync. IMAP does, however.

<p>
Whatever the rendering engine change that was made between Office 2011 and 2016, older Macs on lower resolution displays are suffering with UI issues. Excel's charts' thumbnails are virtually invisible on my 2010 MacBook Pro. The 'light' themes are also not
 suited to lower res LCD displays and we can't change them to something better. Styles in Word 2016 are still an awful mess. I have to use them but it seems impossible to get them to do what you want, like NOT formatting the following paragraph with the same
 style, despite going into settings and setting things up correctly. Changes made to settings often don't stick either. And is it even possible to check what style is being applied where? The number of times I have made a formatting change in a paragraph only
 to find the same (unwanted) change in distant places! Why can't we have locally applied styles rather than document wide? Drives me nuts. It's also near impossible to discover what 'automatic' changes Word makes to your edits or how to switch them off and
 keep them switched off. They're often only fixed by a 'Cntrl Z' undo and even then, I still don't know what the change that I undid&nbsp;was because I didn't make it in the first place! Language settings are still a mess too. Permissions errors with custom dictionaries
 in many instances still prevents adding new words to it. And most recently, the rendering of pages in long documents is often corrupted or fails to show a page altogether! I really don't like using Office 2016 but I have little choice in the matter! LibreOffice
 is great and if weren't for my need to ensure maximum compatibility with other Word users, I would switch to it today!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I appear to have lost the calendar when an outside IT consultant(!!) was trying to tie in an old backup file including contacts and also iron out some
 synch issues between laptop and phone (I use Office and phone is Nokia so linking generally is v good) .</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I believe he may have switched my account from POP to IMAP/SMTP and reloaded Outlook but I donâ€™t know the logic of why he did that. As I ended up with
 a lot of problems which he could not solve but blamed BT which is my broadband provider I have tried to get a response from him to rectify what appears to be issues created by him. Not surprising he has not replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Certainly Outlook is now IMAP/SMTP.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Behind it is BT mail which holds all the transactions but does not have a calendar.</span></p>
