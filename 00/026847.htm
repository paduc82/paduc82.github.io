<h2>            Subsites does not show parent site on top bar</h2>
                    I am creating sites with the newest Microsoft design. The home site display the name of the site instead of the word "home". When I enter the subsites, they will display each other (selected inherit the parent site navigation) but not the parent site like
 the past sites. &nbsp;

<p>Hi Vanice,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try navigate to the parent site and go to Site Settings&gt;Site Collection Administration&gt;Site collection features, then<span>&nbsp;
</span>scroll down to SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure and activate it, then check whether the parent site is displayed on the top navigation bar of the subsite.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/feacabc0-7a9b-4b54-a1dc-368285ecedb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/feacabc0-7a9b-4b54-a1dc-368285ecedb9" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Please note that it will display the parent site name instead of "Home" on the top navigation link bar of the subsite, this is a feature of group site which is different from classic site.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ee6ad51-bbb8-42cf-9c3f-589a29e42927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ee6ad51-bbb8-42cf-9c3f-589a29e42927" /></a><br />

            No version of Word is compatible with PDF format. The whole point of PDF is that it is an uneditable graphical representation of the document&nbsp; - often to deter plagiarism. You may be able to copy and paste elements from the PDF to Word, depending on how
 the PDF was created, and if you had the full and expensive version of Acrobat you would be able to save the PDF as a Word document, though whether you would find the results any more useful is debatable.<br />
<br />
There are third party conversion programs around, but the best all round solution is to use OCR software such as Finereader, which can read the PDF format and make a fair stab at reproducing it in Word format.<br />

    <title>Lumia 820 has music issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yeelenm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 820 has music issues</h2>
                    Hey guys, <br />
I've been using my Lumia 820 for a while now, but recently it's been acting up with my music. I have 1571 songs (MP3's and WMA's) that I want to put on the phone's SD card (a 16GB SanDisk card- more than enough space for the music) and the phone seems to refuse
 to play or keep them. The files are not corrupted, but when I drag &amp; drop the music into my phone (which takes an hour, so it's never a quick action) the phone does not want to play them, and it displays the error code 80070003 or 80070002. When I reboot the
 phone, the 1571 songs are replaced by 848 songs and a JPG. The JPG then becomes the album art for all of those songs.<br />
I've tried erasing the SD card multiple times, I've tried syncing through Windows Media Player, I've removed any non-basic tags from the files but nothing seems to work. I've also turned off the 'Connect with Xbox Music' option and whatnot. The phone is running
 the latest software that I can get here in Belgium, and I'm at a total loss. Can anyone help me?<br />

            <p>Hello YeelenM,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting in the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this code usually occurs for music ripped or downloaded from un-official sources or ripped from them and as a result these songs are missing metadata which causes the errors. To improve the metadat I try running the songs through freemake audio converter.
 Or downloading the songs from official sites who's coding works with the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another solution offered by a user: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 822 with expandable micro SD card. Specs say 64 gb is possible, I use a 32 gb.
</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;Everytime I put an mp3 or wma file on the phone from my own PC collection, the file would 50% of time time be unreadable with error 80070002 or 80070003 or other errors. The card would become corrupt and I would reformat it on my PC. I tried FAT32, exFAT both
 with the same result. I would only use the Windows Phone desktop app for Win7 to move the files and would get the errors. If I stored the music on the phone's internal memory it seemed to work better (at least the corruption would stop) but again 50% of the
 files where not playable. I even tried an old 8gb card, same problem so I went back to my 32 gb class 10.<br />
<br />
I tried to transcode all my music to .wma as this format seemed more friendly, I was wrong same problems. So I did the hard this and hard reset the phone and re-formatted the SD card and started fresh. Some music transferred with no errors, but then the playable
 problem persisted again with mp3 or wma.<br />
<br />
I noticed that WP8 supports AAC files, so I transcoded all my files to AAC (actually .m4a which is just another file extension but is AAC format inside). I use foobar2000 freeware to do the work.<br />
<br />
Then I transferred the music using just windows explorer and low and behold the music is there are readable. You even get a windows pop-up saying that the device doesn't support .m4a files but I transferred them anyway and it's working perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any further questions. </p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

            Hi Kirsty,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you got a message stating that your Outlook is growing too fast. I'd be glad to assist you on this matter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Firstly, if you got a message saying that your Outlook.com account is growing too fast, it is possible that your mailbox is already full. If your mailbox is full, it will hinder you from sending and receiving messages.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>With this, we would like you to provide us with the affected email address so we can check it in our end. I have opened a private message wherein you can provide the needed information in a secured way.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To view the private message,
 log in first to the Microsoft Community, go to this thread and click the </span>
<b>You have a private reply to this message</b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> link above your post.</span></div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I &nbsp;have received the below email from Outlook at the weekend however, I had sent some very important and lengthy emails on Thurs, Fri and over the weekend (before receiving the Outlook email) and I cannot find those emails anywhere - not in sentbox/outbox
 or drafts so I am not sure what happened to them or if they have been delivered. It will be such a disaster if theyve been lost as it would be a waste of many hours' work. How can, I check if they'v been delivered? I have deleted hundreds of old emails from
 my account so the below email shouldn't apply now.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi London_711,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are worried if the emails that you've sent arrived on the recipients end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did not receive any bounce email from the system there's a big possibility that the emails were arrived on the recipients inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook.com offers an ever-growing storage. This means that whenever a user reaches the limit (for free accounts) or&nbsp; even Ad free Outlook.com, additional storage space is allotted as needed, so no emails should be deleted by our system from your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other query, kindly post it here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><font>Emails sent using the Samsung or Sony mail app&nbsp;will duplicate in the Sent folder.<br />
The emails duplicate every time the&nbsp;Samsung or Sony&nbsp;mail app&nbsp;syncs.<br />
The Sent folder&nbsp;can grow so much that&nbsp;the account&nbsp;may be&nbsp;blocked.<br />
You will have to fix the duplicating problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is an update to the Samsung mail app.&nbsp; It fixes the Sent folder&nbsp;duplicating messages.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or remove the account from the phone app.<br />
Download and install the outlook.com app.<br />
Add the account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or you can setup the account to use 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.<br />

FIXED ON SAMSUNG GALAXY S2? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had the same problem with hundreds of duplicated emails in my outlook sent mail folder. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I use the native email app (which I prefer after trying many alternatives). I cleared the problem using the native email app on my phone.&nbsp;
 I deleted the outlook account [open app; settings; bin in top right corner; delete] then added it back selecting 'Manual Setup'.&nbsp; When the app then asks 'What type of account?' I selected 'Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync'.
<br />
<br />
The settings needed are as follows... <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Domain\user name: \[Your outlook email address]<br />
Password: [Your outlook password]<br />
Exchange Server: s.outlook.com<br />
Use Secure connection (SSL) [Tick yes]<br />
Use client certificate: [Leave blank]<br />
<br />
All your emails will be back in place on the phone within a few minutes once you have worked through a few more settings which are all ok at their default values.
<br />
<br />
I can now send emails from my Samsung with only one instance appearing in my outlook sent folder :)<br />
<br />
If I get any further problems I will report back.<br />
<br />
I got the Exchange ActiveSync settings from the following <br />

            If you really think it matters (it almost never does) you can try this for stopping formatting of phone numbers:<a href="http://outlook-tips.net/cs/blogs/outlooktips/archive/2009/03/18/905.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook-tips.net/cs/blogs/outlooktips/archive/2009/03/18/905.aspx</a>

</p><p>Be aware that there is an important distinction to be made between the *Access* object model, which includes those objects that are defined by the Access application object, and the DAO object model, which includes those objects that are defined (in Access
 2013) by the Microsoft Office &lt;version&gt; Access database engine Object Library, a separate library reference.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CurrentDb method (which is part of the Access object model) returns a DAO Database object (which is defined in the DAO object model).&nbsp; The DBEngine property (in an Access application) is a property of the Access Application object, but it returns a reference
 to a DAO DBEngine object.&nbsp; Once you start working with properties or methods of CurrentDb or DBEngine, you are working within the DAO object model.&nbsp;

<h2>            A new twist on the &#39;webcam is in use by another application&#39; issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.&nbsp; I have both Skype 8.3.1 and the latest Skype UWP installed and working on my fairly new Windows 10 Lenovo X1 Yoga laptop.&nbsp; I can make video calls on Skype 8.3.1 without any problem - the 'integrated camera' is immediately available and previews
 under 'Settings', and video calls are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when running Windows UWP I get the 'webcam is in use by another application' message, and the camera does not preview nor am I able to make video calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I can both preview the camera and make video calls in Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Privacy Settings: </p>
<p>- Camera access for this device is turned on</p>
<p>- Allow apps to access your camera is toggled to On</p>
<p>- Under the Camera heading:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Everything listed (including 'Camera') is toggled to 'off' EXCEPT 'Skype' (note: this looks like Skype Desktop [8.3.1] to me, judging by the icon) which is set to 'on'</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Assuming I'm correct and the Skype icon is for 8.3.1, I cannot see an icon (and hence setting) for 'Skype trusted Windows store app' or similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Note that there is also not an icon and setting for Skype for Business but, as noted above, that works fine with the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the camera driver through Device Manager by selecting 'Update' and after a check it pronounced it 'the best driver I can be using'.&nbsp; I then had it send me to Windows Update (which does scheduled checks anyway) but it didn't report any updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing that would enable Skype UWP to actually access/use my camera?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>B</p>

<p>You may not have a camera driver that is fully compatible with Windows 7+ or buggy, making it incompatible with Windows 8 and 10 UWP Apps. A DirectX diagnostic output would be helpful.</p>
<p>

<p>Assuming the issue is not due to permissions or camera blocks by 3rd party software, I would suggest updating your drivers. Try to update your camera drivers to the latest that are available from those update servers. I have located newer ones for Windows
 10 - 1803 (your current build). They have been packaged and uploaded to my site.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://pcdust.com/Downloads/SunplusIT/SunplusIT_5.0.18.28.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SunplusIT_5.8x drivers [pcdust.com]</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not change anything, try the generic "USB Video Device" drivers that come with the OS. They may be compatible with your camera. Below is an example of how I can change to either driver with my camera.</p>

<h3> movingtechnologyforward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Update</h2>
                    <p>Having upgraded a Windows 7 Pro SP1 and a Windows 8.1 Pro with ISO 10162 with all of the other software for the various PC's and Desktops, everyone ran well without any problems with the Update function of 10162 which included all of the current Microsoft
 updates. My question for this post, on the 29th of July or when ever Microsoft releases Insider version of the final new Windows 10 software, will it be possible to just do updates to the various PC's and Desktops that were built with 10162, or do we have
 to go back and run the new Microsoft 10 release and upgrade the 10162 to it's final new build?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assume if the new software is released and that 10162 did all of the checking for compatibility, that when the upgrade for Windows 10 final version releases, that all of the previous hardware will upgrade again without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>First thank you for your fast reply. To clarify this subject further. If the operating systems that are being upgraded with Windows 10 Build 10162 for both Windows 7 Pro SP1 and Windows 8.1 Pro, does all of my activations for these devices move forward and
 become Windows 10 activation codes?</p>
<p>When I upgrades all my hardware devices with Build 10162, it never asked me for a new product key. So I need to know when we get the RTM for Windows 10, will all of the hardware I've upgraded, will the activation keys move forward and be good for the life
 of this device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say in your message we can do upgrade/install, do you mean we have to use the new ISO for RTM Windows 10? Another words we can't just bring up the 10162 builds and use the Microsoft Update feature from within the Operating System and update?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens to my previous operating system when I upgrade to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 replaces your previous version of Windows by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Windows 10 becomes the default operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Windows 7 license will always be valid and will not be changed or deactivated because of the upgrade to Windows 10: you'll be able to install or restore Windows 7 again in case you'll need to do that (provided that you've the Windows 7 installation
 DVD</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not have to use ISO for RTM Windows. You will have to install the Windows 10 update from within the Operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you any further queries, we will be happy to assist you .</p>

            <p>Sara, again thank you for your fast response. You said: " Windows 10 replaces your previous version of Windows by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Windows 10 becomes the default operating system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 install and runs without any problems, can I remove the "windows.old" folder? This would give back hard drive space because I would no longer need to go back to and old operating system.</p>
<p>If I can remove the "windows.old" folder, are there any other areas I can also remove that reflect the older version that has been upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have found so far from building a Windows 8.1 Pro system with Office 2013, along with other software for the installation, the total size after the upgrade with build 10162 the Windows 10 system now is about 19GB. That's pretty good for the new environment,
 so if I can remove the "windows.old" folder my operating system should remain in the 19GB storage area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you agree with this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same questions, actually I have the build 10.0.10240 apparently it's the RTM version or similar, and I have the Windows.old folder that has a size about 13 GB. All is running very well, then I want to remove it, I can do it? How I can delete it?.</p>
<p>

            <p><strong><span>How to remove the Windows.old folder</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Applies to Windows&nbsp;8.1, Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you upgraded to Windows&nbsp;8.1 from Windows&nbsp;8.1 Preview or to Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1 from Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1 Preview, some files used by your previous version of Windows
 will be left in the Windows.old folder. These files will be automatically removed within 28 days of upgrading, or you can use Disk Cleanup to remove them yourself.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Before you use Disk Cleanup, make sure that all of your files and settings are where you expect them to be. Deleting the Windows.old folder can’t be undone.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen,
 moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering Control Panel in the search box, and then tapping or clicking Control Panel.

<h2>            Setup the a new Outlook account on Mountain Lion as an Exchange Account</h2>
                    <p>
Hey guys, has anyone been able to add their new Outlook account as an Exchange account on Mountain Lion?</p>
<p>
I was able to on my iPhone but keeps telling me that the server is unreachable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I've tried this as the server:</p>
<p>
m.hotmail.com</p>
<p>
m.outlook.com</p>
<p>
snt-m.hotmail.com</p>
<p>
snt-m.outlook.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
And none work on Mountain Lion though snt-m.hotmail.com works fine on my iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1.1.</p>

            Unfortunately Hotmail/Outlook.com only supports <i>Exchange ActiveSync</i>&nbsp;protocol which is only used in Mobile devices, not desktop or laptop computers. You'll&nbsp;either&nbsp;have to setup using the POP3&nbsp;protocol&nbsp;or wait until they release a desktop client like

            Exchange ActiveSync and Exchange MAPI/OWA are two different things. Microsoft does provide a add-on for Windows customers who own Office Outlook 2007/2010 to connect to Hotmail/Outlook.com nativity&nbsp;as if it was a Exchange Server (and Windows Live Mail
 2012 for&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;else). However they did&nbsp;mention in a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5932972/talk-to-the-outlook-engineering-team-right-here-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Q&amp;A</a>&nbsp;they would bring out something for Mac OSX users. I just don't think that solution would&nbsp;involves&nbsp;the OSX Mail app that we're hoping for.&nbsp;

            Is it really necessary for them to cripple something that already worked for a long time "Exchange mail" access for hotmail.com in the move to outlook.com? Why would you want to alienate all the people out there that may not want to be plugged into a web

            <p>They haven't crippled anything, Hotmail doesn't support Exchange access either, both support EAS (Exchange ActiveSync) which is for mobile devices only, which is why it works on iphone, ipad etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EAS is not for desktop OS's, which is why outlook never supported Hotmail natively, you needed the addin for hotmail. OSX mail doesn't support EAS either.</p>
<p>Windows 8 mail does support EAS, as the mail app is an EAS client.</p>

Hi Tester7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recognized that&nbsp;upgrading to a new interface which is Outlook.com&nbsp;must make you feel upset. You may have experienced something different but certainly you will enjoy this upgrade once you get used to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple, fluid and interactive design of Outlook gives you smart tools to help you keep your inbox organized and makes it easy to use whether you're on a desktop, smartphone or tablet. Click
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to see our Outlook preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly refer to this <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/what" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to learn more about Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            You can't,because Nokia 5300 isn't symbian.However,N5300 can multitask MUSIC + Java.But open the music file first before opening any application.

            Hi Casa ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Some people block incoming calls from callers with unkown Caller ID's. Try to enable Caller ID by following these steps:- 
<br />
<br />1. Sign into your Microsoft/Skype Account here:- 
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview</a> 
<br />2. Under 'Manage Features', Select 'Caller ID'. 
<br />3. Select your country and enter your mobile number in the appropriate boxes. 
<br />4. You should then receieve an SMS to verify the number. 
<br />5. If all goes well, the Caller ID should be activated within 24 hours. 
<br />
<br />or if you have a Skype Number, after step 2, you can simply select your Skype Number as the Caller ID. 
<br />
<br />If this does not solve your issue, I suggest that you contact a live chat agent about this issue here, in case Skype blocked a number:- 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/s...</a>
<br />
<br />Not all issues allow you to speak to a chat agent, so please select one of the following issues to be able to talk with the agent:-
<br />'Payments and Purchases'
<br />'Account, profile and sign-in'
<br />'Privacy and security'       
        </p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>The 2nd link takes me to another Skype account, not the one I usually use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you spell out the link to try to fix my real account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one popped up and unbeknown to me I created anther one which I do not use or plan to use.</p>

            This is because you are signed it to that account on the MS website. You should be able to sign out of it by selecting the icon on the top left of the website and clicking 'sign out'. However, this is not neccessary, you can still talk about your other account with a live chat agent even whilst signed in to your other one.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a972ed7-6d9b-4dd5-9ab0-2afd8d86abfd?upload=true" />

<h2>            Remove ordinals from dates &#40;regex&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In VBA, I'd like to be able to remove the ordinals from a date string to make it return True when tested with IsDate().</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1<strong>st</strong> Jan 2013</p>
<p>2<strong>ND</strong> JAN 2013</p>
<p>23<strong>rd</strong> Jan 2013</p>
<p>Feb 28<strong>th</strong> 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you supply the regex code (all of it including the set up and execution) to remove "st", "nd", "rd" and "th" (in both upper and lower case) that immediately follows a number 0-9?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>no, you can either use Freeze Panes or split the window. You can't use both at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider moving (or copying) the totals functions to the top of the sheet, so you can include them in the frozen panes. That will keep them visible together with the headers, while you enter data somewhere in the middle of the table.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Quota exceeded but I can&#39;t delete anything</h2>
                    Hello: I have not been able to receive and send messages since November 16, 2018. The Hotmail/outlook app on my phone won't even let me look at any messages because I keep receiving a message that my mailbox has exceeded the quota. I can login on my computer
 and have cleared about 70,000+ emails over the last week. However, I am still unable to send or receive e-mails. Also, I am unable to empty my junk mail or deleted boxes. Every time I empty them the same emails return in both places. I have several orders
 in route with tracking numbers that are located in my outlook account but cannot check for a status since I cannot receive current emails. I am frustrated and at a loss for what to do next. Any suggestions or assistance is appreciated.&nbsp;

                    Outlook 2013 from Office 365 on Win 8.1.
<div>Click on the Shortcuts pane.</div>
<div>Under Shortcuts I have 'Outlook Today' and 'Microsoft Office Online'.</div>

            Deleted the Outlook.xml file from the ...Appdata/Roaming/Microsoft/Outlook folder.
<div>That got rid of the item that seemed to cause the error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My Shortcut pane had two items on it. I assume by default.</div>
<div>One is Outlook Today. That one persists.</div>
<div>The other one was something like 'Office Online'. It was a http link to a Microsoft site with information about Office 365, etc. I didn't put either one of these in the folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div>That was the link that caused the OLE error when I tried to look at its Properties.&nbsp;</div>

<p>They have a current version. They are seeing the standard office theme colors. I do remember before we had to save the .thmxl to the themes folder on the c: drive on the customers computer. But lately when I get a presentation sent to me, their colors have
 come over with their presentation. So I thought it was fixed. But my client is saying when she opens up the file the microsoft office theme shows up and not the special color palette.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try just saving the file with the special theme selected and the theme color palette selected. Hopefully it's as simple as that. Do you know if this is the solution?</p>
<p>I'm waiting to hear back if that worked</p>

                    I understand that Microsoft is combining these great services on their end, but the great thing about MyPhone was the automatic sync. The app did everything for you as far as syncing the contacts, schedule, notes, and text messages on a regular basis.
 Will there be an app for Windows Mobile 6.5 to sync automatically with Skydrive?

            It is highly doubtful that any such app will be developed for windows mobile 6.5 since Microsoft is pretty well moving away from windows mobile and completely focused on windows phone 7.&nbsp; There currently isn't even a way to backup text messages or sync

<p>
</p><p>I was trying to enable InfoPath on SharePoint by going to Admin Centers =&gt; SharePoint =&gt; InfoPath =&gt; and checking Allow users to browser-enable form template.
</p>
<p>This should enable it for the entire SharePoint. I was wondering if there is an option to enable this feature per site.
</p>
<p>I looked up a lot of articles and tried to find it with no luck. I would appreciate any help.

<h2>            Error Code 86000c4c</h2>
                    <div>BLUF: My brand new Win8 HTC 8x can't sync with my microsoft account (hotmail) because too many devices listed, error code 86000c4c</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hesitant to post this question as this seems to be an&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;common error however attempting to locate the correct thread to get help to resolve the issue is near impossible as I have been bouncing around numerous threads that are locked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background: I recently purchased a Win8 laptop and have no issues syncing with my Microsoft account. I also downloaded Office 365 and established my&nbsp;Hotmail&nbsp;account on outlook. I purchased the win8 phone but can't sync it due to "...too many devices...error
 code 86000c4c"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Troubleshooting: I deleted the hotmail account from outlook and re-added it using the recommended pop3 settings I've found on the locked threads related to the issue. I've attempted to go to devices.live.com to remove any excess devices however the phone
 was the only one. I removed the phone from devices.live.com and factory reset the phone to attempt to connect it again. The phone again repopulates devices.live.com however the sync issue is still present.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a very serious issue as it&nbsp;completely&nbsp;ruins the purpose of having a windows phone or attempting to utilize Microsoft for my email, calendar, etc if it can't sync to the devices I'm attempting to use.</div>

<p><span><span>I notice the version of Outlook client in your computer is downloaded from a first release Office 365 account. So, I installed the same version in my lab and tried to reproduce
 the issue, but no luck. </span></span></p>

<span>Do you configure an Office 365 account in the Outlook client?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Calendar was created as a Group calendar in Outlook, and then added to Favorites in order to show under "My Calendars." The issue was never resolved with that method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up creating a Public Folder with a Calendar, and the overlay setting is now remembered after returning from Mail. The Public Calendar is showing under "Other Calendars" instead of "My Calendars". I suspect the original issue has something to do with
 calendars that are showing under "My Calendars."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<br />
<br />Use this link to get it:

            Hi there!<br /><br />Yes, you can. To do it you have to buy a UK number and then buy a subscription for Pakistan in order to forward and receive calls on your phone (Pakistan)<br />I saw two subscriptions for Pakistan. One of them is $2.99 month (100 mins landlines and mobiles) and the another one is $15.99 month (800 min landlines and mobiles)

<p>Is there any way that I can use to receive both calls and sms? Actually I have to use this number in UK bank account and amazon seller account, So, it is necessary for me to active my number according to both ways.</p>

 different mobile device types, but the problem is with my desktop, its has nothing to do with the device.</p>
<p>
The problem has shown itself in several ways:</p>
<p>
1) WMDC hangs on flash screen.</p>
<p>
2) WMDC takes a long time to load but eventually it does show the home screen, but does not try connect.</p>
<p>
3) Sometimes when device is docked it shows the message "you must install active sync 4.5 or higher......". But I think this is because WMDC on the desktop is so broken!</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
It never connects. I've gone through all the basic troubleshooting-</p>
<p>
- rebooting</p>
<p>
- different mobile devices</p>
<p>
- I've re-installed WMDC</p>
<p>
- I've even installed the latest vista service pack.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Any ideas?</p>
<p>
Thanks</p>

In the event log I'm geting a message which seems to be related to my problem:</p>
<p>
<strong>"Windows Mobile-based device failed to connect due to communication (0x80072745) failure (see data for failure code)."</strong></p>
<p>
But I don't really know what this means?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I've also unchecked Settings&gt;Connections&gt;USB To PC&gt; Enable advanced network functionality. When I do this my PC picks up the device and installs the driver. But I need it syncing through the WMDC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is a huge problem for me as it stopping me from working :(</p>

<p>Have you tried having WMDC started and then plugging in a device to another USB port? Make sure you have an internet connection so it will install the necessary drivers to communicate with your device. After all the drivers are downloaded and installed it
 should connect to your device via WMDC.</p>
<p>You may also have to remove your computer's relationship with your device(s) in ActiveSync under options - just select and delete the partnership. If that doesn't work you may have to hard reset your device.</p>

<p>I've tried with multiple devices, and different device types. So I don't think a hard boot will help anything. I've resorted to using another machine for mobile development but i really need to fix this. Does anyone have any other ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment there is no automatic device detection (settings in WMDC are correct). If i start WMDC on the desktop it will either hang on the flash screen "please wait while windows mobile device center starts", OR it will manage to proceed to the home
 screen but not detect anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
