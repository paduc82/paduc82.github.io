<p>Is there a way to set up Aero style dark color theme like one could have in Office applications:<br />

</a>I basically want to get rid of the prevalent burning white backgrounds and eventually have different than the bluish color of toolbars and ribbons.<br />

I've already seen themes like:<br />

                    Windows Vista Business 64-Bit<br />
Restarted after what I believe was automatic updates, not sure.<br />
Will reach Vista loading bar, and then flash a blue screen (think it's dumping physical memory, but too fast to tell) and restart. Won't load Safemode. Resetting Bios doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I've attempted the Windows DVD repair install, EasyBCD from a windows XP install on a different drive... nothing works, I get the same thing everytime.<br />
<br />
Please help, I've got a deadline due and this is totally uncool. Thank you :)

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This may fix both the 9f and&nbsp;c2 error problems though you should work through the suggestions<br />
above and do these when you get to the update drivers section.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue. (c2 is also likely a driver or possibly bad memory) Antivirus/antispware/security<br />
programs can also cause these issues. Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check<br />
in Windows Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring.<br />
<br />
For 9f&nbsp;it means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device Manager<br />
to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound<br />
and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else).<br />
<br />
See my generic driver update methods in next message.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Generic troubleshooting methods - and you already gave the info. Keep eye on it while testing to see<br />
if the BCCode changes<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your

<h2>            Disable F1,F3, Etc Hotkeys in Windows 7 Enterprise</h2>
                    I am trying to figure out if there is some built in way to disable the built in hotkeys in windows 7 enterprise? For instance, when I hit F1 it pops up the help window in windows, or a new tab in firefox with firefox help, f3 opens search window etc. I
 use these keys for many other things, this is really a problem for me.

            IT' actually really simple if You have vista or windows 7. Just in start search bar write "mobility" and look in search results for " Windows mobility center". A window will open. find Fuction key in that and select "Function Key" instead of "multimedia"(or
 any thing else) and that's it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; THIS LOCKED MY F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 AND SO ON KEYS. I GOT THIS FROM ANOTHER WEBSITE FROM SOMEONE ELSE THIS SHOULD HELP YOU NIGTHER SMITTER

Mortal Kombat 11 beta</a>. Did you pre-order the game on the Xbox store? If you pre-ordered the digital copy of the game, you should already have access to the beta. Are you able to&nbsp;download the Mortal Kombat 11 beta when you search for it in the store section
 of your console? Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for asking such a great question. When it comes to the MK11 pre-order, if you ordered it digitally via the Microsoft Store, then you just need to download the Beta from the MS Store.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mortal-kombat-11-beta/bt5c2qmr87l1?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mortal Kombat 11 Beta</a><span> &lt;&lt;&lt; link to it in the MS online store</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you happened to pre-order it from a physical or online retailer, then you'd would need to redeem the beta key that you should have received from them directly. If you did this and did not receive the beta key, then you'd need to check in with them
 directly to determine how that code was to be delivered to you and to also confirm that they are participating in the beta program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out! Let us know if you have any other questions or concerns as we'd be happy to help out.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, keyboard not working after sleeping, no drivers in device management</h2>
                    <p>I've encountered an issue with my new Windows 10 PC, and was wondering if anyone might have any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On waking the machine from sleep, the keyboard was completely non-responsive. I tried plugging in another keyboard, and that did no good, so it's not a hardware problem. I had to log in to my machine using the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-starting the machine (twice now), and nothing's changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see other people have had similar problems, and I've seen a suggestion it might be linked to device driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to device management, and found that all of a sudden, there's no option whatsoever for keyboards in there. No drivers, no dropdown, nothing. As there was a keyboard yesterday, and it worked, this seems distinctly odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered this issue, and does anyone have any tips for how to resolve it? Many thanks for reading this :)</p>

            <p>What is the connection type of your keyboard ? PS/2, USB, wired, wireless, ? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wake up from sleep, a new keyboard, which you attach to your PC, might not work because the old one's drivers are running in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug in a new keyboard and restart your PC. Then the new keyboard is loaded into the system and starts working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to Hardware problem, it works both ways. Either the <strong>keyboard</strong> is faulty or the
<strong>connector/its electronics on the motherboard </strong>is faulty.</p>

</p><p>Both keyboards are PS/2.</p>

</p><p>PS/2 keyboards are tricky. Turn off the PC, plug in the keyboard and turn on the PC. While the PC is on, you cannot plug in a PS/2 keyboard. That may fry the electronics on the M/B.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 color calibration resets when external monitor gets &#40;un&#41;plugged - Asus N76VZ</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an Windows 8 (at the moment with 8.1 update) AsusN76vz laptop which needs color calibration to maintain acceptable color levels on its internal display. I found the Windows Calibration tool to be most suitable for this task. I managed to get the
 colours right, but since I move around a lot, and use different external displays in different places, my color calibration values for internal laptop display resets every time when I plug-in or plug-out another external display.</div>
<div>This has become very tedious, since I have to do it multiple times per day. I hoped that 8.1 update would fix the issue, but it doesn't.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At the moment, I'm using latest drivers available for my laptop, as provided by Windows update. I do not have any Asus bloatware apps installed. Everything works just fine except for the colour calibration values which keep resetting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did try to use all the other available drivers, but the Windows colour calibration values always kept resetting when I used Windows Calibration tool.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Interestingly, when I used Asus/Nvidia/Intel apps for colour calibration included in GPU drivers, values didn't get reset. It only happens with Windows Calibration tool. Unfortunately, only the Windows calibration tool gives me satisfying results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I make it stop resetting?</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To resolve this try the following steps and check:<br />
<br />
First connect the secondry monitor and then run the color calibration tool. Then with the secondary monitor connected, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
a) Press Windows key +X, select control panel.<br />
b) change the view by option on the right top to large icons.<br />
c) click on color management. <br />
d) Against device, select the secondary monitor and check, "use my settings for this device".<br />
e) in the bottom, highlight a profile and select "set as default ptofile".<br />
<br />
Save changes and check if the issue persists. Let us know the results for further assistance.

            No. This doesn't help. The moment I plug-out the secondary display, the internal laptop display goes back to default colors. This also happens when I change multiple display settings (for instance when I select "Second screen only") in Metro&gt;Devices&gt;Project&gt;Second
 screen&gt;...
<div><br />
<div>Just in case that you mixed up that step in d) above, I used this for both displays individually, and to both, and I still get the colours reset.</div>

I'm experiencing the same issue. I've tried fiddling with all the settings, but it seems that the external monitor, whenever I plug it it, always takes what I assume is the color profile for the laptop screen and not the color profile that I've assigned previously.
 It's very obvious because the colors are way off, and going through the color management dialog each time is quite tedious.

            <div>I found these links. I had done the stuff in the first link, but as the second link explains, an intel graphics program running in the background interferes with color profiles. Try disabling the utility like the link explains.</div>

            Yes. I tried both before.
<div><br />
<div>The first link didn't do anything for me. I think it's so because it is Windows 7 specific.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The second one only helped partially. The colours don't reset so often. For instance they don't reset anymore &nbsp;when you restart the system, or when administrator mode popup happens. Actually, when the system is restarted, you can see the switch in colours
 right after booting. The BIOS part is booted with default, wrong colours, and when it comes to Windows login, the colours get corrected to the one chosen in Windows color calibration. But they still reset when the actual graphics adapter resets. I'm not sure
 if it is NVIDIA or INTEL. Most probably it's the Optimus; the system that switches between the two.</div>

You might be right about it being the Optimus tech. My laptop has integrated intel and discreet AMD graphics.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to extend the 10 day limit to go back to your previous version of Windows</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span>If you have just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 you will discover that you only have
<del>30</del> <strong>10 days</strong> from the time you upgraded in which to recover your previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is how you can go beyond <del>30</del> 10 days and still go back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: On November 7th (92 days after upgrading to Windows 10) I tested going back to Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>It worked as I was able to restore Windows 7 and install all the Windows 7 updates released from August, Sept. and October.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /></p><p><span>30 days may not be enough time to evaluate Windows 10 especially if you have long work hours, family commitments during the weekends and other activities that limit the time you have on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click Start / Settings / Update and security / Recovery</span></p>
<p><span>Notice the ‘Go back to Windows 7 (or Windows 8.1) option. After 30 days this option will no longer exist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bd2bfd0-0e94-4eb0-b625-e16903b748cd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just follow these instructions to get more than 30 days to evaluate Windows 10 and still be able to recover / roll back to your previously installed version of Windows 7 or 8.1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You need to make the changes described below now, don’t wait until the 30</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span> day as it may too late.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you have installed the Threshold 2 (Windows version 1511 aka Build 10586) update see the instructions in part 2 (only applies if you already had the original version 10.0 which was release
 on July 29</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>, 2015 already installed) otherwise if you have just recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 or 8.1 within the last 30 days perform the steps listed in part 1.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>What version of Windows 10 do I have installed?</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>In the Cortana / Search box enter:</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>winver </span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>The best match should be a run command named winver. Click on the ‘run command’ option and the “About Windows” box will display both the version number and OS Build number).</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span><strong>Part #1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Start by launching File Explorer (manila folder on the toolbar), and select the ‘Local Disk (C:)’ drive partition. Now click on the ‘View’ tab and select the ‘Details’ option. Now place select and place checkmarks in the ‘File name extensions’ and
 ‘Hidden items’ boxes.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Next near the right end the bar there is an ‘Option’ tab, click on it and click the ‘Folder Options/ View tab. Now select ‘Show hidden files, folders and drives’, remove the check marks from:
</span><span>‘Hide extension for known file types’&nbsp; and&nbsp; 'Hide protected operating system files’.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4882701-2546-46db-8b36-54a335bddb77" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the ‘Apply’ and ‘OK’ buttons</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should now see a number of addition files located at the root (C:\) level of the disk drive. Two of these folders must be renamed to protect them from being deleted 30 days after you have upgraded to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ade1979c-e0f8-49ae-bb8d-74ec663c8e7f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In File Explorer right click on C:\$Windows~BT and rename it to Win7-$Windows~BT (or Win81-$Windows~BT). Next right click on the C:\Windows.old folder and rename it to Win7-Windows.old (or Win81-Windows.old). When you have finished renaming these two
 folders you should see the following.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46aadc63-365f-44a9-a2fd-00ed86432b70" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now you are all set to continue using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you have Image Backup software installed make a backup of Windows 10 after you have renamed the 2 folders. When and if you choose to recovery / roll back to Windows 7 or 8.1 should something go wrong with the rollback process
 just restore the backup and try again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong><span>Part #2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You already had the original release of Windows 10 installed after having upgraded from Windows 7 or 8.1 and you previously followed the instructions listed in part 1 within less than 30 days after upgrading to Windows 10. Now you find that the Threshold
 2 update (Windows 10 version 1511 / Build 10586) has been installed and there is a new Windows.old folder in addition to the one you renamed in part 1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you haven’t already done so, start by launching File Explorer (manila folder on the toolbar), and select the ‘Local Disk (C:)’ drive partition. Now click on the ‘View’ tab and select the ‘Details’ option. Now place select and place checkmarks in
 the ‘File name extensions’ and ‘Hidden items’ boxes.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Next near the right end the bar there is an ‘Option’ tab, click on it and click the ‘Folder Options/ View tab. Now select ‘Show hidden files, folders and drives’, remove the check marks from:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Click the ‘Apply’ and ‘OK’ buttons</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should now see a number of addition files located at the root (C:\) level of the disk drive. Two of the folders (Win7-Windows.old and Win7-$Windows~BT) you already renamed to protect them from being deleted 30 days after you have upgraded to Windows
 10. You also see 2 new folders as the result of installing the Threshold 2 upgrade (Windows.old and $Windows~BT). You must rename these folders using the same technique described in part 1, only this time the names will be Win10_Ver10_$Windows~BT and Win10_Ver10_Windows.old.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you have renamed these folder you will have 2 sets of renamed folders as shown below. The 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> set with the Win7 prefix contain the files and folder you need to roll back / restore Windows 7 (or 8.1) and
 the new set (pair #2) with the Win10 prefix. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you fail to rename the second pair of Windows.old and $Windows~BT folders before the 30 day time limit and as a result these two folder are deleted then you will no longer be able to use the original set of folders (pair #1)
 you renamed short after upgrading to Windows 10. Once pair #2 has been deleted, it does not matter if you remove the Win7 (or Win81) prefix to restore the original pair of folder names the roll back option will not be listed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What causes these 2 folders (Pair #2) to be deleted is a scheduled task set to run Disk Cleanup (with the ‘Clean up system files / Previous Windows installations options’ selected) 30 days after the upgrade to Threshold 2 (version 1511) or the next
 major update after version 1511.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Once renamed as shown below the second pair (Pair #2) will prevent the deletion and allow you to roll back to Windows 7 or 8.1 per the instructions in Part #3 of this article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fc74b8b-c11c-4e68-8eb7-00951a91f940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fc74b8b-c11c-4e68-8eb7-00951a91f940" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span><strong>Part #3</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>If you finally decide you want Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 back on your computer do the following:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: Plan to allow yourself enough time to complete the instructions listed below without interruption. Laptop users should also connect to an AC power outlet before you start as this could take an hour or more.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Backup any new data files to external media (USB Flash drive for example) you may have created while using Windows 10 in case they need to be restored after the process has completed.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Your computer will reboot, choose your account name and password to continue and then you should see the GUI Boot Menu when the computer restarts. Click on the ‘Troubleshoot’ option.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Now click on the ‘Go back to Windows 7 / 8.1’ or previous build option. The restoration / roll back process will start by rebooting your computer after which you will be prompted to choose an account (use your Windows 7 account and password if you

            <p>It has been found out and posted at here&nbsp;http://www.thewindowsclub.com/were-sorry-but-you-cant-go-back-windows-10</p>
<p>if you use the media creation tool to create an iso, bootable dvd or usb drive the process will overwrite the two folders (windows.old Swindos~BT needed to do a recovery.</p>
<p>It may be under the 30 days or more if the two were renamed but the recovery folder will show as empty and or not accessible.</p>
<p>When the recovery option is run the user gets a message the recovery has been removed, even if it has been only one day from installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My upgrade was done on the 15th of august and both folders are still on the c drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I can say this is an issue.</p>
<p>I &nbsp;did do &nbsp;a full image backup before the upgrade but not restored it as many that have done this find their old operating system keys not able to activate or login using their microsoft account.</p>
<p>I would like to know if their is a downgrade option in win10 if a new product key was
</p>
<p>input for win 7 or win8 or would this require the media to accomplish this if at all possible to start.</p>
<p>It has also been said that it is only 28 days from install not 30 to do a recovery to the old os.</p>
<p>This could be an issue for someone thinking they had 2 more days when they do not.</p>
<p>The only issue I have is the driver updates that insist on overriding my OEM drivers.</p>
<p>The function to be able to control fan speed so to keep my nvidia gpu cards cool and not crash playing a game is something the microsoft &nbsp;basic driver can not do.</p>
<p>If microsoft duplicated what nvidia or amd offered in their driver package it would not be an issue but they do not.</p>
<p>Paying for hardware that can cost thousands of dollars for just a video card and then have it not function properly because microsoft wants a unified driver so they can attract developers is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>With so many different pc configurations this is not possible.</p>
<p>An android or apple device will not have thousands of &nbsp;configurations on them,the differences will be slight; cpu, storage, memory and the owner has a choice what and how they configure that device. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Spider-Man&#58; Friend or Foe &#40;Black Screen&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>[Retrieved from the <a href="http://forumsarchive.xbox.com/36431765/ShowPost.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Forum Archive</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an issue playing Spider-Man: Friend or Foe on the newer 360 (slim) model consoles.&nbsp; At startup the game will lockup&nbsp;at a black screen, and will remain&nbsp;locked until a notification message pops up (friend signed online, received a game invite, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This only seems to be an issue with the newer 360 (slim) models.&nbsp; The problem does not occur on older (fat) models.&nbsp; Considering it's a console-specific bug (and not the game), I imagine this problem may occur with other games as well - games that share
 whatever unique characteristic Spider-Man: FoF seems to have at the root of this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Posted in the archived thread, one possible workaround is to quickly press the Guide Button immediately after selecting 'Play Game' but before the game actually starts.&nbsp; Of course this is not an acceptable solution for the masses of casual players likely
 to purchase this family-friendly game.&nbsp; A true solution needs to be investigated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey nCogNeato! Just wanted to get a little more info from you regarding this so we have everything we need to pass it along.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen every time on every S console, or does it sometimes work alright?
</li><li>Is there any similar issues when using a non-S console, or does it work perfectly there?
</li><li>You mentioned a black screen until a pop-up message. Does this spur the game into working correctly after that? Describe the situation as accurately and in as much detail as possible.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Thanks for bringing this back to our attention! We'll post back whenever we get any new info.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Does this happen every time on every S console, or does it sometimes work alright?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It happens every time on my S console, and from what I've read&nbsp;on the archived thread (linked above) and posts on other forums, it seems to be a blanket problem for all S consoles.&nbsp; With or without being installed to the Hard Drive.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there any similar issues when using a non-S console, or does it work perfectly there?</strong>
<ul>
<li>It works without any issue on my non-S console.&nbsp; With or without being installed to the Hard Drive.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You mentioned a black screen until a pop-up message. Does this spur the game into working correctly after that? Describe the situation as accurately and in as much detail as possible.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once you select to play the game from the Dashboard or Guide Menu, the screen goes black.&nbsp; While the screen is black, there is no audio, and all controller input is ignored, including the Guide Button.&nbsp; The only option is to&nbsp;eject the disc via console or
 media remote (brings you back to Dashboard), or simply wait.&nbsp; The screen remains black without audio until a pop-up message appears on my screen (ie. friend signed online, message received, etc.).&nbsp; The pop-up message appears to somehow 'shake loose' the game
 into playing as normal.&nbsp; Once the game is 'shaken loose', I experience no further issues unless I exit back to Dashboard and attempt to load it again (repeat black screen).
</li><li>I've tried installing and not installing to Hard Drive.&nbsp; I've tried clearing cache and playing offline (although I don't think the game has any updates).&nbsp; The only remedy that seems to work is the previously mentioned - press the Guide Button immediately
 before the game loads and the black screen appears.&nbsp; By having the Guide Button displayed onscreen&nbsp;the game will load normally behind the Guide Button, at which point you can exit the Guide Button and play the game normally.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further question, just let me know.&nbsp; Spider-Man: FoF is a fairly old game, and will probably not be played by many on the newer S consoles.&nbsp; However, my concern is that other newer games may share the same characterisitic causing this 'black
 screen' issue, and perhaps the root of this issue may lead to other problems in the future if left unidentified.</p>

<p>This exact problem is also occurring on my Xbox Slim. Purchased and replaced twice, 2nd time knew it had to be a problem with the game itself. Thankfully I found this thread and the temporary workaround solution. Thanks to you my son is very happy now! I
 also heard that this problem is also happening with "Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe". MS needs to the update the slim with a system wide patch, I'm sure it's an easy fix since the workaround solution is simple :-)</p>

<p>That's what I was afraid of, other games sharing the same incompatibility with the Xbox 360 Slim model.&nbsp; Hopefully a fix is created for these and any other games with the same problem.&nbsp; More importantly, hopefully developers have been notified of the issue
 so this doesn't happen with future releases.</p>

<p>All- &nbsp;I posted this on another thread but it seems warranted to post again here:</p>
<p>I had the same issue as of 7/25/11. Tried a number of things:</p>
<p>-Tried to play game both from disc AND loaded on HD (250gig S)</p>
<p>-Deleted and reinstalled game on HD 3 separate times</p>
<p>-Tried to load on both my main (live/gold) profile AND an offline profile</p>
<p>-Uninstalled and Reinstalled most recent Live update </p>
<p>-Attempted to play from the dashboard, the guide menu, and the games menu</p>
<p>Each time the effect was the same, after hitting "play game" the screen would turn black and the console/controller would go completely unresponsive, necessitating a hard shutdown. I have not tried playing the game in a non-S model as I no longer have one,
 nor have I tried the fixes above (given by nCogNeato) as I just stumbled upon them, but will try tonight.

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm looking at buying a Mad Catz Fly 5 joystick for various flying games. However I have windows 8 and I am not sure if it will work with windows 8. The box and website say it is only compatible with Vista, XP, and 7.</div>
<div>Is there some drivers you can get that will make it compatible?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

    <title>Duda sobre baneo en Gears 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fuyagatzu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duda sobre baneo en Gears 3</h2>
                    
<p>Hola hola bueno este es mi primer post aqui jejeje y tengo una enorme duda...<br />
creo que a mas de uno le a pasado el bug del Gear of war 3 del reseteo de lvl, etc, etc...</p>

<p>Mi duda es: si respaldo el player data a una memoria usb y respaldo la carpeta con los archivos ocultos a mi pc... provocaria un baneo si la proxima vez que me pasara el bug regresara el player data ( el anterior el cual no fue afectado por el bug) sin haber
 jugado una partida para que los datos se actualizaran en la base de datos de epic games?<br />
<br />
pregunto porque ya me a pasado 2 veces el bug ( en el tiempo que jugaba offline ya que no tenia servicio de internet asta hoy ) y no quisiera que me pasara de nuevo ya jugando online... espero me puedan sacar esa duda para la proxima vez que me toque... respaldar
 el player data o borrar el player data afectado y comenzar desde 0... e.e aunque por hay dicen que epic game banea a los que tengan reseteo de lvl aunque sea por defecto de su propio juego... ._.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Saludos y grax :)</p>

<p>Técnicamente se puede tomar como modificación del sistema por los servidores de Live, así que en teoría hay cierto riesgo no solo de que te baneen en el juego, sino de todo Xbox Live, así que no tomaría el riesgo</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and it’s great to know that you have chosen Windows 8!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you have updated all the Windows 8 Apps from the Windows Store and now you are not able to close the Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to have additional information about this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you press the “Windows Logo” key on the keyboard? Does it take you to the Start Screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you move the cursor at the top of the Windows Store screen, does the cursor changes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer this article from this link on how to close an App in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>if somebody is buying stuff via your account you will need to check this link <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Live/Account-Security/What-To-Do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/.../What-To-Do</a> and change the password and security question etc for your account. Also remove any consoles from remembering the password.</p>
<p>Since there is also money stolen you will need contact Xbox Support. They will start an investigation and temporary lock your account to prevent this from happening. (Even refund the stolen money)</p>
<p>They will also be able to remove the payment option (credit card from your account)</p>
<p>To contact Xbox Support use <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

            Hi Lisa, please try all the options in the Windows Recovery Environment before re-installing . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />If all else fails, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot

<h2>            1903 Settings Appearance - Cortana Delayed</h2>
                    <p>I just did a fresh install on 1903 (on 3 different machines) and each machine displays the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into Settings and it goes from “Ease of Access” to “Search” and then 2 seconds later “Cortana” displays between those two items. It happens every single time I open Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana was NOT activated during installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>So I completed the steps from the kapilarya site and renaming that folder disabled search completely. It did remove Cortana from the Settings app, but now the taskbar search icon doesnt even open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems Microsoft’s disabling of Cortana is just smoke and mirrors… as per usual.&nbsp;</p>

            Microsoft doesn't provide ways to disable features that dont' have an Uninstall button.  That fix is from a reputable MVP.  
<br />
<br />Technet also came up with this Uninstaller that might be more surgical for WIndows apps you don't want here.  Run it to load all the Store apps and then run the Uninstaller for Cortana:  <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />First I'd restore the folder you disabled that took Search with it.  This may be a new issue after the Upgrade.  
<br />
<br />Were you able to restore the Settings app with the fix I gave for that which works for most?

<p>I did restore the folder to original and it went back to “normal”, meaning glitchy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing Windows 1809, I don’t connect to the internet and when installation is complete I run my own PowerShell script to remove ALL metro apps except Store and Photos. Then I run ShutUp10 to save myself some time. Both of these items worked normally
 in 1809. I wonder if 1903 does not like something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will test that uninstaller you shared and post feedback. If it doesn’t resolve this issue, I’ll revert back to 1809. &nbsp;</p>

            The errors you getting are not reported by anyone else using those tools and I refer them every day.  The fact that these strange and unusual anomalies (in the billion Windows 10 users) happened on all 3 of your installs is almost certainly due to the modifications you do on your installs as described in your post before last.  What you describe is a mangling of WIndows 10 so it should't be expected to function correctly in the first place, and it didn't in three of your installs that all had the same malfunction.  As I wrote about the Technet uninstaller which is the most tolerable uninstaller, removing apps without an Uninstall button still has minor consequences for every one.  But to remove them all with a single script is courting disaster and based on my experience over 10 years in forums I wouldn't expect Windows to work at all.

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />

If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 ISO download that works with any version of windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timrobison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 ISO download that works with any version of windows 7</h2>
                    I am looking for a link so I can download the windows 7 ISO that works with recovery discs for my windows 7 pro SP1 and my windows 7 Home computers. I read there is an ISO file download that will work for any version of windows 7. I'm not sure if it is
 windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe found on https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5842. I thought I could use the download at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7 but I only get languages of French and Korean. I tried choosing
 French, then using F12 to search the code to find 'french language' or 'GLC' so I could change the GLC designation from French to GLC-01150 for English, but no luck. Thanks in advance!
