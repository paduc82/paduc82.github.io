<h2>            Can&#39;t add or delete accounts in Windows 10 Calendar app</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added my Outlook and my Gmail account when I first set up the app and everything was working great. But I tried adding another account and I can't seem to add or delete accounts in my WIndows 10 calendar app that comes with Windows 10. I clicked on add
 account and nothing happens. I try to click on an existing account happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unimstalled the app using the Powershell script and reinstalled from the WIndows app store but then when I started the set up account it automatically remembered my 2 accounts and when I tried to click on add account, nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there someway to prevent Mail from remembering those 2 accounts I set up when I reinstall the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>THanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hello Matt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the above description, I understand you are unable to add another account to the Calendar app even after uninstalling and re-installing the app from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue may occur due to the presence of corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders on the computer. Presence of corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders will result in irregular performance
 of that particular app on the computer. The above issue might also occur due to the corrupted user profile on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases
 will fix the same to enhance the performance of the system. Run </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows apps troubleshooter</strong></a><strong>
</strong>to check if the any of the app files are missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by referring to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Set up accounts</strong></a><strong> </strong>on Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

Hello,<br />
<br />
I too have a similar problem.&nbsp; At first Calendar App worked fairly well, I was able to add several accounts.&nbsp; Then some of the accounts started showing sync errors, I was able to re-sync sometimes, then not other times.&nbsp; One of my accounts started to give error
 messages in the Mail app, but the Calenar and Contacts still appeared to work.&nbsp; (Bell Canada used to have it's email hosted by Microsoft using hotmail servers, but then went to a different email system).&nbsp; Then this account stopped syncing with other devices
 if an appointment was created in the Calenar App.&nbsp; Now I am not able to modify any account settings, nor add other accounts.&nbsp; Clicking Add account button makes it blink, but nothing else happens.&nbsp; Same thing when clicking on an existing account, the field
 clicked on blinks, but nothing else happens.<br />
<br />
Tried Method 1 suggested by Microsoft's Likhitha V, who replied on March 15, 2016 to the original post.&nbsp; On running Windows apps troubleshooter, I got "An error occurred while troubleshooting" message, Error Code: 0x80300113.&nbsp; Tried it again, then it ran, and
 the message I got was: Reset and open Windows Store.<br />
Windows Store cache and licenses may be corrupt. Resetting Windows Store will resolve cache and license issues and restart Windows Store, would you like to reset now?&nbsp; Clicked the "Reset and open Windows Store" button.&nbsp; This was follwed by: Troubleshooting
 has completed.&nbsp; The troubleshooter made some changes to your system. Try attempting the task you were trying to do before.&nbsp; Problems found; Windows Store cache may be damaged; Fixed.&nbsp; Closed the troubleshooter, tried Calendar App, same issue, can't access
 account setting for existing accounts or to add new accounts.<br />
Tried Method 1 again as described above, got exactly the same results, Problems found; Windows Store cache may be damaged; Fixed.&nbsp; Tried this at least three times, same messages, no improvement in Calendar behaviour.<br />
<br />
Tried Method 2: If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by referring to Set up accounts on Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.<br />
Well I already had another administrative account, which is not linked to a Microsft ID.&nbsp; Opened it up, found only a Microsoft account calendar being listed (even though it was not linked to any Microsoft ID).&nbsp; Tried to Add account in Manage Accounts, but nothing
 hapens when it is clicked.<br />
Also had a look at the Calendar App behaviour on another computer running Windows 10.&nbsp; There I was able to both change account settings, as well as add an account.&nbsp; Interestingly, am not logged in using Microsoft ID on this computer, but there is a Microsoft
 account visible which shows holidays.&nbsp; There are four accounts visible at left when the left menu is expanded, but only two are in the Manage Accounts window.&nbsp; The Microsft account is not there, and neither is a POP3 account which has a calendar associated
 with it, which is displaying information.&nbsp; It was added by adding the email account.<br />
<br />
Any help with getting the Calendar app working would be appreciated (the Mail App too, it used to work fine, almost nothing updates.&nbsp; There are 7 email accounts set up, but all except one show Nothing has arrived yet.&nbsp; Some have a Focused and Other view option,
 and the Other may show something, but some don't have this option and show nothing.)<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 2-3 months ago I noticed syncing stopped working.</p>
<p>Tried wsreset, troubleshooter, resettings Mail and Calendar via Apps &amp; features list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And though I was able to remove existing account, all old events remain in the calendar and annoy me with reminders (again: accounts are removed from Windows 10&nbsp;Mail and Calendar, and the corresponding event is removed from the origin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, clicking "Add account" does nothing (button itself has visual feedback on mouse button down, but no new window appears when and the view stays the same when LMB is released).</p>

<h2>            SD card reader not working after 1709 Creators update</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a fujitsu T901 laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>O2micro integratted SD/MMC controller shows up in the device manager, and every time I put in an SD card the volume shows up, but it asks me to format the card every time. I tried and it failed to format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>one window pops up saying:</p>
<p>F:\ the directory name is invalid</p>
<p>
</p><p>then another says:<br />
you need to format the disk in drive F:\ before you can use it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to reformat the disk. But, when I try, windows fails to format the disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling drivers from fujitsu, they say they are compatible with windows 10 64-bit - but perhaps that means prior to the fall creators update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution? can I skip the 1709 update?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I rollback to 1703 the cardreader works fine. Next try update 1709 cardreader not working. Disabling the cardreader before updating and enabling after 1709 is applied brings the same problem. No newer or better drivers available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fixed this problem on my Dell Latitude E6520.</p>
<p>I went to Device Manager</p>
<p>Under Storage Controllers, I removed both O2Micro devices, checking remove drivers</p>
<p>I then restarted Windows</p>
<p>The driver then showed up as an Unknown Mass Storage device</p>
<p>I Right clicked the device and did Update Driver</p>
<p>Then Browse my computer for driver software</p>
<p>Then Let Me pick from a list of available drivers...</p>
<p>Then I chose: SDA Standard Compliant SD Host Controller</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Windows will tell you this is not recommended</p>
<p>Proceed anyway</p>
<p>When all is done, there is still a yellow exclamation...however, my sd cards work fine, both read and write after this, and no more annoying FORMAT this disc message, or invalid path message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for you too</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update to version 1903 crashed my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markmwareing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update to version 1903 crashed my computer.</h2>
                    <p>I carried out the version 1903 and it has not just crashed its killed my system. M<span>y system has been kept up to date on all patches and versions along with MS security patches.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My system does not have a CD Drive and will not recognise any USB drives, this means that i cant run a recovery USB or CD as the CD drive is USB,</p>
<p>and I was informed from Microsoft support that i would have to buy a new windows 10 licence to fix the issue, how will a new licence fix the issue if the current corrupt system will not let me install anything. I don't even get a blue screen of death just
 kept told by an on screen message to inform my administrator, this is a home system not a business system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As I already have a licence that was prebuilt on the system, but not given a backup disk as it is no longer needed with windows 10 how do I recover my system if MS support does not under stand that with out "USB" working I cant install a recovery usb or
 cd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way from MS support, it is not their issue as I "did not test the version update prior to installing on to my system", is this a new procedure that MS are now demanding all its home users do prior to carrying out MS updates ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft are now coming on par with MAC "we cant fix it by a new one syndrome"</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is welcome</p>

            Hi Mark,
<br />
<br />I don't understand them saying "test the version update prior to installing on to my system" - how do they envisage that happening for the everyday user?
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot correctly. . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />If available, this is the best option
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
        </p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give that a try, but the windows start up disappears fast then just goes to the white warning screen after about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no issues in the past when I have had to rebuild my system thanks to Adobe, this is a new one on me I would have expected the old blue screen of death.</p>

            Hi Mark.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Your PC is hardware, it can't be killed by software.  So unless you have hardware that's tested dead then at the worst you'd need to reinstall Windows, and that is actually the best option for most who have Version Updates choke to death, especially if you follow this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works in this tutorial link to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary follow the steps in the middle of this download page to  create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media created in Step 2 to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is latest and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Good news, Microsoft is changing Update policies soon as announced recently here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/#25qbCuAVA5Vkx6mC.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />Until then you can manage Updates with all possible options here:

<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it was just a figure of speech, I was due to edit and print off some canvas prints when the version up date screwed up my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a number of things to fix the issue, for some reason I could not use my recovery dvd as my dvd is an external USB 3 and all my USB ports were not being recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i ended up doing was on my mother board I noticed a USB port that was built for the USB 3 card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting the dvd player restarted it recognised the drive, but the DVD recovery disk I burnt was a dud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using an old system I produced a USB recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many attempts to restore it would not work, in the end I un plugged the D drive, then ended up by formating ( this was due to each failed restore used up space on the C drive) the system partition and leaving the OEM, Now I reinstalled Windows 10 by
 using a recovery USB drive which then recognised the OEM partition and a fresh install was built, as all my data is backed up twice a day and photography data backed up sfter each session to external drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From reading the comments in the community I was not the only one who fell foul to this version update, my gripe is that this issue was caused by the version up date and MS support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot. All they wanted to do was sell a new
 OEM disk and would not take accept that the update caused the issue. At first they kept telling me to log into windows and carry out a restore from a saved point, and not listening to what was been said, sounds like they are reading from a script with no knowledge
 of the product they are supporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rant over</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks to all who replied or read the issue, I hope you do not need to take the drastic route I had too take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers Mark<br />
</p>

            Mark -  Unfortunately we see this here every day.  
<br />
<br />But more user control over Updates has been promised in the new version by a top MS exec here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/04/04/improving-the-windows-10-update-experience-with-control-quality-and-transparency/#25qbCuAVA5Vkx6mC.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />
<br />So we'll have to see if there is real relief.  Having it happen at such times is maddening.  
<br />
<br />Let me know if there's anything else.
<br />
<br />Also when ready please mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.  A rating is also appreciated.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to tell you that the clean install with the media creation tool solved a big problem.</p>
<p>The problem was the Windows 10 upgrade to 1903 which could not complete. It booted into the BIOS and stopped there.</p>
<p>The power button let me boot correctly.</p>
<p>The clean install including 1903 completed correctly.</p>
<p>The clean install is not so clean any more. It let me keep both programs and files. That was a great advantage</p>

 recently updated to 1903 because the update did not appear in Windows Update until recently.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Noticed &#39;Screen Saver&#39; &#62; &#39;Photo Gallery&#39; issue</h2>
                    I clicked the questionmark icon (Help) in Windows 8.1 while viewing the Personalization" options and was brought to a page with, "This content is no longer available." message. Just wanted to report the fact Windows 8.1 is rotating the Screen Saver (Photo
 Gallery) pictures upside down and sideways on an install less than one (1) week old. &nbsp;This looks like an undocumented feature (bug) to me.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is not a major issue and I know for a fact some of the photos downloaded on to the computer ARE DEFINITELY upside down, but I can also confirm that images showing right-side up on ONE TEST of the Screen Saver showed up differently on the NEXT TEST.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone else can confirm seeing this same behavior on Windows 8.1 (Release, not preview) then please post a Reply here as supporting evidence.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            <p>I believe the Photo Gallery wasn't touched much/at all for this release, so I would suspect this is not a new issue.&nbsp; I would also be curious about the actual orientation of the file: it's possible the way that orientation is marked in the file may be helping
 lead to this.&nbsp; I haven't seen this on any of my issues with my image collection. :\</p>

<div>This is not a major issue and I know for a fact some of the photos downloaded on to the computer ARE DEFINITELY upside down, but I can also confirm that images showing right-side up on ONE TEST of the Screen Saver showed up differently on the NEXT TEST.</div>

I have this too, Picasa and non-Picasa pictures are rotated on screen saver. Just got new pc yesterday. I'd love a solution as the screen saver gets more attention than the pc.

            <p>I'm having the same issue with the screensaver. While Files in the picture folder are oriented correctly when viewed from the desktop, the orientation is scrambled when in screensaver. While watching the screensaver, I have noticed that the same picture
 may be rotated differently on successive appearances. I'm not sure if this bug affects ALL files in the picture folder, or if it affects only the ones recently imported from my I-phone.</p>

            <p>This will let you adjust some of these features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Desktop: right-click menu &gt; Personalize &gt; Screen saver = Photo Gallery &gt; Settings &gt; (adjust) Use this theme setting (try them all).<br />
<br />
The Settings button opens a different window depending on which Screen Saver theme you've selected. Selecting the Photo Gallery theme will afford the most choices in how your photos will display.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps with some of your display problems.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue with my screen saver turning my photos in the gallery sideways but they are right side up in the picture folder.&nbsp; I am finally tired of it and trying to find a solution to the issue. I googled my problem and came up with this post.&nbsp;
 So, yes, another person is having this issue with the windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And no,&nbsp;my photos did&nbsp;not come from&nbsp;an iPhone.&nbsp; In fact this issue is as recent as about several months ago.&nbsp; I had windows 8 at first and I am not sure if upgrading to windows 8.1 caused the issue with the screen saver or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution, I would appreciate knowing what it is. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no "specific error message".&nbsp; When the skype name is called, it rings like normal, then the screen shows "your call is being forwarded" which is also normal.&nbsp; Then the screen refreshes and says "The number you entered is invalid, please check and
 try again".&nbsp; Attached is a screen shot of this error.&nbsp; The strangest thing about this screen shot is the number shows "+1" and this shouldn't be forwarding to any number at all, just sending it to our PBX via SIP.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b21750ab-331f-421d-819e-2fb1936cab18?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b21750ab-331f-421d-819e-2fb1936cab18?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have reset the internet connection and the PBX.&nbsp; All other non-Skype lines are working properly on the PBX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not reconfigured any PBX settings.&nbsp; The Skype connect lines were previously working fine with the current settings.&nbsp; The only thing that I have done is to reset the SIP auth password in Skype Manager.&nbsp; Both the PBX and Skype Manager show that the
 SIP connection is authorized and successfully registered.</p>

            <span>Sip.skype.com currently resolves to&nbsp;</span>63.209.144.201 on my network. You should be able to keep that domain name, especially if the IP changes again in the future. DNS propagation would be the reason such a change
 would be delayed. If your name to IP resolutions do not update fast enough on your network, it can be due to local device or DNS server caching. You might consider changing your DNS servers on your devices or network to ones that update themselves more often.
 You can try Google's (8.8.8.8), a different local ISP's DNS or an OpenDNS solution.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Thanks Techfreak_</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our DNS was already set to 8.8.8.8 with 8.8.4.4 as secondary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain name sip.skype.com was failing for several days.&nbsp; Definitely longer than a cache would explain if we were using slow-updating DNS servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sip.skype.com might resolve to that IP address now, but it wasn't the other day.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>63.209.144.201 is listed as the secondary connection on the skype connect authentication details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm guessing that they had a problem with the primary server and have since pointed the domain name over to the secondary server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just a guess though.</span></p>

            Since I do not currently have a sip account set up, I would be unaware of any actual downtime that occurred. That sounds plausible.

<p><span>Hi Davies,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Like you’ve stated, Rp_pkt32.sys is not a driver file that is on Windows XP CD. It’s a driver file from RadialPoint Inc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to perform repair by booting into Windows XP or starting the repair installation by booting using the CD?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the complete message that you receive about rp_pkt32 while performing a repair installation?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to unplug all the external devices (except the basic peripherals like mouse and keyboard) and then continue with
 the repair installation. Probably, you’ve a device that is making use of this driver file while performing a repair installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Repair Installation</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Note: Since the installation has stopped, you’ll have to manually restart the computer to start the repair installation again after you unplug
 all the external devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Sound Audio Playback Echo on Windows 10</h2>
                    I've been getting a lot of echo through my speakers and my head/earphones in Windows 10, I did follow what people recommended to preform. This is the method: Go into my Control Panel, then Hardware and Sound, then Sound. after getting into Sound, double-click
 the Speaker option then a new window should open up revealing sound options like 'General', 'Enhancements', 'Levels' and 'Advanced' but the 'Enhancements' option is not available /or blocked off from me, therefore I cannot chance the echo enhancement. I have
 also Uninstalled and re-installed my Sound Driver but it had only worked for a few minutes before the echo returned. Is there another way to fix my sound problem?&nbsp;

<h2>            Search using File Explorer Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On my desktop Computer I have a folder and some files which have a common part of a name on both such as the name of the folder
 could be Folder and the files could be called Folder-file1, Folder-file2 etc. Doing a search in documents or even drilling down closer(these folders and files are about 5 levels down, if I used the name Folder, I don't find the folder or the files which had
 Folder as part of their name.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I
 cleared the search file and rebuilt the index and it still couldn't find the files.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have a laptop computer which contains the same files as my desktop. I opened File explorer and keyed in "Folder" and they
 popped right up. The only difference in the machines is that the desktop has an upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and the laptop is a Windows 10 from scratch. I have checked the search ribbon on File Explorer and all options and other items are identical
 between the two machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While
 I was playing with rebuilding the search index, &nbsp;I even added the drive letter specifically &nbsp;that actually contained the Documents folder (not on the C drive) which the system is smart enough to know that the drive contained the documents folder so it removed
 the documents folder from the list when it added the drive. No change.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Interesting thing happened though. With all my frustrations, I restored to a C drive image from a week before to see what would
 happen. and immediately after the restore completed, I tried the search and it worked. So then I tried it again immediately and it didn't work. Even drilling down the folder tree to the specific folder "Folder" which contained the files so I'm looking at them
 while I'm keying in the search argument and it still can't find them.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So what the heck is going on?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Anyone have any ideas where to look???? Thanks in advance for any ideas.</span></p>

            <p>I have tried your suggestions this morning with the following results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Found no issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: This wouldn't run with my version of Windows, said to contact software publisher</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Mixed results here, so I am not sure what to try next. Booting to safe mode and running the search I was able to find the Folders and Files I was looking for. So then I disabled all services other than the Microsoft Services and rebooted and I
 could NOT find the Folders and Files. Back to safe mode again and I could find the files and folders. So reactivated all of the services and could NOT find the Files and Folders. So does this mean there is something in the Microsoft Services that is preventing
 me from finding the Folders and Files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As another piece of information, there is one more difference between the laptop and the desktop computer that I neglected to state up above. The clean install Windows 10 on the laptop is Home Version and the upgrade on the desktop computer is Windows 10
 Pro.</p>

            I ran SFC and it said there were some errors. I went to the log files and it shows the contents of the Document folder from a couple of days ago when I was playing around but it said it couldn't fix the errors and nothing in the log was flagged as having
 errors. I guess there is a reload in my future coming up, but I just don't understand why I can find the folder and files in safemode and cannot find them during normal operation. Doesn't make any sense.&nbsp;

            <p>I finally solved my own problem. Below is a posting I made to Windows Secrets where several board members had been sending me hints of things to try. I still don't know why or how it happened, but this is how I finally solved the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I think I might have solved the problem, looking good so far so I will share this in case someone else has the same problem.
 This thing was driving me crazy so before I went for the big reload I thought I would try some goofy stuff.&nbsp;</em></span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since a reload of the index wasn't doing any good, having done it many times, I took all my folders off the volume where the
 documents normally reside. I then removed documents from the indexing routine and substituted the drive letter where they normally reside. Then I did a reload of the index and of course the number of items fell from about 50,000 to around 10,000 because only
 my music and start menu and the other miscellaneous stuff that Windows includes had any data in them.&nbsp;</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then I formatted the volume to make it clean and get rid of all the dust in the corners because at this time I had started
 thinking I had a pointer problem and if I couldn't force a clean reindexing a reload was in my future.&nbsp;</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I then moved all the folders back into the volume and let the index start rebuilding itself with a couple of reboots in the
 middle of the process so it would have plenty of opportunity to restart the indexing process. I never put the documents folder back into the list of things to be indexed and just left the drive letter where the documents reside in the list.&nbsp;</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So far so good. I'll give it a day or two and see if it continues to work. I won't restore the documents folder to the list,
 I'll just leave the volume letter in there. Only thing I have on the particular volume is the documents folder.&nbsp;</span></em><br />
<br />
 they caused me to look at this thing from every different direction. Still don't know why I could find the folders in safe mode and couldn't in regular but as someone said there probably was a driver or process stepping on something else. Anyhow, thanks again
 and everyone have a nice weekend. I know I will because I was going to spend it reloading and customizing the machine and now I can go do something else.</em></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Storage Spaces - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony p77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Storage Spaces</h2>
                    <p>Question;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a RAID 0 storage pool in Windows 10. The storage pool has 952 GB of usable space, it currently has 6.06 GB of space used. I ran a system clean-up which wrote data to securely erase empty hard drive space. Now I get a warning that my storage pool is
 full. I wrote a large group of files approximately 41 GB to the space to verify there wasn't an actual limitation. After all the files copied without issue I deleted them and noticed that the pool went from no capacity to&nbsp; 911 GB in use, the amount that was
 written and then deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched but not come across this issue in any internet searches. Perhaps I am not searching for the correct terminology?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for correcting the storage spaces error without affecting the data on the pool? The reason of concern is that the drive has a SoildWorks vault space and I would prefer not to delete it and have to recreate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>
<p>

<p>There's also nothing wrong with Storage Spaces, RAID or no RAID.</p>

            Hi MDCN_89,
<br />
<br />The issue could be related to Touchpad drivers.
<br />
<br />Please perform on your machine a windows update, install everything, then restart the machine.
<br />
<br />You may also uninstall the Touchpad / install back 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel click on Administrative tools, open Computer Management. 
<br />Click on Device Manger, Search the Touchpad . 
<br />Then do a right click on the Touchpad, click on uninstall. 
<br />After it finishes, restart the machine. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

            If your touchpad is not working, here are some things you can try:
<br />
<br />1. Connect an external USB mouse then run the Hardware Troubleshooter:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Hardware and Devices
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />2. Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Human interface devices 
<br />Right click HID-compliant touch pad
<br />
<br />(If you don't see your touch pad listed, look under 'Mice and other pointing devices')
<br />
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit then restart.
<br />
<br />If you don't have an external/wired mouse...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Press the 'M' key
<br />Press tab once
<br />Use the down arround to select Human interface device or Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Press the right arrow to expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Use the down arrow again to select your HID-Compliant mouse or touch pad
<br />Press the right click menu key on your keyboard (usually located between the Alt and Control keys)
<br />Select uninstall
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U

<br />If you recently upgraded to a new version of Windows 10, there might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Firefox infinite tabs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Firefox infinite tabs</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is the right forum. My apologies if this is not.</p>
<p>Over the past few days I have noticed that at times if I try and open a pdf tab in the browser, then I get an infinite number of tabs opening up.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/219c6244-1b3e-4624-bfca-b6faa5d28992?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/219c6244-1b3e-4624-bfca-b6faa5d28992?upload=true" height="509" width="764" /></a></p>
<p>The tabs continue until I use task manager - this is difficult at times as task manager keeps closing down straight away, and it needs to be used a couple of times, or the tabs continue&nbsp; until the computer crashes. I cannot close firefox directly (using
 x top right hand corner).</p>
<p>The only change I have made recently is to download a couple of apps from the windows store. I have started using adobe mobile pdf reader to print the pdf (although I have yet to change it in defaults)</p>
<p>I have norton utilities 16 installed and I have cleaned using this. I also have norton 360 installed and up to date. A quick scan did not show any threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect I have inadvertently changed a setting somewhere - but what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening please and how do I put it right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 HP Pavilion Elite HPE troubles</h2>
                    <p>I bought this pc, monitor, and printer all new at Best Buy. Worked beautiful for like 4 yrs. I unplugged it for 6 months. never letting Webroot expire. Upon reconnecting to online I installed the 100 or so updates. After that I have problems with nearly
 everything has stopped working. HP Assistant which I've never used. IE 10 on the task bar, the windows installed EI wouldn't open. Same messages. I could use Chrome just fine. Windows Explorer does the same thing. try to get to System and windows has to reboot.
 I thought I had a problem and went right to Online Help MS. paid 150.00 they found no problems but they told me within a few minutes of my call that I was in fact infected. And they'd fix it for 30 buck and guarantee it for a month or the 150 for a year. The
 first level of tech spent 4 days working the magic. It didn't fix it. they sent a note it was fixed. So I called back and the second level spent 2 days doing the complete over haul. Didn't fix it. They were both excellent in service quality in Manila.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where the problems started that I noticed. while updating the updates, I see a flag in the action center, one problem, it had been there for 2 years. It said my display adapter needed updating. So as dumb as I am, I followed the ati device driver
 update instructions more than carefully, (There only was a problem 2 years ago of my display had stopped working is all, I never seen it happen the one time it did.) I also clicked on AMD Gaming Evolved (so they'd automatically update the drivers, a huge mistake
 in my opinion. my screen changed in resolution like i was safe mode. I aborted the update. Then couldn't uninstall the update. There was a new Raptr Desktop app that did nothing. The records of updating anything was only 1 day after the AMD ATI thing. I couldn't
 restore back to anywhere except the 1 day after the update attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first level of tech successfully uninstalled Raptr Desktop app and AMD gaming evolved. The second level tech after fixing everthing reinstalled the same exact display stuff. In the same exact order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any body have any problems like that?</p>

            It wasn't $150.00 for "infections monitoring/protection.&nbsp; Who are you anyways Palcouk? Have you ever heard of Technical Support for a machine that's out of warrantee? They didn't want to charge me,&nbsp;I wanted a year of Tech access.&nbsp;I'll check out HP support

 So what does this mean to me? I know now why there's so many bootlegged pirated copies of windows. After all why pay for certified copy, that expires after a year for plain ol help. I'd never buy a Microsoft nor hp product ever again. Run this one into the

            <p>Thanks fateme, it's probably what happened. The pc sat for 6 months then there were 100 important updates to install, I hit the "install em all now" button. This day and age I'd think when such a large number of updates are scheduled that it'd run itself
 5 at a time, How would anyone really know that, unless they spent time fixing pc's more than running them.

<p><span><br />
Which version of windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
When you try to install Alawar games, there would be an option to permit the installation of optimizer pro speed guard. Try to uncheck the option and then proceed with the installation.<br />
If you do not see such option, then contact Alawar support and try to get a download link which does not install optimizer pro speed guard.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Overly hyped Registry Cleaners and System Optimizer are more likely to cause issues while fixing nothing.<br />
Those errors most likely don't even exist.<br />
<br />
Save your money and uninstall that program.<br />
<br />
If you have system issues ask in the Answers Windows Forums for your version of Windows.<br />

As the fonts are in daily use around the company this cannot be correct.&nbsp; Can anyone help resolve this issue as a matter of urgency.

<p><span>Hi MMSIM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What’s the
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are a few issues that you might encounter when installing fonts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you install a TrueType font with exactly the same name as a PostScript font on the same computer, Windows won't know which one to access, which could result in a font type
 being altered. To avoid this, don't install different types of fonts with the same name.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If a program is open when you install a font, the program might not register the font. Try closing and then reopening the program.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Some fonts require that you install two files in the same folder: A bitmap file for the on-screen font, and an outline file for the printer. If a bitmap file and an outline
 file are available for a particular font, make sure you install both files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Gokul<br />
The issue is specifically with the&nbsp;installing of the fonts into the Font folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To answer your questions:<br />
<br />
There are no similarly named fonts installed.<br />
There are no other programs open.<br />
All files are being loaded, we already use these fonts in XP.<br />
<br />
The error message reads:<br />
<br />
"Cannot install lte50019.ttf"<br />
"The file 'C:|Users\****\llte50019.ttf' does not appear to be a valid font."<br />
<br />
The message then repeats for all instances of TTF fonts being loaded.&nbsp; Have tested from different locations, as groups and as individual files, all with the same result.&nbsp; These fonts are in regular use throughout the company on Windows XP machines.<br />
<br />
The link you supplied refers to a similar problem in Vista, we are using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Any other help would be much appreciated as this is causing some major issues and uninstalling Windows 7 is my next option as production has plummeted for that user.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Mark</p>

<h2>            How do I know if the Surface 3 is fully charged when it is turned off and plugged in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since the charger light remains on while my Surface 3&nbsp;(Not Surface Pro 3) is fully charged and plugged in, how can I tell if it is done charging without turning on the Surface 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Dell Venue 8 Android tablet, it shows a battery icon on the screen if I press the power button and release.&nbsp; It does not do so on the Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also...4 hours is a bit long to recharge it, don't you think?)</p>

            <p>You cannot tell if it is fully charged other than by powering on and checking, sorry. 4 hours does not seem unreasonable for a full charge for the Surface 3.</p>
