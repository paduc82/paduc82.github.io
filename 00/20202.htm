    <title>Using SOLVER with &#34;countif&#34; constraint does not yield answers. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using SOLVER with &#34;countif&#34; constraint does not yield answers.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to create a "function" (for lack of a better term) in Excel that would solve a "game" as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game involves 25 cards organized into a, square, 5 by 5 matrix </li><li>The cards can take 1 of 4 values: 1, 2, 3, and "bomb" </li><li>The goal of this game is to flip all the number cards but not the bombs; it's "game over" if a bomb is flipped
</li><li>You get "coins" equal to the product of all the cards flipped - the game is won when all the 2 and 3 cards are flipped
</li><li>Since the game is organized as a 5 by 5 matrix, there will be five columns and five rows
</li><li>At the end of each column or row is two numbers: the first number tells the sum of all the value cards in the row or column, and the second number tells you the number of bombs in the column or row
</li><li>So the point of the game is to flip over all the 2 and 3 cards without flipping over a bomb card
</li><li>The game starts with all the cards flipped so you can't see the values, but at the ends of the columns and rows, the two numbers indicating the sum of cards and the number of bombs are available
</li><li>For example, if the number at the end of a column is 5/0, it means that the sum of the five cells in the column add to five, and there are no bombs in that column - which implies it's perfectly safe to turn over all the cards in the column and that all
 the cards will be 1 since the five cards add to 5 </li></ul>
<p>I have devised a way in Excel to solve this puzzle.&nbsp; Using Excel, I can set the bomb to be "0", and the values to be 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp; I would have a column finding the sum of the column/ row and another column (countif) finding the number of 0s (bombs).&nbsp; I
 would do the same for the rows.&nbsp; Then, I would use Solver to set the sum of the rows and columns to something defined, and set the number of bombs to be the number defined.&nbsp; Of course, there would also be the integer constraint and values &lt;=3 constraint.</p>
<p>The input variables in this would be 25 cards since I want to find out which ones are the 2s and 3s.</p>
<p>When I run solver, however, Solver is unable to find a solution.&nbsp; Solver DOES find a solution, however, if I only use the sum constraints - but the number of bomb constraints are violated, which means I still can't "solve" the game since I still don't know
 where the bombs are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix to my strategy or the way I'm using Solver to address this problem?&nbsp; Your help is much appreciated.</p>

    <title>unauthorized remote access. are the other devices on my network - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unauthorized remote access. are the other devices on my network safe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i noticed today that someone had gained remote access on my old laptop. I still used it for watching youtube etc but since noticing that someone had gained unauthorized remote access I have stopped using it all together. I've removed the battery and hard
 drive and its not going to be used anymore, ive been meaning to get a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ive also changed all my passwords and i didnt use that laptop for online banking or anything so im confident they didnt get any sensitive information. My main concern though is for the other laptops and things that my brothers use. Ive changed the password
 to the router but is there still a chance their devices may be at risk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not very tech savvy so im hoping im worrying about nothing.</p>
<p>

</em>Anyone with remote access to one device on a network, has remote access to all of them AFAIK. What about the device you're

<p>&nbsp;I think it may have been something i downloaded on my old laptop as i was looking for an older version of some software i wanted. However,&nbsp;im now using a PC that hasnt been turned on in months and so far i havent noticed anything suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pc has been scanned using AVG and no threats were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What steps should I take to make sure all the devices used on this network are safe?</p>

<p><strong>Edited to ask</strong>, what was the software you think was responsible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just keep a close eye on things for awhile. It'd also be a good idea if everyone else on the network change their passwords and keep them in a safe place off their devices. Perhaps write them down somewhere. Always make secure passwords, more than
 8 chars is better. Never use same pw's on more than one acct. Have them keep their personal data backed up somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, it'd be good to run a couple different scans on each device just to be sure. The best anti-malware app to date is
<strong>MalwareBytes'</strong>, but there's no longer a free version. <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MalwareBytes Free Trial</a> will revert to on-demand scanner after 14 days. Also scan with
<strong>Hitman Pro</strong>. This link will show "how to" on different platforms and provide d/l link.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: ignore the tech support scam reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-tech-support-scam-popups#windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-tech-support-scam-popups#windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure any Firewalls are ON. Run quick scans every few days with MBAM, and it would be good to run full scans once a wk. for a few, then every couple wks.&nbsp; MBAM will run alongside AVG with no issues, but you should not use more than one anti-malware app
 at a time for real-time protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps someone else will have further advice.</p>

<p><em>"Do you know if mobile devices such as phones may be at risk? We all have smart phones and ps4s etc."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know<em> how much </em>risk, but smart phones can get malware infections. I wouldn't think you'd need to be too concerned about those type of devices regarding remote access. That's just my thought on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install is always the best way to deal with these things, since you just don't know what may have been done. I didn't mention it, but I can tell you know a few things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing about installing software, always do a Custom install when possible. That way you can uncheck any unwanted apps that may be included. Don't use download sites, like download dot com. Go to the vendor's site. You can scan some downloads on Virus
 Total site, which includes multiple scanning engines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe share this link with your brothers. Good advice on how to help prevent issues.</p>

<p>Hi Winston,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response. The issue can be caused by various reasons. For example, several emails sent from the affected IP address were reported as spam.</p>
<p>To help delist the IP address quickly, we need to collect the following information:<br />
1. Some tenant information about the Office 365 &nbsp;recipient's tenant.<br />
2. The whole NDR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve sent you a private message to collect the detailed Office 365 tenant information and the whole NDR. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />

<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Sent items missing after update to Outlook.com account</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just changed my hotmail account to the new Outlook account and noticed that I am missing Sent emails, in the sent emails folder I can't see any emails sent before May 2006. The emails in my Inbox goes back to December 2002, but I think it should
 go back further.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the 'Recover deleted emails' function within Outlook mail (by going to deleted folder and clicking on the option in there) but all it has done is bring back all the recently deleted junk mail I got rid off but nothing else prior to 2012.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anybody else suffered this issue and if so how do I get all my emails back? I am quite annoyed that I have had to update to Outlook mail and have I have lost emails in the process :(&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand if you feel bad about losing some of your messages from the sent item folder. I checked the email address that you provided us and found out that you are also accessing your account on a mobile.&nbsp; Please note that if you have configured your
 emails on your phones using POP3, you might lose your emails too if you haven't chosen to leave a copy on the server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the auto-restore feature in Outlook,&nbsp;it will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your Deleted folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, I am sorry it means they're permanently lost.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this issue from happening again, please configure your account to not delete messages from Outlook. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Sign in to your&nbsp;account.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. In the upper-right of the Outlook window, click the Options icon (gear icon).</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. Click
<b>More mail settings.</b></font></span></p>
<p>4. Under <strong>Managing your account</strong>, click <strong>POP and deleting downloaded messages.</strong></p>
<p>5. Select <strong>Don't let another program delete messages from Outlook.</strong></p>
<p>6. Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I was able to clarify the issue to you. If you have more questions, this forum is always open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply, I have checked the setting you mentioned and I already have it set to "Don't let another program delete messages from Outlook" so do you think the sent emails could still have been deleted?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have also tried the auto restore option and none of the emails from the sent folder are retrieved. So are my old messages&nbsp;deleted permanently and there is nothing else that can be done? &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Encoded URL no longer opens a file in Word, Excel or PowerPoint online</h2>
                    <p>Even though I have forced the library to open files in browser, when I have an encoded URL (from an SPD workflow email), it only opens it in the fully functional Office app. This worked last week, or at least last month. What has changed? I cannot identify

            Hi LisaJo,<br />
<br />
To force the document to be opened in Office Online, please make sure you have done the following:<br />
<br />
1. Go to Site settings &gt; Site collection features &gt; make sure "Open Documents in Client Applications by Default" is NOT activated.<br />
<br />
2. Go to Library settings &gt; Advanced settings &gt; select "Use the server default (Open in the browser)" in "Opening Documents in the Browser".<br />
<br />
If the issue remains, may I confirm the following information?<br />
<br />
1. How did you create the encoded URL?<br />
2. Have you tried using the shared link? (In the library, select the document &gt; "Share" &gt; "Copy Link")?<br />
3. Can you provide an example of the encoded URL?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James

<p>I had already set 1 and 2 as you suggested which is why I am perplexed. It was working fine....before Ignite....and now it is not having made no changes. The URL was created via SPD workflow meaning it was a selection from the dropdown list for the library.
 So I didn't create it myself, just utilized that which was offered programmatically. Shared wouldn't do the trick since I am adding it to a notification email that is generated by the workflow processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And....no...Flow is not meeting the need at the moment. Maybe in the future it will and I will transfer the workflow actions to it as soon as possible but for right now SPD is still the better tool to arrive at my goal.</p>

<p>I have resolved my own problem with a bit of a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To date, the programmatically Encoded Absolute URL generated by SPD and used in a notification email which is part of an SPD workflow no longer opens the file in Office Online anymore as it did less than a month ago. However, by adding&nbsp;<strong><em>?web=1&nbsp;</em></strong>to
 the end of the encoded URL, it works perfectly. So, here's an illustration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In SPD</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">In the email as I created it using SPD, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ul>
<li>Using just the Encoded Absolute URL option it looks like this:</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">[%Current Item:Encoded Absolute URL%]</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Adding the extra code to it, it looks like this</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">[%Current Item:Encoded Absolute URL%]?web=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Then, what's the result in the actual email generated by the workflow and received in your Outlook inbox?
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ul>
<li>Using only the Encoded Absolute URL, the URL is&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">https://<em>tenantname</em>.sharepoint.com/sites/<em>sitename/libraryname</em>/Test%20Spreadsheet%202.xlsx</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">But that will only open the file in the full functional Office application (in this case Excel) no matter what settings I set for the library regarding opening in a browser or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>But with the addition of <strong><em>?web=1 </em></strong>at the end, the URL is</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">https://<em>tenantname</em>.sharepoint.com/sites/<em>sitename/libraryname</em>/Test%20Spreadsheet%202.xlsx?web=1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">And that makes it open in the browser for the Office application (Read only).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>
</p><p>It's not a fix; not sure why the Encoded Absolute URL provided by SPD no longer works, but it solved my problem so I could deliver the workflow to my customers.</p>

<p>Hi LisaJo,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the details. </p>
<p>It is expected that the Absolute URL of the file (https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename/libraryname/document.docx) will not be opened in Office Online. You can use your workaround above.<br />
<br />

            Shortly after posting this&nbsp; I had the malware return after connecting to a sports link. I shut down&nbsp; but on re-start the computer was unusable and I could only shut down by removing the power cable. Once again I returned the computer to an earlier image
 which has restored the system and the malware has disappeared.&nbsp; I think the links affecting me were veehd.com (film site) and a sports link from Cricktime. I have only found this problem whilst using the edge browser whish suggests it might be more vulnerable
 to attacks than other browsers.

<p>Typically if you select either the Cancel or "X" option in the upper right-hand corner to exit that Windows Security dialog, an additional checkbox option to not allow the site to open more of these will be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in testing this doesn't always appear to work, so I've&nbsp;most often found that pressing Alt-F4 in quick succession or holding these keys&nbsp;continually eventually results in an offer to close either the current or all tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that these browser hijacks are typically nothing more than an initial&nbsp;script executed by something within&nbsp;a website, which then copies a small html file containing the page[s] displayed into a local folder on the PC.&nbsp; Since this file is local it opens
 very fast and so is difficult to abort when it loops back to itself, making it appear to be something more malicious&nbsp;than it really is, which is simply annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though these attacks most often seem to&nbsp;happen with Edge, that's more a function of the default browser settings in Windows 10 and how they are launched via advertising or other ancillary functions of the websites where they're encountered.&nbsp; The attackers
 also&nbsp;target Edge since by default it restores the last page displayed after a crash if not cleared before opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these browser hijack attacks&nbsp;often come through advertising networks on popular sites now, I've chosen to block these using the Internet Explorer&nbsp;Tracking Protection&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Easy Privacy list which operates similar to the popular AdBlock extension.&nbsp;
 I believe that&nbsp;with Edge the AdBlock, AdBlockPlus and possibly other&nbsp;extensions are available to deal with these as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if a website is actually directly affected by one of these, the only option may be to avoid that site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether at some point Microsoft will find a way to disallow these popup attacks is uncertain, since for example the login dialog may be required by some commercial websites, it's not as easy as simply removing these completely.&nbsp; And since when Microsoft
 initially added the site blocking checkbox to the earlier modal dialog (white announcement) popups which came first, the attackers just added the more difficult to close&nbsp;Windows Security dialog to the mix, they'd likely simply switch to something even worse.</p>

<p>Thanks to both of you for those replies, the most rewarding aspect of them is that they reassure me that this malware is more irritating than dangerous. I shall certainly put your suggestions into practice if this fellow returns. I've had viruses on the
 computer many times in the past years but this was a different approach. Most often attempts to get access to my computer come by telephone out of India at a rate of 4-5 attempts&nbsp; a year.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Outlook, emails not copying to sent folder</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 newly installed this afternoon&nbsp;- using exchange mail through host provider with Outlook and I am not seeing sent emails copied to sent folder. I did follow previous questions and the box 'copy to sent folder' was/ is checked. Sent emails did appear
 for about an hour ealier today and now they are no longer being copied to this folder. I've sent at least 40 more email this afternoon - my emails are reaching their destinations.</p>
<p>My sent folder also reads "Sent Items [4041]" I do not have more than 200 emails in my sent folder box.&nbsp;4041 does not change when&nbsp;I delete email from my sent folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorites sent items reads&nbsp; "Sent Items [4041]" and under Outlook Data File, simply "Sent Items." both of these folders, when opened, show the&nbsp;same sent&nbsp;emails. &nbsp;</p>

            Ah... yes, Exchange, because its a server-based account, has its own sent folder. If you want one sent folder, you should deliver all mail to the exchange mailbox - otherwise, add the sent folders to the Favorites list so they are easy to access.

            <p>You'll see my posts on this issue in the thread Searching in the Mapping application seems broken (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpfeatures/searching-in-the-mapping-application-seems-broken/eeb24b51-952d-4814-8239-c217866d97fa">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpfeatures/searching-in-the-mapping-application-seems-broken/eeb24b51-952d-4814-8239-c217866d97fa</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p>I noticed the issue with my new 8X after upgrading from an HD7, where it worked fine.</p>
<p>It is compounded by the fact that as it is not recognising, if you search for somebodies address such as '20 Weald Road Milton Keynes mk8 0es' (Made up address), it takes you to Weald in Kent! Noticed this on a number of different addresses when clicking
 on people's addresses in the People app. Something which I did frequently on my old phone.</p>
<p>I have worked round it at present by searching for place names. Once you have the general location,&nbsp;zoom in and long press&nbsp;close to the real location of say a friend's house. At that point you have a flag set with a close post code. You can then favourite
 that. Unfortunately, you cannot edit the addresses in favourites so you stuck with this close location.</p>
<p>If you try the nokia web based mapping app or bing maps then postcodes work. So don't know what has happened in the translation process. Probably works on Nokia phones as well.</p>

            <p>I had a similar experience with my German language phone when starting maps from a contact in People Hub. Rather than jumping to the address a whole list of targets in the area came up.</p>
<p>My fix was to set the browser + search language in Settings -&gt; "Language + Region" to "English (United States)". Now it works as expected (leaving aside that the old WP7 maps UI rather than the Nokia maps UI comes up).</p>

            Yeah I dont know what is going on... I have now just downloaded the Gmaps app (Powered by google) this seems to be working fine. It understands what and where UK postcodes are and gives decent directions.
<div><br />
<div>Apparently Nokia drive will be coming to all WP8 phones, but Nokia are extremely vague on when the will be releasing to other manufacturers and how we will be able to download/use them. Hopefully this will be as good as the Nokia lumia phones...</div>
<div><br />
<div>But in the mean time I am gonna stick to Gmaps</div>

<p>Hi BadMemo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge, seems there is no out-of-the-box option to create a dashboard in SharePoint Online sites. So I would like to confirm the following information:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.How did you create your dashboard? Could you provide some reference regarding this? If it's convenient, please share some screenshots regarding the dashboard.</p>
<p>2.I check the default Apps in SharePoint Online site. Seems there is also no related Apps to connect to a dashboard. So what is the new app you mentioned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any concerns, feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Eli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a default dashboard and tried to re-shape it. I just found myself how to do the change and as always with most apps, in a very unnatural and unnecessary difficult way (in my view :D).</p>
<p>it seems that one have to create some kind of space and then add the app on those spaces.</p>
<p>I think I found out how to add apps to the spaces but not how to create one :) send you a screenshot of my latest accomplishment :)</p>

<p>Hi BadMemo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right. This is called web part in SharePoint Team Site,&nbsp;which are the building blocks of your page. We generally to use this to add the existing app like List or Library to let them display in the obvious place for your members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app layout is default and depends on the contents in it. What we can adjust is the page layout in current site page.</p>

<h2>            Planner App for Android on Intune managed device - unable to sign in &#39;Device not enrolled&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying out the new Planner App for Android. I'm trying to log in using my O365 account, I get prompted for MFA which I do, good so far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I get a message "Your device must be managed by &lt;company&gt; before you can use this application" with a link to enrol the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(the device is already enrolled through the company portal app and I'm using other MS apps just fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried this on two user accounts on 2 separate devices both with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on enrol just takes me to the play store to download the company portal app (which I already have).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried re-logging into the company portal as well as retiring the device from Intune and re-enrolling it. Exact same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            N9 wiped itself after 3 weeks use - help please&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone. First post here so apologies if I make mistakes :)<br />
I have been using my Australian bought Nokia N9 16 for 3 weeks (through Virgin Mobile). A few days ago, I noticed that I was receiving texts messages and the 2 line preview would come up on my home screen - however when I swiped the message across to the right
 to open it, there was nothing new in my inbox. People were definitely sending me messages.</p>
<p><br />
I thought I would switch the phone off then on again to see if the messages would show. Well, not only were the&nbsp; newly received messages not showing, but ALL of my inbox contents were cleared, as were my contacts, and all my photos &amp; videos of my children :(<br />
<br />
So I have questions: firstly, why would this have happened, and is it likely to happen again? And secondly, do I have any way of retrieving my photos, videos, messages, contacts?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice. (And if giving technical advice, can you please keep in simple as I am not very 'technology smart'! :smileyembarrassed: ).</p>

            thats strange! I guess it could be faulty unit<br />
About your seconds issue...first connect your n9 to pc using usb cable and select mass storage mode on N9 then double click on N9 and go to DCIM folder where you can find captured images and videos if that dont work then<br />
First download and install any free data recovery software from your pc using search engine then connect your n9 to pc using usb cable and select "mass storage mode" ...now open that installed data recovery software and select N9 to search for deleted files

<h2>            Contacts not showing on People tab</h2>
                    <p>I recently synced my Outlook contacts with iCloud so that my Outlook contacts would show up in the Contacts on my iPhone, which is great.&nbsp; Now, when I click on the 'People' tab in outlook, no contacts are shown, in fact it shows a duplicate of my Inbox from
 my Mail tab, just no folders are shown.&nbsp; Seems like a bug.&nbsp; But my contacts are all still showing up on my iPhone.&nbsp; How do I get my Outlook contacts to show up on the People tab again, so that I can add new/edit existing contacts in Outlook?&nbsp; Here's a screen
 shot of what it looks like when I'm on the People tab (see it highlighted at bottom) Using Outlook 2013, Windows 7.&nbsp; Don't use Outlook.com.&nbsp; Thanks, Katie</p>

<p>Yep, in the Folders List View, I do not have an iCloud folder.&nbsp; There's one for my @me.com email which I don't even use but there's no contacts associated/under this drop down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did just find all of my contact vCards in a Contacts folder in the Trash folder, while in Folders List View.&nbsp; I was able to drag them to a new Contacts folder, and then for that folder under Properties, Outlook Address Book, I clicked 'Show this folder
 as an Email Address Book', and all contacts were restored to now be visible under the People Tab.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what that means for my iPhone/iCloud syncing but at this point I don't really care.&nbsp; I have my outlook contacts back to add/edit.&nbsp; Thanks
 for your help.</p>

<h2>            A fix, we hope, for the Red X problem in 2013</h2>
                    Microsoft has just released an update that, among other things, is supposed to solve some (all?) of the Red-X problems we've been seeing.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>

Description of the PowerPoint 2013 update: October 8, 2013
</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2817625</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This update is only necessary if you have an MSI installer version of Office 2013. &nbsp;Generally MSI installer versions are only available to volume licensees. &nbsp;If you bought Office yourself, you almost certainly have a Click To Run (ie, not MSI) version
 of Office.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you have a Click To Run (C2R) version of Office, your copy of Office will be updated automatically at some point. &nbsp;We're waiting to hear when MS will roll out the change to C2R users, and of course if you don't have updates turned on, you won't get
 the update.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If in doubt about which version you have, visit the link above. &nbsp;It explains how to tell which version you have.</div>

<br />
I'm working on this issue for a few users as well.&nbsp; So far, while they can't open the files properly, they've been opening fine for me and I save them to be backwards compatible with PowerPoint 97-2003 (Save As)<br />
<br />
I'm waiting for a sampling of files from another user so I can attempt a batch conversion utility as it's impractical for them to send us files each time they have to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Thus far, users on 2007 and 2013 are affected.&nbsp; Can't recall if I've worked on anyone with 2010.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
(PS - I despise the 2013 interface)<br />

<p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to test in version 16.9.1 and the video plays normally on our end. Thus, to investigate the behavior you encountered, could you provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your OS version.</span></li><li><span>Do you click Insert&gt;Video&gt;Movie from File to insert the video?
</span></li><li><span>How do you play the video? In Normal view or the slide show?
</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether this behavior occurs with specific presentation/video/video type. You may create a new presentation and insert a new video.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zixuan</p>

    <title>Cortana breaks if JRiver Media Center takes exclusive control of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana breaks if JRiver Media Center takes exclusive control of default audio device</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure how else to record this to report it to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that if you are using JRiver Media Center, one option you have is, if you are using WASAPI, is to have JRiver take exclusive control over the audio hardware.
<br />
<br />
What happens is if you hit Start and start typing, nothing happens. If you try to click into the Cortana search box, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you close JRiver down, and click into the search box, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get Cortana back to a responsive state is to close JRiver and use the "Hey Cortana" question option, OR open Task Manager to kill the Cortana process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's "Easily" fixed by removing the exclusive control clause of JRiver's WASAPI properties, but I kind of like it as it makes it so OS sounds, and others,&nbsp;are blocked out of music playback.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post this on JRiver's site as well to see if there may be a different work around.</p>

<h2>            Activate Office 2010 without phone support</h2>
                    I had to get a new hard drive and reinstall Office 2010 on my laptop. I'm trying to activate it, but it won't take my product key, and you can't do it by phone. How do I activate my software? Thank you.<br />

<p>Hi Robbins</p>
<p>Thank you so much for these website.&nbsp; It really looks what i want. I haven't try it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, i have 2 questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This guide does not have the information about how to delete the paragraph from template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>example:&nbsp; User will select something which needs to reflect on document as such related paragraph will delete from user end document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. what about merge field instead of docvariable field. can we use and how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will appreciate if you provide me something more information about it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
