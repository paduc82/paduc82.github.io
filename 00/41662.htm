    <title>Poor wifi connection with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giacomojames  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor wifi connection with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have poor wifi connectivity in my home from my Surface Book. Clicking a link, I will regularly get the "Hmm, we can't reach this page" message, or sometimes one telling me that I'm not connected and the web's not the same without me. From the settings
 I can usually see that I'm connected. I then disconnect and reconnect, and after one or more attempts, I can reach the page. Sometimes I can reach it simply by opening a link in a new tab or cutting and pasting the URL. It's not just the browser (Edge) that
 struggles with the connection, but problems are less frequent with other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer came with Windows 10 installed, so it's not an upgrade issue. However, I did have the problem with a previous laptop once I'd upgraded it to Windows 10. I think the problem is with the computer rather than the internet provision, since other
 devices - Apple and PC laptops, and all makes of phones, including Windows 10 - can find wifi easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I use the computer elsewhere, it generally works fine. I have checked with my broadband supplier, who has advised me that they are not aware of any problems with Windows 10 and the router (technicolor tg582n). I haven't tried testing it with
 an ethernet cable, partly because of the expense of buying a cable and adapter just for diagnostic reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be really grateful for any thoughts or advice.</p>

            Just to say that the problem has been resolved.&nbsp;I contacted my&nbsp;broadband provider again and they accepted that the router was either old or faulty,&nbsp;and sent a new one. The whole thing works perfectly now.

<h2>            FRAUD CHARGES BY EPIC GAMES NOT HACKERS</h2>
                    
<p>I am being continuously fraudulent charged by Epic Games. When looking under billing in my account, it states. I've made zero transaction an 0 purchases. However, they continue to drain my Microsoft account whether it's from credit card or balance of Microsoft
 gift cards. And then Will not help? They will not contact. Will not respond? And their contact us does not work. Microsoft denies the help. I just wanted to put the word out there.
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> And let the company know that all 9 credit card on the account will be. Process under fraudulent charge. And I will get every penny I've ever spent and not spent back. This month. Which is spread across 5 different Xboxs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Mod
 Removed]</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FORTNITE IS THE ISSUE. BUT MICROSOFT STANDS BEHIND IT</p>

<p>Just so I am understanding you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign into your account at account.microsoft.com and look at your order history it shows that there has never been and purchases made? but there is charges on your bank statement showing otherwise?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are signed into the same account on the website as you use on your xbox?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are charges on your credit/debit card and they are not showing up on your account when you go to account.microsoft.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you will want to make sure you are signed into the same account on the site that you are signed into on your console because it should be showing something if you have made purchases on that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second if it is not you can contact xbox support by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us they can do a search with your credit/debit card number and find any account that has that card actively on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately unless they can verify ownership of the account the ONLY thing they would be able to do is remove the card from the account they would not even be able to see what the email address for the account is without verifying ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you would need to talk to your bank about getting a refund for the fraudulent charges.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It appears that the ability to do that has been disabled in Win 7 and Win 8...I wasn't happy either.</p>
<p>I lucked out and found this website that discusses the issue, and near the bottom of the page, provides a link to download a RegEdit batch file to restore this ability under most conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using it ever since Win 7 came out, and I am using it on Win 8 Pro now.</p>

    <title>Under 400gb of storage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unreal warfare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Under 400gb of storage&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>From what I am currently reading (I cannot link to it from here, as it involves stuff people aren't allowed to do here folks, sorry. Go look on Kotaku) the Xbox One only has 391gb of storage space. The rest of the space is partitioned as follows:<br />
<br />
<em>Temp Content</em>: 44 GB capacity, 27.1GB available (in an Xbox that we never turned on).<br />
<em>User Content</em>: 391.9 GB capacity, none used.<br />
<em>System Support</em>: 42.9 GB capacity, 34.1 GB available.<br />
<em>System Update</em>: 12.8 GB capacity, 11.8 GB available.<br />
<em>System Update</em> 2: 7.52 GB capacity, 7.47 GB available.<br />
<br />
If this is indeed true&nbsp;then under 400gb storage is just not acceptable.</p>

<p>Never was going to be a problem for me.....I can't even get close to filling my xbox360 250GB HD.....I know next gen games are larger, but I must not be a true gamer because I don't buy hundreds of games....just don't have enough time in the year to play
 that many "shrugs".</p>

<p>This is about the only thing I would of liked too. If I'd of had a choice to change one thing about the console when it was announced I would of said a bigger hdd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;still can't wait to get My hands on the console in the morning though, I am so excited at the moment.</p>

<p>Well the difference with the 20gb is that we didn't have to install our games on the Xbox 360. Now it's mandatory, so once people start buying DLC that space is going to fill up quick.</p>

<p>I have a feeling the storage will be an issue this gen for a lot of gamers. Sure, you won't run into issues if you only have a few games you regularly play even though games are getting a lot bigger in size, but when you're like me and you've got a lot of
 games you're actively playing during just one week, the little under 400GB fills up real quick. External harddrives will certianly be a saviour this gen.</p>

Shame Microsoft don't allow an upgrade of the&nbsp;internal hard drive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems installing programs, nothing happens</h2>
                    I am running WINDOWS XP SP3.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I download a zipped file (*.zip) from the internet for a new program. I will unzip it &nbsp;and typically find a setup file to install a program. I then execute the program and the new program is installed(?). When I then try and execute the installed program,
 the program never executes. Later when I try and shut down the computer, the system tries to &nbsp;close down manually a file called something like " InnoSetupLdrWindow" &nbsp;and fails. The computer then will not shut down using the regular shutdown routine and I must
 cut off power to shut down the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Typically if I run everything on my WIN98 computer everything works. I have even been successfull just copy the installed program from the WIN98 computer to the WIN XP computer and everything works which has surprised me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem appears to have only started in the last few days.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I use Google to search on "InnoSetupLdrWindow", I find &nbsp;a company which sells an installer. I suspect that there is something wrong with my computer software or registry which is not permitting the installer to work correctly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All help is appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The major change was upgradind to WIN XP PRO-SP3. however i have been reinstalling old programs after a hard disc crash and a backup that did not work.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, if I do not try to install the programs that cause the problem, everything seems to work</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;fine.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I hesitate to use a "clean boot" because as I understand it, a "clean boot" &nbsp;will destoy all my restore points. I would prefer to restore to right after SP3 was installed.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I also hesitate to restore back to SP2 since I do not know if that will work.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi BobMaloney,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot procedure does not remove any system restore point unless you turn off the system restore service.</span></p>
<p><span>The Clean boot procedure is performed only to check if any third party program or services installed on the computer is causing
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you first read the complete article on clean boot procedure and later try the method mentioned in the previous
 post for clean boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried soft reset, I've tried removing the battery, I've confirmed on free (home) Wi-Fi, plugged in with battery saver turned off.&nbsp; I've tried turning on airplane mode and just using Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Short of doing a hard reset, I have no idea what else to do.</p>

            <p>To make sure that updates to your device go smoothly, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Charge your battery</strong>. Make sure your device is fully charged before you update. If it's not, you may need to plug it in and wait before you can finish installing the update.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Connect to Wi‑Fi</strong>. You'll download updates more quickly when connected to Wi‑Fi. If you need to download updates using a cellular data connection, make sure it shows 3G, 4G, or LTE. If you have a 2G or 2.5G (EDGE) connection, you'll be prompted
 for updates but won't be able to download them until you have a faster cellular data connection or connect to Wi‑Fi.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Free up space</strong>. If you don't have enough space on your device to update it, remove some files you can no longer need.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Try again</strong>. If you're getting an error, wait a bit and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Restart your device</strong>. If your device freezes during an updates, restart it to get your update back on track.
</p>
</li></ul>

            <p>I am having the same issue with my phone.</p>
<p>It's been like this for about three days now,updates download stuck at 0% and will not move from there. Occasionally,it will come up saying that "connection is on roaming mode" (which is not true) and that download will be resumed shortly. Also, at times
 the "download" button comes up prompting to start the process,but the result is always the same. Needless to say,battery gets drained very fast,plugging the phone to the wall charger will not help. Not even doing a soft reset/taking off battery was useful.
 Also have problems updating apps on the Store. should I take the phone in for assistance - again?? Had the same problem no more than 2-3 months ago. It's a pity because all in all the phone works quite ok (Lumia 550)</p>

            <p>In addition to the above steps outlined by PA Bear, can you try something for me? Go to Store, tap Downloads and Updates, and cancel all pending app updates. Keep the phone plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi, so we can see how the OS software update download
 progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be wondering: "<em>Mike, why would I do that?</em>" We're going to try this as the Store's update mechanism and the OS software update mechanism use the same background service. However unlikely it seems, it might be these two are getting in one
 another's way thereby causing the persistent download. So, as a test, let's see what happens if you clear the queue from Store and let the OS software update go on its own.&nbsp;</p>

Hi, 



Has anyone figured out a solution for this problem?  It has been a week and while Outlook and messaging has started working again I cannot download this update on my Lumia 950. My phone is no longer burning up the battery ina couple of hours but  Is there some manual trigger for the update?  I have returned one 950 already because of software issues and I have hard restarted it and lost everything a coupe of months ago.  It seems like these phones **** out software wise about once a quarter.  Very disappointed with this phone and liked my 925 better as it was much more reliable.

<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue with a Lumia 950 XL....download stuck at 0%, battery draining in an hour, superhot, phone randomly shuts down. I am stumped. &nbsp;I had this same problem about 3 months ago with the last big OS update and had to do a full reset/refresh,
 which I would really like to avoid this time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cancelled all Store updates, so there shouldn't be any competition in the queue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried Wifi and LTE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have shut off all background tasks and tile updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have down soft reset (volume+power down).</p>
<p>I haver removed the battery</p>
<p>I have removed the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Probleme mit Lastschrift beim Kauf von Gold Mitgliedschaft</h2>
                    
<p>Servus Leute,</p>

<p>Ich hab folgendes Problem:</p>
<p>Hab vor einem Monat die automatische Verlängerung des Gold-Abos abgestellt, und wollte heute wieder Gold holen. Es läuft jetzt allerdings über ein anderes Konto.</p>
<p>Ich habe die Daten auf der Xbox eingetragen, und wollte auch direkt schon von da aus die Gold-Mitgliedschaft kaufen. Ich kam bis zum Fenster, wo man gefragt wird ob man 1, 3 oder 12 Monate haben will. Ich wählte 1 Monat, wurde dann weiter zum "Kauf bestätigen"-Fenster
 geleitet &gt; bestätigte den Kauf &gt; wurde zurück in das Fenster geworfen, wo ich die Anzahl der Monate auswählen soll.</p>
<p>Habe es nun ein paar Mal versucht, es passiert immer wieder das selbe.</p>
<p>Wollte nun auf der Xbox Seite meine Konto-Daten checken. Es ist keine "gültige" Zahlungsoption eingetragen. (Nämlich garkeine)</p>
<p>Das Problem ist nun, dass ich NUR entweder <strong>PayPal</strong> oder <strong>
Kreditkarte</strong> auswählen kann, wenn ich eine neue Zahlungsmethode hinzufügen will.</p>
<p>Lastschrit ist in den Optionen nicht mehr vorhanden.</p>
<p>Weiß jemand von euch bescheid, oder komme ich um einen Anruf beim Support nicht mehr rum?</p>
<p>Danke im Voraus!</p>

                </div>

<p>Danke für die Antwort schonmal, </p>
<p>@cRaZyLIZARD76:</p>
<p>Das habe ich davor schon einmal versucht. Es scheint so, als wären die Daten, die ich dort eingebe nicht mit meinem Xbox Live account/ meiner Xbox synchronisiert. Warum auch immer.
</p>
<p>@IMorrocI:</p>
<p>Gilt das auch für die Xbox Live Gold Pre-paid cards? Also die mit 3, 6, 12 Monaten? Oder bezieht sich das nur auf die Xbox Live Gold-Testmitgliedschaften?
</p>
<p>Ich würde denen ja gültige Zahlungsinformation geben, aber wie gesagt, auf der Xbox Seite habe ich nur PayPal oder Kreditkarte als Option. Lastschrift ist nicht vorhanden</p>
<p>@weidhas:</p>
<p>Hättest du eine Vermutung, was da nicht stimmen könnte? Ich habe im Grunde nichts außer dem Konto selbst geändert.

<p>Kein Problem, die Vermutung hatte ich auch schon. Ist eine berechtigte Annahme bei solchen Problemen.
</p>
<p>Ich habe schon bei dieser Microsoft Payment Hub Seite die letzten Transaktionen geprüft, da ist jeweils ein grünes Häkchen dran, die sind also beglichen.
</p>
<p>EInen Fehlercode hat mir die Box ein einziges Mal rausgespuckt, nach dem ich dann suchte, aber nichts fand. Ich weiß den Code leider nicht mehr, er wird auch nicht mehr angezeigt.</p>

<p>Ich hab gerade beim Support angerufen, und alles wurde durchgecheckt, was von meiner Seite kam.
</p>
<p>Es handelt sich anscheinend um einen Bug, da mit meinen Konto-Daten alles stimmt und alle Transaktionen sauber abgelaufen sind. Das Problem wird weitergereicht und geklärt, aber die einzige spontane Lösung ist jetzt, dass ich mir über Amazon, etc, einen
 Code (für 3 Monate, etc.) holen muss. Ist auch kein großes Problem, da das auch über Lastschrift geht.</p>
<p>Allerdings mache ich mir sorgen, was die Code-Eingabe betrifft, da die zwei Codes für 2 Tage bzw. 14 Tage, die ich gestern einlöste, in dem "Ihre Mitgliedschaften"-Fenster ausgegraut sind.

<h2>            Wlan cuts randomly, WLAN-AutoConfig cannot be found</h2>
                    <p>I have a Acer Aspire One A0722 which has a Broadcom 802.11n Network adapter. Recently I upgraded my Windows 7 64bit to Windows 10 and ever since my wlan cuts randomly, multiple times during a day. Everything worked okay when I used Windows 7 so I'm suspecting
 some kind of driver compatibility issue, I use v. 6.30.223.256 drivers with my network adapter, I haven't tried the older 5..something drivers. My wlan uses WPA2-Personal to secure my wlan.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mail app receiving but not sending email from Yahoo account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antschmitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail app receiving but not sending email from Yahoo account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I use the mail app on w8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two accounts running through it - windows live mail and yahoo mail. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently also had the yahoo mail app but&nbsp;uninstalled it after experiencing duplicated emails due to also setting up the two accounts in live.com. I&nbsp;set up the two accounts&nbsp;online at&nbsp;live.com&nbsp;to get the outlook desktop app to sync my facebook contacts and
 fill my address book, which worked.&nbsp;However, a side effect of this was that&nbsp;emails from the yahoo account were then duplicated into the online live.com account and subsequently duplicated into the outlook desktop app. To correct this, I removed the yahoo account
 from both the online live.com and the outlook desktop app. Deciding to try and keep everything as simple as possible, I then uninstalled the yahoo mail app for w8&nbsp;to just run everything through the mail app for w8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my mail now runs through the mail app in w8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can send and receive&nbsp;mail from the live.com account.</p>
<p>I can receive but not send from the yahoo account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked in the mail app's account settings for the yahoo account and noticed that the password is too short. I am trying to correct this problem by retyping the password but my changes won't save in the app. Every time I close the settings dialogue
 box and then go back in to it to check that the new password has been applied, I find the old too-short password is still present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure that the password is the problem as presumably a wrong password would also prevent yahoo mail from being received in the mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how I can resolve this please?</p>

<p>Some accounts can’t be added because they use POP (Post Office Protocol). For more info, see

            <p>Hello Antschmitt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understands you are able to receive your email but are not able to send with your Yahoo account. If your Yahoo account is setup to use the same password to send and receive then the password is not likely the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever been able to send email with your Yahoo account in the mail app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked your SMTP server settings in Mail vs. the&nbsp;SMTP server requirements from Yahoo?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Keep the monitor button pressed for about 30 seconds and then restart the computer and then check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue occurs again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2. Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3. Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />

<br />
computer.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;press F8.<br />
3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Enable low-resolution video (640×480), and then press Enter.<br />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ced6dbec-75ce-48bc-aaae-fa123431a097" title="barbiejazzy">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 1:</strong> <em>I am adult and didn't realize that I selected a wrong birth's year. Tried to change but it was not allowed. Kept getting the error page to contact a customer support.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>If you are located inside the<strong> US or Korea</strong>, you need to provide either a
<strong>proof of age via FAX </strong>or a <strong>US credit card </strong>to access your Skype account again. You may refer to this link for the additional information:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/microsoft-account-change-birthdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Change the birthdate on your Microsoft account</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you are located outside of these two countries, you should be able to edit the
<strong>date of birth&nbsp;</strong>on Microsoft website. Here's how:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to this <strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">link</span></a></strong> using your Skype credentials.</li><li>Once signed in, click "<strong>Your info</strong>".</li><li>Select "<strong>Edit your personal info</strong>".</li><li>Make the changes then hit <strong>Save.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 2: </strong><em>What should I do to setup a new account? Seem like my email and my phone number is already setup as a new account but can't login without parental consent.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> If your existing email address and phone number were already used to create a Skype account, it is no longer possible to use them to create a new Skype account. You can create new Skype account with the information listed below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use another email address</li><li>Create a new&nbsp;Microsoft account (<em>can use to access Skype automatically</em>)</li><li>Use a different phone number</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Can I just delete the account without logging in and start over????&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Unfortunately, it is not possible to delete a Skype account without signing in to it. Since the primary requirement in account deletion is the account access. You may check this support link for additional information:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=Close+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 3:</strong> <em>Having a Live chat customer support is better than no support.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Actually, we do have a&nbsp;Live chat support available. You can contact them for any
<em>billing-related </em>concern. In addition to that, for <em>general and technical concerns</em>, we have the Community forum for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

<h2>            All the people complaining about no backward compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I have posted this in a few threads and I will post it in a new thread I am making to try and explain why there isn't backwards compatibility&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Backwards compatibility is actually quite hard to do between xbox one and the xbox 360 and even the ps3 and ps4... the ps4 and xbox one ( at least from what I read ) use the x86 architecture and the xbox 360 and Ps3 uses the power pc architecture. The power
 PC architecture is similar what macs used before they went to intel based chips ( Which are the x86 architecture chip). This is great simply because now it will be a lot easier to port games between pc, ps4 and xbox one so all game should somewhat look on
 par between ps4 and xbox one ( obviously pc games will always trump because you can upgrade gpu's )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar reason why the Xbox 360 had limited backwards compatibility with the xbox 1 games because it used a NVidia GPU while the xbox 360 has an&nbsp;ATI ( AMD) gpu in it and basically the original xbox was basically a PC in a box" and the xbox 360 is the equivalent
 to the old macs running power pc cpu's</p>

            <p>Yep, it's pretty easy to understand when you think about it. They also said multiple times today what you just said, it's just people don't like to listen, they hear what they want to hear. Anyways, I don't see the big deal? Was everyone going to be selling their 360s? If so, the market would be flooded with second hand units, meaning you would all get like $20 for your console. Keep your 360, keep it plugged in, continue to play your games. Then, when you want the new experience and new games, power up your Xbox One. It's that simple really :P.</p>

<p>It seems as though PS4 might be getting Gaikai to offer BC support for PSX, 2 and 3 titles, at least some dev group is working hard on it. I wonder if One will be getting such a feature since Gaikai is cloud based and One seems to be heavily cloud focused

<p><span>Your thinking inside of the box. I may not know much. But I do know that software powers the hardware. Couldnt they program it to read and run 360 games. Or program the console to scan the user&nbsp;accounts achievements to figure
 out what games they bought for the 360. Offer those games for free only once thru a download. And have programed the games to run on the new software. Its all just ones and zeros. Re programming. Alot of people will end up not buying over this and could bankrupt
 Microsoft if they dont make enough money back off of the console the spent millions making. I know because I deal with marketing in my job.</span></p>

<p>Gaikai is owned by sony so they been planning to use it for that reason... and MS never outright said no to BC. just said it wasn't in the plans but since this console will be more interactive with the cloud it is possible down the line</p>

<p>Here is another Quote now about Sony and why&nbsp; it doesn't do it hardware wise</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Reported by <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2013/04/sony_thought_long_and_hard_over_ps4s_lack_of_backward_compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PushSquare</a> yesterday, Sony Revealed that they actually had a lengthy decision process behind the implementation of backwards compatibility with the PS4. “We struggled with this point. We decided to focus on the ‘positive aspects’ of switching to X86. If
 a different architecture had been selected, it probably would have been even more problematic. The X86 architecture is well known and development is relatively easy.”</p>

<p>Switching to the x86 architecture will allow many new possibilities, but this comes at the cost of eliminating backwards compatibility for the PS4. “Using this opportunity, we decided to stop going down this path, and, as Mark said, to focus our efforts
 on simplifying developer efforts.”</p>

<p>actually people have already flooded into used game places selling off their old consoles one place here locally has 40 360's ( 15 are slims) and 20 ps3's, so yeah there are a lot selling the old to get the new. &nbsp;personally i wont be getting a new console
 i honestly don't care for the whole entertainment center in a box thing, i want a GAME console not a box that just replaces the devices i already have.</p>

<p><span>Microsoft already did this with the 360. They claimed it wasnt backwards compatable. Enough people complained and it got fixed. Sure u get sighned out of Live when u play them. But xbox origional games can be played. Theres
 even a few of those on the market place. If Microsoft put the effort into it. It could be done. I didnt say it would be the easiest thing. But someone with enough knowledge could do it. Something only becomes impossible when u think it is. Instead of working
 towards a solution to the problem u defeat urself by saying it cant be done. If everyone thought like u. We wouldnt have any of the&nbsp;technology we have now. We wouldnt have achieved any of the scientific discoveries we have, and&nbsp;everone would still believe
 the world to be flat. Dont be so negative towards people posts. I was just speaking my mind.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are a lot of possible reasons why your file is not opening properly. If your media player doesn't support the file, its either in a bad format or your media player can't play the file. Try these suggestions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Use a different media player that supports MP4 files</span></p>
<p><span>2. If it is possible, try to obtain a new copy of that file or&nbsp;new copy of that file in uncompressed format</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if you still encounter the same issue after trying the suggestions I provided.</span></p>

            <p>I will always support Dragon's Dogma, absolutely love the game and so close to my heart. As others have mentioned here, there is a 'remastered' version on Xbox One, that Capcom are focusing on for the near future. Please note, that the servers for the 360 versions have been shut down.</p><p><br /></p><p>Best,</p><p><br /></p><p>L</p>

            <p>I still say there is a chance for the game to become backwards compatible, simply stated because there are games that were already present on the Xbox One but were released as backwards compatible titles. Call of Duty:&nbsp;Ghosts and Assassin's&nbsp;Creed IV:&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Flag both have had this treatment..</p><p><br /></p><p>In terms of Remastered or "Enhanced" games and backwards compatibility, Darksiders I and II along with Castle Crashers have enhanced Xbox One versions but still made their way to backwards compatibility. So there's always a chance.<br /></p>

<h2>            I can see the other computer on the network but cannot connect to it &#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I feel like I have tried everything.</p>
<p>Both computers are fairly new, I was able to connect to this one before we had to replace the hard drive and completely reinstall everything. I tried remote access using the IP address, made sure remote access was enabled, that did not work either</p>
<p>Both are set to private network, both under 'windows firewall advanced settings' have inbound connections allowed. They both have the same version of McCafee, I disabled the firewall on the other computer just to see. I can get Drew's computer to connect
 to mine, but I cannot connect to his. I can ping his computer, don't know if that helps at all. Microsoft phone support is essentially useless in assisting, can anyone help?</p>
