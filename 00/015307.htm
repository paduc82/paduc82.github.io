<p>No this is not a tricky problem !!!! <br />
<br />
Could the SDET simply perform closed system testing with a few major reported sites..... say just&nbsp;between IE8 &amp; facebook ????<br />
<br />
Clearly something - 'additional functionality' ahem.. perhaps you call them 'enhancements' have been made to IE8 such that Facebook, Xanga, even MSNBC (yes... collaboration between NBC/MSFT) does not retain presets/login information .... either in how the browser
 handles cookies or authenicated sessions/store passwords/&lt;whatever&gt;<br />
<br />
As has been reported by MANY MANY MANY users in the other forum you mention ... this issue was raised&nbsp;up very early on ... and NO resolution or solution has been given (last post was 23 hrs ago - at the time of this post)<br />
<br />
Look, all software is made by humans ... and my industry (supply chain) has its fair share of bugs... but when users raise flags... they are addressed promptly... and not given runaround or excuses. Simply put; as many have said - IE8 is NOT NOT NOT retaining/authenicating/&lt;###&gt;
 user passwords/settings.... and we&nbsp;have recommending our clients against upgrading to it or simply accept annoyances &lt;DAILY&gt; in dealing with their intranet portal applications<br />
<br />
I trust there sufficient brain power within MSFT to view this as critical. You guys do make some great products (i.e Office) ... and really if this was an office issue... your corporate customers would be getting your FULL attention ....</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I also have some sites that will not accept my signon. I have "log ins" on my Norton... I deleted the automatic sign on for this sites thinking this was the problem... it wasn't.<br />
<br />
Everything worked fine a couple weeks ago. I had to take my computer in for warranty work to replace two USB ports. Afterwards, the computer date was set wrong... I fixed that today (I had bad certificates because of the date but that problem's been solved).
 Could they have changed something to work on the system. I have reset everything back to default.<br />
<br />
My Juno email works fine. Yahoo email signs right in. Discover works ... Hotmail took 2 times of entering the email / password but works right at this moment.<br />
<br />
Ebates.com does not work, Chase bank doesn't work...&nbsp; both keep just cycling between the logons? Both I have added the site to "Always Allow", but I just have the "base" address, such as www.ebates.com.<br />
<br />
Any ideas to fix these sites. Right now it seems just to be a couple sites, but I haven't visited everything since I found this problem. Also I have deleted all the cookies, history, temp internet files (including the "favorite" cookies).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.

            I just uninstalled IE 8 and went back to 7...no problems with this issue in 7. Hopefully someone will get this fixed, at which point I will go back to IE8

            It took 3 page reloads just to reply???&nbsp; I can't blame the browser for this (Firefox).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But as far as IE8 goes, this is such BS--I wouldn't be using IE if I didn't have to use it to view 2 sites--out of 100's I visit every day!!!!<br />
<br />
A tricky problem?&nbsp; Firefox does not have this problem--EVER.&nbsp; What planet do you live on?<br />
<br />
IE is overly ambitious which leads to security issues which keeps people paid out of Remond Washington employed and folks like me wondering why do I have to use it?&nbsp; My response will be to lobby those TWO SITES (CNBC is one) to fix their content so as to avoid
 ALL OF THIS ____.<br />

            Yeah I am at my limit now. I have tried everything I can think of and even tried some things I have read that worked for other users but my cookies keep disappearing and I don't know what else to do except go back to Firefox again. I came back to IE because&nbsp;IE8
 finally had everything I was looking for that FF had and now I am tired of having to relog into every web page every day. I&nbsp;am giving it one more&nbsp;chance and if I have to relog again then I will switch until MS fixes this issue since I know it isn't just me
 having this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
The article wasn't specifically just about Cookies.&nbsp; Unfortunately it also didn't mention any particular OS.&nbsp; But I think that both Vista and W7 are affected by the decision to split Cookies into&nbsp;normal and Low groups.&nbsp; Added to that is the fact that the TIF
 Viewer is now much less useful for managing them in those OS.&nbsp; More security/obscurity IMO which just impedes usability more than anything.<br />
<br />
FWIW I have been using a cmd window or an Explorer window instead of the TIF Viewer to manage Cookies and usually am eventually able to get them to persist after working on them that way.&nbsp; I think the problem is typically a problem caused by the site that then
 gets exacerbated by the new extreme lack of usability in the new implementation.<br />

            I ended up at this post after searching half an hour for the right information. Allthough I thought this still would not help me, it did.<br />
My problem was that IE8 would not remember my new password for some page I needed to login to. It would keep my old password and today it annoyed me so much that I needed to fix it.<br />
After doing the "<strong>Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Internet Options</strong> &gt; <strong>
Content </strong>&gt;<strong> Autocomplete</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> and checking the
<strong>User names and passwords on forms</strong> and <strong>Ask me before saving passwords</strong> checkboxes." thingy it finally gave me the prompt that the entered password did not match the password IE8 had previously saved and if it should save the
 new password or not.<br />
The only thing I changed was check the "Ask me before saving passwords", everything else was set correctly. But still it is weird that IE8 did not give me any oppertunity anytime sooner to fix this problem...

    <title>Missing Outlook Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniellelinden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Outlook Folders</h2>
                    <p>I often save emails to folders on the left side of the Outlook email page that are alphabetized A through Z but there are two sets of folders alphabetized A through Z. I do not know if one set is an old set I may have brought with me when I switched to Outlook
 or not but sometimes, when I open my emails the second set of folders are not in the drop down on the left &amp; I do not know how to get them back. I know they still exist because if I try to open a new folder with the same name as the "missing folder" I will
 get a pop up with a warning that the folder already exists. I need to know how to restore the second set of folders to the drop down on the left side of my email page.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance!!</p>

            Hi Danielle,
<br />To confirm,  you are using Outlook.com on the web, correct? 
<br />
<br />If you clear the browser cache or log into using a private browser session, do you see all of your folders? 
<br />Are the folders a subfolder of another folder?

<p>For example, column <em>A</em> might say 01/01/2001, and column <em>D </em>might say 01/01/2014. What I want is to report&nbsp;on this employee&nbsp;for the period of September 1st 2012 to August 31st 2013, with a change date of January 1st 2013, so the entries in
 columns <em>A</em> and <em>D </em>would need to change accordingly (if <em>A</em> &lt; 01/09/12, change it to 01/09/12, and if
<em>D</em> &gt; 31/08/13, change it to 31/08/13). Column <em>B</em> would need to show the day before the change date, and column
<em>C</em> would need to show the actual change date. This looks as follows (English date format dd/mm/yyyy):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Before</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</p>
<p>01/01/2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;01/01/2014</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>After</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</p>
<p>01/09/2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31/12/2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01/01/2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31/08/2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess the tough part is that if the employee commenced employment during this period of time, it needs to reflect this. So if the employee started work on 01/04/2013, it would look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01/04/2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31/08/2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>A</em> and <em>B</em> would be blank as there was no employment in this period</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if the employee left employment during this period of time, it would do the same. If the employee left on 30/11/2012, it would look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</p>
<p>01/09/2012&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30/11/2012</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>C</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>D</em> would be blank as there was no employment in this period</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this? I appreciate it might be time consuming!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Let me recap a rule or two in more general terms.&nbsp; You've spoken of dates in terms of absolutes, especially years, and I'm wondering if that's always the case, so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person enters a Change Date (which will be applied to all rows)</p>
<p>The 'report period' would initially be set up to be</p>
<p>The date of September 1st just prior to the Change Date</p>
<p>[that is, if the Change Date is 1/4/2013 the start date would become 1/9/12, and</p>
<p>if Change Date were 1/12/2013 then the start date would become 1/9/13]</p>
<p>and same logic would apply to the revised ending date: it would become August 31 following the determined new start date.</p>
<p>So for a change date of 1/4/2013&nbsp; the report period is 1/9/12 - 31/8/13</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>for a change date of 1/12/2013 the report period would be 1/9/13 - 31/8/14</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that 31/8/14 is in the future, but I'm just using it as example to<strong> verify that the reporting period dates are relative to the year of the Change Date and are always from September through August for the 12-month period.&nbsp;
</strong>That is before we start looking at all the other exceptions.</p>

    <title>Cross-Referencing Two Tables in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marialabat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross-Referencing Two Tables in Access 2010</h2>
                    I have two tables that I am currently working with: Table A contains all of my company's product data, including freight class, which is the information that I am interested in, while Table B contains a list of products that one of our dealers carries
 and asks for the freight class of each product. Is it possible to cross-reference these tables so that the freight class from Table A will appear in the "Freight Class" column on Table B?

            <p>If you can "relate" your tables, then you can create a query that will pull data from both tables. For example, if TableA contains a column named "ProductID" which contains the Product Number for your products, and TableB contains a field that contains the
 same value, then you could create a query with a Join:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT * FROM TableA INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.ProductID=TableB.ProductNumber</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would show you all data from both tables where the values in those two fields are the same. You could then pare down the columns to show only the items you need.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Note an Inner Join will NOT show any records from either table where there is no match - so if you have a record in TableB that does not match any record in TableA, that record would not be included in the query's output. If you need that sort of information,
 you can use a LEFT or RIGHT Join.</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, the products that this dealer carries, can then be carried by any other dealers? Second, do you need to record anything else about these particular products other than what's in your products table?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the principles of a relational database is that data should exist in one table and one table only. So if the freight class already exists in your products table it should NOT exist in Table B.&nbsp;</p>

            Yesterday morning, before it stopped receiving, I got a message that said I could not send an email because "You must check for new mail before sending mail.<br />
<br />
I removed and re-added the account. Then,I was able to receive emails. When I tried to send an email a few moments ago, I got the message again. I posted it here but removed the name of the intended recipient for their privacy.<br />

I noticed online that this is a recurring problem with Outlook 2013. Is there a patch being worked on? An unreliable email program is worse than no program at all.<br />

<h2>            if i upgrade to windows 10 on my phone, will it still be compatible with my computer running on windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    My computer runs On windows 8, and I tried to upgrade to 10, but nothing was working properly after that and it was really frustrating so I went back to windows 8, I'm hoping the windows 10 phone upgrade wont be as bad, but I worry it wont be compatible
 with my windows 8 computer. I have a Nokia Lumia 640, it runs on Lumia Denim so from what I understand I'll eventually be able to upgrade, but I don't want to do it if it wont work with my computer anymore, or if its as buggy as it was on my laptop

            <p>It should do with Windows 8 because it does here. However, Windows 10 Mobile has not changed much since November 2015 (10.0.10586.xxxxx) in that regard. Therefore, if you face the same issue again:</p>

<li>On your computer, do you have the Windows Media Player installed?

<p><span>Hi Ken,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my research and experience, Outlook 2016 for Mac adds support for Google Calendar and Contacts. However, to use this feature, we need to join the
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-insider?tab=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
insider channel</a> first. To become an Insider, simply open up Outlook, click Help &gt; Check for Updates and then follow the directions found here.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have an existing Google Account connected to Outlook, you can remove it after setting up the new experience. You can also get more detailed information about this topic via the following link:</p>

<h2>            Publisher 2007 and Publisher 2013 paginates differently</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated from Win XP and Publisher 2003 to WIn 8.1 and Publisher 2013. For many years prior, a co-worker and I could exchange PUB files, making corrections and updates. Her system is Win 7 using Publisher 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I upgraded to 8.1 and Publisher 2013, the pagination / copy fitting no longer agrees between our two systems. I can fit more copy into a text box than she can. This obviously affects the pagination of our publications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to look into in order to bring our two systems back in synch for publishing projects?</p>

            <p><span>Sorry. It appears that text is rendered differently on Windows 8 machines. It has been reported that you will get about 5% more text in each box although font size, spacing, etc are all the same as before. &nbsp;At this point I don't know of a good solution
 other than tweaking your layout if you are going to move to Win8 permanently. It sounds like a publication produced in Win8 will not render correctly in older operating systems, and the opposite is also true. They are not interchangeable. I am hoping that
 this is a 'bug' that will be worked out, but only time will tell.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are interested I will post some links to this well documented problem.
</span>Some have suggested that installing Windows 7 fonts on the Win8 machine can help but for most people this is not a viable solution.</p>

<h2>            Installation of Office 2016 but 365 is also installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I purchased and downloaded the Office 2016 Pro but I see that Office 365 was also installed at the same time.&nbsp; When I open the applications I see "Office 365" written at the start-up screen, but when I go to the About link I see "Office 2016 Pro".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why was Office 365 also installed at the same time as 2016 Pro?&nbsp; Which one am I actually running, 2016 Pro or 365?&nbsp; Why don't I see the .exe files etc in the relevant folder (Program Files--&gt;Microsoft Office--&gt;Office 16 )? Am I working on stand-alone apps
 or cloud based?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            If you are part of an organization and sign into Office using an Organization Account, it can convert a standalone Office 2016 installation into a Office 365 installation.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind also, if you recently bought your computer, it might have come preloaded with a trial Office 365 trial.
<br />
<br />What you should do is remove all installations of Office currently installed, then install your purchase copy of Office 2016 separately.
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have U-Verse, but what kind of account are you trying to configure, POP or IMAP? Does ATT support IMAP? I didn't see any info on their support page - worth asking them though.</p>
<p>I found the following<a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB401573&amp;cv=803#fbid=A2AfbK466Bh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> ATT email settings</a> (Outlook and Windows 7, but server &amp; port settings are the same for Mac).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffymp9a.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pvZhlDu57-P8yTD9sO8IXjdeQHIMVqAQD0vPNGFu08ceLUE3L_OmVMeVckv7OG1LcA04YQb5_LU-q5SYuGxVRNuXsrrYfBtVM%2fATT%2520Settings.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure you have gone through all that...</p>
<p>Make sure you are not accessing the email account through any other device while you are configuring Outlook.&nbsp;Turn off email sync on Phones, tablets, other computers, etc.</p>
<p>I would recommend IMAP if ATT supports it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks...&nbsp;</p>

If not and I have to use subforms, please explain what needs to be done.<br />

            I'd suggest using a tab control in the form. You can then logically group the controls on separate pages of the tab control while comfortably accommodating the form within the screen area.<br />

            Why would you need to? If you are trying to create a form from multiple tables then yes you should use subforms, You can place the subforms on a tab page to make it easier to organize.

<p><strong>Boss has a Verizon BlackBerry that checks email in IMAP and his office2007 outlook2007 that checks email both in IMAP format&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If mail comes in on the blackberry and the outlook2007 is not running AND he opens and reads the email on his blackberry when he gets into the office and pulls his email with outlook 2007 the messages that were read
 do not show up in the inbox.</span></strong></p>
<p>However when I configure a email client like Thunderbird in IMAP &nbsp;if will download read mail and unread mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem is outlook 2007 is not downloading read mail that is on the IMAP server... There must be a setting, what am I missing?</p>

<blockquote>that is what i thought..... but in his case its not downloading the already read messages, yes we have run a search and it only searches the locally downloaded messages obviously as the already read message does not download.... yes if i use tunderbird
 it downloads the messages correctly in imap and syncs the mail properly</blockquote>
<br />
Go into Send and Receive settings and look at the account's properties. Are any boxes unchecked?

 about my HP laptop is that it has a dedicated button for turning the touchpad on and off.</div>

            <div>Yep. I have a couple of wireless "mobile" mice (one MS, one HP) with the nano transceiver that you can leave plugged in all the time. I actually prefer this for my desktop as well, since I have small hands. It does require one AA battery, but it lasts
 a reasonable amount of time provided you turn the mouse off when you're not using it.</div>

<h2>            Reply Icon in desktop Outlook 365 not showing in replies made on a mobile device using Outlook app</h2>
                    <p>I posted a question about this a while ago and still do not have a resolution. I use gmail imap with Outlook as my desktop client. Replies to emails made with the mobile Outlook app on an Android Note 8 do not invoke the reply icon on the desktop Outlook
 365 client. All is up-to-date and I have run repair function on the desktop install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If replies a made with other mobile apps (K9, gmail, native Samsung app, Inbox) then the icon shows as expected.

            Hi Marc,
<br />
<br />Do replies made on the desktop show on the app? (That's often a problem too.) Outlook has always had a problem with the reply icon and IMAP accounts.  
<br />
<br />Have you used in-app support on the mobile app to report it? It's in the Help menu &gt; Contact support. They can take a look at it.       
        </p>

<p>No, the reply icon is not shown in mobile Outlook when a reply is made in Desktop Outlook 365. Never noticed that until you pointed it out as Desktop in my "master".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try mobile app support as you suggest.</p>
