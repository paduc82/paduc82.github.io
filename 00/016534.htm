<h2>            Adobe Acrobat Prevented from Being Default PDF Viewer</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;Windows 10 is not allowing Adobe Acrobat to function as the primary PDF viewer. &nbsp;Edge is fine, but I don't want to use it for PDFs. &nbsp;I have tried changing the default applications in settings multiple times. &nbsp;Adobe also asks if I want Acrobat to
 be the default program, and I say yes every time. &nbsp;However, Edge somehow takes over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any mercy in your souls, please fix this as soon as possible. &nbsp;It is an incredible time suck. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This could be a symptom of registry protection.&nbsp; Try booting in safe mode (where such an interferer will be less likely to be running) and make your change there.&nbsp; Test your change there, also rebooting in safe mode to be sure it persists.&nbsp; Then chances
 are that it will persist in normal mode too and your registry protector will be helping make your preference persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, another possibility is that you are misinterpreting your problem symptom, especially if it involves launching from a web page and not a local file.&nbsp; So, another test to help refine your symptom description would be to pick only local files to try
 to open after confirming that your preference for Acrobat has been made to persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion. &nbsp;It worked until it didn't. &nbsp;When I boot in safe mode, I can assign Adobe Acrobat as the default. When I go back to a normal boot, Edge has taken over again. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if I launch from a web page, from a document on

    <title>Deleting records from a table without deleting from linked tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dracaena draco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting records from a table without deleting from linked tables</h2>
                    <p>I have a table of client information (client code, client name, manager name, etc) and a table of to do items (assigned worker, project description, date due, date complete, etc) linked in a query by client code. The query is then displayed in a form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: both tables are external and linked to the database.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>When a user deletes a record on the form (by highlighting the row and hitting the delete key), the record is deleted from the table of to do items, but the client is also getting deleted from the client table. I'd like to prevent the client record being
 deleted, it there a way to do that? </p>

            It depends on how you structure you query. If you are using the client code from the client table the client will be deleted. Use the client code from the task table instead and that should prevent the client record from going POOF!

            <p>What is the Recordsource of the form? I also suspect that you may have Referential Integrity imposed in the wrong direction. Open the Relationships window and check out the relationship between the 2 tables. If the relationship goes from the ToDo table and
 Cascade Deletes is checked, that would explain the deletions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to check the back end to see how the Relationships are set.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm sure Bill is right about your query.&nbsp; When you join tables in a query you should only return the foreign key column from the referencing table in the query, not the primary key column from the referenced table.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only non-key columns from the referenced
 table, client name, manager name, etc, should be returned in the query, and controls in the form can be bound to these.<br />
<br />
For an example take a look at&nbsp; InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the main invoices form is based on the following query:<br />
<br />
SELECT Invoices.InvoiceNumber, Invoices.InvoiceDate, Invoices.CustomerID, <br />
Customers.Customer, Customers.AddressLine1, Customers.AddressLine2, <br />
Cities.City, Customers.PostCode, CountiesOrRegions.CountyOrRegion, <br />
Countries.Country, Customers.Email<br />
FROM (Countries INNER JOIN (CountiesOrRegions <br />
INNER JOIN (Cities INNER JOIN Customers <br />
ON Cities.CityID = Customers.CityID) <br />
ON CountiesOrRegions.CountyOrRegionID = Cities.CountyOrRegionID) <br />
ON Countries.CountryID = CountiesOrRegions.CountryID) <br />
INNER JOIN Invoices ON Customers.CustomerID = Invoices.CustomerID<br />
ORDER BY Invoices.InvoiceDate;<br />
<br />
As you see it is the Invoices.CustomerID column which is returned, and in the form a combo box is bound to this column, set up to show the customer by name by hiding the first column from the combo box's RowSource query.&nbsp; The non-key columns from Customers
 and the other referenced tables are represented in text boxes, whose Locked property is True (Yes) and whose Enabled property is False (No) to prevent the user from inadvertently editing them.&nbsp; Consequently, while the customer can be changed by selecting a
 different item from the combo box's list (upon which the values in the text boxes will automatically change to those for the selected customer), deleting the record would only remove the row from the Invoices table, not from Customers or any of the other referenced
 tables.<br />

            Rather than joining the two tables and basing a Form on this joined query, consider using a Form based on the client table, with a Subform based on the to-do list. This will not only make it possible to delete to-do records without harming the parent record,
 but will make it easier to sort, display and edit data in the two tables without seeing duplicates.

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>Categories are not supported on a published calendar.&nbsp;Category is&nbsp;a setting only for internal Exchange services, not for published HTML. . Meanwhile, I understand it would be great if we could acheive it, especially for external contacts. So I suggest you
 submit feedback to our relevant team via the link below. Many features have been designed and remolded based on our customers’ valuable comments.

<p>Oh, I also forgot to mention, the column on each cell is 7.57 (58 pixels) and each row is 15.75 (21 pixels) times 2x. So the circle should cover within column 7.57 x 31.5 (15.75 x2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
The row/column dimensions are immaterial as my code obtains them directly from Excel and adjusts the circles to whatever size they happen to be. Here is my code, modified to process<strong>ALL</strong> worksheets and which&nbsp;allows you to resize the circles by
 changing a single value... the Factor variable in the second line of code. Using a value of Sqr(2), which is approximately 1.414, forces the oval to touch all four corners of the cells it is encircling... using a value of 1.0 will&nbsp;make the&nbsp;oval small enough
 to&nbsp;fit inside the cell&nbsp;just touching each side of the rectangle enclosing the two cells.&nbsp;Set the value somewhere between 1&nbsp;and 1.414 will probably get you an oval you like. Try a value of 1.1 (I preset the code for that value) as that kind of looked okay to
 me (touches the&nbsp;values in the cells&nbsp;without obliterating them... if your values are centered aligned within the cells, then this setting for the Factor variable would be perfect I think). Let me know if this does what you want...</p>

Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions.

With Windows 10, Microsoft has made huge announcements regarding product distribution. The most notable being that Windows 10 will be free to existing Windows 7, 8/8.1 users for the first year. Regardless of this, product activation remains a part of Windows 10 in current previews. It remains to be seen if the final release will include the technology.

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

<p>Ever get anyone from Nokia fix this issue i have same issue with Nokia Lumia 1020...Front camera video recording sound fine.....main vid camera recording sound is absolute rubbish! Got a replacement Lumia 1020 and same issue.....is this a design fault????
 The OIS in the 1020 uses active motors to counter-balance your handshake and this is the noise that is being intensified by the recording MIC of the main camera. Check below link</p>

<p>Please help!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the same problem with my 1020: a terrible noise while I am recording with the camera. Since I have had a N8 that I just use very extensively to record my classes etc, (so much that I had a plug problem to download my materials) I decided
 to move to the 1020 expecting at least the same quality on noise while recording videos. So I did this experiment to demonstrate the problem where I compare the 1020, N8 and an Asha:</p>

<p>I have had the screeching issue too.<br />
<br />
I sent my phone off to repair, using Nokia Care UK (Anovo) and got my phone back in a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I contacted them again, said the problem wasn't fixed, so they arranged for it to go back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I left a video on the fully reset phone showing the problem, plus a note to say there was a video for them to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The log for the repair&nbsp;shows exactly 1 minute from the phone being on the workbench to there being declared "no fault"! It's as if they ignored everything I gave them, including an extensive description of the issue in the report form, switched it on, saw
 a picture and thought "that works".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are now going to send back the phone with the fault not fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely, because it is still under warranty, I should be due a replacement if it cannot be fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am furious with them.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone from the Nokia Team who can escalate this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even better, a complaints form would be a good start. Try finding anything on the web for that!!</p>

            hey just because the product has been discontinued,it doesn't mean that the company should ignore us,after all we are the "few" consumers who bought a windows phone in 2013!!.it doesn't change the fact that we bought your company's phone..I'm surprised
 to see such a blunt answer from a respected Employee,way to go!!!

</p><p>I wasn't happy with the responses to this question. I suppose there was a misunderstanding. So I want to explain our issue in other words. I will present two cases.
<strong>Solving either one would greatly help our case</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>case 1</strong>:&nbsp;Is it possible to define a <strong>limited width for the page, while having unlimited height</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>case 2</strong>: Right now we can draw <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
one</span> red rule line on one side of the page. <strong>Is it possible to have (only) two red rule lines with constant width in between?</strong> So that each one would show one side of the page?</p>

<p>Hi Hessam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can change the OneNote paper size or create a custom paper size by following the instructions provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-or-customize-page-templates-2c92ef65-06aa-4b01-9bae-4fc2e7361806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. However, there is no option to set a specific paper width and unlimited paper height. There would always be
 a limit on the paper width and <span>paper height unless</span> you’re using <strong>
Auto</strong> in paper size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, Rule Line is a single red vertical line on the left side of the OneNote page. You can switch to different Rule Line Layouts where the spaces between the Grid Lines changes. You can also change the color of the grid lines using the Rule Line Color
 command. However, we have yet to include an option to add a second rule line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, we encourage you to post your suggestion to our <strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a></strong>. This way, our OneNote Team will be able to review your concern.</p>

    <title>New Unsigned iertutil.dll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael bann  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Unsigned iertutil.dll</h2>
                    <p>I came home today to something odd. My VMWare crashed, and also I had my iertutil.dll file (previously signed by Microsoft) replaced by a different iertutil.dll that is NOT signed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I submitted this dll to virustotal but received no hits on it (first submission ever): https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/ffe0114b9c5f0aa8cd7348b729e6c29a71fc97253889feb332ba2207373d638f/analysis/1422405560/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, Anubis had never seen this before: https://anubis.iseclab.org/?action=result&amp;task_id=1302cd45f154eca94816cd504b0d06881</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file itself resides here: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\iertutil.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yesterday, this file was Microsoft signed. Today, the hash changed and it is no longer Microsoft signed (however it says Microsoft in the meta information). Can someone tell me if this is legit? If it is, why is it now unsigned and how did my computer
 change it? I have Microsoft update set to notify, but not auto install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

            <p>Prashant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a python script to periodically (multiple times per day) run the Sysinternal tool autorunsc, and monitor the output for change. After I discovered this, I verified the dll was unsigned using Sysinternals Sigcheck on the file and then on all the files
 in the folder, confirming that iertutil.dll was truly the only Microsoft dll not signed in that folder now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigverif only returns a hit on my OpenVPN tap driver. However, I'd like to get positive confirmation that Microsoft has indeed chosen to release a new version of this file without a signature, as that would surprise me.</p>

            <p>Update: Today that iertutil.dll file was replaced with the original one (same hash, valid signed Microsoft). This does not seem like normal activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note: The invalid one is actually "'(<span>Not&nbsp;v</span>erified)&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;<span>C</span>o<span>rporation</span>'", where the valid one is "(<span>V</span>erified)&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;<span>Wind</span>o<span>ws".
 Subtle difference, but might be meaningful.</span></p>

</p><p><span>File version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;11.00.9600.17496 (winblue_r5.141121-1500)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I believe the winblue designation might refer to Windows 10, it may also simply indicate another test version of Internet Explorer or its components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that you might have been testing an upgrade to either IE or Windows recently that may have updated that file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I doubt that the file contains malware since it's likely that at least one of the many antivirus at Virustotal would have detected this with at least a heuristic module if it did.&nbsp; I also noticed that the Additional Information tab did contain
 this at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>
</p></div>
<p>However, as with most such detections I suspect this may simply be a false positive detection by an overzealous heuristic module.</p>

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that it looks a lot like a legitimate Windows file. As for the version and metadata, that can unfortunately easily be mimiced by programs such as metasploit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not testing an install of anything. In fact, this happened while my computer was idle and I was gone for the day. Came back to this, and as noted have auto-installs of patches and such disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's actually not too difficult to get VirusTotal not to hit on anything. In a malware analysis class I took, one assignment was to take Meterpreter itself and cause VirusTotal to say it's 100% clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concerns with this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If legit, my machine should not be updating without my consent</li><li>I was the first person in the world to throw that into virus total? With the amount of use VT gets, I find this suspicious.</li><li>Symantec Suspicious.Insight is Symantec's way of saying it really hasn't seen this file anywhere. Symantec has a cloud just like every other vendor, so for them to be saying they haven't seen it seems sketch.</li><li>Why would an "update" (if it is one), then un-update itself a day or two later? If this is a legit practice, it is likely this type of willy-nilly system file level changes could negatively impact corporations that are relying on that stability.</li></ol>

            <p>Rob, Windows Blue actually refers to Windows 8.1. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>@Micheal:</strong> Here is the VirusTotal report of the <strong>iertutil.dll</strong> from my system:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d22fc24cec1516058e99091b6f580df52a94fa06bc153ee5cf8329ac1b54d6fa/analysis/1422623748/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d22fc24cec1516058e99091b6f580df52a94fa06bc153ee5cf8329ac1b54d6fa/analysis/1422623748/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My file was signed and its publisher is Microsoft Windows. The only difference (apart from metadata) that I can find is with Entropy and MD5 of .text from PE Sections. I don't have a sound knowledge about this but I think .text section actually holds the
 real code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, as Rob said, since the file got clean reports from all the scanners, I would care less about that change. Also, my file also got the same heuristic detection that your file got.</p>

            <p>I understand your concern which is why I was trying to find a scenario which seemed to fit.&nbsp; Though the potential of a truly sophisticated attack that is evading all types of detection is surely possible, I would personally consider this unlikely unless
 there's a reason you'd be likely to become a target for such an attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking back at your original post the fact that VMware had crashed combined with the fact that only a portion of the iertutil.dll itself changed, while all other properties of the file seem to remain the same as that uploaded by Prashant, makes me believe
 this may simply be file corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scenario would explain a change to the code (.text)&nbsp;section of the file and corresponding invalid signature, while no other attributes for the file appear to have been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though such a change could also be explained by a highly sophisticated attack scenario where portions of the code section of the file where replaced, the lack of any other indications that this has occurred combined with the otherwise apparently stable operation
 of the system including the automatic recovery of the damaged file makes this seem unlikely.</p>

            What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and

            <p>I run BitDefender Total Security 2015 and it says my license is good for another 200 odd days. This product serves as AV, HIPS, and firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, the file publisher changed as well. Originally, it was "Microsoft&nbsp;<span>Wind</span>o<span>ws" (when it was valid signature), then it changed to "</span>Microsoft&nbsp;<span>C</span>o<span>rporation"
 (invalid signature), then back to "Microsoft Windows" and valid signature again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I wish there was a way for Microsoft to claim that it was indeed their file. It claims to be from them, and theoretically they would have hashes for all their files. That would at least put the maliciousness of it to rest, if not the reason
 why it changed out and then back in.</p>

natzkrekr</a>. Does it mean both PC and recovery tool don't recognize the phone? If so, have you tried using another USB cable? You may also try installing the Windows Device Recovery Tool to another PC, connect the phone and see if it makes any difference.
 Let us know how it goes.

<p>If your phone did not it takes a USB data/charging cable to connect the phone to the PC. Most USB cables are not data cables.</p>

 PC suite though connects to my phone adequately for all other functions properly. Only I am not able to coccent Net through dial-up. How can I load the driver for USB Modem for my phone? Please help.

            Try to uninstall the latest pcsuites, and all taht the pertain to Nokia by used of windows add/remove programs. Then install version that is for your phone not the latest. If installed properly all drivers will be loaded, not usb modem driver but Nokia
 modem. Assign a suitable com port to it &amp; select it when configuring dial up connection.

            Do the following,<br />
<br />
(1) Find and download " Nokia_PC_Suite_Cleaner_7_0_1.exe " from nokia site then CLEAN all existing PC suit (if any earlier version of PC Suit 7) and any other Nokia software earlier installed in your PC for Nokia 6275 CDMA. Then restart your PC (Computer).<br />
<br />
CABLE CONNECTIVITY &amp; PC SUIT:<br />
<br />
(2) Download PC Suit 7 from nokia site then install it in your PC.<br />
<br />
The CA-53 cable driver along with PC Suit and Connection software will now be installed in tour PC and you can use all the benefits of PC suit 7 here except the MODEM (Internet Connection) connectivity.<br />
<br />
BLUETOOTH AND MODEM CONNECTIVITY:<br />
<br />
(3) After you have successfully installed PC Suit and tested functionality of PC suit you will probably need to use the Phone MODEM to connect the internet.<br />
<br />
PC Suit 7 does not accept MODEM connection through CA-53 cable but bluetooth so you need in install bluethooth software came along with a compatible Bluetooth Adapter.<br />
<br />
(a) Install the bluetooth Adapter in your PC.<br />
(b) Enable Bluetooth connection in your Nokia 6275 CDMA mobile phone<br />
(c) Search for a bluetooth device from the bluetooth main withdow - it will detect your mobile phone<br />
(d) Pair your Mobile with your PC through Bloetooth.<br />
(e) Now connect the inbuilt phone MODEM by selecting the appropriate option (Bluetooth Dial-up Networking) by right clicking the phone icon from the Bluetooth main withdow.<br />
(f) Your MODEM will be installed.<br />
(g) Now a dialogbox will open as you try to connect the MODEM from the bluetooth main window, - (i) Here, for Reliance Mobile users, you type your user name: (your ten digit phone number) and password: (your ten digit phone number) and the number to dial #777.<br />
<br />
Hurray! you are now connected to the internet!<br />

            I happen to have the same problem with usb modem not found when trying to connect with PC Suite 7. I use Windows Vista OS and thought I should try the usb modem when I discovered that the bluetooth modem speed was 115k maximum. The usb modem of course
 is at least 230k fast. The nokia usb modem drivers can be downloaded from this page:<br />

<h2>            Powerpoint Presentation Won&#39;t Advance when Plugged into an External Screen</h2>
                    We have a Powerpoint 2010 file on a Windows 7 laptop. The file works fine on the laptop when we change slides but when attached to an external projector, we can't get the presentation past slide 1.

            <p>Here is the diagnostic procedure I would recommend:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Make sure the focus of the machine is set to the presentation and not another window. If using the extended desktop feature, PP will project the show to the external display, maintaining the normal editing screen on the primary screen (screen 1). Do this
 most easily with F5 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ensure that PP is still responding to animations and what not while connected to external display (ED). Likely PP will not respond to anything, keyboard or mouse; animation or transition. If the only thing not functioning is the transition, there is a
 programming bug and disregard the next steps. More on this later if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Duplicate the screen and play a video file. If the file plays back on both screens, advance to the next step. If not, your computer is not powerful enough to light 2 screens. More on this later if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If you have gotten this far you have an OS - PP communication issue. Projects but keeps PP from operating correctly. This is what I would expect. The best thing you can do is update your OS (if possible) and look for PP updates. This would be some sort
 of coding issue. Hopefully someone else here can speak intelligently on that subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try to be more specific when posting this type of question. It helps you get your diagnosis quicker and it means I don't have to type as much.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Gooogle without &#123;searchTerms&#125; pretyped after click &#40;Windows 10 mobile&#41;</h2>
                    In Windows 10 mobile, search button goes to google and automatically searches for {searchTerms}. Then I must delete pretyped text. Thats very slow, because it cannot by selected all by double tap. How to remove it, I want only the home page of google,
 without any pretyped text.

            For some reason, this sometimes happens in Edge, it think a full URL is a home page. Just keep typing only Google.com, or make a favourite out of it and it will correct itself.

<h2>            Activation Panic time</h2>
                    <p>Getting ready for all of the people in panic mode because of the ending of old Preview builds activation, if people have&nbsp;been active in this program, no need to worry as&nbsp; when it's time MS will push a new Insiders build with a later date as I have 10/1/2016
 on the current build. few tips for the ones that are have activation issues make sure you are using the
<strong>original MSA </strong>that you used to install the Preview/Insiders as I've noticed many of the ones who have posted with activation problems are also new to this forum.</p>

            <p>Release of the final to insiders via the development channel has no activation implications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What will happen in a few days is that the release build for version 1607 will be flighted to Insiders. &nbsp;At that point Insiders will not be on a preview build anymore. &nbsp;They will be on the same build that the general public will receive at the end of this
 month. &nbsp;The page you posted will read "Permanently activated" instead of "Evaluation copy...." &nbsp;Insiders can then either change their settings by clicking "Stop receiving preview builds" and stay on the public release or do nothing and continue to receive
 preview builds when the next development cycle begins in late Summer or early Fall. &nbsp;No action is required regarding activation. &nbsp;Remember, activation is based on the computer's registration as a Windows 10 device, not on any files on the system drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expiration of a preview build is more a matter of usability of the computer beyond a certain date than activation of Windows 10. &nbsp;Expiration of a build does NOT mean de-activation of Windows. &nbsp;</p>

            They've known it was a Friday for a year.&nbsp; Just rumor.&nbsp; The support staff is worldwide anyway.&nbsp; There are support staff online in Europe, Asia, Africa, Philippines, and who knows where else.&nbsp; Microsoft does not rely on Redmond to do all this.&nbsp; It would
 take the discovery of a show-stopper flaw to prevent timely release.&nbsp; It will probably be a rolling release as each time zone reaches midnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;The files will already have been downloaded the day before so watch the WindowsBT folder (hidden) in the root of
 your directory.&nbsp; The Setup.exe file will be time-locked to your time zone, so don't bother trying to jump the gun.&nbsp; At least that is the way it was with the release last July.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Changing the default font for &#34;Index Markings&#34; in a Word Document.</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Word 2013.&nbsp; I am typing a very large document, using a particular font ("Century Schoolbook") for the entire document. When I add an Index Entry, the field placed in the document (the XE field)&nbsp;is formatted in a different font (I think
 it is "Calibri").&nbsp; It seems that this affects the final outcome of the index, which is built. It turns out that the font of the document, and the font the index is using, is different!&nbsp; I could resolve the problem, by manually highlighting the "Index field",
 and changing its font to Century Schoolbook. However, doing this is very bad, because my document will end up having thousands of index entries!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can make it such that, each time I add a new index entry, it is NOT formatted as Calibri, but to another font?</p>
<p />

<p>First thing that comes to mind is check for more than one <em><strong>Windows.old folder</strong></em>, sometimes don't get deleted and end up taking up space. If you have one too many, delete them but DO NOT delete the latest one, you might need it to restore
 to previous version if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to delete them because of lack of rights, download a free utility called
<strong>"<em>IOBit&nbsp;Unlocker</em>"</strong>.</p>
<p>Easy to use, open or right click the folders to delete, check force mode and from the drop-down menu select unlock and delete.<em>
<strong>Again! make sure you don't delete the latest one.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, open <em><strong>PowerShell</strong> or <strong>Command Prompt both with admin rights</strong></em> and type:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><em>cleanmgr /sageset</em></strong>, select everything except "<strong>Downloads</strong>" or move any important files from that folder to another one with a different name.</li><li><strong><em>cleanmgr /sagerun</em></strong> will delete everything you selected previously</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; click "Configure Storage Sense", at&nbsp; the bottom of the page click
<strong>"Clean Now"</strong> but select <strong>"Never" to delete "Download Folder"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>One more: if you don't use hibernation, you can get recover between 7 and 10GB or more. Again open PS or CMD with admin rights and type&nbsp;<strong><em>powercfg -h off</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Very important!</strong> make a backup of your important files or preferably a full system backup image before you do anything else.&nbsp; Let us know if you need more assistance. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            SPO Org chart web part is .... horrible</h2>
                    <p>I need an easy way to add a user friendly org chart but the existing web part has issues:</p>
<p>The html view is just a list = not worth the time</p>
<p>You need silverlight to get a visual presentation but:</p>
<p>-nobody uses silverlight</p>
<p>-silverlight isn't compatible with modern browsers (because no one uses it)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The silverlight rendition in IE is appallingly ugly and isn't responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>O365 is designed for organizations so it's shocking that there's no viable organization chart included. I would think this would be a basic requirement for a service that claims to be "enterprise quality".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any options that don't require silverlight and don't look as if they're from the '90's? &nbsp;</p>

            Err, an "org chart" doesn't use the chart web part. It's an organization chart.

            Yes, we could and do use some of the other options but my co is spending a ton of money on O365 and I'm tasked with getting the organization to "live" in it. Since all the components needed are present in 365, it's kind of bizarre that a decent org chart
 that works in all browsers isn't made available. The work is already done in Delve so why isn't that available to display as a web part in other sites? &nbsp; It would be much more useful than all the tinkering with the "modern" experience that Msft has spent so
 much time on and that no one has asked for... &nbsp;

            <p>I understand that implementing Office 365 is expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have found a weak feature in the Office 365 suite. OK, the implication is that MS has not identified a lot of demand for displaying Org Charts in browsers.&nbsp; So why not switch to one of the other Office applications, Word/Excel/PPT/etc, that you (and
 your users) are familiar with and use the Org Chart option in that application? You will still be taking advantage of Office 365, the file can be stored in sharepoint, your users can use their Office 365 applications to view the charts, the chart data can
 be linked live to sources outside of the viewing application. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with your last point, but that is where MS chose to spend their development resources so we have to live and work with it. Even though you can't use the tool you want, there are other tools in the suite that will deliver the look you want.

    <title>Unable to modify DL after migrated to Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to modify DL after migrated to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>We have Exchange 2013 hybrid with AD Sync.&nbsp; We have migrated about 50 users to Office 365 without any problem except one.&nbsp; The email Distribution List owners who got migrated to Office 365 can no longer make modification to the DLs anymore in Outlook 2013.
 They got error" Changes to the public group membership cannot be saved.&nbsp; You do not have sufficient permission to perform this operation on this object."</p>
<p><br />
I don't suppose we need to migrate the DL groups from on prem to Office 365.</p>

<p>I was reading some posts have mentioned that the on prem DL groups are synced Office 365 via AD Sync, therefore those DL groups can't be modified as AD Sync can only sync from on prem to Office 365.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If that is the case, is that mean once
 we are fully migrated to Office 365, then mangers won't be able to manage their DL groups anymore?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jimmy</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy,<br />
<br />
By default, a group and its owner (and all the members) always need to be at the same side, or there will be issues. If you want a group to be working for online users, you need to synchronize the entire group along with all its members.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you’re correct that a group can be synchronized through all the Directory Synchronization tools, and a synchronized group can only be managed from on-premises AD, not from Office 365 cloud side.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>Now that everyone on Exchange on prem are migrated to Office 365. &nbsp;However, none of the DL owner can make modification to the DL in the Outlook GAL. &nbsp;All gets the same error" Changes to the public group membership cannot be saved" &nbsp;
</p>
<p>What do we need to do so the DL owners can modify their DLs in Outlook?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy,</p>
<p>We do not have an official supported way to let the owners modify their distribution groups through the GAL of Outlook, if the groups are synchronized.</p>
<p>As I explained above, a synchronized distribution group can only be managed from on-premises side, not from Office 365 cloud side. If you try to modify it through the GAL of Outlook, that still means changing it from cloud side, which is not feasible. Please
 modify these groups from on-premises AD instead.</p>
<p>I understand that every user has been migrated to Office 365, but you should still be able to modify these groups from on-premises AD.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

                    In MS Project 2003, resource work contours change to "contoured" after actual values are entered. Is this related to how I have the resources set up? Or is this a bug?

<div>Not a bug. It's simply the way Project works. If Project is allowed to calculate the actual work based on % complete or % work complete then the Actual Work field will track the Work field. However when the actual work is entered manually by the user,
 Project treats that as a manual work profile and hence changes the type to contoured.</div>

    <title>Word is slow to load on my new computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardcharney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word is slow to load on my new computer.</h2>
                    I was using Office 2000 on my P4 11-year-old computer without difficulty, saving lots of documents. I just upgraded to a new computer with Windows 7, and Word is very slow to load. Once the page loads, it works ok. Is this because the program is too old?
 Should I upgrade to Office 2007 (I can buy it cheaper than Office 2010)? If I do, will it work; and will it preserve my Office 2000 documents for viewing and editing?

            <p>Just to confirm, you installed Office 2000 on new computer?</p>
<p>I can't think of any reason why it should be slow loading, but YNK.&nbsp; The program being "old" does not mean that it will&nbsp;slow down&nbsp;like people do ... {grin}.</p>
<p>Try this trouble shooting process:</p>
How to troubleshoot problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002

</span>(no %temp% folder)</u></span></span>
<p>No reason to upgrade to 2007, go directly to 2010. Although you may be able to get it discounted on the internet, you have to be careful that you are dealing with a reputable vendor with "old" stock. There are many&nbsp;disreputable vendors selling 2007 that
 is fake.&nbsp;Other than possibly saving a few bucks, there is no real advantage for average user to go to 2007 instead of 2010.</p>
<p>Yes you can use 2007 or 2010 to work on your 2000 documents. There may be slight changes in page layout because there are changes in how each version handles page layout, AND Word is totally dependent on the specific printer selected for page layout information.
 The driver on new machine will not likely be identical to one on old machine, so you can anticipate some minor layout changes.</p>
<p>Here is some general info about buying office that should help you make your choice:</p>
<div>

<p><span>Here is more info about those decisions:</span></p>

<p>Since that<strong>&nbsp;.DLL</strong>&nbsp;file is in a temp folder, run Disk Cleanup to clear those folders out. Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows + R</strong>. Type&nbsp;<strong>Cleanmgr</strong>&nbsp;to open<strong>&nbsp;Disk Cleanup</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's in addition to following<em> ALL</em> of the steps at that link to Malware Tips
<strong>José</strong> linked you to, which is at the very bottom of his first post. One user

<p>
</p><p><strong>Edited to note</strong> there's usually more to an infection than one file, so clearing out that temp folder won't get rid of the hack tool.</p>
