<h2>            Deleted battery Lumia 800</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi all,</span></p>
<p><span>I know it's an old subject but t</span><span>o keep a long story short, is there finally a real and fully functional solution for a bricked Lumia 800?
</span><span>Firm- and software fully patched. WP 7.8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Friday afternoon the status bar of my wife's Lumia 800 had disappeared from the screen. The name of her provider was visible on the telephone tile. It was impossible to make a phone call. She told me she charged the telephone during the night before.
 I advised her to shut down the phone and restart it again. Then it became a glossy brick )-: She never made a backup of her pictures!!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried all the tricks I could find on the net.</span></p>
<p><span>1) Charging overnight with the original Nokia wall charger</span></p>
<p><span>2) Charging during several hours with the original usb cable connected to the PC</span></p>
<p><span>3) Power cycle reset </span></p>
<p><span>4) Soft reset (volume- &amp; power)</span></p>
<p><span>5) Zune (manual connection -camera button pressed before connecting the phone to PC-)</span></p>
<p><span>6) Hard reset (volume-,power &amp; camera buttons)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Results</span></p>
<p><span>1) Backside of the phone is warmer than the rest. 10 Seconds after connecting to the wall charger the phone vibrates and the (empty) battery icon with the small red line shows during a minute or 3, then the screen turns black and the phone vibrates
 again</span></p>
<p><span>2) Nothing. But doing a power cycle reset still connected to the PC the phone shows up in Devices and Printers as Unspecified (1) Windows Phone and the empty battery icon is visible during a minute or 3, the screen turns black again, the phone vibrates
 and disappears from the list with the devices. I can repeat this infinitely. </span>
</p>
<p><span>3) Please see 1) and 2)</span></p>
<p><span>4) Being connected to the wall charger or the PC, nothing. Without wall charger of PC the phone vibrates twice and then nothing happens. Sometimes it vibrates only once.</span></p>
<p><span>5)It takes a long time before Zune finds the phone and then it reports error code C101002E. When connecting it without camera button trick nothing happens. Zune reports eg 'To check sync status, connect your device'</span></p>
<p><span>6) Nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've been thinking to open the case, I've found a very good instruction movie on YouTube, to manually disconnect and reconnect the battery. Is this different from the power cycle reset?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone any idea to revive the battery??? It seems that there is still life in this battery but not enough to get through the startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks !!!!</span></p>

<p>As you have surmised, it does sound like a depleted or shorting battery.&nbsp; You could try to repair it yourself, but I think I would suggest taking it to a cell phone repair shop (or a Nokia Service Center, or your cellular provider) to have them take a look
 at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may also have tools available to download your wife's pictures for her and save to a flash drive or something.</p>

<p>Hi dtolson and other readers,</p>
<p>I bought a new (original Nokia) battery and installed it yesterday.</p>
<p>Left it charging during the night.</p>
<p>This morning no signs of life other than the large almost empty battery icon.</p>
<p>Still no difference )-:</p>
<p>For detailos on its behaviour, please look at my first post.</p>
<p>Either the new battery is empty-empty too, or the problem is due to something else, or .......?</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here some additional info.</p>
<p>Soft and hard reset don't work.</p>
<p>Manual connection to Zune (camera button pressed when connecting to PC) neither</p>
<p>After a hard reset (volume down, power and camera) the phone vibrates once and then nothing happens.</p>
<p>Only reconnecting to the wall charger (I used mine, Lumia 920, to be shure that there's no cable or charger problem) makes the phone vibrating and a few seconds the battery icon shows up.</p>
<p>Sometimes after&nbsp;10 minutes and sometimes after less than&nbsp;1 minute the phone vibrates again and then the battery icon disappears.</p>
<p>I think that&nbsp;on that moment&nbsp;the phone shuts down</p>
<p>I can repeat this over and over, but to show the battery icon again, I've to disconnect the phone from the wall charger for&nbsp;5 minutes or so.</p>
<p>When I disconnect and reconnect immediatly afterwards the phone vibrates but doesn't show the battery icon</p>
<p>Is it possible that the firm- or software 'thinks' the battery is fully charged and hence it shuts off the phone from further charging?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the phone is connected to the wall charger, the backside of the phone gets slightly warmer than the rest of the case. I think this means it is charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power button problem?</p>
<p>If so why doesn't the phone charge until 100%?</p>
<p>I think charging is independant from the power button.</p>
<p>When the big&nbsp;battery icon shows it's always the one with the red line (please have a look at the attachment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for helping me solving this enigma.</p>
<p>It's getting&nbsp;to me&nbsp;(-;</p>

<p>Hi dtolson and other members of this forum,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night the 800 was connected to the wall charger.</p>
<p>The back of the case felt nicely warm.</p>
<p>I think the battery is fully charged now, because the battery icon doesn't show up anymore.</p>
<p>When I push the power button the phone vibrates and then nothing happens (black screen)</p>
<p>So I think I may safely exclude&nbsp;a problem with the battery.</p>
<p>What's the next obvious reason on the list for this behaviour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for sharing you knowledge with me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again some additional info.</p>
<p>I connected the 800 to a PC with Zune open pressing the camera buttonat the same time.</p>
<p>I got the connect your phone by usb cable to the PC icon.</p>
<p>Windows tried to identify the phone as&nbsp;a usb device, but came up with an error message 'Device driver software was not succesfully installed'.</p>
<p>I accepted the troubleshooting option and after completing it showed 1 issue:</p>
<p>Your windows Phone 7 or Zune device was not detected.</p>
<p>The Zune software reported a Restoration Error (code C101002E)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting the phone to&nbsp;the wall charger makes it vibrating and the empty battery icon pops up again.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;opening Win8 Windows Phone App (on a Win8.1 PC) asks me to connect the phone. Pressing the camera button whilst connecting the phone I get the connect your phone by usb cable to the PC icon and nothing else happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've the feeling I'm getting closer to a correct diagnosis, but I'm still in the dark. One of the major difficulties in diagnosing this problem is&nbsp;that I don't know when the phone is on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this story ring a bell to anyone?</p>
<p>Someone had the same experience?</p>

            Just check the box you want removed e.g. the top one just touch the little box then touch the remove files tab at the bottom and it will only remove the files you have checked

<p>So it appears to me that you have updates to install and I'm guessing you do not have enough space on your device to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case then my advice would be to Hard Reset your device. Then when that is completed, set it up with the same Live ID so all of your contacts and calendar will return automatically. As long as you have auto upload to OneDrive enabled, all of
 your pictures will have been saved to your OneDrive folder so you will always have access to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save any documents you need to OneDrive or your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would NOT restore from a backup but rather start fresh. Set up the device, check for updates and install, THEN install programs you need or want. All too often we install stuff, use it then never use it again. It is better to start fresh, install the must-have
 apps then slowly add "stuff" as you need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you hard reset, make sure you turn off reset protection!! If <span>you go to
</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 0"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f11996_en-us_6" width="16" /></div>
<span>&gt; </span><strong>Updates &amp; security</strong><span> &gt; </span><strong>Find my phone</strong><span> and scroll down. If reset protection is turned on you can turn it off there.</span>
<p>
</p><p>You can also get a recovery key by going to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices</a></p>
<p>Click on Get Recovery Key. (I usually just turn it off when I hard reset)</p>

            Hi 1Nancy&amp;hub. I am getting fairly nonsensical replies about browsers and I share your problem but I have just found another random ( ie. it doesn't always work!! ) solution is to quit Outlook inbox, or arrow back into Google search, type in Outlook, re-enter
 via the Outlook homepage ( whichever of the Outlook search results leads you to this!! ) &nbsp;which has pictures and a "sign in " bar , click on the "sign in" bar and it takes you ( without inputting email address or password ) back straight to your inbox and
 allows you to compose mail/use "new" button. This is all hugely inconvenient , obviously.<br />

            <p>Modifying the options for the reading pane caused this problem for me earlier today, and I have been able to move&nbsp;in and out of that problem by adjusting those options.&nbsp; Unfortunately the problem is caused by the combination of "hiding" the reading pane
 and simultaneously&nbsp;selecting the option "to type in a new window".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That combination worked well earlier but&nbsp;two hours&nbsp;later it then produced the inability to compose a new message....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using the reading pane option "on the right" and "type in reading pane".&nbsp; But I do NOT LIKE IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT ADDED.</p>
<p>I've now learned that the combination "hide" &amp; "type in new window" works if you either ALLOW POP UPS ALWAYS&nbsp;or you at least allow them TEMPORARILY; however TEMP only remains in effect as long as you do not refresh your browser.&nbsp; Of course, this inconvenience
 with the pop up nonsense is worse than the miserable reading pane "right" and "bottom" selections etcetera.&nbsp; On the whole, the entire reading pane combinations all stink with the exception of "hiding" and "typing in new window".&nbsp; So, Microsoft, make that combination&nbsp;work
 so that it does not interfere with the ability to compose a new message.</p>

            <p>I solved my dilemma by adding&nbsp;"Outlook.live.com"&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Internet Options/Security/Pop-up Blocker/Exceptions so I&nbsp;can now have:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Hide the reading pane"</li><li>"Type in a new item"</li></ol>
<p>and the New Button works ie. a pop-up, new composition window appears.&nbsp; Of course this means that I will be subjected to pop-ups by Outlook.live.com but I'll deal with that later....&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;Microsoft Authenticator app is&nbsp;free.&nbsp;This app provided an extra layer of protection when you sign in, often referred to as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication.. Since you're getting an issue with the cost of downloading this app, we'd
 like to isolate this by answering the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which phone model and Windows version are you using?</li><li>Can you send us&nbsp;the screenshot of the message you are getting when downloading this app?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so&nbsp;far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can try performing a soft reset on your phone and see if this will resolve the issue. Press and hold the
<strong>power </strong>and <strong>volume down </strong>buttons at the same time until your phone vibrates and restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi 1rish5student,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, could you share with us the following info:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur just when you open Word or after several hours work? </p>
<p>2. Is the issue only related to Word for Mac? How about other Office apps?</p>
<p>3. Do you install some third-party add-in in Word for Mac? Or the issue is only related to some specific files (e.g. files stored in cloud storage or files with macros)?</p>
<p>4. Click Word/Apple icon on the top bar&gt;About Word/About This Mac&gt;let us know current versions of your Office suite and Mac OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Rich, thanks for helping us troubleshoot in the thread. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>My suggestion: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>On The&nbsp;Standard Toolbar:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the ¶ Button (Show Invisibles) .<br />
</li><li>At the end of the last page with information you should see a blue line with Page Break&nbsp;<br />
Similar to ———————page break<span>–––––––––––––––– .<br />
</span></li><li><span>Click at begin</span>ning of the line and scroll to the end.<br />
</li><li>Then hit delete.<br />
</li><li>Repeat again until no line break past you last page shows.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>There &nbsp;is an alternate method in this case is easier:</p>
<ol>
<li>while in the Document go to <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">View</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Menu</span></strong>.<br />
</li><li>Scroll down and click on Sidebar.<br />
You will see a display similar to:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b0e8994-a0cd-4c00-b4df-e8be60adee6a" /></li><li>Follow directions I have in annotation.<br />
</li><li>Repeat with all undesired Pages.<br />
</li><li>To dismiss the sidebar you can click on the x inside the circle at top of the side bar as shown above.</li><li>Or you can click on the series of three dots between the sidebar and main display and hide the sidebar.</li></ol>

    <title>Headings for Table of Contents in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trebe26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headings for Table of Contents in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I need for format a document according to American Psychology Association 6th ed. guidelines which stipulate specific formatting for headings and the following paragraph text, which I am finding are not compatible with Word! Below is a sample of the requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1 Level 1 Heading</strong></p>
<p>Maecenas porttitor congue massa. Fusce posuere, magna sed pulvinar ultricies, purus lectus malesuada libero, sit amet commodo magna eros quis urna. Nunc viverra imperdiet enim.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.1 Level 2 Heading</strong></p>
<p>Fusce est. Vivamus a tellus. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames acturpis egestas.Maecenas porttitor congue massa. Fusce posuere, magna sed pulvinar ultricies, purus lectus malesuada libero, sit amet commodo magna eros
 quis urna. Nunc viverra imperdiet enim. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.1.1 Level 3 Heading. </strong>Maecenas porttitor congue massa. Fusce posuere, magna sed pulvinar ultricies, purus lectus malesuada libero, sit amet commodo magna eros quis urna. Nunc viverra imperdiet enim.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Levels 1 &amp; 2 Headings work fine for a Table of Contents; however, the Level 3 heading brought in all the text underneath it as well! I reformatted the text to the text Style of the document, and that worked for the TOC, but it takes on the bold format
 from the heading, and the only way I can see to do is it to 'unbold' it manually, which is going to take me quite a lot of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be very welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>Here's how you do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type the heading using the Heading 3 style.</li><li>Press Enter to create a new paragraph. By default it will be in Normal style, but it will be in whatever style is defined as the "Style for following paragraph" in the Heading 3 style.</li><li>In that new paragraph, type the rest of the text.</li><li>Click in the heading and press <strong>Alt+Ctrl+Enter</strong> to insert a style separator. This works very much like the hidden paragraph mark but doesn't require you to hide Hidden text in order to see the result. Instead you'll see a paragraph mark surrounded
 by a dotted box.</li></ol>

            There is an article by Suzanne Barnhill at&nbsp;<a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/RunInSidehead.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/RunInSidehead.htm</a>&nbsp;with information about this.<br />
<br />
If yourHeadings do not need to be numbered automatically what you are supposed to do is format the paragraph using a body text style, then select the part that needs to be in the ToC and format it with the correct heading style (Heading 3, probably). Suzanne
 describes this near the bottom under "Lead-in emphasis"<br />
<br />
However, if you need automatic numbering I think you will have to use the approach where you insert a paragraph mark and mark it as hidden.<br />
<br />
(There is also an APA template for Word 2013 at&nbsp;<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/templates/apa-style-report-6th-edition-TC103982351.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/templates/apa-style-report-6th-edition-TC103982351.aspx</a>&nbsp;. However, that
 can be a bit confusing because it contains a lot of "Content Controls" for example purposes and you don't really need them. Type in the headings and body text, and those content controls should disappear. But this template uses the "Lead-in emphasis" approach
 as it stands.)

    <title>I lost Office Starter 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dtgraham  say:</h3>
<h2>            I lost Office Starter 2010</h2>
                    My computer recently ran into a problem. For some reason it kept trying to read from the D: drive instead of the C: drive and despite the computer repair shop's best efforts, they couldn't get around this issue so they had to reset my system. This in turn
 erased Office Starter 2010. So I'm wondering if there's any way I can get Office Starter back. While I do have OpenOffice, being a student, I find that having that lack of some of the basic tools in Office Starter interfering with my having to write several
 essays a week, sometimes a day. So it would be truly wonderful if I could get Office Starter back somehow without having to go out and buy the entire Office 2010 package.

            Sounds like they used a Windows Install disk instead of the recovery partition created by most manufacturers on the HD. They probably had to do that becasue they couldn't access the HD properly. The recovery partition includes Office Starter along with
 all ofthe other "crapware" you get from the factory.&nbsp; In other words, you are going to have to do another re-install / refresh. This time from the recovery partition.<br />

<p><span>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010 . A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Windows 7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption
 of files. Using the Windows OPK, you can create this solution with Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE).

    <title>Vitual laserpointer for recording slideshows in PPT for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vitual laserpointer for recording slideshows in PPT for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am not sure if this question came up already.</p>
<p>I want to record a slide show including audio and a virtual laser pointer movement for an online lecture. While this function seems to be available for the Windows version of PPT, I can't figure out how to do this in PPT for Mac (version 15.30). For me,
 the laserpointer function simply isn't there so won't allow for recording the pointer movement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to get this done on a Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Jens</p>

            <p>Does this happen only when the closing parentheses and brackets are at the end of the cell? If yes, this occurs because you're using a non-Arabic version of Office. I have never found solutions for such problems, but there are some workarounds that could
 work. Choose the easier for you:<br />
<br />
A. Workaround with the Excel file:</p>
<p>1. If a row DOES NOT contain an English closing parenthesis/bracket at the end of a cell:<br />
Go to every Arabic closing parenthesis/bracket that exists at the end of a cell and add after it a Right-to-Left Mark from Insert &gt; Symbol &gt; Special Characters tab.<br />
<br />
2. If a row DOES contain an English closing parenthesis/bracket at the end of a cell:<br />
For some reason this addition of the Mark in one cell affects other cells in case of mail merging (which is quite odd). Here you should add a Right-to-Left Mark AND a Left-to-Right Mark (same path) after the Arabic closing parenthesis/bracket that exists at
 the end of a cell. This way the RTL Mark won't affect the English closing parentheses/brackets in the other cells of the row.<br />
<br />
B. Workaround with the Word document:<br />
- Complete the mail merge (Mailings &gt; Finish &amp; Merge &gt; Edit individual documents)<br />
- Open the Find and Replace window with CTRL+H. In "Find what:" type (or copy-paste) this:<br />
[\)\]]<br />
- Click More. Check "Use wildcards".<br />
- Click Format &gt; Language and double click the English language you're using. It will appear under the "Find what:" field&nbsp;<br />
- Now click inside the "Replace with:" field, keep it blank, but go to Format &gt; Language and double click Arabic UAE. It will appear under the "Replace with:" field.<br />
<br />
1. If you're sure that the document doesn't contain English closing parentheses/brackets, click Replace All.<br />
</p>
<p>2. If the document does contain English closing parentheses/brackets, only Replace the Arabic closing parentheses/brackets.<br />
<br />
There could be some easier workarounds but that depends on the formats of the text in the mail-merge document.</p>

            Very useful.<br />
<br />
FWIW <br />
&nbsp;a. I believe this results from an error specifically in Word MailMerge (the text is in the correct sequence in Excel, displays correctly in an RTL paragraph if you copy/paste into Word, is in the correct sequence in the MailMerge data that Word "sees" (I checked
 using VBA), but goes wrong when you insert it via a MailMerge field. The display in an LTR paragraph is even worse as the closing brace tends to be moved to the other end of the RTL text.<br />
&nbsp;b. You can fix this (at least partially) by changing the primary editing language in Word to be one of the versions of Arabic. But then you get the equivalent problem with texts in LTR scripts.<br />
<br />
It was clear from looking at the XML for the document that Word mail merge fails to mark a terminating closing brace as "RTL" when it comes in through a MailMerge field, and that is probably why it is impossible to fix this by, for example, surrounding the
 field code with RTL embedding characters or other techniques such as trying to use \*Charformat to format it correctly.<br />
<br />
I also had a look at Office 2013, and this particular problem <em>appears</em> to have been fixed.<br />

            <p>I know that Excel stores as raw data the information that is typed in cells. Mail Merge in Word takes from this raw data, ignoring any formatting.<br />
<br />
Parentheses, brackets, dots, exclamation marks, colons, etc, are called weak characters. Being the same in RTL and LTR languages, they cause display problems when not formatted (as in Notepad).</p>

<h2>            Office Web Apps 2013 Issues with Chrome Version 57&#43;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, anyone else experiencing the issue with Chrome not opening office files within the chrome browser? Or the document image preview when searching for a file not working in chrome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We get a "might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address". Works fine with IE 11 and latest Firefox, just Chrome version 57+. I suspect since End of March when the chrome update came is the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have updated our Office Web App server to June 2017 CU. Still no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>We solved this issue by since chrome 57 update it now requires a SAN SHA-2 Certificate vs just the wild card SHA-1 Certificate we had.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we issued a SAN SHA-2 cert and applied to OWA 2013 Servers, chrome worked great and with the latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this solves your guys issue too. </p>

<p>I do agree with mrioux101 as that seems to be the permanent &nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you could try this if per chance you are not able to get a SHA-2 Certificate quickly enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open the root site for that page in another TAB in Chrome</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a) assuming you are trying to get to https://owa.xxx.xxx.xxxx.com/vw/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxx/xxx/xxx.doc&amp;action=view</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b) the root site in this case is&nbsp;https://owa.xxx.xxx.xxxx.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) You will get a couple of Chrome specific notifications that the certificate has a weak algorithm with the error message having this NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM</p>
<p>3) Click on the last link at the bottom of the page "Proceed to xxxxxxxx (unsafe)"</p>
<p>4) The site should open with the message as "404 - File or Directory not found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is fine, atleast you are able to access your previous certificate and add it using Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to your site and relaunch your documents in the browser for editing. The document should be available but the nasty "Not Secure" message will be also visible in the address bar until the permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I am using Version 59.0.3071.115 (Official Build)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Ringtone&#39;s for Windows Phone 7 Samsung Focus after Mango update</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I recently recieved my Mango update for my windows 7 phone and i should be able to have custom ringtones on my phone, I've read articles that show you how to use zune to get the ringtone onto my phone, you have to make sure its not over like 30 seconds
 and the genre has to be changed to RINGTONE. I've done that and synced my phone and the ringtones are still not showing up like it said they would. I'm very frustrated and eager to get my ringtones on my phone so please please help me!</div>

            <p>Hi LaurenChad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you checking for your ringtones&nbsp;under Settings,&nbsp;ringtones &amp; sounds? Also, try drag and drop in Zune, drag the ringtone&nbsp;to the phone icon at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Let us know how you make out.</p>

            Same for me, trying everything I can think of, everything I read on different forums, and nothing.&nbsp; In my Zune collection, it shows the song as being synched with the phone; and it shows up in my phone collection through zune.&nbsp; However it doesn't show
 up in either the music list or the ringtone list on the phone itself...it's simply disappeared.&nbsp; I even thought it might matter whether the genre was ringtone, Ringtone or RINGTONE...no difference.&nbsp; Open to any thoughts.<br />

            God it sucks because we should have had freakin ringtones to begin with when we got the freakin phone. Why did they have to be so difficult, i like this new mango update but to me its made this whole custom ringtone thing 209378623976 times harder. It
 sucks!

            Have you gotten the free ringtones from the Insider app?&nbsp; That is what created the "Custom Ringtone" category in my settings / ringtones &amp; sounds.&nbsp; Then I had to make sure when I edited my own ringtone creation on Zune that there was no "s" at the end
 of "ringtone" in genre.&nbsp; Solved all of the issues.&nbsp; No problems after that!!&nbsp; :)<br />

            <p>You have to right click on the file within the Zune software and from there click Edit.&nbsp; After you do that you bring up the genre and set it to
<em><u>ringtone</u></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you modify the file within Windows Explorer, it will not sync to your phone for use as a ringtone.&nbsp; The modification of the genre must be done within the Zune Software.&nbsp; It should look like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your song info does not look like this, it will not sync to your Mango Phone and be able to be used as a custom ringtone.</p>

            <p>I am also facing this problem. Changed the genre in Zune to "ringtone" but it does not sync to my mango phone. The moment I change the genre to others, the songs appear in my phone. Can someone help so that I can get the ringtone sync onto the phone?</p>

<h2>            OneNote Problem</h2>
                    I have upgraded to Windows 10 and upgraded to OneNote 2013 from OneNote 2007. With Windows 10 and OneNote 2007, I could not stop my hand from leaving ink marks when using my pen. When I upgraded to OneNote 2013, my hand no longer leaves ink marks, but
 as I shift my hand it shifts the paper and makes it impossible to write clearly. Is there a solution?

            <p>I am right handed, and this setting is set correctly.</p>
<p>The driver you recommend would not let me write at all, but I downloaded a previous version and it seems to have solved the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!</p>

<p>I tried the repair you suggested, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>However, downloading a new Wacom pen driver seems to have solved the problem. Thanks for your help!</p>

            My pen driver was saying it was the most up to date, but I needed Lenovo Wintab Driver 8.1. This solved the problem.

<h2>            Visio 2016 Professional - Can&#39;t drag shapes to the page</h2>
                    I have just installed Visio 2016 Professional through my work Office 365 subscription and this simple, basic function of Visio does not work.&nbsp; I cannot drag-and-drop any of the shapes to the page.&nbsp; I can copy and paste but it then locks the shape to that
 spot, not allowing me to move it.&nbsp; I can add a few basic shapes from the "Tools" toolbar, but that is it.&nbsp; I am I missing something here?&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled and tried to repair the program already, but the same result.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Windows
 7, 64-bit.

            <p>Ran,</p>
<p>&nbsp; To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Drop and drag does work on other files</p>
<p>2. When I tried to move the shapes, they did not follow the cursor.&nbsp; There was a 4-direction arrow that showed up but nothing followed when the button was pressed and mouse moved to the page.</p>
<p>3. I did not see the screenshot you mentioned</p>
<p>4. The Product Information says that it is Microsoft Visio Pro for Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to give you an update, before I replied to your message, I decided to try it again and everything now seems to work.&nbsp; I am not sure what was different, maybe the fact that I had to restart after I installed this?&nbsp; I was not prompted to so I never thought
 much about it.&nbsp; Just to be sure, I tried several different types of charts and diagrams and they all seem to work fine.&nbsp; Thank you for your response though.&nbsp; It was definitely frustrating at the time but hopefully we are good to go for now.</p>
