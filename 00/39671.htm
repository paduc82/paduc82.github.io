<p>who knows they may possibly have someone that is sponsoring them and this is a promotional perk for them. research on my part has found that gunner and many others offer perks on sponsoring clans. all of these this forum member has laid out to show is just
 examples. </p>
<p>gunner has give free glasses to clans its sponsors. so while this may possibly be funny to you. it's really showing what they have gone out and done. can't say the same for LoH everyone their wants to work for free on a website and tell people what to do.

            Hi there Suzanne, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Windows Update won't delete your files, as it only makes changes to your Windows system and not your personal documents or files.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your technician reset your PC, which removes all of your files. You may need to get in contact with him again to ask what exactly he did and if he backed up your files to an external drive or another location.
<br />
<br />Please see the below link for more information on the various Windows recovery options and how they affect your files:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further advice! Thanks!

            Hi Suzanne.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Ask the technician exactly what he/she did.  If they did a Version update the files may be in c:/windows.old.  They may also be your old User profile at C:\Users.  
<br />
<br />OneDrive introduced some features that remove files from the hard drive and store them only in the cloud if Files On Demand is chosen in OneDrive Settings:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />Also if the new Folder Protection is chosen in OneDrive Settings &gt; AutoSave Tab, then Documents, Desktop and Pictures folders will be moved into the OneDrive folder.  See Folder Protection details here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Strangely recent Updates have set these on by default and even after I warned about this for months, apparently caused file losses that caused them to withdraw the October Version 1809 Upgrade.  So I would check closely those OneDrive Settings, your OneDrive folder, the PC Recycle Bin,  and also check the Onedrive Online Recycle Bin.
<br />
<br />Some Updates can also cause Windows 10 to start into a temporary profile which should be obvious because you don't recognize anything, in which case files should still be in your old Profile at C:\Users.  
<br />
<br />Finally sometimes if an Update fails it will archive files in C:\windows.old.  
<br />
<br />So look in all of those places, starting with OneDrive "View Online" the online files and online Recycle Bin. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Everything became big in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi, I'm currently using Windows 8.1 and when i started my pc, everything suddenly became big and with a different font (much bigger that the natural font). Please help.

            <p>Where is it big like Texas big where everything is big? Right click the desktop select Screen Resolution and look to see if the resolution is set to something off like 1024X768. If you can't change it there hit windows key + x &gt; select device manager &gt; expand
 Display adapters &gt; and double click the one listed to open properties &gt; clikc drivers tab on top &gt; look at the driver data says and post it here if you can't fix the issue &gt; then try and update the driver. You may need to go to the computer manufactures web
 site to get a drvier for the graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF none of that works lets check and repair the systems files using the instructions bellow. the last one dism... is what you will type in the command prompt window that will open after you click yes on the UAC control. type that in and hit enter. Let me
 know what the results are</p>

<h2>            Xbox one will not power cycle after update this morning</h2>
                    <p>This morning I&nbsp;had and update waiting to download. I started the download and my xbox shut down on its own midway. I turned on the xbox one more time and was prompted to start the download again. The same thing occurred only this time now my xbox will not turn on. I have been in contact with xbox support and troubleshooted. After troubleshooting the service rep "Cat" had concluded that I need my xbox serviced and it is not the psu. Where do I go from here? How do i get my xbox one fixed.</p>

            <p>Update: I left my console unplugged for about 20 minutes and powered on my xbox. The update was still there so I proceeded with the install. After verifying the update and then restarting my console shut off again and will not power on. There is a faint start up sound when hitting the power button on the console. Still nothing happens. Firmware update gone bad?</p>

            Hi austinalbert
<br />
<br />You need to have iTunes Installed on your PC, you can then use iTunes to sync those tracks to your PC, there is no other real way to do this, without using an unauthorised app, that may brick your iPhone . ..

<h2>            How do I safely remove an old OS partition&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Home built PC [E8400/4GB/Win7 Ultimate &amp; XP Pro/multiple HD].</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I got a new 1TB drive to replace the 640GB drive that has system partitions on in.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The original OS used was Windows XP Pro which is on the first partition (xp32).
<br />
</p>
<p>Later Windows 7 Ultimate was installed; it's on the second partition (Windows 7).</p>
<p>When the computer boots it gives me the option to choose between Windows 7 and the previous OS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've cloned that drive.</p>
<p>Here's what the new drive looks like:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>
http://imgur.com/VBTFnwU</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>exchange replace the old one with the new</li><li>remove the Windows XP partition</li></ul>
<p>What steps do I take to do this? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After that's done successfully I want to change the sizes of the other partitions mp3 and backup audio, but I'll do that in Disc Management.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<br />
Is it at all possible to delete the Windows XP partition and then use boot repair / Windows 7 disc to fix the ensuing mess?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to avoid a day of downloading and installing 150 Windows updates and security packs and re-installing all the programs.<br />
<br />
As the new drive is a clone of the old one, if I do get in over my head I can still put the old one back.&nbsp; Or format the new one.&nbsp;
<br />

<div><span>Go to start-&gt;type msconfig-&gt;press enter. Click Yes, if UAC prompts. Go to Boot tab. Select Windows XP and click Delete. Then click

            Thanks Balaji,<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently the boot tab has:<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate (recovered) (C:\Windows) : Current OS; Default OS<br />
<br />
<br />
When I put the new (cloned) drive in, I expect it's gonna say the same thing.<br />
here's how the new drive looks: <br />
http://i.imgur.com/VBTFnwU.jpg<br />
<br />
My goal is to delete the XP partition (not just folders).&nbsp; Everything in that partition is backed up.<br />
Then move the Windows 7 partition to the beginning of the drive, then enlarge it (to 300gb).<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps given by "Balaji Kundalam" to remove Windows XP from the partition. Once the Operating System has been removed, you can delete the partition and you can shrink the volume with the previous partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any further queries related to the issue.</p>

            Hi Tadasha,<br />
<br />
As I replied to Balaji, the boot tab in msconfig has:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate (recovered) (C:\Windows) : Current OS; Default OS<br />
<br />
and it can't be changed or deleted.<br />
<br />
What do I do?<br />
<br />
Also I see that I can't delete the first (WindowsXP) partition while it's in the computer.&nbsp; I guess I should boot from the old drive and delete the xp partition on the new drive while it's attached via usb.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your assistance.<br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>First of all we have to check where the bootmgr file has been resided. Open Disk Management and find the partition that
 is marked "active". That is the partition that contains the bootmgr.<br />
<br />
The active partition is usually from the OS that was on the system first - e.g. if you installed Windows 7 on an XP system, the XP system would be the active partition.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>The reason you can't delete the Windows XP partition is because Windows 7 is currently booting from it. Since Windows
 XP was installed first, Windows 7 installed its boot files onto the Windows XP partition (that's why it's labeled "System"). The Windows XP partition is also the Active (booting) partition. According to your post, the Windows 7 partition is Logical. It would
 have to be converted to a Primary partition to be bootable. If you delete or remove the Windows XP partition, you'll have to convert the Windows 7 partition into a Primary partition and run a Windows 7 repair (at the very least) to fix the Windows 7 partition
 so it will boot. You'd need a Standard Microsoft Windows 7 DVD for this.</font></font></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here's what I recommend you to do:</p>
<p>1. Turn off UAC (Do this if you're using Vista or Windows 7, otherwise, proceed to Step # 2). Don't just lower</p>
<p>down the restrictions - turn it off completely.<br />
2. Restart your computer for the change to take into effect.<br />
3. Re-download Security Update for the 2007 Microsoft Office System (KB982331) from the link below:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7f89a734-cda4-4abb-9a10-f6dfe560e8d0&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7f89a734-cda4-4abb-9a10-f6dfe560e8d0&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />
4. Install it. It should be working fine.<br />
5. If it still does not work, try to open any or all of your MS Office applications (like MS Word, MS Excel, etc).<br />
6. Follow Steps # 3-4.<br />
7. If it still does not work, follow step # 3 again. After downloading it, try to disconnect your computer from</p>
<p>the internet (either unplug the internet cable or turn off the modem). Then, try to install the downloaded</p>
<p>(KB982331). It must be working this time.</p>
<p>Do the same for all the updates that come along with KB982331, IF ANY.<br />
Let me know your findings.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is only a WORKAROUND and not a RESOLUTION. The resolution will be posted as soon as we have it.</p>

<h2>            Removing BIOS Password of an Acer Aspire One AOD257</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire One AOD257. Whenever I boot up, it give me the option to enter the bios. Unfortunately, I can't do that because there is a BIOS password. Is there a way to remove it without removing the CMOS battery?

<h2>            Please help&#33; Access denied when importing photos from camera to Pictures Library &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened before. When my photos had been downloaded from the camera and 'Import' had been clicked, there suddenly appeared en error message: Access denied. &nbsp;When I tried once more only to see "We cannot get to this file because this pc has blocked
 access to it.... We are still importing your other files. Click the test in the upper-hand corner, fix any problems, and try again." But, there was NO text to see and there are NO other files in my folder except for the one whose access was denied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine is Windows 8.1. Does anybody know what has caused this problem and how it can be fixed? Thanks beforehand!</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for the prompt reply with the useful link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually in despair I tried restarting the computer and, as luck would have it, &nbsp;I was surprised to see my file access unblocked! Still I have saved your link for the future. Nothing is predictable....</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, another problem turned up: Even though both importing photos to my Pictures Library (Windows 8.1) and editing in it are working as well as before, I was unable to access Pictures Library to reediting unless I connect my camera with the PC once more
 because when I type in SEARCH "Pictures Library", I saw an error message: Pictures Library sorry there was a problem and I was taken to Pictures. But I can't do editing in Pictures,can I? Are Pictures and Pictures Library the same thing? Excuse me for my ignorance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I saw somewhere: library is no longer working and followed Microsoft's instructions below:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">
This message might appear if a library has been damaged. Here's how to solve this problem:</p>

            The manufacture no longer supports this scanner past win/xp. &nbsp;But you can download the winxp drivers and install them in the compatibilty mode of win7 and it will work fine. &nbsp;At least it did for me. &nbsp;I hope this helps some one with this problem. &nbsp;I have
 not tried this with misc..... softwares but just using the scanmaker 5 software this worked great. &nbsp;I was impressed at the speed I got from scanning in items.

<h2>            All achievements unlocked, achievement progress stuck on 74&#47;75</h2>
                    
<p>Have collected 75/75 achievements - one achievement unlocked as taking part in a Beta for DLC.</p>
<p>Game now displays as 74/75 on the 360 and on xbox.com, but shows all 75 unlocked when going in to the game's achievement list.</p>
<p>Have asked on the support forum of the game involved, but have been ignored.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Some things to make more clear to answer you!!!</p>
<p>What game?(that most important)</p>
<p>I have &nbsp;a similar inssue in another game (after burner climax, and that occur in time you open 3 achievements in same time), so in my case in Xbox.com and gametag shows 12/12 but in complete data show 11/12</p>
<p>Try a solution sugest to me for a friend, first copy your game save in another device, second erase all data of the game in question (save included) and play again and enter xbox live (in theory that will fix it), but i didn´t test yet personaly (because
 i have problems in USB flash drive particion).</p>
<p>I hope i help you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

            <p>Hey there Ackter! I'm trying to get this sorted for you. The achievement that seems to be causing the problem is "Outlander", correct? How long ago did you get that achievement (a date and approximate time would be great)? Also, were you online or offline when the achievement unlocked?</p>

<p>Well this is embarrassing, I completely forgot about this, apologies.</p>
<p>Yes, the achievement is "Outlander", and it would have unlocked sometime in early January 2013 or late December 2012. The other achievements from the DLC were unlocked on 7/1/2013, but this one was unlocked a while before them.</p>
<p>I remembered about this topic because a similar thing has just happened with Forza 3. I unlocked the "Driver Level 20" and "Year 2" achievements yesterday morning and, while they're showing up as unlocked, they're not being counted towards the amount of
 achievements unlocked (it's showing 33 unlocked when I have 35) and I don't think the gamerscore was awarded either.</p>
<p>Cheers (and again apologies for the ridiculous delay in answering you).</p>

            <p>Hey, Ackter! I'm glad to see you come back for an update. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />I checked out your Skyrim achievements, and see that you've achieved a few of them offline. Did you also attempt to get Outlander offline? It's possible it may have not synced properly.<br /><br />If you did attempt it online, my main suggestion would be to try to get it on another character. I completely understand that this will take some time, and I do apologize to ask this of you. I want you to attempt it following the directions on <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a172535/outlander-achievement.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">trueachievements.com</a>. This way we can make sure we're both on the same page for the way it was achieved. :D<br /><br />I look forward to seeing your results! Please do let us know if this works out for you. :)</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Part of the Beta process was playing the game while hiding all of your information from online so noone could see you were playing it. I would have very probably been online for them, but not guaranteed.</p>
<p>I've tried it with different characters as well, including the ways shown on TA, but no luck.</p>

<p>Ya probaste hacer un power cycle de la consola, a veces puede ocurrir que se queda como trabada por estar en modo suspensión, lo cual puede afectar tanto accesos a las cuentas como a juegos, el siguiente método ayuda a resolver este detalle. Sigue el link

<p>
</p><p>Si esto no llegase a funcionar, pruebe quitando el cable de alimentación de la consola por 30 segundos y luego reconéctelo de nuevo. Después de esto, trate nuevamente.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Espero que soluciones tu problema de lo contrario háganos saber para seguir asistiendolo. Un saludo</p>

<h2>            XP PC can not access shares on Windows Server 2012 Essentials</h2>
                    Hello, I am having an issue with accessing the shared folders on my Windows Server 2012 Essentials on my Dell Inspiron 1100 running XP Pro SP3 I have changed all of my workgroup computers names to match the Servers NetBios and all of my other computers
 have access to the shares except for the Inspiron 1100 when trying to access the share I am told that I don't have access I am not offered a prompt to enter a user name and password I am simply denied access. Does anyone know how to get around this or fix
 the issue does XP have and issue with Server 2012 or vice versa. I can access the Server using Remote Desktop but not the shared folders that seems weird to me. I already posted the same question on TechNet site also since it is a server question but I find
 that you can easily post there and not receive any help what so ever but I find that almost every topic I have posted here someone at least makes an effort to assist you with your issue.<br />

            Actually I created a user account on both the server and the XP client gave them both the same user name and password and now I have full access to the server shares. I often keep trying while waiting for replies and find my own solution.

<h2>            Setting up a Home Network and Disabling Win 7 Auto connect</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
What i have and their use: <br />
I have 3 pc's of which one is wired (Win 7-64)&nbsp;and two are wireless (Win XP-32SP3)&nbsp;connected via a router used to gain internet access. Two of these PC's at the least (1 wired and 1 wireless) are used mainly for LAN gaming.<br />
<br />
What's happening:<br />
Now when i finished attaching my ethernet cable to my nic windows 7 just auto connected... whooosh i was online just like that and this is the problem!&nbsp; When i go onto the system tray for networking&nbsp;to try disconnect there's nothing to disconnect from... normally
 to connect&nbsp;to the web on my XP pc i just enable my lan connection, run my PPPoE connection and whalla! i'm online and if i want to just stay lan bound (most of the time)&nbsp;i just disconnect the DSL connection.
<br />
<br />
What i need:<br />
I'd like some control over when i connect as it's killing my internets CAP limit. I need to be able to have seperate control over connecting to the internet through my PPPoE connection which is setup but currently pointless&nbsp;and just a plain old LAN through
 my router without been online at all! Mainly need to be able to stop Win 7 just auto connecting to the internet without having to disable my network adapter which kind of makes using a lan difficult.<br />
<br />
any help is appreciated!

hello<br />
<br />
Choose this if your computer is connected directly to a broadband modem (also called a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or cable modem), and you have a Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) Internet account. With this type of account, you need to provide
 a user name and password to connect.<br />

<p>Thanks for the response,<br />
I've already setup the PPPoE connection using account details supplied to me however this is pointless as my pc is connecting to the internet the moment the adapter/cable are connected regardless of the PPPoE&nbsp;and if i disable the adapter... well theres no lan
 to connect through :|. Main thing i need is to be able to stop windows 7 auto connecting&nbsp;so i can get a bit of control over my network. I've read through just about all the related 'help' readme stuff and none of it is any help really ;/<br />
keep it coming! ^^</p>
