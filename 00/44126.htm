    <title>Folder contents failing to copy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickblong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder contents failing to copy</h2>
                    <p><span>Having recently updated to Windows Pro 8,1, I find that when I copy a folder to a network drive , the contents do not copy with it. &nbsp;Copying the folder does just that; the
 contents don't get copied across, although I have just found that on repeating the process the contents are copied.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So first copy, folder only; second copy (with folder now in place on the destination drive) contents copy across.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>No error messages, although a third copy delivers exactly what one would expect with Windows declaring that the files are already in place and asking me whether
 I want to overwrite or skip.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The result is exactly the same whether I just drag and drop or copy and paste a folder; on the initial copy the folder appears in the new location, but with no content
 (sub-folders and files). &nbsp;This happens with any folder, regardless of size; I've tried it with minimal content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have 2 network drives and they are shared with 2 other computers running Windows 7; copy works just as one would expect from those machines.&nbsp; Copy also works OK
 with a USB flash drive.&nbsp; The only problem combination is Windows 8.1 and Network drives.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Surely this must be as simple as changing a setting somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm more than 50% sure it worked OK before upgrading to 8.1, but cannot be absolutely positive, although I believe &nbsp;I would have noticed before, now having used
 WIndows 8 for 9 months.</span></p>

I'm adding my agreement to this issue.<br />
<br />
I have a Toshiba laptop which was delivered with Win 7 Professional and qualified for the upgrade to Win 8 when it was released.&nbsp; I did not install the upgrade until Win 8.1 became available.&nbsp; I then upgraded (not clean install) to Win 8 which then almost immiediately
 offered the Win 8.1 upgrade which I also accepted.<br />
<br />
Since then I find that I cannot copy folders to a network addressed storage device.&nbsp; I can copy files or folders individually but not as a complete structure.<br />
<br />
By way of example, this morning I experienced the following which set me looking for a solution and hence this thread.<br />
<br />
I had the following folder structure:<br />
<br />
Top Level Folder<br />
- Sub folder 1<br />
--- File 1<br />
--- File 2<br />
--- etc<br />
- Sub folder 2<br />
--- various files<br />
- Sub folder 3<br />
etc<br />
<br />
I used copy and paste but then had the same result with drag and drop.&nbsp; When I checked the results on the NAS drive I found that only the Top Level Folder and Sub folder 1 had been copied.&nbsp; None of the files in the sub-folder had transferred.<br />
<br />
I can copy to a USB removable HDD.<br />
<br />
I can still copy and paste/drag &amp; drop from a family PC still running Windows 7.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to relate to the external storage being a network addressed device rather than directly connected to the computer.&nbsp; As with the original poster, the drive is mapped.<br />
<br />
I should, perhaps, say that my NAS is a Freecom Network Drive.<br />
<br />
I can also say that when I make a network connection to the family PC I can transfer folders correctly as well.&nbsp; So it does seem to be the NAS device.&nbsp; I wonder what make the network storage that the original poster has.<br />
<br />
Late Edit:&nbsp; Interestingly, I subsequently tried copying from the command prompt using
<br />
xcopy source destination /e /v /c /i /f /g /z <br />
and this worked just fine.&nbsp; I'm wondering if this points to a solution?<br />

            No support has been added but I made some of my own discoveries so am adding this note to say what I discovered and how I have resolved it.<br />
<br />
I spoke to the manufacturer of the Network Addressed Storage drive - Freecom.&nbsp; They recommended updating the drive firmware which I had already done.&nbsp; They then observed that the drive was several years old and they could not guarantee that it would work with
 Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
I was then inspired to connect to the drive using the built in FTP capability.&nbsp; I already had an FTP account set up on the drive so&nbsp; I created a drive mapping to ftp://my.nas.local.ip/PUBLIC/&nbsp; This works just fine as opposed to the original mapping of \\drivename\PUBLIC\
 which is what ceased to work after the upgrade to Win 8.1<br />
<br />
So the answer for me seems to be to use FTP.<br />

            Thanks for that, Agsteele. &nbsp;You're clearly more technically adept than I. &nbsp;I don't really understand the FTP issue you described. &nbsp;FTP is enabled, but that's about as far as the extent of my understanding reaches. &nbsp;The firmware could well be out of date,
 but I can't find any newer firmware available from Iomega. &nbsp;It might just be easier to live with the problem. &nbsp;Technology eh? &nbsp;Thanks again.

            &nbsp;
<p>I confirm : everyone on the planet is getting the same issue : from windows 8.1 to a NAS : doesn't copy without message, just creates silently the first folder and leave it empty.</p>
<p>every other combination works : from windows 7 to the same NAS, windows 8.1 to an USB key, everything works.</p>
<p>for your information, a NAS is a standalone device, not a computer, you can only manage it remotely.</p>
<p>so just stop asking about details about the error message, there isn't any.</p>
<p>this is not something you can fix by making settings or reading KB. you have to make the test yourself if you don't believe your customers, and once you'll understand that this is a serious bug, you have to escalate to the development teams to alter the
 windows 8 code to make it work almost as well as a windows 7 can.</p>
<p>pardon me if i speak hardly, but i've just made a dozen of internet searches, and the whole platet seems to be aware of this issue, you are the only one who ignores it or ask an unrelated question. on another hand, your are the ony ones that can fix it.
 Don't try to incriminate the NAS firmware as you were able to deal with it in windows 7.</p>
<p>if you need more info, just make an internet search with the following terms :</p>
<p>"windows 8.1" when copying on a "network drive" nas</p>
<p>so much people are complaining about this point since 2013.</p>
<p>when do you expect to release a fix ?</p>
<p>anyone can reproduce the issue. did you even try ?</p>
<p>or you just suppose that since there is no reply for such a long time, they probably all migrated to Linux ?</p>
<p>please take in account that some people try to work with such a system. They don't all play with it.</p>

 and decided to get windows 8.1 thinking hey its latest windows maybe it will be working fine without any bugs or anything like that well I was happy all software is working like a charm and I am able to work and do the job I need without a problem but then
 I decided to use a good old bridge connection I was using on windows 7 to connect my xbox 360 elite console to network and I found out that this is where windows 8.1 weak spot is... networking Ethernet showing up as unidentified network and I am unable to
 connect my console to the internet. </strong></em></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is usually caused by a conflict between a software and the feature. We suggest that you perform a clean boot to isolate the issue. Clean boot will start your Windows 10 with minimal set for drivers and startup programs. To do so, follow the steps
 on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

    <title>Either Headset or Microphone Works, but Not at the Same Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stayedgibbon265  say:</h3>
<h2>            Either Headset or Microphone Works, but Not at the Same Time</h2>
                    <p>I have a Kotion Each G-2000 headset. I've had this headset for some time now, and I've also been using Windows 10 for quite a bit. Occasionally an update would render something about my headset broken for some time, then I'd find out some way to fix it.
 But not this time. Microsoft kept bugging me over and over to update my Windows, so I decided to do so while I went to do something. I come back and realise something: My microphone doesn't work when I tried talking to someone online. I look it up and it seems
 like other people had this problem after updating recently. So I follow some fixes that people posted, none of which worked. Then I tried resetting the drivers, setting as default device, and all that jazz. I finally decide to just try uninstalling the update,
 as that seemed to be the only option Microsoft was giving me here. So I do that, and reset my computer. Once it finished doing everything, I&nbsp; go to try; Hoorah! My microphone works! Now, I'm gonna play some music to relax...Oh, wait, the headphones now don't
 work. I spent about 2 hours fixing them, only to then realise the microphone no longer worked. Everyone else having this problem only has 1 cord for their headset, but not me. I have a USB (for LEDs), a cord for headphones, and a cord for the microphone. If
 I unplug the headphone plug, and unplug then re-plug in the microphone cord, the microphone will work; Upon re-inserting the headphone cord, the microphone cuts off and the headphones work. I tried the microphone on a separate PC and it worked perfectly fine.
 I also tried the headphones without the mic plugged in, and it worked fine there too. The headset obviously isn't muted, and my jacks aren't messed up because I plugged seperate things into those to test them, and that worked fine too. That only leaves me
 with the conclusion that Windows screwed something up during the update, and I've spent the better half of the last 2 days trying to find a solution both online and on my own, but to no avail. I finally gave in and asked here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating drivers on my sound card and the headphones, which did nothing. I've set both the headphones and microphone (though technically it's apart of the same headset) as default devices. I've tried removing them and restarting the PC to re-install
 them, which really only helped with the headphones. I'm at a complete loss here.</p>

            Hi SG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu. 
<br />
<br />If problems persist:
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p><span>Hi PhilWaterton,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Canon Smartbase MPC600F printer is not compatible with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
However, you may download &amp; install the printer drivers in compatibility mode 
</span><span>i.e. Windows XP mode and check if it works.<br />
<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/Fax__Multifunctionals/InkJet/SmartBase_series/SB_MPC600F.aspx?type=download&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/Fax__Multifunctionals/InkJet/SmartBase_series/SB_MPC600F.aspx?type=download&amp;page=1</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
To install in compatibility mode, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
a. Right click on the setup file of the driver software, click Properties, click Compatibility tab, under compatibility mode, check mark “Run this program in compatibility mode for” and select “Windows XP (Service Pack 2)" from the drop down list. Click Apply
 and then click OK.<br />
b. Under “Privilege level”, click “Run this program as an administrator”, click apply and then click ok.<br />
c. Install the driver software successfully and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
d. Launch and check for its functionality.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Angie,</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do other websites work?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The steps below should fix the DNS server issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;<span>Flush your computer's DNS cache.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<span>
<p><span>Most DNS clients cache the results of name resolution requests. This means that the DNS clients will temporarily store the website names that you
 have been visiting lately. This process speeds up name resolution if multiple lookups are done to the same address.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sometimes a bad DNS entry will be cached and you will need to either flush the DNS cache to get rid of it, or wait up to 24 hours for it to be dropped from the cache automatically. Given below is a comprehensive step-by-step process
 to flush the DNS.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on cmd from the programs list and select “Run as administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 “ipconfig /flushdns” without the quotes and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>A
 message will appear saying that your DNS cache is cleared.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This command refreshes all DHCP address leases and registers all related DNS names configured and used by the client computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span><strong>Restart DNS Service from
 Services</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<span>Start</span>,
 type services.msc, and then click <span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click&nbsp;<span>DNS
 Client</span> service. If you receive a Configuration Manager message, click&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the&nbsp;Startup<span> Type</span> list, click Start, and then click&nbsp; <span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 Services.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Configure the connection to obtain an IP address automatically</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "Start", type "NCPA.CPL" (without quotation marks) to Start Search bar and press "Enter".</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the network connection and click "Properties". If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 to highlight "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" and click "Properties".</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "OK".</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 to highlight "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click "Properties".</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".</span></p>
<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "OK".</span></p>
<p><span><span>i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Reboot
 the computer.</span></p>

<h2>            NAS drives and network</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a WD EXultra2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop (5yr old samsung) running Win10</p>
<p>I have a fairly new PC running Win10</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop can see my NAS drive no problem and can access everything on it.</p>
<p>My PC has recently decided to not see my NAS drive - no reason that I can discern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Webroot Firewall and anti-virus, Windows Defender etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the PC to see the NAS drive again - I have checked the privacy settings and they are the same as for the laptop. I haev also tried asking google but seem to be running around in circles to not get an answer!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Outlook calendar live tile does not update, turns back into DEAD tile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skinnypig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook calendar live tile does not update, turns back into DEAD tile every night</h2>
                    <p>I have the Anniversary Update on my Lumia 930. I have checked that my outlook mail and calendar app is up-to-date; there are no updates in the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every night when the clock turns 12 am, my outlook calendar live tile does not switch over to the next day, it just turns back into a static tile with the Outlook icon on it.&nbsp; It stays that way until I either resize the tile or restart the phone.&nbsp; I have
 to do this every morning which is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug?&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it is.&nbsp;I have seen lots of feedback about this issue in the feedback hub so I know I'm not the only one experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows a way to fix or workaround this issue please reply.&nbsp; Note that I have already done the usual hard reset to try to solve this but it doesn't work.&nbsp;If any support person is reading this please bring this bug to the attention of the dev team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Tile needs to be resized to get it working every day at midnight.Otherwise it just changes to a tile with the Outlook icon on it . I have a wide tile on my phone and I have to change to medium tile and again to wide tile to get the date updated at midnight.</p>

            <p>There are other older threads about this topic without any reliable answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deem live tiles a nice feature but not reliable; I no longer count on them. Often I do not get a notification for emails or the live tile does not work, it is the same with other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Till now Microsoft is unable to provide some means to clear the cache of live tiles or to reinitiate them. It is out of reach for the imagination of many supporters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck in describing the issue, I am weary of it.</p>

            <p>I finally used the WDRT to roll back my phone to 8.1 then updated it all the way back to the latest w10m release preview build (14393.103).&nbsp; The process was every bit as time consuming and as painful as you could imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it did resolve my tile updating problem, I know of someone who went through the same tedious process and their calendar tile still was not fixed!&nbsp; This tells me the root problem is still lurking there and could come back the next time there's an OS
 update or if I need to do another hard reset for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to stress that using WDRT should NOT be the answer to solving problems with basic functionality of the OS!&nbsp; It's like using a sledgehammer to fix a loose screw.&nbsp; Microsoft, if you're listening please fix the root problem.</p>

            Yes I fully agree with skinnypig that the problem is still lurking somewhere even though WDRT has worked for some users.In fact ,WDRT did not work for me and it was a time consuming and exhausting process which should never be required to be done to get
 a basic function of the OS working.It is a bug which even a hard reset cannot correct ! With so many feedbacks regarding this in the Feedback Hub and so many users facing this problem irrespective of the device used and no solution being provided to it except
 WDRT ,it seems to have become a frustrating situation for users WP users after Anniversary Update.

            <p>Exactly the same problems&nbsp;here!</p>
<p>I'm on 10.0.14393.448, lumia 640 ds.</p>
<p>I have tried pretty much everything (soft/hard resets and all possible settings).</p>
<p>I think it has to do with some kind of bug in privacy settings/background apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either I have turned them all&nbsp;on or off, some keep on changing/updating on the main screen (outlook mail and calendar tiles always&nbsp;dead. Only calendar updates after resizing
 the tile).</p>
<p>The only temporary solution I have found is using the OneCalendar app, which can use all data from outlook/Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think one possible solution is for MS to consider importing a windows mobile 10 build in WDRT (at least for lumias that have 8.1 roms there).</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t access my account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I can&#39;t access my account</h2>
                    Hi, so I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and I went to "Manage my account". It told me that it needed to be verified (This is my Live.co.uk account). It sent a code to an old email of mine on MSN which I still knew the password to. However, when I logged
 into the MSN account, I needed to verify this account too. The recovery code for the MSN account was sent to a Gmail account of mine. I have only 3 Gmail accounts but there was no code on any of them. I don't know what else to do. I cant even use my Xbox One
 anymore. I have tried finding a Microsoft Live Chat link but I cannot find it. I have also tried the Contact Us page on Microsoft Support but it didn't help me. Please could I have a live chat link because all I have tried have sent me to the Contact Us page.

    <title>Lenovo Yoga windows 10 screen resolution problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roihu7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Yoga windows 10 screen resolution problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I've been having a problem with my computer (running windows 10) for a little while now: when some programs are opened (like LMMS) they appear very small on my screen. I've tried adjusting the screen resolution but it didn't work. As you can see from the
 picture below the program is very small and is fixed to the top left of the screen. I don't think this is a problem with LMMS as it has happened with other software too, so I believe it's a problem with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I haven't made any changes to my computer. This didn't really start at any particular point and actually has been happening for a while, not just to LMMS but to some other programs as well. I've tried changing the screen resolution a bunch of times but
 nothing seems to help.

<h2>            Windows 7 Startup Failure&#58; BadPatch 21199471</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom built desktop computer which was running Windows 7 happily until a few weeks ago when it began failing to boot due to a bad patch.&nbsp; I was able to use system restore a few times to undo the bad patch, but each time the computer shut down it
 would automatically reinstall the patch and I'd need to do a restore.&nbsp; Finally yesterday system restore was unable to restore and I'm stuck in a reboot cycle - Windows won't start and the system restore tool won't do anything.&nbsp; I have tried restoring to various
 previous restore points, none of them work - system restore fails with an error.&nbsp; I have tried the advice in
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-pro-startup-repair-offline-error/fde4a3cf-7e75-4bfa-94f7-57e56c319da9</p>
<p>
</p><p>To no avail.&nbsp; I can't get the computer to enter safe mode and the manual restore did nothing.&nbsp; I have used bootrec.exe to fix the boot record as advised in</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/927392</p>
<p>
</p><p>No help.</p>
<p>

<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent the error to Microsoft several times so you should have the fail record.&nbsp; I was able to boot the computer to Ubuntu LiveCD and access the file system without a problem, so it's not a disk or a physical problem.&nbsp; I would appreciate some help.</p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the idea, but I couldn't get the computer to boot into safe mode.&nbsp; I just gave up and reinstalled Windows 7, losing my data.&nbsp; Since I presume the bad patch will be pushed to me again, I did the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; I hope it's more stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
