<h2>            Exporting data from Excel into Publisher - Making signs for our shop</h2>
                    <p>Hiya</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I believe that my question asks for a rather niche answer, but I've tried to search around to no avail, and this seems to be the next best place to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My father owns a couple of stores, and we mainly sell fruits/vegetables/groceries/etc. We often have to print signs to display in the shop, and they mainly differ in portrait, landscape orientation, and then the number of items on the sign, and what size.
 They all print straight to A4 size, and we then laminate and cut them to the size needed, unless they're full page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I just use Publisher and create various formats like so. When I need to print signs, I manually alter each and every textbox, and duplicate the page and then edit that too if there are several pages worth.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e90bb96-0b1d-4e4f-ad05-8dc411c9b8ba" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there was any way to create an Excel table where I could enter a list of the products I need, their respective prices and the Publisher files for the right sizes, and somehow export that data to those files, so it automatically places
 each corresponding piece of text into the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example of these vege signs:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/525ccc93-bd67-439b-bf1a-e69b557982e6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sign</strong> column says to place that row of data into the file named
<em>Veges</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Product</strong> column says to place the text&nbsp;<em>Lettuce</em> in the
<em>Name</em> box (the word Name is just to fill the space, it can be changed to Product too).<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>Price</strong> column says to place the text <em>$1.99ea</em> in the <em>
Price</em> box, in the <em>Veges</em> document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first row of data would go into the first box. Once that is filled, the second row of data goes into the second box. If all four boxes are filled, and there are more signs, it could create a second page and repeat the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That list of four items would result in this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9454e0d2-d2f7-4736-b040-49e8942be726" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I can just print that out to the desired printer, and it'll just come through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will admit a certain part of this is my laziness, and just finding an easier and quicker way to get it done, but since I'm just a 17 year old teen who still goes to school and has other things too, I'm not always around to print their signs for them. I
 had in mind to create something easy to explain for me, and as a result, easy to use for them, so I can set up a PC that they can use to print signs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't possible with Excel, could InfoPath be utilized instead? I don't really have any experience with InfoPath, though I use Excel quite often for certain office work for dad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most desirably, I would like to use drop down lists so its easier for the workers to find the exact product they want for the sign, without any unintentional mistakes in spelling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea on how to work this, or an alternative that could achieve a similar effect, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Raj</p>

            <p>I don't know that you will ever get it set up such that it is so easy you can delegate the job to someone else, but you might consider a catalog merge approach.<br />

<ul>
<li>Start an o365 plan for using yammer.</li><li>creating our cloud-only accounts on o365 with identical mail adress as our on prem AD/exchange users</li><li>using yammer for a while</li></ul>
<p>When we then start migration/connection of our on prem ad users via azure ad connect, using the mailadress as the matching attribute to merge the accounts:</p>
<p>Will the accounts in yammer still exist with all of its content and will the users then be able to login with their AD account?</p>
<p>Or will this result in a way in losing my previous cloud-only accounts and their content?</p>

            <p>Hi Ross,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the following thread for your answer:&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/windows-defender-is-turned-off-and-i-cant-turn-it/58a34482-3292-458b-867e-e4a5b7133b3f">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/windows-defender-is-turned-off-and-i-cant-turn-it/58a34482-3292-458b-867e-e4a5b7133b3f</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why does your situation differ fram the one in the above thread? What AV or other security software (ALL names and versions) do you currently have installed or have you ever had installed on your computer (even if never used)? What is your Operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above (as is usually the case), the reason is conflict with something else installed. And even if we showed you how to do it, it likely would be bad to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you want to use or think you need Windows Defender as opposed to or in addition to whatever else you are using (since it is not enough on its own as it only deals with Spyware and if disabled by an AV product it's because that product covers that
 and WD isn't needed aside from causing problems).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use a product where WD is permitted, then that error usually does not occur unless you previously used something else and didn't properly remove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, it should work for Outlook for Android (Office 365) while the rule has been set up as the Outlook for Android uses Exchange ActiveSync (synchronization between Office 365 and the Outlook for Android).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your situation, I suggest you re-move the account from Outlook for Android and then re-configure it back (Exchange ActiveSync) to see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I suggest you contact the built-in support of the App for further help (Outlook for Android related issue). You can refer to the following screenshot to contact the support.</p>

<p>Hi Vic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>m/d/yyyy date is an English (United States) date format. Did you change the region setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not go to <span>Windows <strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong> and then , click on
<strong>Change the date, time, or number format</strong></span><span> under Region and Language</span><span>:</span></p>

<p>After that, restart Office such as Word 2016 on your computer to check the outcome.</p>

<em>Office Suite doesn't follow computer settings</em>, so your answer is irrelevant. I want to know why Office displays differently (than every other program).<br />
If there's a setting in Office, where is it? I can't imagine why Office is different, unless it's a bug; or Microsoft requires one to set it independently of the computer default (which to me is also a form of bug, as in irritating).<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying.<br />

<p>Hi Vic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your PC's date format is different from date format on your Office application. For Example in the following screenshots, I have already change my date format as
<strong>dd/mm/yyyy</strong>. However. When I start Word 2016 and click Open, the date format of the document is
<strong>m/d/yyyy</strong> in Recent list, which is different.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afd73275-7380-4603-98bc-ef04c06fe1ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afd73275-7380-4603-98bc-ef04c06fe1ae" /></a></p>

<p>After I changed my region into English (United States) and the date format as M/d/yyyy, restart Word 2016 again to check the date format, they have the same date format.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a34e64af-206c-4db6-aab6-9b35889e36f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a34e64af-206c-4db6-aab6-9b35889e36f0" /></a></p>
<p>Please share more details from your side if you can't unify these to date format. Some pictures would be helpful.</p>

<p>Hi, William.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed. I tried changing the fields in Region....; no success.<br />
The pc has been restarted, all Office applications closed and re-started, various approaches; to no avail.<br />
A couple of images attached.<br />
<br />
Maybe I did something differently than you.<br />

Based on your description, I can see that the Region format as changed as English (United States). However, your system date format is set as dd/MMM/yy instead of
<strong>m/d/yyyy</strong>. Would you mind change it as the screenshot in my first reply and try it again?</p>

<h2>            &#39;Invalid&#39; footnotes and endnotes preventing access to document</h2>
                    Hi, I have just tried to open a document that I was using on OneDrive yesterday and I cannot. I get a prompt message telling me I cannot do this, the exact wording is 'Sorry Word online can't open the document because it contains footnotes or endnotes
 that are invalid'. I did put in footnotes when I last worked on the document but these were in association with the functions offered as part of the Word Online. Ideas?&nbsp;

            i am having the same issue, there is no option to send the file to anyone. &nbsp;it only says my options are to view as read only or open with word. if i try to download it and open in word, it says corrupt file. &nbsp;if i try read only, it says open in word. &nbsp;we
 have done nothing different with the file since its creation, after which it opened fine for a month or so. &nbsp;We need access to this file asap.

    <title>can zune reduce a full song to 30 sec so it&#39;s usable as ringtone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larsaronsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            can zune reduce a full song to 30 sec so it&#39;s usable as ringtone in WP7.5, or do I need other software&#63;</h2>
                    I understand WP7.5 still have not&nbsp;caught&nbsp;up with competition and that one can not use "normal" songs as ringtones, unless they have one of the 2 allowed formats, are shorter than 30 seconds (!!!!). Is there somewhere in zune I can " cut" a song so that
 it's not longer than the 30 sec? If so how? Sorry for my frustration, but I'm very disappointed with the Windows phone software, especially after having had android before. You need to catch up guys.&nbsp;
<div>Thanks for you help in advance.</div>

            <p>
</p><p>Hi FeBr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the issue may be related to the large size content of the notebook.</p>
<p>Large size content will make sync slower, because the content needs to be sent / received over the user's Internet connection.</p>
<p>I suggest you try creating a new notebook where you insert a photo to check if you can sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. The version of OneNote.</p>
<p>2. The OS version.</p>
<p>3. Check if the issue occurs on all notebook.</p>
<p>4. Where is the notebook stored?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

            <p>Hi FeBr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Instead of embedding files, upload them to a shared location and add a link to them.</p>
<p>2. Delete unnecessary pages that contain the Large Sized content types.</p>
<p>3. Delete versions history (only available on Win 32 client) make sure you don't need old versions.</p>
<p>4. Empty the Notebook Recycling Bin. (only available on Win32 client)</p>
<p>5. Try to remove large embedded files (images, videos, ...) from section and upload it OneDrive and use link to it's location.</p>
<p>6. Try to split large sections into multiple small sections, you can group them under a Section Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Check if the issue occurs when you create a new notebook where you only insert two photo.</p>
<p>2. The version number of OneNote. (Open OneNote&gt;click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>3. The screenshot of the situation <span>
“</span>keep syncing<span>”</span>.</p>
<p>4. The affected file. As we need the file to reproduce the issue.</p>

            You are right that Word 2003 is different from later versions in this respect. I don't know why.<br />
<br />
In Word 2007 and later you have to temporarily unprotect the document, add the break and then reapply protection.

</p><p>If, in the past you saw <strong>MyFile.doc</strong> and now you see <strong>MyFile.docx</strong>, that is a

Thank you. My laptop recently performed a system upgrade. Could that be why my word docs and now docx?&nbsp; Will the new docx documents "act" the same when attaching to email or uploading to&nbsp; Dropbox?

            I don't know if my files are .doc or .docx, but they got blocked from revisions. How can I change back to the original (2007?) so that I don't have to retype the whole page to upgrade the report?

<p>I sort of think we are testing Beta W10 and that includes how it works with 3rd party software.&nbsp; I use lots of 3rd party software.&nbsp; My W10 would not be much use to me if 3rd party does not run on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Norton Internet Security, mostly because I can. I can run whatever virus program I want to run.&nbsp; I did notice that Norton pulled off about 6 files on the 15025 install and the install died.&nbsp; I just turned Norton off and the install was good.&nbsp; For 15031,
 I turned Norton off for 5 hours.&nbsp; For the next Insider, I might check with Norton to see if they have caught up.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you noticed that I referred to 3rd party security programs, not 3rd party programs in general. There's quite a difference.
</p>
<p>3rd party security programs that haven't been made compatible to a specific OS can be expected to grab and quarantine unrecognized files, and block unrecognized processes, etc., which will interfere with the normal behavior of the OS; whereas 3rd party browsers,
 office programs, accounting programs, etc., may or may not run correctly, but they are not designed to capture unrecognized files and/or block normal processes that occur in the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, we are expected to run a variety of 3rd party programs in testing the preview builds, but not ones that are designed to do things that compromise the normal behavior of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 3rd party security program provider cannot be expected to keep up with all the revisions of their program that would be necessary to always be compatible with each week's new preview build, and since the compatibility of their program with the OS is their
 responsibility, not Microsoft's, what does one accomplish by using the 3rd party security program to cause problems with the OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it legitimate feedback to report irregularities caused by the incompatible 3rd party security program as though they were defects in the build being tested?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if the 3rd party security program is installed in a publicly released Windows 10 version, after the provider of the 3rd party security program has specified that it is tested and compatible with that version, one might expect it to not
 cause problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm wasting ink, here, but I get it wholesale, and have budgeted for it.&nbsp;

    <title>N97 Compass, your experience&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N97 Compass, your experience&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just about to head out the office so sorry for the quick post, I've got the compass application off the Ovi store but it never seems to show the correct direction. &nbsp;I've tried it in the open away from buildings and cars too...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have the ARound (<a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/10357_ARound_and_about-augmented_rea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/10357_ARound_and_about-augmented_rea.php</a>) app installed and it gets a GAPS fix
 etc but the compass symbol always stays red indicating it doesn't have a reliable reading from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched the boards quickly before I decided to write this as there doesn't seem to be a specific post regarding the compass and other users of the N97s&nbsp;experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            If you haven't already done so, disable the auto rotate facility in settings on your phone. Then load Nokia Maps and turn the phone frolm face up to face down several times and the red ring on the compass will turn green. Mine would never calibrate with
 handset auto rotation enabled and disabling it fixed the problem.

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I haven't used Nokia Maps much but it seems a good proving ground for the compass. I have the auto-rotate off as default and after a while the compass symbol on Nokia Maps went yellow then green. &nbsp;At that point I left Nokia Maps running
 and fired up the compass application also as it give a heading indicator too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the compass application in conjunction with a Nokia N95 running an application which also provides GPS speed and direction the heading was different in both. &nbsp;The GPS heading was 20deg and the N97 compass was 95deg, that's quite a bit out and
 I felt that 20deg was more like the direction we were heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is is this innacuracy normal or do I have a 'duffer'?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since loading the Ovi Maps 3.1 Beta it seems like the compass calibration is off by about 5 degrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fluxgate compass on my GMC Yukon SUV has a calibration setting to compensate for magnetic vs. true north deviation depending on where you are (13 settings in the US alone).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if there is any such smarts in the N97 compass application?</p>

            I have been helping beta test a Symbian app on my N97 for the developers and in the process we found two bugs. One was in the program itself which the developers have fixed. The other turned out to be in the Nokia GPS SYSTEM WHIcH causes it to provide
 innacurate location data. The probblem has now been reported to Nokia for them to fix.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the caps issue above but my phone went crazy momentarily.

<p>How long before Nokia can get the GPS software bug fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the Compass--since going to Ovi Maps 3.1 Beta...the compass will sometimes calibrate but often turn around and point the wrong direction flipping the entire screen (looks like Cap'n Jack Sparrow's compass in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No--I've checked to make sure that I'm not near any magnets or electromagnetic fields and I've turned off the auto-rotate sensor feature, so I don't think that is the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that I'll hold out until v20 firmware in October before I give up and send this phone back to Nokia for repair-or-replacement.</p>

<p>Besides the compass being "off" sometime by more than the 5 degrees that I've previously reported, the GPS altitude gets way off!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GPS Location applet&nbsp;shows me (while standing still at my workplace) as being --295 ft (below sea level) when I am more like 122 ft above sea level, it also shows a 40+ typical altitude acceleration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No wonder the Maps application can't get a fix properly!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on Nokia...get this worked into v20 firmware and out NOW!!</p>

            &nbsp; Compass app works by instructions from the GPS. And GPS's direction is never affected any magnetic fields! So no magnetic compensation is needed. But the accuracy will not be great because of the time lag.

<p>The compass is a vector magnetometer. It measures magnetic field direction.. Think of this problem..</p>
<p>You're blind, in a field on a clear day with a directional thermometer..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to know where the sun is..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You point the thermometer up and take a reading.. You'd need to move the meter around to find the highest temperature.. that would be when you're pointing directly at the sun..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you repeat the experiment the next day (when it might be cloudier) you'd need to "recalibrate" maximum since there might be a bit more cloud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same with the compass.. the magnetic field strength changes depending on where you are.. and what you're near..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crazy calibration motion is a bit pants.. I remember hand held GPS devices (garmin I think) with compasses.. They were calibrated simply by rotating the device slowly.. if it were on a desk, you'd just spin it round two or three times.. That seems to
 work for the N97 too..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pisser that the compass needs it..but it is going to be some funky hardware that isn't going to need regular calibration!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>The pen style options in <strong>OneNote </strong>may vary depending on the app that you're using.<strong> OneNote 2016

<p>Hi Darwin, seriously why would Microsoft create different versions of OneNote when the whole purpose of onenote is to curate information? a curation tool shouldn't have so much variation. 2016 should just be a cut down version of win 10 then not different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have continual sync issues with Onenote (Win 10) and have to use onenote 2016 - but I don't want to. The one thing OneNote 2016 has is a export function that allows me to effectively create a backup offline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the prompt response. Microsoft decided to create two different versions of
<strong>OneNote </strong>in order to keep some legacy functionality that are available only to the
<strong>OneNote 2016</strong> app. On the other hand, <strong>OneNote </strong>or
<strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong> is designed to receive regular updates which includes new functions, features, and security.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, accessing your <strong>OneNote </strong>notebook should look and feel the same, the features may just vary depending on the version that you're using. Regarding your concern, could you tell us more about the
<strong>OneNote</strong> sync issues. It will help us understand the situation better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Usage Report</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to understand the below scenario. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>1. I want to understand how Office 365 calculate active user and inactive users in the usage report. When the report say we have 5000 active user over the last 180 days, what criteria define a user as active
 or inactive?</p>
<p>2. What is the numbers and criteria determining a user is active or inactive?</p>
<p>3. Are sharing and Sync activity not determining the active/inactive status?</p>
<p>4. Does single received message in Exchange in the last 180 days automatically categories that account is active in Exchange?</p>
<p>5. Users are regularly accessing the emails through IMAP and POP protocols however the email app usage report doesn't shows any activity.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Suji,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad to help you for your case here, the short answers ( A1~ A5) for your questions as below:</p>
<p>A1.&nbsp; The criteria that defined active user in office 365 is the Office 365 licensed users have activities in the past.&nbsp; For example the licensed Exchange users read or sent emails in the past days.</p>
<p>A2. &nbsp;The criteria is Office 365 <strong>licenses</strong>, the number is the licensed users had
<strong>the number of activities</strong> in the past. For example sent an email, made skype for business calls or sent IM etc.</p>
<p>A3. &nbsp;Yes, the sharing and sync activity are regarded as active status.</p>
<p>A4. &nbsp;If the single user received a message and read it in the past 180 days, as we talked above, for example he read an email in the past, this is recognized as active user in the Exchange.</p>
<p>A5.&nbsp; As the office 365 usage report is related to the <strong>
Exchange online licensed activities</strong> ( Exchange Protocol), so if your users access the emails via POP/IMAP protocols in the past, he may not be recognized as active user, and the activities don’t show up in the report, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about the office 365 usage report with active users, please refer to

            <p>In this case there's no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a theme is designed you can set the font for Headings and either the same or&nbsp; a different font for Body Text. If they are both Calibri then it makes no difference which you choose. The menu is just telling you what the Body and Title font is set to.</p>

<p>My experience of the use of Calibri (Heading) and Calibri(Body) on both Office 365 for Mac is different between Word and Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I am presented with a choice between Calibri Light (Headings) and Calibri (Body)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, the Body font just displays a little darker and &nbsp;Calibri Light (Heading) font appears a little lighter, as its name implies. That is the only difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in Excel, in addition to the difference in font weight, the the Calibri Light (Heading) just appears a little lighter, but the Calibri (Body) font, in addition to having a heavier weight, also inserts a full 12 points of leading vertical spacing before
 the text I enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens in some cells set with General formatting, and specifically with 12 point font. It doesn't happen with other font sizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows up when you auto height the row by double clicking on the row divider in the left hand axis of the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on menu bar Format &gt; Row &gt; Autofit also does not reset the row height and leaves a blank line at the top of the cell. Manually dragging the row up will eliminate the row (when cell formatting is on "align bottom"), but the moment you do a row height
 auto fit either by clicking on the left hand column or thought the menus, the blank line reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NO hidden carriage return or line down character at the beginning or end of the line of text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't happen on every cell, and I can't identify what triggers this behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is very annoying in Excel. I want the heavier font weight but I do not want the wasted vertical space, particularly in a large spreadsheet with hundreds of rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why the different behaviour between Word365 and Excel365 for Mac or what's happening in Excel?</p>

<p>I didn't have this problem ever with old 8.1 laptop. All other websites are ok.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to access a specific website. This issue could be if you are connected to any domain network or there is any restriction applied on surfing to these websites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As&nbsp;you are unable to open one specific website then, </span><span>there might be a chance that the website is not compatible to Internet Explorer. So, I would suggest you to open those websites in compatibility view and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open <strong>website </strong>which is getting blocked.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>alt key </strong>to open<strong> tool bar</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now click on <strong>tools</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then click on <strong>Compatibility view settings</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You will see the <strong>name of </strong><strong>website
</strong>under <strong>Add this website</strong>, so click on <strong>add </strong>
to add this website.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Close the <strong>window </strong>and restart your computer.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists you may try to trust those websites by following the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Open the trusted sites</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <em><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></em>.</span></li><li><span>Press the <strong>Alt key </strong>to make the <strong>tools </strong>menu visible.</span></li><li><span>In the menu, click <em><span><strong>Tools</strong></span></em>.</span></li><li><span>Now click <em><span><strong>Internet Options</strong></span></em>.</span></li><li><span>Go to the <em><span><strong>Security</strong></span></em><strong> tab</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <em><span><strong>Trusted sites</strong></span></em>.</span></li><li><span>Click <em><span><strong>Sites</strong></span></em><strong>.</strong></span></li></ol>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong></p>

    <title>Ruler alignment in word tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ruler alignment in word tables</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with the way the ruler aligns at the top of the page in MS word when I am working in a table. I have tried searching online for solutions but am not even sure I am using the correct terminology. I think the best why to explain this is
 with a picture. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03cc3566-6968-4bd7-8821-1f8fc1468a09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03cc3566-6968-4bd7-8821-1f8fc1468a09" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see each column border is offset from the related marker in the ruler. This causes further problems when trying to add bullets to the table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issues only happens when in the table. If I click back to the rest of the document the problem goes away. If I add a fresh new table however it has the same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Jon</p>
