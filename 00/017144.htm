<h2>            One Email account has two associated pst files and I can&#39;t change the &#34;Default&#34;, access messages etc.</h2>
                    <p>Probably as the result moving&nbsp;data from my old PC (Vista Home/Outlook 2007) to my new Laptop (Windows 7 64bit/Outlook 2010), when I set up my email account on my Laptop, two entries (having the same "Name") appear&nbsp;in the Data Files Tab of Account Settings.
 Each entry is&nbsp;associated with a different Data File (pst).&nbsp;One pst file has the address C:\Users\WallingPG\App\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\Peter Walling.pst; the other C:\Users\WallingPG\Documents\Outlook Files\Peter Walling.pst. (For the sake of brevity&nbsp;I shall
 refer to them in future &nbsp;as Jack&nbsp;and Jill)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Jack"is&nbsp;I think, the one which actually holds my messages, contacts &amp; calendar&nbsp;(from my old PC)&nbsp;with "Jill"&nbsp;&nbsp;being a&nbsp;pst created by Outlook 2010;&nbsp;it only occupies 1505 Kb. Unfortunately "Jill" (the "empty" file) is set as the "default" Data File&nbsp;and I am
 unable to change it to "Jack" in the Data Files tab as the "Set as Default Option" is greyed out. If I delete "Jill"&nbsp;from the Laptop's "C" drive&nbsp;I am unable to open Outlook as "the default data file is missing" and I have to restore it from the Recycle Bin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, two "Peter Walling" named entries&nbsp;appeared in the Navigation pane (using&nbsp;"Jack" and "Jill" pst files respectively). To differentiate between them,&nbsp; I&nbsp;renamed one of the Navigation entries&nbsp;and then (via Options) I changed the settings so Outlook
 opened with the name associated with "Jack", which contains&nbsp;the messages. Unfortunately&nbsp;I am not offered two names for Calendar and Contacts so seemingly I automatically am given&nbsp;access to "Jill" -&nbsp;consequently no Calendar entries and no Contact names!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I think I'd like to achieve is just one "live" pst so that when I select "Mail" I get my messages, "Calendar" displays my appointments and&nbsp;"Contacts" lists&nbsp;my address book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry this question is so long and reads like a fairy tale&nbsp;but I am tearing my hair out. Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks Peter&nbsp;</p>

            It is just showing that NPV result is very close to 0 because of a common phenomenon called Floating Point Calculation..Refer to following links to know more about this.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I looked into this a couple of years ago.&nbsp; The claims that many websites make to be able to crack Office 2007 file-open passwords are largely a false leftover from Office 2003 [which could be cracked easily].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your password was particularly short then you might get lucky but that would not be certain.&nbsp; Even to try, however, would mean giving your credit card details to a crook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, if you have forgotten the password then you have lost your data.</p>

                    My lumia 735 windows phone worked great with Microsoft sync in my 2015 ford flex.&nbsp; the phone came with Windows 8.&nbsp; I was forced to update to Windows 10 in order to keep facebook messenger on my phone.&nbsp; Now my lumia with windows 10 doesn't work with my
 ford sync like it use to.&nbsp; Is anyone else have an issue?&nbsp; I went to my dealership and their tech guy had never seen a windows phone so he couldn't help me.&nbsp; Ford is telling me to get a new phone, but I bought this one because it works with ford sync better
 then other phones.&nbsp; Does anyone else have this issue?&nbsp; Is there a fix coming?&nbsp; Do I just need to buy a new phone?

<p>Microsoft Lumia 735 phone with windows 10 mobile&nbsp; I am not sure of the build version, where would I find that?&nbsp; the update came from the Upgrade advisor app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before Windows 10, my phone was on Windows 8.&nbsp; When paired with Ford Sync in my 2015 Flex, when I got a text, the audio on my car would say over the speakers, "You have a text message from William, would you like me to read it or ignore it?"&nbsp; Then I would
 here a beep to replay verbally and I would say "Read it."&nbsp; Then she would read the text out lout to me over the speakers.&nbsp; After that she would ask me over the speakers "Do you want to reply or are you done?"&nbsp; If I say Reply, she would ask me again over the
 speaker (all this was over the speakers, I didn't have to touch a button on my screen or steering wheel) what would you like to say.&nbsp; I would respond.&nbsp; Then she would ask me, do you want to send, add more or are you done?"&nbsp; She would always read my vm back
 to me until I was done adding what I wanted to it.&nbsp; Then I would say send.&nbsp; She would then say message sent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Windows 10, I hear a beep and there on my screen it says I have a vm and I have to now take my eyes off the road to hit a button for her to read a text to me.&nbsp; after that she doesn't ask me if I would like to respond, etc.&nbsp; It just goes away.&nbsp; I
 bought this phone to work with this car and now since windows 10 it doesn't work like it use too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the phone from the car and added it back.&nbsp; The Ford dealership tech guy rebooted my computer in the car and paired them again.&nbsp; No one seems to be able to get it back to the way it was working for text messages.&nbsp; So I am going to assume Windows
 8 worked great with Ford Sync and Windows 10 doesn't.&nbsp; I am not happy!&nbsp; I gave up all my favorite apps from my iPhone to have a Microsoft phone to specifically work great with my ford sync.&nbsp; Now I have a Microsoft phone that doesn't have apps nor does it work
 with my car! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Use Windows Explorer and look at the permissions set on the folders and files on the external drive.&nbsp; Probably they're marked Read-Only on the drive.&nbsp; Turn off read-only there.</p>

            Thanks. I checked the properties for the files and they are not marked real only. I use this hard drive on other computers and have not had this problem. I don't know if it's unique to my computer with Windows 7&nbsp;or&nbsp;Office 2010 or both. My other computer
 has Office 2007 with xpPro.

            No - the macro depends on your having pre-formatted the cells for text entry (to keep leading 0s) and entering a string that is 8 numeric characters long. You can enter values into as many cell as you want, using Ctrl-Enter, and the code will check them
 all. &nbsp;Note that if you need to re-enter a value, it will need to be entered as a date or you need to format the cell for text prior to entering the new 8 digit date string. The code will work for as many columns as you format as text.

<p>You have a Virgin handset with Virgin-specific firmware. Since Virgin do not offer 4G services, this option is not available on your handset. I do not believe that you can enable 4G oprion on your handset, this can only be done by a software patch, which
 has to be approved by Virgin. And since they don't offer 4G services, it is very unlikely that they will request such a patch from Nokia.</p>

            <p>Hi Tariq,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When apps are not opening, the first thing you can do is to refresh the phone by doing a soft reset. Press both the volume down button and the power button for about 10 seconds until phone vibrates. Turn the phone ON and relaunch the app. Also, you may want
 to check if there's any app updates from Store. The current app version you may have is outdated and might require some update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Money Sunset Version Stopped Working on Windows 10 with Edge, Asks for IE 6.0</h2>
                    <p>Folks, major problem!! I just updated to latest Windows 10 build 10240&nbsp;(presumably production version?) and clicked on Microsoft Money to check on my finances. Money popped up a notice saying it needs IE 6.0 to run and quit on me?</p>
<p>It was working just fine on previous builds of Windows 10. So I tried to install an older version of IE but it refuses to install saying I already have the latest version of IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to make Money work on Windows 10. Ironically all 3 (Windows, IE and Money) are Microsoft's own products :(</p>

<h2>            Account Hacked&#33; I Have Screenshot Proof</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>My account has been hacked since May 26, 2016. The hacker hacked my phone number via SIM card, went on to reset the password using my phone number, and took out my phone number and replaced it with their own email as backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have proof that I was totally hacked such as when Microsoft texted me stating, " -my phone number- deleted from Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Not you? https://account.live.com/a", my drivers license since my full name is on the account, as well
 as an activity log proivded by T-Mobile that my phone number was hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried recovery forms and I always fail due to me not remembering the information on the account. I've also tried contacting *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but they never get back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. My income is at stake if I do not get the proper help needed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            APOP&#47;MD5 authentication on Windows Mobile 6</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something I am trying to figure out for a friend of mine over the phone, but I was having trouble walking him through it so I said I'd go ahead and ask the question. We set up a mail account using POP 3. The server in question requires authentication
 for incoming mail - I know on PALMOS it's an option labeled APOP. He was not able to find any such option on Windows Mobile 6, other than SSL for outgoing mail.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point us to where this option is?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>Normally for incoming mail it will use your set up information. For outgoung mail (SMTP settings) there is a check box for authentication.<br />
<br />
But in the advanced settings (in the smtp set-up screen) you have an option" require SSL for Incoming Mail" That's probably what you need.</p>

<h2>            User cannot login to Outlook</h2>
                    I have a user that changed her first name and now she cannot login. I've checked her account in O365 and Azure and all appears to be fine. When she tries to login, it says "Something went wrong, try again." Her Office product was not licensed to her at
 first, so I re-licensed her and reinstalled Office to fix that. But she still cannot login. Auto discovery is working and I tested it.

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your clarification, the user cannot login to Outlook desktop app. Firstly, please try to clear the credential in Credential Manager to check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/870c5664-a57c-4683-ade1-6d04ab26c233?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/870c5664-a57c-4683-ade1-6d04ab26c233?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And to narrow down this issue, please try to sign in Outlook Web App (OWA) to check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/mail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/mail/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, to my knowledge, in Office 365 online environment, the change of display name won't affect the sign-in progress since the sign in address is username/email address. Therefore, I'd like to collect the following information to better understand the
 situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Where did the user change her name?</p>
<p>2. Is the user in Office 365<strong> pure cloud</strong> environment? If not, please let me know the details.</p>
<p>3. Please capture a screenshot of the entire error message for us.</p>
<p>4. Also, if it's just a client issue, please capture a screenshot of Outlook version info via File &gt; Office Account &gt; About Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Hi Wrandi,</p>
<p>Based on my test, to let students only access their own information in a workbook, we need to add separately workbooks instead of different worksheets in a workbook for them as we cannot assign specific permissions on different worksheets.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Laptop booting taking up too long in build 10130</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is my second Laptop that running windows 10 TP. In this ASUS Laptop including Intel Celeron 1007U 1.5 Ghz with 4 GB RAM and intel graphic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first install build is 10122 and that was took very long time in boot and starting the Laptop. After I update to build 10130, I wish the booting issue have been fix. But I still facing the same issue with booting up. I need to force shut down the laptop
 for the long long booting. It stuck on the Windows Logo with no loading&nbsp;sign. After I force shut down and restarting, the laptop show the lockscreen and I loging in but it's took a little bit longer than my first Laptop. In the desktop screen, the taskbar
 icon appear In a long time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This experience in my second laptop was so different and less comfortable than my first laptop (HP Pavillion with AMD Processor A10, AMD Radeon Graphic and 4 GB RAM). The first laptop is very smooth and enjoyable. I'm hoping the same experience in my second
 laptop like my first one, but it's kinda disappoint me in booting start issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping some help to fix this issue. I don't know if it need a better Hardware or not. Thanks for your attention.</p>

            Similar situation here, with i7 and nvidia 750m. I can't even install it. After few restarts it simply get stuck on blank screen for more then few hours. A lot of free space is available. And, as expected, it fails to boot and cannot be repaired. I booted
 once, but after restart situation was the same.&nbsp;

    <title>Live Mail login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayhem147  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail login</h2>
                    <p>My wife and I share a computer. She has a Hotmail account, which is now Live Mail and I have a Microsoft login because I use OneDrive.</p>
<p>Quite often when my wife wants to check her email (via web browser) she gets my Live Mail email instead, which I don't even use.</p>
<p>Is there a way, perhaps by modifying the shortcut, to have the Live Mail on my web browser always default to her email account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>

<h3> boab_843  say:</h3>
<h2>            DUB408-M.HOTMAIL.COM Server is down&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 8.1 phone and set my Calendar to sync with my Outlook.com a/c. On my PC I have Office 2016 and in Outlook I set up a Calendar to sync with Outlook.com also, so updating either my phone or PC calendar would automatically update the other.
 Been working fine for the past 9 months. Suddenly in mid-October 2017 my phone cannot sync with Outlook.com, nor can my PC's Outlook 2016 calendar! After checking on the internet i find i can log into my Outlook.com account and see my calendar now (couldn't
 for a couple of weeks initially), but it still doesn't sync with other 2 calendars! I found a website -&nbsp;http://www.websitedown.info/dub408-m.hotmail.com, which confirms that the Dub408-M.Hotmail.com server is still down, as at today's date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this server actually down? Have to wait until it is fixed? Can't believe a server has been 'down' for such a lengthy time. So, is there some action i can take to get me back on sync?</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>

<p>
</p><p>I assume I merely have to wait until this fix actually hits my account? As yet, I still cannot sync my phone calendar or Outlook 2016 Calendar. However, I did update my Outlook.com calendar with a test entry, to find it updated to my Windows 10 Calendar.
 But I really use my phone and Outlook 2016 in the main, so hope the fix you mention will resolve my issue in the near future.</p>

<p>Hint: Be sure the number you wish to call is included in the subscription!</p>
<p>Tip: If you do not plan to keep the subscription after the trial ends, be sure to cancel it at least three days prior to the trial term's expiration date - or you will be charged for a month of service which you may not need.</p>
<p>Otherwise, purchasing a small amount of Skype credit - cover call and connection fees - is all that would be needed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You cannot- MSE doesn't do real-time scanning of emails. Do you have reason to disable the scanning of attached files when they are opened or saved?</p>

    <title>Pages added in OneNote universal app doesn&#39;t show up in classic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason55555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pages added in OneNote universal app doesn&#39;t show up in classic app &#40;but works the other way around&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Problem:&nbsp; When I add a new page/content in the same OneNote notebook starting from OneNote
<strong><em>classic </em></strong>app, no issues - after sync, it appears in OneNote online, and OneNote universal app on my Surface Pro.&nbsp; However, if I create new page/content with OneNote
<strong><em>universal </em></strong>app, it does not appear in any other programs - can't see it (in the same notebook) if viewed online, or using OneNote classic app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote classic app --&gt; OneNote universal app = good, sync works</p>
<p>OneNote universal app --&gt; OneNote classic app = doesn't sync, can't view in classic app or online</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sync is clearly working, but only 1 way.&nbsp; When using my Surface Pro and pen, this becomes a problem because it ink likes to start in universal app (and there's good reason for that - inking support is much better in universal app.)&nbsp; When content is created
 in the universal app, it stays there - I can view the content later in universal app.... so the data is there!&nbsp; It's just not visible on classic app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using:</p>
<p>OneNote classic = Version 1710 (build 8625.2121 click-to-run/Office Professional Plus 2016)</p>
<p>OneNote universal =&nbsp;Version 17.8625.21151.0</p>
<p>Surface Pro, Win10pro ver 1709</p>
<p>Everything is updated... and yes, I've rebooted&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I resolved the issue, but unfortunately I lost some data.&nbsp; I ran the Windows app troubleshooter - it found some possibly corrupted certificate, so it cleaned and rebooted - I tested this against OneNote and it still showed the same
 behavior.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded the OneNote diagnostic tool, and looked thru the log files and sent a set via the upload function.&nbsp; Nothing obvious there, but it was fun looking thru that program... lots of XML files - no real good documentation after install about how
 to use it, but easily found the executable in the program files directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the OneNote app seemed to be the focus of the problem, I did an uninstall, and re-install from the Windows Store.&nbsp; Gladly, this seemed to resolve the issue - however, I did lose whatever pages that were created with OneNote app and that were not synced.&nbsp;
 Mostly all of the debug stuff I created, so not too much lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, both OneNote client apps (app and Win32) are functioning and syncing normally.&nbsp; Next time, I just need to check more frequently, and perhaps back up/export unsynched pages and then do the app reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Excited to use my Surface/Pen again!&nbsp; The Surface Pen shortcuts are very nice to have so long as OneNote is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>
