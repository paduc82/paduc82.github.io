<p>Hi Anderson,</p>
<p>Good day.</p>
<p>Dirsync integration is only available to a Verified Administrator Account. It must be sync with the Admin account that you used when you installed Dirsync. If the account that you are using to access the Directory integration option is not the Verified Administrator
 that you used when you installed Dirsync. Then you would be getting this message. I hope this makes it clear. thank you.</p>

            <p>the phone app sometimes has message contact customer service 702, I have no idea what customer service it refers to. I have uninstalled the phone app and reinstalled it several times if I try to add my account as IMAP it doesn't work, if I try to add as
 outlook account I enter my Microsoft account and password and get the message the server has timed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My email is through time warner, the servers are mail.twc.com. I used this to set up outlook 2016 on my pc, the mail synced right away. I still can't sync contacts from people or sync the live calendar on my pc. outlook.com and live calendar still do
 not work. I have tried all the troubleshooters I can find. now every time I open outlook on my pc I get the message to enter my username and password for the mail.twc.com server, I do this and check save password, it keeps coming back. that information has
 not changed. I checked credential manager to be sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as for&nbsp;my account&nbsp;migrating to a new server, is Microsoft migrating? my mail servers haven't changed that I am aware of. should the process take days?</p>

<h2>            Unable to open Excel&#47;Word&#47;PowerPoint files in native mode on Office 365 after installing OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 2013 installed on my business laptop.&nbsp; I often&nbsp;edit Office files stored on Office 365 SharePoint sites.&nbsp; Some of these files are my files that I uploaded to the SharePoint and other files were uploaded by other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing OneDrive, I can no longer open any document stored on an O365 SharePoint site using "Open in Excel", "Open in Word", or "Open in PowerPoint".&nbsp; When I try this, the application opens and I see a blank gray screen where the file content should
 be displayed.&nbsp; The application menu tabs (Home, Insert, Design, etc.) at the top of the screen are active however all the&nbsp;user actions&nbsp;(icons to click, etc.)&nbsp;on those tabs are grayed out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to open and edit&nbsp;the files using "Open in Excel Online", "Open in Word Online" and "Open in PowerPoint Online"&nbsp;but I would like to open and edit&nbsp;the files in their native mode as I did before&nbsp;I installed OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have un-installed Office 2013 on my laptop and installed it again.&nbsp; This did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas on how to resolve the problem are appreciated.</p>

            Hi S. Karen,<br />
<br />
To better understand the situation, please confirm the following information:<br />
1. Check if you can open a document from your local disk normally.<br />
2. Uninstall the OneDrive sync client you just installed, and then do an <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

3. How did you install your Office 2013? From Office 365 portal (Click-to-Run) or with an MSI installer?<br />
4. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which OneDrive sync client have your installed?</a><br />
5. Provide a screenshot of the situation.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have been experiencing the same problem for the past few weeks.&nbsp; I used to be able to simply navigate to a doc on OneDrive and choose "edit in PowerPoint." PowerPoint would open the doc on my desktop, I would edit, and save back to OneDrive.&nbsp; I could do
 this while other people were editing the file at the same time -- it worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I can navigate to the file, download it, and edit it in the browser. The only thing I CAN"T do is edit in the desktop PowerPoint (or word, or excel) client.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>One important note</strong></span>, this only happens when I am trying to edit a doc that is on one of my clients OndDrive for Business shares.&nbsp; This has been working great for months, but a few weeks ago stopped
 working.&nbsp; We have spend hours and hours on the phone with their tier 2 and 3 support and they are convinced the problem is not on my end. (They are sharing with my O365 hosted organizational account, authenticating against Azure AD.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To answer your questions from above:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Downloading and editing the file work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I only have the consumer OneDrive sync client installed -- version 2015, Build 17.3.6390.0509.&nbsp; It uses my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have flattened three machines and reinstalled Office on them with no success.&nbsp; In every case I used the click-to-run method.&nbsp; I have also tried three versions of Office:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Office 365, business subscription. Installed from portal.office.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Office 2013, installed from office.com/setup</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Office 2016, installed from office.com/setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. See answer for question #2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I could take a screenshot, but it's pretty simple:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. try to open doc through "open in PowerPoint" command</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. I am asked what account I want to use to open the doc</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. I am taken to a screen that asks me to click on the account I want to use (I have two O365 accounts and one MSA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d. It loops through this process a few times until I get an error saying it could not open the doc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on machines that are both joined to our O365 service, and on machines where I've signed in with my MSA.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, this is causing a huge problem for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes I can open a document from my local disk using normal method, that is, clicking on the Excel/Word/PowerPoint file name in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>I installed the OneDrive&nbsp;for Business sync client&nbsp;provided by my employer using a script.&nbsp; I installed OneDrive&nbsp;a few weeks ago and moved my files there at that time.&nbsp; The same is true for the Office 2013 installation.</p>

            Hi S.Karen,<br />
<br />
I noticed there is a yellow mark next to your account in the screenshot. You can click it to check the error message. Do you sign into the Office applications with the same work/school account which you use to access SharePoint Online?
<br />
<br />
Moreover, do you mean the OneDrive for Business sync client is included in the Office suite? You can check its edition referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> mentioned in Jiaxing's post.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please open one of the Office applications&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of Product Information and share it with us. If the files are synced with the sync client, when you access the synced folder to open them, will you encounter the issue?<br />
<br />
Let other uses who can open the files in this library, check if they encounter the same issue.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

<p>
</p><p>The error message is:</p>
<p>ACCOUNT ERROR:</p>
<p>Sorry, we can't get to your account right now.</p>
<p>To fix this, please sign in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed out of O365, went to office.com to sign in again.&nbsp; I have SSO for O365 so it immediately displayed "Welcome Karen" and I don't have to enter credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sync client says OneDrive - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (my employer).&nbsp;&nbsp;The sync client&nbsp;was not included in the Office Suite. These were two separate installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can successfully open Excel files in the OneDrive directory but not on 365 SharePoint sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I open an Excel file "using Excel" on an O365 SharePoint site, I still see the gray screen where the content should be however the&nbsp;yellow mark with
 the ACCOUNT ERROR&nbsp;is now gone.</p>

<h2>            Numbered List Style - Tabs Reset when Numbering Set to 1&#59; Numbered Styles to not Hold Formatting</h2>
                    Here's the problem: I have created 3 levels of Numbered List Styles for use in the templates I created for my project. The Level 1 style is not indented. When users use it for a list, insert regular body text after, and then use the&nbsp;Level 1 style later
 in the document, the new list continues the numbering from the previous list. When they set the numbering for the second list back to start at 1, the list indents a quarter inch.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            PowerPoint Designer has Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>I was noodling around setting up a presentation I'm building, and was offered some layout options. They are layouts I've never seen before. I left to do some other things, and can't for the life of me figure out where they came from or what I did to get
 them. The background picture I'm using on the content slide seems to be permanently affixed, and can't be removed easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first slide is the presentation title; the second slide is a content page. I am just stymied as to where they came from; I didn't create them from scratch, but they were suggestions offered to me after I inserted background pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how this happened and where they came from? I've never seen a content slide with this kind of side-by-side title/content layout. Quite neat.</p>

<p>Yes, I thought I was. However, for some reason, I'm no longer getting access to it. I have the Design Ideas button on the ribbon, but invoking it gets me a "no design ideas for this slide" text; inserting a picture does not automatically result in design

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I.e. the overall percentage complete for my project is currently 12% but I need info on percentage on track overall. ( 12 % but should be for example 20 % complete as per baseline programme)?

            <p>EoghanH,</p>
<p>First, I'll assume you set a baseline and that your version of Project 2010 is fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no baseline percent complete field but you can create one using a couple custom fields. First customize a Duration field with the following formula:</p>
<p>Duration1=ProjDateDiff([Baseline Start],[Current Date])</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the "calculation for task and group summary rows" as a summed rollup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then customize a Text field with the following formula:</p>
<p>Text1=[Duration1]/[Baseline Duration]*100 &amp; "%"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the "calculation for task and group summary rows" to use the formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>The custom text field (Text1) will give equivalent values for "expected complete" as of the current date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hello LiliJoburg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, some users has fixed this kind issue via update the Outlook for Mac 2016 version to the latest one. Since you can't open the Outlook for Mac client, please go to the other Office
 application like Word, Excel or PowerPoint to update the Office suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 crashes when trying to select landscape layout</h2>
                    Anyone else experiencing a crash when trying to create a document in landscape mode? &nbsp;I first noticed the issue when I opened a document that was already in landscape mode. &nbsp;Everything opened fine and I was able to edit and save the document. &nbsp;However,
 when I tried to save the document as a pdf the entire program crashed. &nbsp;There was no error message to indicate what happened, the program just crashed. &nbsp;I originally thought that maybe there was an issue with the document that was causing it to crash, so I
 decided to start from scratch and create a brand new document. &nbsp;I went back in to word, selected a new document, and then went to Layout &gt; Orientation &gt; Landscape. &nbsp;Word then decided to just crash again. &nbsp;I then pulled in the latest upgrade to see if maybe
 that was the issue, but still nothing. &nbsp;I then decided to do a full online repair of the office suite, restarted my machine, and it still didn't fix the issue. &nbsp;My final step was

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with your concern regarding the crashing of Microsoft Word, let me suggest that you remove the add-ins in the application in
<em><strong>safe mode</strong></em>. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R </strong></em>&gt; Type
<em><strong>winword /safe </strong></em>and Microsoft Word will open. Press <em><strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Manage: COM Add-ins &gt; Go &gt; Uncheck the given add-ins
</strong></em>then click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>and see if the issue persist. We suggested to disable the add-ins through safe mode to make sure that the Word application itself will not be affected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes for us to assist you further. </p>

<h2>            Word for Mac 2016 freezes with black window when opening files</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running word for mac 2016 as part of an office365 E3 license on my macbook air running El Capitan.</p>
<p>Every time I open a document Word freezes ('does not react' in activity view) with a black window and a spinning beachball.</p>
<p>When I wait long enough (minutes) it eventually comes trough. It doesn't matter whether the document is small, large, local or on a file server.</p>
<p>This is frustrating. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find my config details below:</p>
<p>Macbook Air medio 2011, 4GB RAM</p>
<p>OSX El Capitan v 10.11.3</p>
<p>Word for Mac v 15.18 (160109)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other office apps such as excel and outlook are sluggish too but word is what i used most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a fix which I google earlier and it seemed to help initially but unfortunately the problem is back:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">sudo update_dyld_shared_cache –force</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue and what can be done about it. it is really frustrating and impacting my productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope you have a solution. Let me know if you need more info.</p>
<p>kind regards,</p>
<p>Xavier</p>

            As the situation was no longer tollerable I ended up buying a MBP with 8GB. So far so good. Not sure whether it is the RAM or because it is a clean install.

</p><p>Yes, it is possible.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You can fistly buy the Office 365 Business Premium Subscription with correct quatity of licenses and then assign the Office 365 Business Premium license to each user. At last, remove the user's original Exchange Online (Plan 2) license and cancel it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The process will (clean) re-install the current software version in your C3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can always choose to &nbsp;(re)install the latest update using Nokia Suite on your PC via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

            OK I cannot see what the mechanism invoved here is, but the following macro in the normal template should work around it<br />
<br />
Sub EditPaste()<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
Set oRng = Selection.Range<br />
oRng.Paste<br />
If ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdWebView Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oRng.InlineShapes(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Err.Number &gt; 0 Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ScaleHeight = 100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ScaleWidth = 100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
This should paste normally, but if in Web view you paste an in-line image it will be resized to 100%<br />

<h2>            OM&#47;QM Excel 2011 Mac Graph</h2>
                    Hello! Is there a way to display a graph on OM/QM Excel 2011 for Mac? I've tried searching the web looking for instructions and details on how to display the graph on OM/QM Excel 2011 for Mac, but there seems to be no answer out there.

 is the linear problem that is already solved using OM/QM Excel 2011 for Mac. Now, I need to get the graph, but I don't know how to display it into a graph using OM/QM Excel 2011 on Mac. I know that on OM/QM Excel for Windows we can display it under the window
 tab. However, on Mac, there is no display graph button under window tab. Is there a way to display the graph in OM/QM Excel 2011 for Mac?

            I know it isn't developed by Microsoft, Jim Gordon Mac MVP. I've already seen the tutorial multiple times before I first posted my question here. In addition, I've done much research online on the topic before asking the Microsoft Community. I'm only here
 to ask my question because I thought that there would be some Mac users who uses Excel 2011 and OM/QM Excel 2011 Mac to do operation management problems. However, seeing your answer, I can conclude that no one in the community uses OM/QM Excel 2011 Mac, and
 that OM/QM Excel 2011 may be deemed flaw on the part of displaying a graph. Anyways, I appreciate your response. Thank you, and I'll just use my Windows for my operation management problems.

            <p>Generally, when someone is having trouble with a third party add-in I try to refer them to the help and support channel for that add-in. I did that with your question, but I also noticed that there really isn't much support at Pearson. I had done a web search,
 but that's all I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's OK to post here about the add-in, of course, but Pearson is responsible for supporting their product, not Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Headset For C5-00</h2>
                    
<p>Just thought to say that I personally do not think that the headset that accompanies the Nokia C5-00 is any good, reason for that is the actual sound, and when I tried my ipod headset it was far better, anyone else notice this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enhancement settings, should that be set to headphones or headset, not that I think it matters as I am sure I have tried both and didn't hear much difference between the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps my ipod has a superior jack and antenna.</p>

            Bundled headsets are often bad.<br />
<br />
Headphones refer to well, headphones. Headsets refer to those with remotes and mic for calling and controlling pause, play, forward and reverse.<br />
<br />
I dont understand what the jack and antenna has to do with a bad headset problem? The iPod's only antennae are bluetooth and wifi AFAIK.

<h2>            Blue Screen On Start Up With Windows 10 Build 17110 Have to Do Hard Start</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to this new build when I first boot up the computer, the logo comes on, then a circle, then the mouse icon disappears and there's a blue screen. I have to do a hard reboot to get on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on start-up, the task manager shows a 50 percent disk usage and the performance section shows 100 percent. And the CPU maxes out at 100 percent as well on boot up. I have Real Player installed and the real times desktop service uses a high amount of
 memory on start up. I don't know if this could be one of the reasons. I'm using a Dell Inspiron 3847 3.5 Ghz 4150 I3 with an Evga GTX 750ti</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answer or suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to check this first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 8, 8.1 and 10 have a new feature called Fast Startup. It can sometimes cause problems like you mention as well as others.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell if this is the problem is to turn it off and see what happens.</p>
<p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>

<h2>            Correct use of a Resource Pool for a Master Project &#47; SubProject setup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>MS Project: Project Pro 2010</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Pro 32 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up a hierarchical set of projects as a team workload planner so we can plan activities and try to avoid over-allocating our efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up a set of plans in the following structure:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Team Plan 2014-15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (master project)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Resource Pool 2014-15</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>People 2014-15&nbsp;&nbsp; (folder)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Person 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Person 2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Projects 2014-15&nbsp;&nbsp; (folder)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Project 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Project 2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Services 2014-15&nbsp;&nbsp; (folder)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Service 1</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Service 2</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>Notes: Anything above in non-bold type is a project .mpp file. All project files share the resource pool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem - Over-stating work allocation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is graph the teams forward work load an look for over-allocations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look at the "Team Plan" master project, and set up the resource graph to show all resources as well as the selected resource (this has to be the most obscurely hidden feature in Project!) the result shows crazy numbers for the "all resources" load,
 like 600% for two people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Resource Form for the master project, it seems to be picking up the same task two or more times for each person, and this seems to be related to the use of the Resource Pool across all projects. My guess is that the Resource Pool is "double
 counting" the same task for the same person in both the subprojects and the&nbsp;master project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems Project isn't clever enough to avoid counting the same task twice if it appears in both a sub-project and a master project.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Am I right in thinking this is what's happening here?</li><li>If the Resource Pool can only handle being linked to sub-projects OR a master project, It looks like I should link the Resource Pool to either-
<ol>
<li>The master project only</li><li>All the sub-projects separately (and NOT the master project)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>What is the best way to set this up?</p>

            <p>colin_e_uk,</p>
<p>Yup, you definitely have a corrupt structure. I'm glad your files are only test files and not real files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that "OTT" means over the top, and yes, it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, do not put the files in different folders. Keep everything in a single folder and ideally not on a server. By moving and renaming the files during your experiment, you effectively created multiple duplicate links. It's a mess to clean all that up
 but that's what you need to do. You might find the macro below useful. I wrote it some time back to automate unlinking a resource pool/sharer file structure. Just open the pool file and run the macro. Then you can check the pool file to make sure there are
 no rogue files linked to it. Do the same with each sharer file. When all looks good, you can re-establish sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A static master is created by first opening a new blank file and then going to Project/Insert group/subproject. Select all sharer files and unchecking the "link to project" option in the lower right corner of the Insert Project window. That will create a
 snapshot in time of all the sharer files. You will need to build a new static master each time you need to do a report but it won't contribute to corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users shy away from a single large file but if it's not too large (e.g. less than 10K tasks) filters and/or grouping can be used to make it more manageable. A file larger than that is probably a good candidate for moving to Project Server although a
 linked structure will work if all users are fully trained and extreme discipline is used to manage the files. It's that last part that is sometimes hard to instill in all users.</p>

<h2>            Two Line Appendix titles as a single line entry in the Table of Contents in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Working on a dissertation format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sample they want us to file has a centered title like "Appendix A" and on another line the name for appendix A like "Title of Appendix A"&nbsp; so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Title of Appendix A</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;they want the Table of Contents to show a single line entry at level 2 that shows both lines from the page in the format</p>
<p>Appendix A: Title of Appendix A</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They do not want the page numbering to break going into the appendix so we don't need to worry about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all the other headings working at all the levels in all the formats&nbsp;but I cannot figure out how to get this to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I could use a hidden TC field where I type in that text and get it to work that way.</p>
<p>I am hoping there is a better or&nbsp;elegant solution that uses the actual lines from the document.</p>

            If you use a line break after "Appendix A" so that the appendix number and title are in&nbsp;the same paragraph, then the line break will be rendered as a space in the TOC entry (but there will be no colon). For a more sophisticated approach, see

            Hi Pelo,
<br />
<br />Your son's macro is missing the code -  With Selection.Font - which your macro does have, I think this is causing the error since the macro would not know which cell to start in and that would also cause the relative reference to fail . . .

<h2>            Windows Defender Detects Pokki Applets and Start Menu icon as Malware on Toshiba Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS Answers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things that always seemed to slow down my Toshiba Laptop with Windows 8.1 was the presence of the Pokki games and Start Menu application.&nbsp; I have had the system for about nine months.&nbsp; It was from Best Buy. Today, Windows Defender notified me
 of three attempts by Pokki to try to change my browser's homepage and stopped each of them, in addition to completely removing the Pokki elements from my computer.&nbsp; My system is much faster because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this malware garbage even bundled on a laptop in the first place?&nbsp; It sure seems to be more of a distraction than a help.&nbsp; Although I read that some customers like the conveyance of the Pokki Start Menu, the overwhelming consensus seems to be that
 it should not be a part of the Windows 8/8.1 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am glad that Windows Defender now recognizes this bloatware as malware and can remove it.&nbsp; What have the community's issues been with this software and its applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Satch</p>

            You may open Windows Defender and under History check the name of the malware and with that you could look for more details online (there is a link to more details about the malware) details like when it has been discovered and latest signature and so
 on. Windows Defender keep getting updates everyday.

            <p>Acquired Pokki Start Menu&nbsp;without my knowledge,&nbsp;pleased to know that it can be removed using Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to 10 I am unable to turn Windows Defender on, I have tried to turn it on using services.msc, (after disabling Avast anti virus software) to give me&nbsp;access Windows Defender restart, what I get is error 577, so I'm stuck. Is it safe to remove
 Pokki Start Menu using Window 10 uninstall program? Before trying to resolve the defender issue?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you upgrade to Windows 10 from a prior version of Windows?&nbsp; Or did you get a new computer OEM (Manufacturer Direct) with Windows 10 already on the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In EITHER case, if you went through the Windows Update to get Windows 10, or you get a new computer with Windows 10, make sure that you have completely removed Avast from the system. (Just disabling it will not work.)&nbsp;For example, all new Dells come with
 a pre-installed version of McAfee Anti-Virus.&nbsp; A 12-24 month trial version.&nbsp; In order to get Windows Defender to work, and to resolve potential conflicts with two Anti-Viruses running in real time, you need to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.) Go to Control Panel and check the list for any instances of competing AV programs.&nbsp; You have Avast, so you will need to uninstall it&nbsp; Uninstall Avast from Control Panel/Remove Programs. (Remove All Avast products. from the Control Panel Programs
 List.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.) Reboot your computer. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.) Use the Avast Software Removal Tool.&nbsp; Here is the link to the removal tool for Avast from their website:
</strong><a href="https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility</a>&nbsp; This tool will find and remove traces of the Avast program that the uninstall program feature in Windows Control
 Panel might have missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.) Here is a link showing you how to boot into Safe Mode to run the Avast Software Removal Tool for both Windows 8 and Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5.)</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Get the tool and follow the prompts to run and remove any fragments of your AV that may still be on the computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.)&nbsp;Reboot again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.) Future Tip-&nbsp;To&nbsp;help&nbsp;prevent going to a bad site in a web search, I use My Web of Trust or My WOT, which places color coded ratings next to web searches in site results.&nbsp; Green is good, Yellow is caution, and Red or Black is bad.&nbsp; You can also
 register with the My WOT community and leave your own ratings.&nbsp; It doesn't work with MS Edge yet, unfortunately.&nbsp; If you are interested here are details about the program:
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.mywot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mywot.com/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8.) Now after booting up, can you get into Windows Defender?&nbsp; If you can, update the Definitions and run a scan.&nbsp; It should find the Pokki software and remove it. &nbsp;
</strong></p>

<li><strong>Remove “Start Menu Updated” pop-ups</strong><br />
&lt; QP&gt;<br />
The Start Menu Updated pop-up ads are caused by the Pokki program, which might have been installed on your computer by another program. This program is typically added when you install another free software (video recording, download-managers or PDF creators)
 that had bundled into their installation this potentially unwanted program.<br />
<br />
When Start Menu from Pokki is installed, whenever you will start your computer, a “Start Menu Updated” will randomly pop-up. The Start Menu Updated will display a change log, and will offer you to install an additional program. If you click on the “OK”, “Run
 Update” or “Click to install now” button, apart of installing an update, you’ll agree to download an adware or a browser hijacker onto your computer...<br />

<p>MICROSOFT if you are reading this I want it back or a microsoft version, I dont see why its such an issue, a customisable start button is what i need with this surface pro 3, and no I dont want 10 I already have it on my desktop and its terrible, never have

</p><p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some good points made.&nbsp; Yes, PA Bear makes a point that a good Start Menu was brought back in Windows 10.&nbsp; However, some people are still content with Windows&nbsp;version 8.1.&nbsp; I agree with you Mike, that since Windows 8.1 is going to be supported for many more
 years that Microsoft could and should make a Start Menu option for Windows 8.1 via Windows Update.&nbsp; It just needs to be like the Pokki Start Menu without the malware!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not even know that the Pokki Start Menu was classified as malware until Windows Defender detected and removed it.&nbsp; The software PUP in question was pre-installed on my Toshiba and it did cause some slowness when it was there.&nbsp; Sleep Mode on my laptop
 is faster in getting the computer to sleep, and I don't have the Start Menu pop-up- screen&nbsp;updates anymore, which I never knew were because of Pokki's PUP&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree with Mike!&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft should bring&nbsp;a Start Menu button to Windows 8.1!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you for your encouragement, and I did say I would get back to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event I set about the process of removing the Pokki Start Menu, step one - remove Avast to allow Windows Defender to load. &nbsp;Followed the advice from Avast to switch to safe mode, (that's no longer a simple process with Windows 10}! &nbsp;I eventually found
 an options menu - choice number 4, if I hit the function key instead of the numerical I may never know. What I do know is that the screen went into flicker, and no matter what I had no further control, could it be something else? Some suggested a problem with
 the video card. At this point I saw the hole and decided to stop digging. In the end a local service centre cleared the flicker, did a system restore, discovered that my earlier effort had neutralised the PUP which appears to have been reawakened on upgrade
 to Windows10. Defender is running and Pokki is no more on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is well, I can say I am wiser now and poorer by £20 GBP and grateful to the community and to the guy who wouldn't tell me what he did gain control !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

Word gave up printing full manuals a long time ago because a complete manual would take up a bookshelf. Instead they expect us to rely on the Help sections, which have gotten better, but you still need to know what words to search for.<br />

<h2>            After importing from Evernote, anyway of consolidating all the sections created in a notebook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I imported some 2,000 notes from Evernote to OneNote. In my largest notebook, OneNote decided to create a bunch of sections, with names like Pages 1-100, Pages 201-300, Pages 901Plus, etc. A bunch of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to easily consolidate all these sections?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this done because of some limitation in the number of pages allowed in a section?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no limitations of pages allowed on a section in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To consolidate the sections that you have on your OneNote, copy them and paste each page manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but that sounds like a nightmare. It would take days and I would lose all my original dates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the Mac client is too buggy to be used now, so I'll give up for the time being. Certain imported notes which open fine in (1) Evernote, (2) onenote.com and (3) iPhone OneNote cause the Mac OneNote client to crash. I can't even delete them without
 OneNote crashing. Even pasting manually from Evernote to a new note caused Mac OneNote to crash. Two Support tech people tried to help and couldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus searching on iOS devices doesn't search the server contents, unlike Evernote. So search doesn't work well across devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointing, because there are things I like about OneNote as well, such as the better formatting and the better structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if it crashes and doesn't search the server then it isn't really usable right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll continue to use Evernote for now as my "main repository of all my bits of data" and use OneNote just for preparing some class notes, because of the better formatting.</p>

            <p>That doesn't really appear to be a true feedback link, getting information about specific product features. It's more of a general "satisfaction" survey about Microsoft itself.</p>
