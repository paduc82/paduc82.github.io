<h2>            Bluetooth Radio deleted after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, good afternoon, Dear Friends.</p>
<p>I have a Samsung Tablet with Win 8 operating system. Yesterday there was an automatic update which deleted my bluetooth. Can someone help me to retrieve this. Microsoft Techs tried, one did well, it started working, then after re-start, died again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am orphaned for this help at the moment and I don't think that a simple windows update should delete applications from my tablet. Please for your help. Thanks. my cell is &lt;
<strong>Phone number removed by CM </strong>&gt; if anyone can hep walk me through. Thanks. Bob Singh.</p>

                    I am using windows 10 on bootcamp on macbookpro. While fiddling with quick settings corner, I ended up selecting 0% brightness. And now I cannot get screen to brighten. Its stuck at 0% and the macbook brightness control keys are not working with windows
 10. My windows 10 is all dark and unusable. I did look up the internet but couldn't find a solution. Please help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience. As you are using Windows 10 on boot camp on your MacBook pro, I suggest you to get in touch with Boot Camp support in this regards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>This solution would work if you had Boot Camp installed, and the "Keyboard" tab on the "Boot Camp Control Panel" appropriately checked.&nbsp; Otherwise, its probably a point of no return. If you had your Boot Camp keyboard settings appropriately ticked, all you
 need to do is press "fn + F2" keys. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To have the keys working you need to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Click on the Boot Camp icon ( The black square...that appears on clicking the arrow head)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f021556-3217-430e-931c-3ac9aacb1196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f021556-3217-430e-931c-3ac9aacb1196" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select Boot Camp Control Panel.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d05d999d-e570-418c-951c-e51facc6048f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d05d999d-e570-418c-951c-e51facc6048f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; You need to have the " Use all F1, F2..." checkbox ticked.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/598d8341-a0a7-4d3c-b062-5498ede91d32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/598d8341-a0a7-4d3c-b062-5498ede91d32" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Boot Camp Control Panel configured in the above way, "fn + F2" will work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I am the same person posting this request for help. I posted it at about 1:35 AM Indian Standard Time. And been freaking out in my bed. I could hardly sleep.</p>
<p>Like suggested by Guru Kiran G. below ,I called Apple care India, where they assured every kind of help possible in their reach. But couldn't find a solution and tried to convince me to talk to Microsoft India support (and even generously found me Microsoft's
 support phone number). And then I called Microsoft India support, where again I was told that they cannot offer help regarding dual boot since the liability lies with the hardware manufacturers. So I am back to square one. Freaking out even more. If you have
 reached where I am, trust me, you are on your own.</p>
<p>No support staff has any idea about this issue. I am really frustrated with the hours of helplessness.</p>

    <title>what happens with digital content if I sell my Xbox one&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            what happens with digital content if I sell my Xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As per title, I bought Xbox one expecting big things but I'm not impressed one but with it... Microsoft has lost the plot.. Windows 8 is pants, Xbox one is pants... Both 360 and 7 where great... Idk but on serious note I've had enough of xbone and as much
 as I try and like it I can't...&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dashboard is awkward and poorly arranged.. Sending a friend an invite is just overly complicated with to many options... As it finding my digital download games and achievements etc...</p>

<p>Fifa does not work online... End of.. Period</p>

<p>My bonus cars in forza never appeared in my garage...</p>

<p>Ghosts is about 1% better than Xbox 360</p>

<p>And battlefield 4 isn't much better</p>

<p>Controller thumb stick broke after 1 week and I had to get a replacement...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I paid a lot of money for this console and the games.. Two are on disc.. 2 are digital download.. Scan code download nonsense... Where do I stand with these.. Are they tied to my profile out the Xbox one itself?? If I sell it can I advertise with 4 games
 or only 2?&nbsp;</p>

 to buy in-game with Tokens or CR.[quote]Where do I stand with these.. Are they tied to my profile out the Xbox one itself??[/quote]They are tied to your gamertag. You cannot sell them as per the Terms of Use. If you don't activate a new Xbox One Home console,
 they'll continue to work on your existing console. Should you buy a new Xbox One in the future and make it your Home console the games will stop working.</p>

<p>Exactly. Sure there are some things missing but so far it's looking to be a great console. But I knew there would be some bumps at the start but that hadn't stopped me enjoying the games. Only EA have let me down with BF4 at the moment.

<p>I find it rather funny that we have a ton of people on the forums just in the past couple days *** about stuff that everyone knew was gonna be an issue on both systems because they were both rushed out the door... People need to realize the features are
 coming for both systems but selling one to get the other just to have the same issues in my opinion is stupidity cause you are wasting a ton of money</p>

<p>your online play will not be any better on PS4 as simply it will take a hundred times more consoles sold to create an online world worth gaming. &nbsp;The winner of the two will be the first to combine the online worlds into one. &nbsp;Just play at the lower resolution
 if gaming with anybody with say a 360 or PS3 or do your own invites for say only X1 or PS4 to play with all the bells and whistles.</p>

<h2>            Computer stuck in Automatic Repair, will not boot into Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello. My Windows 10 laptop recently experienced a series of BSODs. I had first experienced a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT screen, and after Windows restarted the computer was too slow to be used normally. Then I got CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. After logging in on another
 reboot, I eventually got BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO, and a series of more MEMORY_MANAGEMENT screens. Now, the computer upon booting goes into Automatic Repair and fails to repair. Nothing works in the Advanced Options screen. I'd like to know what happened, thank
 you.</p>

            Hi Manny.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />It looks like your computer memory is defective.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.

<p>Thank you. I put Windows 10 Media Creation on a SanDisk flash drive, then plugged it into the laptop that wouldn't boot.</p>
<p>The hard drive was also cleaned. During Windows 10 install from the flash drive, it went by smoothly. In the Installing Windows' "Status" screen, after "Finishing up" had been done, the computer went into a splash screen where another blue screen of death
 appeared. The computer shut off too fast to get the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe that the memory is defective, and will try the MemTest86+ once I get the chance.</p>

<p>Sorry for replying so late. 3 days ago, MemTest86 found no errors. Also 3 days ago I left chkdsk running overnight but the laptop turned off as I forgot to leave it charged.&nbsp;This is under Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt. During that first run, it found
 many bad parts in the hard drive and replaced them. Two days ago, I have been using the chkdsk command once again, and the progress on Stage 5 has been slow since then (Stage: 24%).</p>
<p>Is it a problem with my hard drive?</p>

            <p>Bluetooth is a radio, just like WiFi and there is a slight battery drain for each device used but is minor.&nbsp; It is very little and almost not noticeable but with these tablets, you have to set them up and then put them to use and monitor the battery drain
 as you go.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You also have a range of about 25+ feet as well with them.&nbsp; My VIZIO headset, I have travelled further and had perfect connection.&nbsp; You won't be doing that with a keyboard or mouse with a screen that small.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do note that each of these tablets have a life of their own.&nbsp; You can read that here in the forum.&nbsp; Just because mine works that way, doesn't mean everybody else's tablets will work the same, so, you just have to try it out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The device limit for Bluetooth, like I said, is not a set limit.&nbsp; It depends on what class of Bluetooth that was used for the tablets.&nbsp; Normally, most people don't have enough devices to fill up the full allocation.&nbsp; We are talking about Bluetooth and you
 can also communicate with a cellphone via Bluetooth as well to transfer files.&nbsp; You may find issues doing that with these tablets even though it is supposed to work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Experimentation is about the only way to find out what these tablets can do.&nbsp; If you dig around on Microsoft's web site in the Surface category, look at the bottom of the web pages and there is a PDF booklet which is for the Surface RT and Surface Pro that
 is fairly good if you want documentation.&nbsp; Both tablets are combined in the same file.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What's working for some is installing the WIndows 7 Driver from here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/lifecam-hd-3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/l...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try uninstalling the driver in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features and Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  restart PC and try installing it in Compatibility Mode:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>

            Hi Linda, <br />
<br />
First, let’s disable the security software <strong>temporarily </strong>and check if you can delete the shortcut.<br />
<br />
Refer: <br />
<br />
<strong>Disable antivirus software<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
Make sure you turn the antivirus software. <br />
<br />
If the computer hangs while deleting a shortcut from the dektop, it could indicate that some of the third party startup items or other services might be interfering and hence causing the computer to freeze.
<br />
<br />
Let’s put the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may go ahead and disable or uninstall the same.<br />
<br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:<br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2. Click Start, type <strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective <strong>Startup</strong> , and then click to clear the Load
<strong>startup </strong>items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
The above steps would put the computer in clean boot state. Try and delete the shortcut and check if the computer freezes or not.<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
</strong><br />
After you’ve finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

I appreciate your input, thank-you!<br />
<br />
I tried but soon as it was(the shortcut)selectedfter the clean boot the hourglass hung in the balance for a few minutes.just stalling unable to delete move or rename.<br />
In the same session I clicked on another router shortcut, where the right click menu saidENABLE or CONFIGURE and curious as I am I clicked just to see whatI could learn.<br />
I thought it was the real shortcut to the BELKIN router ??whatever it was it disconnected my web connection. After a while my son noticed the lights on it was off so he restarted<br />
the wireless router manually.<br />
&nbsp;I have internet but back where I started from.. with that BAD Link!<br />
For anyone who has information about this issue please read on..<br />
<br />
Also reading my other question on this site may be&nbsp; related.?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any input or feedback!<br />

<h2>            The computer is very slow at startup - Server service hangup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer of a friend is having an issue.&nbsp; When I bootup the computer, the computer seems to stop at "windows starting" with the black background and the Windows Logo, but after one or two hours, it finally startup. &nbsp;It was running fine until yesterday,
 then during a game, it started to act slow, so my friend rebooted the computer and&nbsp;he got the problem I mentionned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the event viewer, there is a lot of eventID 7022 for the Service control manager, mentioning the Server Service hangup and was in a "pending state".&nbsp; There are also error concerning others service who depends on the server service.&nbsp; I can't find
 why the server service hangup though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I did the following : </p>
<p>chkdsk on the OS drive.&nbsp; No error found.</p>
<p>Mem diag test : ran for 12 hours, extended tests, no error.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow - No error</p>
<p>I ran the windows readiness tool - No error in the logs found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OS is Windows 7 64 bits SP1, up to date.</p>
<p>The CPU is an AMD (can't remember the exact model), 3.11GHz, it was bough two years ago, the motherboard was changed 12 months ago.</p>
<p>System has 8 GB of Ram</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestion what to look for ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p>Edit : The CPU is : AMD Athlon 2 X4 Processor (X4 645)&nbsp; if that matter.</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and giving us opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing performance issue with Windows 7 startup. To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m glad to provide you with these articles which will help you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Run the performance troubleshooter and then check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> If the issue does not occur in safe mode, you may put your system in clean boot state (in normal mode) to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>To answer your questions : </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Booting in Safe mode was doing the same thing, except it wasn't "stopping" at the "startup screen", but after it loaded the list of drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Absolutely no change was made prior the problem, either software or hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-There is no error messages, beside what I mentionned in the event viewer concerning the server service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try the performance troubleshooter and I'll report if it helped or not.&nbsp; Please note the computer was running fine prior that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p>Edit : I used the troubleshooter, but it didn't help.&nbsp; I'll try the "clean boot", but I doubt it's going to change anything since the computer was having the same (slow startup ) behavior with the Safe Mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s follow these methods to fix the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> If that does not work, create a new user account and check. If it works in a new user account, then probably your user account
 may have been corrupted and would need a fix.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentionned in my first post, I already tried your first method : </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>chkdsk on the OS drive. No error found.</li><li>Mem diag test : ran for 12 hours, extended tests, no error.</li><li>SFC /scannow - No error</li><li>I ran the Windows Readiness tool - No error in the logs found.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem arise at Windows startup (black screen, logo), so the user profile isn't even loaded at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried using MSConfig and disabling all non-Microsoft service or startup program : the computer boot a little faster, but it's still extremely slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Adam</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing more information on the issue you are facing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are receiving black screen at the startup, you may refer the following article and check if that works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?</b></p>

            <p>There is a misunderstanding.&nbsp; There is no black screen.&nbsp; What I meant, the computer seem to freeze when the windows logo with the black background appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friend just told me that after a few reboots, the "slow" startup went away by itself...&nbsp; I don't explain it, since nothing special was done.&nbsp; I can only guess that Windows fixed something by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may close this case.</p>

    <title>Error&#58; BSOD DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;btfilter.sys&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rudylavaux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; BSOD DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;btfilter.sys&#41; on install of Toshiba Bluetoth Stack 9.10.00T on Windows 8.1 x64</h2>
                    Hello to all,<br />
<br />
I purchased a fantastic laptop back in August last year, a Toshiba L850-1JQ. For my personal needs however, I needed the Toshiba Bluetooth Stack as the generic one pre-installed didn't have the functions I needed, so I uninstalled the other bluetooth stack
 and installed the Toshiba one, and that Bluetooth Stack worked wonderfully, except for apparently causing the odd BSOD DRIVER_IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (athw8x.sys), which is NOT the error I have now, as you may have noticed. It happened like once a month, so
 it wasn't too bad.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to earlier this year, like January I think, and I finally upgraded to Windows 8.1 (from the 8.0 that the laptop came installed with) and the update completely solved the athw8x.sys problem I had previously (I never had one since) BUT my Toshiba
 Bluetooth Stack stopped working at all, and another Bluetooth icon appeared alongside the Toshiba one in the bottom right of my screen.<br />
<br />
Last night I wanted to reinstall the latest version of the TBS (version number in the title above) and on install I'm getting a BSOD with an error on btfilter.sys, during the bluetooth driver install part.<br />
<br />
On startup, none of the two bluetooth icons in the lower right of the screen appears, and when I uninstall the TBS altogether, the other bluetooth icon appears again. I really need my TBS, or I can't connect my game controller to my laptop, as it is only recognized
 by the TBS.<br />
<br />
Help?<br />

            <p><span>Hi Rudy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer on how to extract the driver and then apply compatibility settings to install.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The steps are in the web link given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://www.toshiba.eu/innovation/windows8_drivers.jsp?macId=&amp;LNG=5&amp;mode=allMachines&amp;userOS=&amp;action=search&amp;selCategory=2&amp;selFamily=2&amp;selSeries=178&amp;preselDriverType=0&amp;selProduct=7501&amp;selShortMod=3721&amp;selOS=40&amp;selType=all&amp;country=41&amp;language=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.toshiba.eu/innovation/windows8_drivers.jsp?macId=&amp;LNG=5&amp;mode=allMachines&amp;userOS=&amp;action=search&amp;selCategory=2&amp;selFamily=2&amp;selSeries=178&amp;preselDriverType=0&amp;selProduct=7501&amp;selShortMod=3721&amp;selOS=40&amp;selType=all&amp;country=41&amp;language=13</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Doing so, you should get one preferred driver which might work.</span></p>

                    <p>I have had the same problem with deleting email.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to work that I saw online.&nbsp; This worked for me, and hopefully will for others, too.&nbsp; And continue to work for me.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; hit delete&nbsp;&nbsp; (which gets error message)</p>
<p>2. right click and select "open"&nbsp;&nbsp; (error message again)</p>
<p>3. hit delete&nbsp; (which now deletes the selected email)&nbsp; !!!!</p>

<p>The usual reason for not being able to delete a message from the message list is that it has already
<em>been</em> deleted, but the message database has yet to record the fact. If this is the case (and in other cases where the various delete options apparently don't work), it's usually enough to select the message(s) in the list and then press
<em><strong>Shift</strong><strong>-Delete</strong> </em>on the keyboard. This bypasses the
<em>Deleted items </em>folder and removes the message permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message database is updated after the program is closed down, so it continues to run in the background for a few moments or minutes even though the program interface has disappeared. It's important, then, to wait a few minutes after closing Windows Live
 Mail down before relaunching, closing Windows or switching off the computer. Otherwise, the database's records may be incomplete.</p>

<p>Just to check how you have the NAS setup:</p>
<p>You setup a user on the NAS setup page.</p>
<p>You allocated a password to the user.</p>
<p>You created a folder on NASBOX called Jim-data.</p>
<p>You gave the user full access to \\NASBOX\Jim-data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are using the user name and password in Windows 10 File Explorer to access the NAS drive.</p>

            <p>Hi Tracy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue may be caused by the&nbsp;keyboard drivers. Let us work together to troubleshoot the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a few questions to get a clear picture of the issue.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Do you get any error message/code related to the issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. </span></span>Are you using wired or wireless keyboard? What is the make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the methods listed below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run hardware and Device troubleshooter.<br />
</strong>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your
 computer was installed correctly.<br />

d. Click on <strong>view</strong> <strong>all</strong> option on the upper left corner.<br />
e. Select the <strong>Hardware</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Device</strong> options from the list.<br />
f. Click <strong>Next</strong> to run the <strong>Hardware</strong> and Device Troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If method 1 does not help try method 2.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>U</span>pdate the mouse and keyboard drivers from the device manager and check.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press Windows key + X</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Select device manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Double click on keyboards.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d. Right click on the device listed and select Update Driver Software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e. Follow the on-screen instructions and restart the computer after the drivers are installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope this resolves the issue. If the issue persists, you can write to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, your Acer Travelmate 5720 only has Bluetooth 1.0 and your new speakers require Bluetooth 4.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although newer versions of Bluetooth are supposed to be backwards compatible with older versions, according to Wikipedia, "Versions 1.0 and 1.0B had many problems, and manufacturers had difficulty making their products interoperable."&nbsp;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_1.0_and_1.0B</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A more serious problem is that Windows 7 does not support Bluetooth 4.x.&nbsp; See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-support-in-previous-windows-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth-support-in-previous-windows-versions</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is to buy a USB Bluetooth 4.x "dongle" that is compatible with Windows 7, turn off the built-in Bluetooth support on your Acer, and install the new device.&nbsp; For example,
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;N=100158097%20600315449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Malheureusement, votre Acer Travelmate 5720 n'a que Bluetooth 1.0 et vos nouveaux haut-parleurs nécessitent Bluetooth 4.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Bien que les nouvelles versions de Bluetooth soient censées être rétrocompatibles avec les anciennes versions, selon Wikipedia, "les versions 1.0 et 1.0B ont rencontré de nombreux problèmes, et les fabricants ont eu du mal à rendre leurs produits
 interopérables". </span><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Bluetooth_1.0_and_1.0B<br />

            <div>Hi Shivam,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wondered what happened to the MSFT scanner...&nbsp; I have been using ESET for years.&nbsp; It has done the job so far for me.&nbsp;
<br />
<div>I will look into the scanner.&nbsp; Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also use WD Passbook all-time backup which keeps most of the data files stored on a separate remove drive.&nbsp; I have been thinking of using the "cloud".&nbsp; I have stored a backup of the system
 on the cloud and keep a separate flash drive for pw, system and periodically a large flash drive of my files from all my accounts.&nbsp; I don't use ADM accounts for any web processing only user accounts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTY...&nbsp; I had to dismantle my system and move it.&nbsp; After I setup it up I now have two optional updates to apply.&nbsp; Before the move, I notices. "windows Modules installer worker" was using a lot
 of memory and cpu time (40/15%) on a basic user account.&nbsp; <br />
<div><br />
<div>I tried to restore to a prior Check Point, but it failed twice before I moved the system.&nbsp; It also indicated that Adobe, Mozella and KB3048778 would not restore.&nbsp; It failed on a Mozella missing
 profiles.&nbsp; Somehow the directory must have missed an update.&nbsp; <br />
<div><br />
<div>After checking for updates, it came back with error: "windowsUpdate_dt000"(1) or 80070057, ran troubleshoot, and it indicated it fixed it, but tried again and go a 8024A000 error.&nbsp;
<br />
<div>I think KB3048778 failed to complete its update and hosed something.&nbsp;
<br />
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Being an old PC-1 man, where you carried a set of 4K ram chips banged it some times to make it work, I wonder that a complete power shutdown, reset something in my HP Envy h8-1520t.&nbsp; I will use the backup note post to let you know how things worked.&nbsp; BYT
 cmd/scanner only go 39% through before it stopped.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all the step and then tired to reset to&nbsp; a check point before the 24th update and this time it aborted with a hard disk error.&nbsp; Ran complete HP disk check and no issues, so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am off now backing up some files, noting setting and exporting mozella favorites.&nbsp; Afterwords, it system recovery.&nbsp; I am convinced it was the KB3048778 that hosed the directory which is a major pain.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support, but we cleared off the hard drive and tired a few times to install Recovery to Factory Setting software for Win-8 Pro, it bombed each time.&nbsp; I am return my Envy h8 to HP for a fix as it looks to&nbsp; me, that the drive is bad and or
 the mother board or memory has a issue.&nbsp; We could not narrow it down.&nbsp; I was tempted to load a version of win-7 that I have but am tired of playing with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what is or caused the problem.&nbsp; It all started after the 3/24 windows update and one optional for I think Western Digital backup software.&nbsp; I was unhappy that I only had one System Recover Point in my system which turned out to be corrupted,
 also the "D" drive Recovery Reset failed also with a corrupted file.&nbsp; This lead me to the "C" drive or SATAT controller as the issue.&nbsp; I saw Intel posted a software update a few days after the 3/24 update, but is was rejected being a lower version of the installed
 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be week (4/14) before I get it returned and find out what was the issue.</p>

<h2>            Phantom Drive J&#58; after April Update, with constant Disk Space warnings</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;<br />
I installed the Windows 10 April Update.&nbsp;<br />
I've since started getting constant warnings about local disc J: saying it's almost out of space.&nbsp;<br />
I've never used J: before, I don't think it was ever there before.&nbsp;<br />
When I open the drive it says 'this folder is empty'.&nbsp; Same thing when I click 'show system / hidden files'. Nothing there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, System Restore was turned off for some reason after the update, I've just turned it back on.<br />
Is it possible that it's a phantom recovery partition left over after the update? As per:&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://www.disk-partition.com/windows-10/recovery-partition-after-upgrading-to-windows-10-4348.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.disk-partition.com/windows-10/recovery-partition-after-upgrading-to-windows-10-4348.html</a><br />
<br />
Should I wait for the next Windows Update or try and fix this myself?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            Hi Shaun O, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

<h2>            Party Chat Doesn&#39;t Work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My party chat does not work half the time on Xbox One. I get a message telling me to change my network settings, but I try and try and change them every which way I can and I still get the message. Granted I can connect every once in a while, but the problem gets worse and worse. How do I fix this? Is party chat not guaranteed on these supposed "Next Gen" consoles? 360 had party chat without a hiccup. I can guarantee it is NOT my internet.&nbsp;</p>

            Sp2 includes Sp1, so why to you try to use an obsolete Sp? The best is to install the MSXML 4.0 Sp3

<h2>            Photo App storing photos in wrong place</h2>
                    <p>Using HP Pavilion 2 in 1 laptop with Windows 10.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I go into the Photo App and select where I want photos stored, they go somewhere else and I can never find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have them set to go to: &nbsp;C: and I cannot select what sub folder.</p>
<p>They save to E:\my name\pictures\camera roll</p>
<p>I do have a folder titled C:\users\my name\pictures\camera roll that they used to save to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have honestly researched this and tried a few of the fixes that were recommended. &nbsp;They did not work. &nbsp;It honestly has been so long ago that I cannot remember what I did but I think I went into the specific folder preferences. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi, i had this issue too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the error comes from a program called AccelerometerP11 or FreeFall Security. Depending on where you look.</p>
<p>If you just want the message to go away, find this program in the "remove a program" tool in windows, and remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But the program is designed to make your disc ready for an impact, if the computer's accelerometer shows that it is moving at high veolocity (like it is falling towards the ground). This could prevent datalossm if you drop you computer. And i wanted that
 feature, so here's how to get AccelerometerP11 back without the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you have to go to Dell's "download drivers" page, and enter you license code, or use "dell system detect" to find the code for you. Then you can find AccelerometerP11 called something like "ST microelectronics freefall" under the tab called something
 like "program tools".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have downloaded the installer, i bumped into a problem, and i don't know if it will become a problem for you too, but just in case, this is what happened: When i executed the installer, it had an error when trying to create a log at C:\freefall.txt,
 and then it closed without installing. I fixed this by doing two things, and i don't know which of them actually fixed it.</p>
<p>1. i went and deleted the already existing freefall file, that was there from the old program.</p>
<p>2. I ran the program with administrator priviliges. You can find that function if you right click on the installer that you have downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, everything worked for me.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Had the same issue with my Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Uninstalled the old version of AccelerometerP11. Note: Restart required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Downloaded the new version of "ST microelectronics freefall".&nbsp; Found it under "Applications".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran the program&nbsp;as administrator.&nbsp; Note: Restart required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No more "error handle".</p>

<p>Assuming that you also have a dell, you will have to download it from dells website, like i described in my first post. We can't just send you a copy of our version as it would be piracy and as it most likely wouldn't work with your computer anyway. The
 versions are very custom to specific computers, so you have to download the one for you specific pc.</p>

<h2>            Unable to upgrage anytime Ultimate due to corrupted .mui files</h2>
                    I was ill advised last year to look but not use visalizator on a Win 7 64 bit tower HP pc
<div><br />
</div>
<div>.mui files were corrupted even thought it reported not able to install</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now an attempted upgrade to Ultimate will not work</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Various attempts with dowloaded and burnt to DVD .iso discs all fail to run</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The machine at date of purchase was installed with Win 7 64 French. &nbsp;I use the pc for English and French work so the keyboard is set to French and I have deleted English as a language local option but it is staying in English</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Win 67 installed is a valid copy with the PC without discs supplied by HP so I cannot do an install upgrade to bring the pc back to original status</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One option is to buy a complete copy of ULTIMATE at full price, delete the existing operating system and hope I can get PC drivers from HP</div>
<div>or</div>
<div>Try and get OS DVS from HP, so far I have not been successful, and do a destructive restore</div>
<div>THEN&nbsp;</div>
<div>try to run anytime upgrade before I place my data files on the PC</div>
<div>or</div>
<div>Can I correct the errors manually ?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any comments? &nbsp;I enclose the error code lines below</div>
<div>I am exploring all options to save doing a destructive restore</div>
<div>OF course the errors below cause update not to work and a non valid licence flash screen to appear</div>

<p>Check your hard disk for any errors:</p>
<p>Click Start</p>
<p>Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>Click 'Run as Administrator'</p>
<p>At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>

<p>HP laptops come preloaded recovery partition will allow you to create a set of Hp restore disks that can be used to recover all of the original software in the event of a major problem by tapping the F10 key continuously when the PC is first boots up. However,
 there may be times when recovery discs are needed to restore the PC. By using the Recovery CD-DVD Creator program, you can create a set of recovery discs to restore your PC back to its original condition.<br />
Creating A Restore CD</p>
<p>The recovery CD set contains a complete set of the original operating system, drivers, and application software that shipped with the PC. The Recovery CD Creator software can be used to creat a set of recovery CDs for your computer. Because this software
 actually contains the Operating System, the Creator program allows only one complete set of CDs to be created. This data that will be put onto the CD is the same as the recovery CDs that you’d receive if you’d actually ordered them from HP.</p>
<p>You’ll need a blank CD-R or blank DVD-R.</p>
<p>To begin, click Start, then All Programs. If you have an HP Pavilion click Hewlett-Packard and then HP PC Recovery CD Creator. If not, try clicking PC Help &amp; Tools, then HP CD Recovery CD-DVD Creator to start the program.</p>
<p>You will see a welcome screen. Click the Continue button on each screen to start the disc creator. You will see how many disks are necessary to create the HP recovery disks. Label them, so you do not get confused after each burn.</p>
<p>The disk will burn, verify data, then eject each CD when complete. When the process is complete, you should have a working set of HP restore disks.</p>
<p>You will not be able to create another set, so if you lose or damage these disks, you’ll need to contact HP for a replacement.</p>

            <p>Some programs have an option to wipe freespace.<br />
<br />
The freeware CCleaner has that option. <br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

                    <p>In Skype for Windows 10 (12.1815.210), the Contacts in "Local Address Book" with multiple numbers don't work. I can see them in Search Results under Local Address Book, but clicking on the desired contact either simply returns me to the un-filtered Contacts
 list or presents me with a call button with no way to pick which number I want to call.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fcc0ecd2-beec-4c6c-9937-4b78754f7429" title="JeffsHall">
<p>
</p><p>For us to see this unusual behavior, please send us a screenshot of what you see after clicking on the contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to blur personal information, such as Skype name, email address, phone number etc., before posting the screenshot here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to reset the Skype application to correct the problem from your Windows settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incase you need details on how to reset your Skype app, refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click start, then settings (gear icon)</li><li>Go to System &gt; Apps &amp; features</li><li>Find Skype, and click on Advanced options</li><li>Scroll down&nbsp;to find&nbsp;the Reset button</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, I suggest using the classic version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have the classic version of Skype, here's a downloader link: <em>
<a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi</span></a></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>The Reset helped, plus a reboot to fix the fact that Mail was not syncing Contacts for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, see attached screenshot where a Contact with multiple (3) phone numbers is selected, but the Skype window offers no way to select which number to dial.</p>

<h2>            Netflix  frame rate Issue drop Frames stuttering choppy framerate</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>since a couple of weeks I have the issue of dropping frames when watching Netflix. When the camera pans, it is a very stuttering choppy movement.</p>
<p>We all had that problem when Xbox one came out, months later they fixed it, now Microsoft reintroduced the miserable Netflix quality.</p>
<p>On Amazon everything is fine, Netflix works fine on my Apple TV,</p>
<p>My download speed is around 40mbit/s.</p>
<p>i already reset my Xbox and reinstalled Netflix, nothing helped.</p>
<p>Microsoft, are you aware of the Problem?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>I'm still noticing this issue too. I've contacted Xbox Support and no one seems to know anything about it. All I get is, try resetting, reinstalling, change cables, reset the router, etc etc etc! NONE OF IT WORKS! ITS THE APP ITSELF! Ive recently got faster
 broadband, and it still hasn't helped! Ever since the June update, whatever they've done they've *** up Netflix! Every other streaming service WORKS FINE! Come on Xbox, FIX IT!!!!</p>

            <p>Hey guys, I understand you're upset over this I would be too. &nbsp;However, in a situation like this it is Netflix themselves who create the app. &nbsp;If you are having issues with the app that normal support suggestions cannot help then you should contact them to let them know what is happening so they can look into it.</p>

<p>I am watching Showtime anytime right now, same choppy unsmooth experience, so it seems not to be Netflix or showtime, but Microsoft causing the issues, I remember similar issues when Xbox one came out...</p>
<p>I heard they introduced something in their last update which makes streaming possible with lower bitrates , well I think that's obviously still in beta</p>
<p>So let's do happy guessing: How long to:</p>
<p>1. Admit to the issue from Microsoft </p>
<p>2. Fix it</p>
<p>I think it's gonna take at least 4 months from now...</p>
<p>WhT do you guys think?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Academy License after massive Hardware Change - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Academy License after massive Hardware Change</h2>
                    Hello, I just upgraded my PC, and I'm a student on a University. I used to have the Windows Academy for the past 6 months with no problems. I used the code 2 other times except my PC, that was my father's PC and my sister's laptop. Well the problem is
 that now I can't put the code again on my PC, plus when I'm troubleshooting that I just had a massive Hardware change, and it asks me for my email that I used, even though I did inputed the correct one, the problem is still that it can't activate the license.
 How can I solve that problem? Can it be solved, or should I ask my friend to give me his code, or should I switch to Linux full time?&nbsp;

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Depending on the type of Windows 10 license you have installed, you might be able to transfer it to a new computer if needed. Over the years, Microsoft has distributed its desktop operating system through different market channels. New computers will often come preinstalled with an OEM license. There are many other channels Microsoft distributes Windows in, these include Retail, Volume License, Academic, and subgroups such as Upgrade licenses. Check these links, I hope it helps.

            Already tried those and didn't help. I even mentioned that I did it and it didn't help.

            The only things I changed on the upgrade was the CPU, the Motherboard and the Ram. The HDDs remained the same, but it doesn't recognize my email for some reason, even though I was logged in with the email.

            You usually have to deactivate the license of one device so that it can work in another

            Then the only way of solving the problem is building up the old PC from scratch again. If there is no other option, then I will have to get the code from my friends. Anyway thanks for trying to help.
