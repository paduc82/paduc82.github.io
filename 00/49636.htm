    <title>My computer won&#39;t let me reinstall windows because it thinks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My computer won&#39;t let me reinstall windows because it thinks it&#39;s 32-bit and won&#39;t recognize the install disks. Help please&#63;</h2>
                    My computer hasn't been working ever since I shut it down during an automatic update. Which I've been kicking myself about ever since, but the last time it updated, it broke the computer and I panicked.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it won't run certain programs, including iTunes and much of MS Office, and no matter how often I try to reinstall, they still won't work, saying "The side by side configurations are incorrect."<br />
<br />
What I want is to restore it to factory settings - all my data is safe and backed up.
<span style="font-weight: bold">But when I put in my recovery disks (and they are the highest boot priority in BIOS) the system loads from the hard drive as normal. When I remove the option to boot from the hard drive, my system won't book at all, telling me
 to restart or insert an appropriate disk. And when I boot from the disk and try to manually run it, by clicking ETFSBOOT, it tells me that "The version of this file is not This version of the file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running.
 Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or an x64 (64-bit) version of the program."<br />
</span><br />
I have double and<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>triple checked this - <span style="font-weight: bold">
my system is 64-bit. My disks are 64-bit. </span>As far as I can tell, the computer got scrambled during the automatic update and now part of it thinks it's 32-bit (some of the programs are divided into 32-bit and 64-bit sections). All I want to do is to reinstall
 windows, but I don't know what to do since it won't recognize my disks! Any suggestions, internet?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much.<br />
<br />
Also, if it's relevant, I'm running Windows Vista on an ASUS K50IJ laptop. I don't have the windows install disk because the computer came with windows installed, but I have the ASUS recovery disks (which have been used to restore my computer in the past).<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are unable to open programs like iTunes and Office, you may try performing System restore and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</p>
<p>To perform System restore, you may refer the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>System Restore</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the Factory restore issue, you need to get in touch with ASUS support to get further assistance on ASUS recovery disks.</p>

<h2>            In the Photos app, why can&#39;t I share to the People app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>From IE, I can share to fb/twitter through the People app. However, in the Photos app, my only options are to share to Mail or Skydrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a current limit of the OS or is something amiss?&nbsp;Some posts have mentioned the ability to share to fb/twitter from the Photos App, so I figured it was me.</p>

<p>The People app is a contact list. You can share the contact information with other programs. If you want to share photos with someone on your contact list, you will have to send the photos as an attachment or create a link using
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-HK/skydrive/showcase-photos#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>.

            I don't think so. People is a hub to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more. It should be the first option for sharing a photo to those channels.

 post to FB from the People app.</p>

            <p>This is also true with the News app.&nbsp; Occasionally it will let me share a news article to facebook via the people app but most of the time it won't.&nbsp; It is supposed to because if you remove your facebook and twitter accounts from the people app and then
 try to share something through the people app it tells you to add a facebook or twitter account to share with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is obviously something that is supposed to work but does not.&nbsp; I have seen it work a few times for me.</p>

            I'm having exactly the same problem right now with my Photos App.&nbsp;When I'm in the Pictures Library, the People app isn't in the Share charm options. The People option only appears when I'm on Skydrive. How can they NOT make this app the same as WINDOWS
 PHONE where I can update to different social networks instantly plus I have an option to tag somebody. It's so frustrating from a Windows Phone user since this is a very basic functionality on the phone. I don't know if this will ever be fixed but looking
 at the date since the issue was first raised, NOT GONNA HAPPEN.<br />
<br />
PLUS, this website doesn't even work properly on INTERNET EXPLORER 10 and this is a MICROSOFT WEBSITE. Many links are not working. So, I switched to Chrome just to post here. How PATHETIC this is.

            I am having the same problem. I added my Twitter account under the People app but when I go to share a picture in the photos app and click share, the only choices to share with are email and skydrive. Twitter does not show up. I have even been trying to
 get help from Windows support on Twitter and they don't even know what the problem is. Obviously this is not a new problem.

                    <p>Exactly as the title says, I have a Microsoft&nbsp;account and it has multiple Skype accounts under it. I used this website to&nbsp;check:&nbsp;<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. One&nbsp;is my Microsoft email, one is
 my Skype username, &lt;removed&gt;. And the last I closed by linking it to a whole new MC account. I've seen a lot of Skype accounts that have&nbsp;<em>just</em> the MC email. Is that their username? And if it isn't, why don't they have that other Skype account that
 shows with their MC email?</p>

<p>
</p><p>In short the icons in the system tray should 'double' up as they have done previously in Windows OS's, at the very least it should center them like it does when the computer is in Tablet mode, instead we get this awful looking display.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the attached screenshot, it looks like you have the taskbar enlarged which is why the icons are not placed correctly. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Right-click an empty area on the taskbar. If <span>Lock the taskbar</span> has a check mark next to it, the taskbar is locked. Unlock it by clicking
<span>Lock the taskbar</span>, which removes the check mark.</p>
<p>2. Hover the mouse pointer to the edge of the taskbar until the pointer changes into a double-headed arrow‚Äç‚Äç

 size of the taskbar and check if it changes.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have a bit of a problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your HDD is completely dead, about your only option would be to purchase the necessary media from HP....</p>
<p>Since the SSD is most likely&nbsp;smaller than the HDD, any media you purchase from HP most likely will refuse to install...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would try to install Win 8.1 directly, it may refuse to install, and if it does install, it may not activate...</p>
<p>This is because the Preinstalled stuff detects the Windows key from your BIOS, and anything else you try most likely will not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I hate to say, you may need to purchase another HDD the same size or larger than the original, and purchase the Disks from HP to reinstall Win 8.1....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do that, it would then be possible to transfer your fresh Win 8.1 installation to your SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked with HP to see if they can help you out under warranty, or otherwise ?</p>

            <p>My laptop has already passed its warranty by 6 months...HP would not give me the code to Win 8.1 unless I pay another $60+ for it.&nbsp; I don't know but I thought I've already purchased a copy of Win 8.1 when I got my laptop from HP...all they need to do now
 is just look up my PC # then they should be able to retrieve my original Win 8.1 prod # that's preinstalled on this&nbsp;laptop.</p>

            <p>It ended up that my hard drive is still working. I was able to retrieve data when I connected to another PC using a USB cable. So, it's the pre-installed program that's corrupted. I cannot start the computer to Win 8.1 environment.</p>

<p>The Windows 8.1 with Update 1 .iso from the Windows Media Creation Tool should work with your OEM HP license. I have gotten quite a bit of feedback from users who have tested these installs out, see here for details:</p>

    <title>Configuring An SSD For Software Development&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Configuring An SSD For Software Development&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks:</p>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I develop C++ with Visual Studios.&nbsp; Several projects I'm working on have over 100K lines of C++.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never used a solid state drive, but I'm getting a new computer and I want to speed up my compiles.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not particularly concerned with boot up time, faster is nice but it's not a priority.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am concerned with is ripping through large builds of my project as fast as I can.&nbsp; This is much more important than boot time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'm thinking right now, and I'd appreciate advice from people with experience in these matters, is the system files on the bootable SDD and my program source, and other sensitive and personal files on a hard drive that's been encrypted with Truecrypt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What affect would moving the C++ project files, to the SSD have on compile time?&nbsp; I can have a TrueCrypt partition on the SSD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm guessing Visual Studio generates "scratch" files as a project is compiled.&nbsp; Can these be moved to the SSD?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything else I should be considering?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry</p>
<p />

                    I have a photo file that shows the photo gallery icon instead of the pictures like all the others do, when I click on it, it does show the picture image, but then goes back to just the icon on the file, how do I get it to show the image like all the others
 do in the folder? This is just on the one file, I have the show icon never thumbnail box unchecked, so need to know how to correct&nbsp;an individual file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> erlewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avermedia AVerTV Bravo Hybrid PCI-E TV Tuner Card - is it really and fully compatible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am searching for a digital TV tuner card that is compatible with Windows Media Center and Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; This card is listed on this Microsoft compatibility site as fully compatible.&nbsp; However the AVerMedia technical support folks are less than enciouraging
 about this.&nbsp; " But we should advise the product you owned is EOL(Ends of Life). Since we are developing the new models continually with better functions for the users, there is
 no more plans for RD department to provide upgraded drivers for MCE. Please kindly understand the situation and your consideration will be much appreciated. "&nbsp; This is their response to my submission stating that Windows Media Center (WMC) does not find any
 tuner present.</p>
<p>I have a version of this card (same model number but digital tuner only) that appears to work with the AVer Media Center (AMC) but is not recognized by Windows Media Center.&nbsp; Moreover, the AMC hangs when I launch it a
 second time after opening it and closing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the card is not usable after resuming from S3 state.&nbsp; I found several feedback reports at the Newegg site saying this card does work with WMC and does reconnect after resuming from S3 power down state.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am left wondering if AVerMedia cards suffer from digital anamolies that result in different experiences?&nbsp; A followup to this responce elicited this response from AverMedia
</p>
<p>"In advance, we need to clarify AVerTVHD Bravo support Win7 MCE as the mentioned in our website. We supposed it's compatibility issue between the card and your desktop. Refer to some comments from the Newegg link page,
 there are still some users can't make the device back to work from S3 sleep state in MCE. Could you help to confirm if run "windows update" to check if any available updates. Since the Windows Media Center is a third party software provider, we suggest you
 contact with the Microsoft customer support center if the problem persists.<br />
<br />
As our understanding, AVerTVHD Bravo function with no issues while operating Avermedia Center in your computer. It's suggested to run accordingly or try to duplicate it in another desktop since there isn't enough development resources to provide the customized
 driver at that time. Please understand the situation and your consideration will be much appreciated."</p>
<p>My computer is a new build using the Asus P8Z68-VPro and is using LucidLogix Virtu with an Intel i5-2320 and VisionTek Radeon HD5670 video card.&nbsp; Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.<br />
</p>
<p>I am tempted to mark the MS compatibility page for this card as WRONG but I am more interested to find a card that has proven to work and is backed up by the manufacturer as fully compatible with</p>
<ol>
<li>WMC</li><li>Win 7 64-bit</li><li>resumes OK from S3</li></ol>
<p>Does anyone have any insight to why I am having difficulty with this quest? Does Virtu play into this equation?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><br />

            <p>Perhaps this is so but should it be?&nbsp; This is the "year of the Protestor" according to Time and the primary purpose of a TV tuner card in a "PC" is to work with Windows Media Center.&nbsp; Ironically, it turns out that this card does now appear to work well with
 WMC.&nbsp; The AVerMedia supplied Aver Media Center does not work well and has severe problems that make it unusable.</p>
<p>So your comment is an indictment of AVerMedia if "supporting their own product" is the test of sufficient support.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>AVerMedia could have saved me a lot of work it it had simply included information for how to set the card up with WMC and was more forthcoming about the AMC deficiencies.</p>
<p>If you take the argument that a vendor claiming to support another vendors Operating System and associated software is a claim of support ... well, AverMedia says WMC is supported and Windows 7 is supported.&nbsp; That is the bottom line for me.&nbsp; Anyway, my crisis
 is over and I am going to close this thread.&nbsp; Thanks for your comments.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><em>"the game it self is not there, only the data and stuff like that to the game."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which, I believe would be some of the games files. </p>
<p>[ btw - When using a disk based version of a game you are installing, not downloading.
</p>
<p>Download is the term used when you get something from the internet. In the case of a game you may</p>
<p>download an installer package (As with GOG, below)&nbsp; which you use to install from, or the game installs
</p>
<p>while downloading (eg - Steam). ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disk 2 may have some corrupt files or be otherwise faulty. One way to determine if the disk is OK is
</p>
<p>to copy the contents of the disk to a new folder. A folder on your desktop is handy.</p>
<p>If the files all copy then also copy the full contents of Disk 1 to that folder and run the games setup from there.</p>
<p>- It would be safest to delete any files that have already been installed before running the setup again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However...</p>
<p>The game also uses <em>SafeDisk </em>copy protection which MS has started blocking since the advent of Win10,</p>
<p>On Win7 this is done via Windows Security Update - <em>KB3086255</em> - . </p>
<p>My disk based version of the game was installed before upgrading to Win10 so I don't know if this particular
</p>
<p>game will install if this update has been installed on Win7. Some games do, but some don't.
</p>
<p>Those games that won't install should install if you use the copy method above, but you will still require a
</p>
<p>noCD fix/hack to run the game if you don't uninstall&nbsp; KB3086255, or use the other method described</p>
<p>in my post regarding DRM Blocking at&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread-</a>-</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If you don't already have the <em>Spearhead</em> and <em>Breakout </em>expansions you may find it worthwhile to keep an</p>
<p>eye on Good old Games for a sale of the MOH-AA War Chest version (or pay the $10- ?).
</p>
<p>GOG removes all DRM and tweaks their games to make them run better on modern Windows.</p>
<p>I bought this version on sale for $5-&nbsp; for the expansions, and it runs well on Win7 &amp; 10.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Black Borders on the side&#47;Smaller Screen Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mungbeansprout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Black Borders on the side&#47;Smaller Screen Issues</h2>
                    Hello everyone<br />
<br />
I have a surface pro 4 and I have the black side border issue.<br />
<br />
I have tried what I could including settings, deleting and reinstalling hardware and updating it and windows update. Other tips I found on sites suggest tweaking the registry. However, it seems to be video card/desktop specific so I stayed away.<br />
<br />
It happened on a stormy night with the surface plugged into the wall socket. I was using DosBox on windowed mode at the time.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the screen turned black and when it returned, the borders appeared.<br />
<br />
Now if I disable the video driver, the screen covers the entire monitor but I cannot use the pen.<br />
If I enable the drivers, it goes back to covering a portion of the screen.<br />
<br />
If I maximise DosBox it covers the whole screen as well.<br />
<br />
The partial coverage is annoying enough, but it feels as if the resolution has gone down on some apps and is frustrating to use.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

<br />
If that works, you're done. Otherwise:<br />
<br />
<span>Per MVP Ramesh, one of the most common causes for Add/Remove Programs being blank</span> is that a recent install/uninstall routine may have wiped out the contents of the entire "Uninstall" registry key here:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall<br />
<br />
Each sub-key stores the Display Name, UninstallString information for a program that you installed. Open Regedit.exe and navigate to the above key. Check if the "Uninstall" key is empty (contains no sub-keys). In that case, your best best is to rollback the
 system state using System Restore.</span>

<h2>            Official Xbox One Media Remote Media Buttons Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the official Xbox One Media Remote for about 6 months. For at least a few weeks now, the media buttons (play, stop, fast forward, etc) have not been working on any app, including just trying to pause OTA live TV. All other buttons are working
 properly. Any ideas? Other people on third party forums seem to be having the same issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 file explorer scrolls itself to the top - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirk gremillion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 file explorer scrolls itself to the top</h2>
                    <p>This is NOT the "Left pane scroll" issue so many people have pointed to.&nbsp; I've made a video and posted it to YouTube so that I could show you what is happening: https://youtu.be/xzte0GjBKpE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, if I have a list of files that fills more than the screen area available, such that a scroll bar appears to the right of the file listing, and if I then scroll down some ways, like I'm looking for a particular file, after some time, random it
 seems, the "scroll" function resets back to the top of the file list!&nbsp; What's going on here guys?</p>

<p>Hello Belgie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error you're getting is one of the many error codes of the <strong><em>.dll</em></strong> files that are missing on the Windows operating system.&nbsp;<span>If the software can't find the file, or if
 it is corrupted, you'll get a&nbsp;</span><em>DLL
<strong>file is missing</strong></em><span>&nbsp;message. Having said that, note that the&nbsp;</span><strong>DLL</strong><span>&nbsp;stands
 for&nbsp;</span><strong>Dynamic Link Libraries</strong><span>&nbsp;and are external parts of applications that run on Windows or any other operating systems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometimes it's possible that the issue is just temporary and you'll just need to restart your computer. If the issue persists, we recommend that you run&nbsp;</span><span>the
 DISM to repair&nbsp;</span><span>the Windows system image and the&nbsp;</span><span>built-in&nbsp;</span>System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These tools<span>&nbsp;in Windows allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>You can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>&nbsp;to know
 more details about it. Just make sure to carefully follow the steps.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80bd0009 not found&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox One S connected to my Samsung TV then through the ARC cable to my Yamaha. Both HDMI cables are High Speed HDMI.&nbsp;All devices are HDCP 2.2 compliant. The HDR works on the TV (proving a compliance chain) but I get the error&nbsp;0x80bd0009 each time I try to enable Atmos.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the Xbox settings audio output menu it sometimes stays there without error but is muted when I test using the Insects app and other&nbsp;times it changes back to HDMI with stereo. I rebooted the Xbox from the settings menu and now I get the error&nbsp;0x80bd0009 which can't even be found at xbox.com/error help. Now here I am STILL waiting for Xbox to get their $hit straight and fix this ongoing issue. So Xbox support, what is the solution??!</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Hello, i had the same problem with my HDMI home-theater, i couldn't get HDMI&nbsp;sound passtrough 5.1&nbsp;(error&nbsp;0x80bd0009) probably due to 4K resolution. I found a solution so i hope it could help you, it just need to be configured first&nbsp;in&nbsp;manual&nbsp;1080P, it's just a bug of the autodetect resolution&nbsp;mode that almost never works for passthrough sound even in 1080p now. First you need to switch in display and sound TV connection from Auto-detect to HDMI. Then you'll have a poor resolution. You'll have to switch to 1080P and then accept all the options available in advanced video&nbsp;options and&nbsp;on the right&nbsp;for games and apps, don't forget to select :&nbsp;Allow 4k. When you'll have done this you'll need to go in audio output and select under&nbsp;speaker audio HDMI audio and 5.1 passthrough (or 7.1 depending on your home-cinema). Here you shouldn't get the error code (0x80bd0009). Then you'll just need to get back to Display and sound and go back to Display

    <title>Controller Analog Stick Wear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> will got gas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller Analog Stick Wear </h2>
                    
<p>I'm sure anybody who plays FPS games is aware of this issue. Whenever you go to sprint, the analog stick grinds against the rim. The original controllers had this issue pretty bad, to the point wear my controllers only lasted a few
 months simply because a lip would form on the base of my analog stick, causing the stick to go unnaturally too far forward and ultimately damaging the controller beyond repair. Xbox offers the solution of buying a new controller, but rubbing alcohol cleaning
 can repair the issue for a duration until eventually the controller is done. I recently purchased a new Xbox One controller with the "redesigned analog sticks" and the soft touch grip on the back of the handles. I'm 3 days in and already noticing wear on my
 left analog, so since Microsoft refuses to fix the problem or offer a solution, does anybody have a method of combating this issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same problem here, after upgrading to Windows 10 no cursor. Can you please send me the update?&nbsp;

</p><p>My PC will boot with functioning mouse &amp; keyboard; but after some apparently random time the mouse and keyboard become inactive; and the only way to get them going again it to cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that this is happening to many due to the number of posts athwart the web. My system is a Lenovo 'IdeaCenter'&nbsp; K330 7727.5gu.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am willing to let you remote monitor my system in order to attempt to determine what is exactly causing this.&nbsp; I'm
 a Microsoft Partner and can send any additional information you need. Just let me know.</p>
