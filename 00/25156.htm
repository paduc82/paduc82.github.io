    <title>Will the Mango update improve landscape support&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will the Mango update improve landscape support&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought an HTC Arrive (WP7 phone with a keyboard) and I was very surprised that the phone doesn't support landscape mode in some of the most important places.<br />
<br />
For example, when you open up the people button, hit the search button, and open up the keyboard to type, the screen stays in vertical mode. So you are typing with the text box oriented vertically on your screen. I don't understand how they could have missed
 something like this.<br />
<br />
Another example is the home screen doesn't rotate. I used to have a Touch Pro 2, and 90% of the time I was using it I had the keyboard open. Now I have to open and close the keyboard every other screen and it is very very annoying.<br />

            <p>In playing with the emulator I've not come across anything that stands out as hugely different with respect to orientation. The People hub still shows up in portrait mode,so does the home screen.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Suddenly&nbsp;( I&nbsp;believe after a cash/cookies deletion) I cannot enable&nbsp;the Adobe Flash Player add-on.&nbsp;When I&nbsp;click 'Allow' or 'Allow for all websites' nothing&nbsp;happens. The&nbsp;Add-on notification keeps coming back all the time.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I sometimes use Glary Utilities or CCleaner (including their registry cleaning utility). But not&nbsp;in connection with&nbsp;the Adobe Flash Player add-on enabling problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I can open the page, but it doesn't tell me that Flash Player is installed. The same page in Chrome works fine though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, it's&nbsp;another computer. However, I have used Glary Utilities on that computer as well. And by fact, I have since one week noticed a returning performance issue. This time not connected to the previous problem&nbsp;(using CrashPlan in conjunction with OneDrive
 online files). </p>
<p>So it's a mystery why suddenly the machine feels so&nbsp;slack...&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is not in connection with use of Glary Utilities. It just happened from one day to another.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Suddenly the&nbsp;another computer works&nbsp;as expected again! There was&nbsp;a Windows 8 update yesterday&nbsp;and after that&nbsp;the sluggish problem disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But are you saying that "Registry cleaners"&nbsp;can cause problems in Win 8? If so, what do you&nbsp;recommend me to do with these PC's?</p>

            <p>Actually, after a closer look, I have all the CCleaner backups, and Glary Utilities backups until June 11 which is before the problem started.
</p>
<p>I restored the latest backups (also before the problem started) but it didn't change anything, the add-on problem is still there... &nbsp;Do I really need to restore all available backups?</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: I just noticed a system message saying that OneDrive stopped working. And I can see that the OneDrive folder is no longer showing any online files, just the offline. Could this OneDrive issue be connected to the registry restore? Now I feel confused...
 &nbsp; </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And what about a System restore? The earliest point is from July 17, which is before the problem started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>1. Yes, see if restoring ALL registry cleaner&nbsp;backups, followed by a reboot, makes any difference (then stop using CCleaner's Registry Cleaner &amp; uninstall Glary Utilities).</p>
<p>

<h3> zechla-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I choose an old password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today I changed my password on mistake because I thought my Skype and Outlook account had different passwords. I want to put it back to the way it was but I get this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please choose a password that you haven't used before. To help protect your account, you need to choose a new password every time you reset it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely ridiculous. I should not be limited to choosing a new password every time. This is how to get someone locked out of their account because they do not remember their password. Is there a way I can get around this issue or can you fix it
 for me? I was really fond of my old password and absolutely do not want to try a new one or I will forget it instantly. Please fix this issue or at least give your customer the option to keep their old passcode. It's dumb to always force customers to do something
 they might not want to do; it's a service FOR them. Give them a warning, such as "Are you sure you would like to use your old password? For security reasons, we recommend choosing a new one." Or something of the sort. I am furious about this issue and if it
 cannot be resolved I will be switching to Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that I might get a response along the lines of "We would like to understand more about your issue..." - If I do, I am switching to Google. My question is very clear and there are only two options: change your system to allow the user to choose
 an old password, or show me to an option that allows me to bypass the error message. There is nothing more to inquire about in the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has competition in e-mail systems, Microsoft has competition in video call systems... I have been an avid user of Microsoft products in the past and encouraging people to choose Microsoft but my faith in the company is faltering due to such idiotic
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix this problem, please.</p>

            <p>For us to resolve this issue, let's start with checking the phone software if it's updated by going to
<strong>Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Phone update&gt; Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the phone software is updated, we suggest that you perform a soft reset to refresh the phone. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes. </p>

                    I have hundreds of PDF documents that I have to save in the SAME file location (in the same folder which has many sub folders). Is there a way that I can set a "default" save as location, so that I don't have to go through 7 steps to get to the folder
 that I want ?<br />

            Microsoft Office is not compatible with PDF files, so it is difficult to see what you mean by saving them to the same folder. Where are they now? What software are you using to open them in order to save them?<br />
<br />
Let us have some more information and we may be able to offer a solution.<br />
<br />
As you are using Windows 7, why not create a library with your required folder, then you won't have to go digging to find it?<br />

<h2>            Communication between Skype for Business Online and regular Skype not functioning</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello everybody!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have an Office 365 Business environment that we use for work. It’s purely online, not on-premise. I am looking into migrating from regular Skype to Skype for Business, but am running into some connectivity issues.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am currently not able to contact regular (external) Skype users with our SfB. This is a two way thing, as either account can sent a invite to the other, but you won’t see the invitation on the receiving end.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I sent the invite from the SfB account to my personal Skype account, I do get a message that the invitation has been sent, and that I can communicate with the person once it invitation has been accepted. However, no invitation is
 seen at the receiving side.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Things I have tried so far, all to no avail:</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -
</span></span></span><span>Updating the test computers to the latest Windows and Skype/SfB versions. As of writing this the SfB client is running version 16.0.8201.2102, 32-bits, the regular Skype clients version 7.37.0.103, and the computers Windows
 10 Pro, build 15063.413.</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>- Correctly configuring all DNS records for Office 365. The O365 admin panel tells me that all DNS records are configured correctly</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>- Disabling ‘Public IM-Connectivity’ in the SfB admin panel, wait over 6 hours, and then re-enable it, wait another handful of hours and try again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any help is greatly appreciated. Do note that I am not an O365 expert, so easy to understand and follow technical explanations and questions are also welcome
</span><span>😊</span><span>.</span></p>

            Hi Joshua,<br />
<br />
Per checking this article, contacting Skype for Business users from Skype is feasible.<br />
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12315/can-i-contact-skype-for-business-users-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12315/can-i-contact-skype-for-business-users-from-skype</a><br />
<br />
Thus, I think the sentence you quoted means that if the Skype user cannot search for and find a Skype for Business user in some specific situation, the Skype for Business user should send a contact request to the Skype user so the initial connection can be
 established.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sorry for the confusion caused and glad to hear everything starts to work now from your side.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sam<br />

    <title>Excel and .csv bank statements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmurray74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel and .csv bank statements</h2>
                    I have exported my bank statements as .csv files but when i paste them into exel the balance column is not accurate as it seems to be placing the item description in alphabetical order, e.g if i have 4 transactions in one day they are listed alphabetically
 and not in the order they were paid into or out of the bank so in the balance column the total is not consistent, is there an easier way than going through my bank statement and manually moving each row to match the statement?

<p>Apparently on your Mac the .csv file type is set to open with Numbers by default when you
<em>double-click</em> one in Finder. Copying from Numbers captures the Numbers interpretation which may differ from how Excel would see the file. Have you tried:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Excel, use <strong>File&gt; Open</strong> to open the CSV rather than copying from the Numbers environment?
<em>Or</em>,</li><li>In Finder, <em>right-click</em> the CSV, point to <strong>Open with</strong> &amp; select
<em>Microsoft Excel</em> rather than <em>Numbers</em>?</li></ul>
<p>BTW: If you right-click a CSV &amp; select Get Info you can designate Excel as the default for all files of that type if you choose to do so.</p>

            Yep, it requires 6.5. I did a forced install on a 6.1 phone and from experience I can tell you that you don't want to do that.

<p>I have the same problem, even though I remove all SMS from Inbox and Sent, there was no notification of a new SMS -- only by explicitly checking if there's something new in the Inbox I discovered a new text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Can Nokia Care Point fix this (send this in for fixing) or do I have to live with it? (My phone still has warranty, and is on the newest firmware.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>got troubles not seeing new sms msg today -- beginning to hate this phone -- or nokia for not fixing this issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what could be the cause of the problem? under which circumstances sms tones work and under which it doesn't? for me it seems after restarting the phone the next few messages get notified correctly but if i keep the phone on for some days they don't. maybe
 a memory getting full issue?</p>

            also, i have a 16gb sd card, what about u Dushyantha?<br />
<br />
i'm thinking that maybe the sd size cud make a difference as the phone runs out of memory due to addressing the 16gb space ...

<h2>            Excel - Copying files with pivot tables still linking to the original file</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue concerns an MS Excel file which includes a lot of data and around 30 pivot tables. I do a lot of work in this file and to safeguard my work and data, I make a lot of copies of the file (in Windows Explorer) in order to have different versions.
 Let's say the original is version 1 and the copy is version 2. Normally, when I make the copy, the pivot tables in version 2 will be sourced by the data in version 2. However, when I make a copy of the file with the 30 pivot tables, I notice the source of
 the data has changed from version 2 to version 1. To change this, requires a lot of work as you have to change all sources manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know why this happens? And what I can do about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>dh</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>We have a user with a fairly large Exchange 2010 mailbox; this is approx. 3 GB with around 20,000 items in the inbox. When we set him up on a Lumia 650 Windows 10 phone,
 Outlook Mail seems to struggle synchronising using active synch. Other functions like Out of Office and sending email also seem to fail. We managed to set the synch settings to only last 7 days which helped with sending emails but this isn’t an option we can
 keep as older emails will need to be viewed.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>We set up the same user and mailbox on a Lumia 640XL Windows 8.1 and there are no issues reported all functions work ok and Synching is relative quick.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>Can anyone advise why the Windows 10 better spec phone is not able to cope with this mailbox? And how to get this to work please ?</span></span></p>

                    I have 2 accounts created. 1 is for my personal use which I have been using for almost 5 years which is working fine but I have another account which I had created for temporary use and I wanted to close the second account but whenever I am trying to login
 to the account it displays the message that "The Microsoft account does not exist" but I know for a fact that the account does exist because when I search on Skype using the Skype ID it displays the profile along with the picture. How do I close the profile.

</p><p class="contentStandard">The error I see almost applies to the english function names, even if I am using Excel in another language. However, sometimes Excel also crashed when I used an UDF with a localized function name. But I could not reproduce the error
 constantly for localized function names in my test Add-In.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">First, please create an Excel Add-In. For this, open Excel and create a new file. Then open the VBA-Editor and add a new module, e.g. by using the menue
<em>Insert</em>. Add This code to the module:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Public Function IFS() As String</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">IFS = "I am an UDF for IFS"</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">End Function</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Save the file as Excel-Add-In (*xlam), e.g. MyAddin.xlam. Now you need an
<em>older version of Excel</em>, where the IFS function does not exist yet. I used e.g. Excel 2010/2013 on another computer, where I copied my Add-In in a folder. In this Excel version, activate the Add-In by going to the Excel Options, category Add-Ins and
 clicking on the button (Go... or similar) and setting a checkmark to your Add-In. May be, you should select the location first. Then create a new file in the old Excel version and add the formula =IFS() to cell A1. The value displayed should be "I am an UDF
 for IFS" in cell A1. Save the file, for example IFS.xlsx.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Get back to Excel 2016 Build&nbsp;16.0.7167.2026. The Add-In should not be active in this version. Open the file IFS.xlsx. You may be asked to enable the automatic updating of links. Please allow this. In cell A1 you should see #NAME?
 as the function can not be found. All correct until here. Now change any other cell and click on save. Excel crashes.</p>

<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Translated to English, the error message says that there is not enough memory for this action and recommends to choose less data or close other applications. The error was reproductible with several other functions. I tried SWITCH,
 FORMULATEXT, WEBSERVICE and IFS as function names in my Add-In, which all throwed the error. I tried WENNS, FORMELTEXT, ERSTERWERT and WEBDIENST (the German names) in my Add-In. These ones sometimes throwed the error.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if anyone encounters this issue, please rename your UDF to something that is not the same as an existing Excel function.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>So I set the Paragraph and fonts. There is no place where I check <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
"Make this the default setting".</span></p>
<p>If I open a new blank .pub doc the settings go back to the&nbsp;original&nbsp;default settings. Even when I copy and paste into pub from another pub doc or a word doc, the formatting changes, back to the pre-programed default font and Paragraph settings.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are correct. There is no place in Publisher where you can <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
"Make this the default setting". </span>The instructions Mohan gives only changes the font and paragraph settings for the individual text box -&nbsp; NOT the entire publication nor new Publisher publications. His instructions might work for Word but they do not
 work for Publisher as the OP also noted above. Word and Publisher <strong>do not</strong> have the same features or functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor is there any need to do a repair of Publisher as Mohan suggests to your question. Publisher is working as designed and doing a repair won't change the way Publisher works but it might break something else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you want to copy and paste try using the options under <strong>Paste Special</strong>.
<strong>Home tab</strong> &gt; click the down arrow below <strong>Paste</strong>. Also when you get ready to paste try a right click and look at the options under Paste. You can mouseover those options and see what the pasted text will look like. Then once you
 do paste, notice the <strong>Ctrl</strong> icon on the edge of the text box and click the down arrow to see the options of
<strong>Keep Source formatting</strong> and <strong>Keep text only</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read my instructions above about how to create a <strong>building block</strong> and
<strong>page parts</strong> and how to use the <strong>format painter</strong>. In my opinion if you learn how to use these tools and the options under
<strong>Paste special</strong> and under <strong>right click paste</strong> and the options to change the paste options after pasting then you will be better off than trying to change the default settings in a Publisher template or a blank page. However if
 you want to try to change the default for a blank page then this article might give you a method to reset the defaults. The method should work for Publisher 2013 though I have not tried it. I have already shared my preferences about how to use Publisher and
 I don't care about changing my default settings.</p>

<p>Actually that setting does not appear to exist in the current release of Skype 8.25.0.5* nor the former Skype Preview&nbsp;<span>8.25.76.1 , so no one could find it. On ~<strong>July 2, 2018
</strong>(less than a week later after these posts were made), the <strong>Skype Preview 8.25.76.3</strong>
<strong>pre-release</strong> was made available. It was the first pre-release I could find to have the newer Settings layout vs. the former Application/Audio and Video Settings layout. In Skype Preview 8.25.76.3 and above, you will find it under Settings -
 Calling - Advanced.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>*I have run across an instance of the newer menu existing on Skype 8.25.0.5. This may be due to the newer preview version being installed prior to the release. This either means some components are left updated, it
 is a selective push, or a bit of both. I have also seen the latest preview releases revert to the older menu (like Preview 8.26.76.25). Consistency of the option/layout existing from release to release will probably be intermittent&nbsp;as they continue to make
 changes to the software.</span></p>

</p><p>I was wondering ive been running windows 10 preview since it was launched. And at this point I am only using it. However I have a valid liscense for windows 7 pro. But I no longer have it installed on my pc does that mean I wount get free upgrade when windows
 10 is released. I uninstalled it a few weeks ago cuase I was no longer using it windows 10 in my eyes is better at this point and runs everything I do flawlessly with out ishues. If I have to have windows 7 installed on my pc I can reinstall on another hard
 drive just want to know if I need to do this. </p>

</p><p>I tried your first suggestion but when I click on 'Font Collections' there is no 'Windows Office Compatible' option.<br />

Century Gothic is also not in my Font Book.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cath,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>About this issue, I suggest you do the following troubleshooting steps:</span></p>
<p><span>To identity if add-ins cause the abnormal&nbsp;operation of Outlook, I suggest you Start up Mac in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The white Apple logo appears on your display. If you don't&nbsp;see the Apple logo,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">learn
 what to do</span></a>.</span></li><li>
<span>Release the shift key when you see the login window. If your startup disk is encrypted with&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">FileVault</span></a>,
 you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>To leave safe mode, restart your Mac without pressing any keys during startup.</span></p>
<p><span>While in Safe Boot I suggest you use open Font Book, click&gt; File&gt;Validate Font to validate ALL your fonts. Get rid of any font that
 doesn't pass as clean and green. Then restart your Mac and then empty the trash.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Resume help... Huge white space</h2>
                    I recently updated my résumé and I think it might be a template from Microsoft. In the process of updating. I have this half page of nothing and then it continues on to the rest of my résumé. I have tried everything I can think of or that my friends have
 come up with and nothing works to make the space go away. Does anyone know what to do?

            At first read, it sounds like you might have a next page section break confused with a continuous section break. Another possibility is a fore-shortened page area due to the wrong margins or a rogue footer.
<div><br />
<div>Expose your formatting marks with Ctrl+Shift+8 to see if the problem becomes apparent. Failing that, could you upload a copy to a public file storage area&nbsp;<span>like</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://db.tt/1YbiAnmF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DropBox</a><span>,
 and post a link to the file back here? The file and link can be removed once one of the volunteers here has had a chance to download it for a first hand look.</span></div>

<div>Good catch. This is a very&nbsp;likely&nbsp;candidate. Show the table's gridlines by first clicking inside the table. This will give you the Table Tools menu. Go to Table Tools, Layout and choose View Gridlines from the left-most Table group.</div>

            <p>On the Home tab, open the Paragraph group.&nbsp; Check to make sure that you do not have a lot of Space before or Space after (expressed in points), and check the box that says, "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another drastic fix is to select the entire document ("Select all" at the far right end of the Home tab), and then click "Clear formatting" (in the Font group).&nbsp; That may remove whatever is causing the problem, but then you will have to format headings,
 fonts and font sizes, indentation, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possible fix is to select all, then copy and paste everything into a new, blank document.&nbsp; Sometimes that works.</p>

    <title>lock a cell value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deebabe57  say:</h3>
<h2>            lock a cell value</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to lock a cell value once a formula&nbsp;is calculated? I don't want to replace&nbsp;the formula, just keep the value from changing if one of the ref cell values in the formula change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ie&nbsp; I fund an account each month with 1/12 of the yearly amount due so that when a quarterly, semi annual or annual bill comes due there are funds available for payment. My current formula takes the prior month balance minus any paid amount plus the monthly
 amount to get the new balance. My problem arises when a bill amount changes and I adjust the monthly amount to reflect that change. How do I prevent all the prior calculated values from changing?&nbsp; want to use that new value for the rest of the year, but not
 go back and change the prior month calculations. </p>

<p><span>Hi Polachan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my understanding, if user has Exchange Online license, they should be able to see the Mail tile in app launcher. About your
 first requirement “create Outlook web app”, do you mean that your tenant doesn’t use Exchange Online license? Do you use Exchange sever and local mail boxes?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your second requirement, you may try the following options:</span></p>
<p><span>Option 1. Add Promoted links app in your SharePoint team site. And then add it as web part to the team site home page. You could check
 steps mentioned in the video below.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZOftiTdL-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZOftiTdL-0</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/fZOftiTdL-0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/fZOftiTdL-0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></span></p>
<p><span>Option 2. As you mentioned portal, I assume you may want to add custom tiles in app launcher for some web sites. To achieve this, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-custom-tiles-to-the-app-launcher-1136115a-75af-4497-b693-640c4ce70bc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add custom tiles to the app launcher</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: To see custom tiles, users
 need to have Exchange Online licenses. Meanwhile, after you create the custom tile. End user need to add it to their app launcher by themselves.
