<h2>            Recovering over-written ppt presentation - no previous versions available</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Enterprise. I deleted some slides and saved over (over-wrote) the ppt with the same name. Can I recover the previous ppt before I deleted the slides? I checked for previous versions, but none exist under the file info tab.&nbsp; Thanks.

<p><span>Thank you for asking.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to hear that you have over written a presentation.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately if the presentation is edited and saved you would not be able to recover the information which was

            <p>Dear Velu16,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contributing to the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are unable to download updates&nbsp;to your&nbsp;Lumia 925. You get&nbsp;the error&nbsp;code 80070435.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I suggest:</p>
<p>A. Please check you have enough&nbsp;storage available (Settings -&gt; Storage).</p>
<p>B. It is always good to do a soft reset for your phone from time to time.</p>
<p>C. Make sure you are connected to a WIFI.</p>
<p>D. Wait for&nbsp;a few&nbsp;days and the update will be restarted, that is by design.</p>
<p>E. To restart the download, please go to the keyboard language and download a new language pack.</p>
<p>F. If the device does not get updated&nbsp;despite the steps above, the only option is to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>G. If that fails after a hard reset, please contact the mobile provider to get the device inspected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, keep us informed and have a lovely day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            something went wrong message keeps appearing when downloading Office 365 please help</h2>
                    I just bought a windows 8 laptop today and I've been trying to install Office 365 for hours! I've tried everything, but this message keeps coming up that says "something went wrong office can't do that right now because your product is busy with another
 task. Please wait for this task to complete and try again" I have no idea what task&nbsp;that message is&nbsp;talking about. When I download it, I have no other windows open and nothing else is downloading. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. I've
 tried adding the icon to my desktop and configuring the setting from there but NOTHING WORKS! The error always pops back up. PLEASE HELP IM GETTING FRUSTRATED, TIRED, AND DESPERATE AT THIS POINT

<p>I have attempted to locate the files to do a manual uninstall following tips from others&nbsp;and using the online Fix it tool, but Microsoft Office is not located in my Installed Programs List so I can uninstall it first to attempt another reinstall.</p>

            It took a few times but if you go to the link to get help on the net to the Microsoft link it should help diagnose the problem. Mine finally loaded after about 3 tries. Just don't run any demos until everything is installed.... Works great now......

            Thanks Todd. I ended up having to do Manual uninstall's via Command Prompts and Service Functions - now I am getting an error message saying I have a beta version and need to uninstall that - but feel a lot more confident in finding the answers now that
 I have been through those first steps! At least now I feel there is an end in sight! LOL

            I had tried all of this before and it still didn't work. What I ended up doing was going&nbsp;to the support page on here and clicking on the Ask Desk. I did an online chat with a tech and they were able to help me.&nbsp; Because I had uninstalled and installed
 so many times she said it would be a good idea to clean all of that stuff out first.&nbsp; She took over my computer and cleaned it out then proceeded to install Office365 for me.&nbsp; THIS WAS THE BEST WAY TO GO! They are able to fix the problem for you right then
 and there.&nbsp;She also told me that if the error persist again that&nbsp;I should not close out the window and contact them again which was helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had tried everything else but she was the only one who got it up and downloading.&nbsp; The download took a day because
 it said I had a slow connection but it was worth the wait.

            <p>Windows 10 is an UpGrade to qualified windows versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't need a key when doing an upgrade.. it will find the key itself and register&nbsp;a new key&nbsp;and store it&nbsp;in the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to do the Upgrade install and activate - after that you can do
 a fresh install as many times as you like</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no the product id is not your key.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only key you can type into&nbsp;windows 10&nbsp; is a purchased windows 10 key.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other key right now will cause you problems.</p>

            I upgraded my win 8.1 and I was not asked for a windows key, As mentioned with Mike P, maybe Deep did a install, not an upgrade. If you used the USB at boot up to install you did not update, &nbsp;you did the install. You must do the install/update within the
 windows your updating from

<h2>            Apps that don&#39;t work in windows 10 Tech. Pr.</h2>
                    <p>Since I installed&nbsp;Windows 10 Tech Pr., my windows apps for "Viber" and "Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter"&nbsp;both stopped working.</p>
<p>When I try to reinstall them, the will not install. Has anybody else run into this problem, and if so how did you get them to work again?</p>
<p>One good improvement with the apps. I install the "NFL Game Pass" on my Win8 and my Win8.1 but the never worked. I installed it</p>
<p>on Win10 and it works great. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments on this?</p>

            <p>That would seem to indicate that at some point a Click2Run version of Office was/is installed on your system (or it thinks it should be). What version of Office '2010 exactly was installed (i.e. Home &amp; Business, Pro etc)</p>
<p>Just for the sake of confirmation - you did try to uninstall any Office related program and then re-install Office 2010 - is that correct? Once uninstalling as much as possible manually, you ran the uninstall "fix-it" to ensure everything was cleaned out
 prior to re-installing Office '2010? (your reply wasn't clear as to what exactly it was that you tried prior to starting Excel)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sounds like each Office program was installed separately for some reason versus a full MS Office install.</p>
<p>You may try the following to see if it helps</p>
<p>Diagnose and fix program installing and uninstalling problems automatically<br />

</p>
<p>If the above doesn't resolve anything, then, while not&nbsp;something that I normally suggest as a solution,&nbsp;if this occurred on one of my systems, would be one of those instances where I'd uninstall everything related to MS Office completely and then re-install
 Office 2010. As a precaution, would also make sure that have all Outlook profile info for your email account(s) just to be on the safe side...</p>
<p>Control Panel --&gt; User Accounts &amp; Family Safety --&gt; Mail applet</p>
<p>Once all of MS Office is uninstalled, would also follow the process in the following article before re-installing O'2010</p>

</p>
<p>Other people may have other (better?) suggestions but that's the approach I'd follow at this point based on the problem description.&nbsp;It does sound like something got corrupted along the way.</p>
<p>Another side comment about image backup - if your Outlook data is located in the standard default locations (or simply on the same drive as Windows) - make sure that you also keep current backups of your Outlook data in between image backups otherwise you're
 going to lose a lot of info if image backups are done infrequently.</p>

<h2>            N95 8GB - better web browser</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I see the browser that comes with the N95 8Gb is more of a WAP browser. Anyone know of a full blown web browser which wont water down the content returned? On my 6680 I think it was the Opera browser which rendered an HTML page in full, and one could use navigation
 keys to move left right up and down around the web page. with the wap browser its just up and down.<br />
<br />
Thanks a mil<br />

            Are you sure you are using it correctly? I use the built in browser on many S60 phones and it allows you to scroll left, right, up and down. Also most websites look like they do on a pc, just smaller.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you are browsing the web version of a site and not the wap version?<br />
<br />
The only real alternative at the moment is opera or opera mini:<br />

            Thanks i'll check out opera.<br />
<br />
Go to google.com. Ity might look simlar but do you see ALL the same link on the top left corner as you do on PC? compare it....mine is def watered down. Also, I cannot scroll sideways, it shrinks the page to fit the width of my screen, do you have an example
 URl I can go to which allows you to scrolls right and left and cause the entire page to move (not the just the mouse cursor)?<br />
<br />
Thanks a mil

            Google does that because it detects that you are using a phone. There should be a link in the bottom corner to display it like the pc version.<br />
<br />
The bbc website also does the same, it thinks you want to browse the mobile site so you have to tell it you want the full site.<br />
<br />
Open this forum in your phones browser and you will see the phone browser work as it should.<br />

Mine still displaying in one narrow column and cannot scroll left and right. If you go to 'Settings', then 'Page', I have set screen to Full Screen and still no change. I know its normally the webserver which decides the outputted content based o nthe browser,but
 do you think that maybe my mobile carrier/network is doing this? What else could you suggets,maybe I have a setting wrong?

            Found it! Right at the bottom after scrolling down for a while there is a link called 'Unmod', clicking this reverts the screen to normal as you are seeing it. Did yo not have to click this link before seeing what you took a screen shot of?

Some networks have a connection for wap browsing and a connection for web browsing.<br />

I didn't have to click any links on barclays.<br />

<p>Lawrence Thanks for fast reply. Yes I did a clean install as well on drive c:, D: is my data drive. !0162 I have WIFI and touch pad problems, and intermittent frozen screen altogether. WIFI starts and after few minutes no such device, doesn't happen with
 any other build. synaptic touchpad shows exclamation mark in device manager, reboot - fine for a while or not???<br />

 probaly have than a activation problem.&nbsp;Or do you have a solution for this<br />

            That's exactly the point. I still with build 10162 as every update fails.have tried 10169 and 10240 crashes my machine as well. 10162 I have only because I did clean install with the iso. The update crashed as well.

            <p>Another thing, have you tried this;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot your PC and press the key to get to your BIOS.<br />
<br />
Check the BIOS for a setting called any of these and set it to ENABLED<br />
<br />
"Non-Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Data Execution Prevention"<br />
"No Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Execute Disable Function" with a sub-menu of&nbsp; 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology."<br />
or similar wording<br />
<br />
It might be call CPU protection - Set it to enabled.</p>

<p>build update works (if there is any). My CPU Protection was off</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 HUP install hangs before I can enter a product key</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing and using Office 2013 Professional Plus HUP for a month or so, I got an error with Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried&nbsp;the Quick Repair, as advised in&nbsp;Outlook,&nbsp;and Online Repair, neither of&nbsp;which cured the&nbsp;problems. I therefore uninstalled and reinstalled. I had to use the uninstall FixIt (<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809219</a></span></p>)
before reinstalling.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the install, it askes for a User Name or Product Key. If I enter my username/password it says that "It looks like you don’t have Office yet. Do you want to visit the Store to get a copy?", even though I purchased online and have the product
 key and DVD to prove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I select the Product Key option, it shows the "Hold on, this should only take a few moments" which shows for a while before showing the "We're sorry. We ran into a problem while installing and couldn't continue" + "If another program is installing, please
 wait for it to finish and then click Retry" messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see two issues here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) My account should show Office 2013 Professional Plus</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) There appears to be a bug with the Product Key link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried various methods before reinstall&nbsp;including these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - RegEdit to remove all office keys, after uninstall</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Remove the Office directory from my c:\Program Files</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - msconfig&nbsp;- Start in Clean mode with only MS applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- services.msc - Stop the Print Spooler</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Disable firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Disable anti-virus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've finally managed to get Office 2013 re-installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this page which listed many steps to do the install.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2822317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2822317</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that the Task Scheduler had active tasks for Microsoft Office. I deleted the tasks and the Office folder and then re-tried the install. This time it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be useful if the uninstall FixIt could also check and remove Office tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was about 30 hours out of my life that I will not get back&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck to others with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            Chromebook help for Microsoft word</h2>
                    <p>With my Acer Chromebook, I try to write an essay, for example, and what happens is that these back letters pop up in the ribbon, and I am unsure as to how to get them off. It gets annoying to click these off after hitting caps lock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Victoria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate your concern, since when have you been experiencing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now,&nbsp;<span>your concern related with the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">access keys,
 keyboard shortcuts to navigate the ribbon is&nbsp;</span>now under investigation and I am now working with our Internal support team to get this addressed as soon as possible. I</span><span>’ll let you know once we reach a resolution. Please standby.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, have you tried&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">changing the keyboard combination including how to turn on Caps Lock? If not yet, you can give it a try by going to your device's
<strong>Settings &gt; Keyboard Settings</strong> to change the behavior of any of the special keys. Let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have additional questions, please let us know by replying to this thread. This way, we'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as we can.</span></p>

<p>Last failed install attempt on ‎7/‎20/‎2018 - 0xc1900101</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several attempts over the course of several weeks I captured a green screen which said:</p>
<p>KCODE: Exception not handled (It may have said Interrupt, it was not there for long).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last attempt was close to 9 hours which included several reversions to Pending installs, Preparing to Install, Installing, downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not see any indication of what exception or interrupt since I guess if it was known there would be a handler for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would also be nice if there was a delay option to just wait for the next release when you get to this situation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Scan-to-email content errors - Ricoh scanner</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just recently started getting errors with scan-to-email to Office365 mailboxes for one of our customers. They have several Ricoh scanners all set up to scan to a dedicated SMTP connector in Office365. This setup has been working fine for over a year,
 and suddenly yesterday it became unreliable. Some of the emails are now being received with the attachment displayed in-line as plain text.</p>
<p>EG: the message body looks like this:</p>
<p>This is a multi-part message in MIME format.<br />
--DC_BOUND_PRE_&lt;1444815224.0026737eaefd&gt;<br />
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII<br />
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>This E-mail was sent from "RNP0026737EAEFD" (MP C2003).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scan Date: 10.14.2015 11:33:44 (+0200)<br />
Queries to: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;--DC_BOUND_PRE_&lt;1444815224.0026737eaefd&gt;<br />
Content-Type: application/pdf; name="20151014113344274.pdf"<br />
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64<br />
Content-Disposition: attachment;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;filename="20151014113344274.pdf"</p>

<p>etc - this carries on for pages...</p>

<p>The root of the error appears to be that the Content-type header is being changed from "multipart/mixed" to "plain/text". This seems to have started yesterday afternoon. It does not affect every scanned message. This seems to be similar to an earlier issue
 here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/319725?pi14985=1</p>
<p>Can anyone advise? I will be opening a support ticket too.</p>

<p>UPDATE: have just seen this thread which is currently open and describes the same issue:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/413432</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with the OneNote Mac (version 16.19) using the printer format setting via document and I didn't know that there is the break page that caused the words cut off from the printer setting preview since I called the tech support. Can you

<h2>            Calculated field</h2>
                    Hello, I am new to access and I am using access 2010.<br />
<br />
How can I create a calculated field that counts non empty fields.<br />
<br />
Say I have 4 text fields,<br />
<br />
Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4<br />
<br />
Can I have a calculated field that counts non empty fields.<br />
So if values are <br />
<br />
Field1 = aaa<br />
Field2 = bbb<br />
Field3 = ""<br />
Field4 = ccc<br />
<br />
the calculated field would be 3.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help.<br />

            <p>I don't see how that count can be useful unless maybe if your table is not properly normalized, in which case you';; have bigger problems than this question.&nbsp; Please reevaluate your table design to see if it follows the rules of Database Normalization.&nbsp;
 I'm pretty sure your question will become moot when the tables are normalized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, to try to answer the question as asked, use an expression like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a query, the calculated column could look something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NotEmptyCount:&nbsp; -(Nz(field1,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field2,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field3,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field4,"")&lt;&gt;""))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A form/report text box expression would then look like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>= -(Nz(field1,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field2,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field3,"")&lt;&gt;"")+Nz(field4,"")&lt;&gt;""))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be a slightly different expression if the fields were a number type.</p>

One of the things I need to do is average out scores.&nbsp; I should have said numbers instead of text.<br />
Not all the fields need to be filled.&nbsp; And I do not want to ave by 4 if only 3 scores are filled.<br />

This reinforces what Marshall said. Apparently you have multiple fields within the same record for scores. This is a denormalized structure. You have a horizontal&nbsp;structure&nbsp;when you should have a vertical one. Your scores should be stored in a child table like:
<div><br />
<div>tblScores</div>
<div>ScoreID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>PersonID (Foreign Key)</div>
<div>ScoreTypeID (FK)</div>
<div>Score</div>
<div><br />
<div>So this table identifies who made the score (PersonID), what the score was for (ScoreTypeID) and what the score was. You only have records where a score was actually made. So your Average can be done very easily. A Group By query that groups by person
 and score type then averages the scores.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As Marshall said, this eliminates your problem about counting the blank score fields.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>For number fields, it would be (I think I corrected my earlier mismatched parenthesis):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -((Nz(field1,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field2,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field3,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field4,0)&lt;&gt;0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To average the fields:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -(Nz(field1,0)+Nz(field2,0)+Nz(field3,0)+Nz(field4,0)) / ((Nz(field1,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field2,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field3,0)&lt;&gt;0)+(Nz(field4,0)&lt;&gt;0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be thinking that expression is unnecessarily complicated and you'd be right.&nbsp; But using a simple expression such as Avg(field) in a Totals type query requires you to have properly normalized tables instead of tables that try to imitate a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do yourself a big favor and google/bing Database Normalization and read at least one of the less theoretical ones diligently.&nbsp; Once you get a grip on the first three Normal Forms, many of your problems like the one you asked here will disappear.</p>

<h2>            Build 9926 running like a dog and unusable</h2>
                    <p>After hours of download/upgrade/pleasewait I get to log into the new build and ... it's unusable for me. It's so sluggish it's unbelievable. I thought I'd tracked it down to the Search Indexer service/processes but even when I disable that service and process,
 it's only a marginal improvement. It's too sluggish to use. After an hour, multiple restarts, windows updates, I've had enough. It's done my head in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else getting this? Any ideas?</p>

                    <p>I just downloaded the trial version of MS Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like the radial menu on the free version of one note.&nbsp; Is that radial menu not available on the purchased version or something?&nbsp; I can't seem to get it to pop up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, how can insert a pdf file to scale (so it fills the paper sheet exactly like it did before I inserted it into one note)?&nbsp; I don't need to show the page heading.&nbsp; I just need&nbsp;pdf to scale as they are construction drawings and need to remain to the&nbsp;original
 scale and show exactly as they did before I started redlining them in one&nbsp;note.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Right - the radial menu is used only by the version of OneNote for the store.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; optimized for touch and the radial menu fits well there.<br />
<br />
And you can right click the image of the PDF and select "Restore to original size" and it will cause the image to go full size.&nbsp; This works on any image, not just PDF printouts, by the way.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

                    <p>Over the last several days whenever I use IE9, the pages randomly crash and I get a message saying that Internet Explorer has stopped working and then closes the tab. Sometimes it will reload automatically, and other times the page says "Internet Explorer

<p>&nbsp; I have run McAfee scans, Microsoft Essential scans, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, run an SFC-SCANNOW command and nothing shows up.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Professional.</p>

Hi,<br />
Does it happen with any particular websites or it happens with all the websites?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To start Internet Explorer without add-ons, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Start button, and select All Programs.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Accessories, and select System Tools.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
See the section “Disable add-ons in Internet Explorer 8" in the following article for further instructions:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Is Internet Explorer slow? 5 things to try<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reset Internet Explorer and see if that fixes the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Run the “Fix it” from the following article: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset Internet Explorer settings</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Disclaimer:<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
Please note that resetting Internet Explorer settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing
 history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>:<br />
Internet Explorer stops responding, stops working, or restarts</p>

<h2>            Updating take 5 hours, While clean install takes 30 mins. You really need to find a way to reduce the time it takes to update.</h2>
                    <p>Its time to figure out how to reduce the time it takes to complete an update over doing a clean install.</p>
<p>The last 2 updates, I just had to do a clean install that took only 30 mins vs an update that took 5 hours.</p>
<p>Today on build 10049 I let the update go all the way though, Took 5 hours give or take a few..</p>
<p>Anyhow, Clean installs take 1/4 of the time it takes to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be nice too see an improved update interface and calulations a bit faster. As long as it takes to update, I have an AIO Desktop.</p>
<p>im not to fond of leaving my monitor that I cant turn off on for 5 hours burning a windows 10 image into the screen.</p>
<p>Thankfully it didnt do that.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to Microsoft: Would be nice to have an option to turn off AIO desktop screens while updating.......</p>

            <p>I personally have given up on the Windows Update method, its slow, buggy, unreliable, unstable and a waste of bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend every potential Windows 7, 8.1 user use the ISO for updating. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update was just never designed for delivering a full operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes forever to download and forever to install with a high risk for failure.

<p><strong>&nbsp;I've found the answer!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The first time I upgraded from build 10041 to 10049 it took me a LLLLOOOONNNNGGGG 10 hours.&nbsp; Since then I've read a number of posts suggesting that if you disconnect or otherwise disable your Internet connection, you can significantly reduce this time.&nbsp;
 So yesterday I deleted my Windows 10 build 10049, installed 10041 from a DVD I made from the ISO, and tried it.&nbsp; It didn't make any difference.&nbsp; So today I decided to try it again, but this time I disconnected the network cable after the download was complete
 but BEFORE it rebooted.&nbsp; VOILA!!&nbsp; From the "Preparing to Install" message until I was up and running with 10049 took all of<strong> 62 minutes</strong>.&nbsp; That's a
<strong>10:1 performance improvement</strong> just by disconnecting the network cable at the right time!&nbsp; And I was doing all this on an ordinary several years old 320 GB SATA hard drive.&nbsp; I have 6 GB RAM and an Intel 2.93 GHz E700&nbsp;dual core CPU.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;So let me just sum it up. <br />
</p>
<p>1) Start the upgrade via the usual Settings (fast track) update.<br />
</p>
<p>2) Wait for the download to get to 100% and give the message "Preparing to install"
<br />
</p>
<p>3) At this point you'll have roughly 10 minutes before the computer will reboot.&nbsp; This is the time to unplug the network cable.<br />

            Clean installs are faster because it has no data to move around. In an upgrade, your user data and apps must be moved and preserved, then moved back into place. There's just more to do in an upgrade.

<p>&nbsp;Logical, but I'm sure you know bugs aren't logical.&nbsp; I tried this both with and without disconnecting the network using the exact same Windows 10 build 10041 install&nbsp;before the first reboot and believe me it made the 10:1 difference.&nbsp; There's a serious
 bug in that install program that needs to be fixed.&nbsp; I did report this through the feedback to MS.</p>
