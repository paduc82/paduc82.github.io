<h2>            How to create a PDF from PowerPoint that have all of the fonts embedded&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, <br />
We are currently running Office 2007 and I need to save some of my PowerPoint files as PDF to be embedded into InDesign. When I save as PDF, some of the fonts are not embedded into the PDF even though the word next to it is using the same Arial Bold font. When
 I print to Acrobat, the entire PDF is an image and has no live fonts in it. Does anyone have any suggestions or have the same problem?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Steve,<br />
Thanks again for working with me on this. The obvious solution was right in front of me and I didn't even noticed it. Clicking on the ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A) embedded the fonts correctly. Tried all the other options but never even looked at that one.
 Thanks for all your help!</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; I go back to the original PDF and use Enfocus Pitstop to check those specific words that defaulted and it shows as not embedded and the words next to it with the same font exact font are embedded.</p>
<p>That doesn't really make a lot of sense.&nbsp; A font will be embedded once per PDF.&nbsp; If it's embedded for one word, it's embedded for all of them.&nbsp; That's why I asked the other questions.&nbsp; Could you pop back and answer them too please?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

    <title>IE11 Adjust Favorites File Drop Down Width - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnm522  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 Adjust Favorites File Drop Down Width</h2>
                    <p>I found how to adjust the name length in the registry (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\LinksBar -&gt; DefaultItemWidth) for a link in the Favorites Bar. But, how do I adjust the width of the drop-down menu from a file that is in the Favorites
 Bar? For example, I have a file that has multiple camera streams that have names that are about 15 characters long (i.e. 010 - MM 189.9). But, I can only see 11 characters of the camera stream name and it looks like this -&gt; "010 - MM 18...". Is there somewhere
 in the registry to adjust the length that is visible?</p>

<p>Hi JohnM522,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Managing your favorites is the best way to organize websites you visit or categorize them to your advantage depending to your daily tasks involving those websites you visit. Editing the registry isn't much advisable as this may cause more harm that good
 on your computer. Before we perform any troubleshooting, I would like to know the following for me to be able to provide you the most applicable troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue happening on all of the <strong>Title</strong> of links saved on your
<strong>Favorites</strong> folder on <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> or is it happening only on a specific folder or website?</li><li>Are your links saved on a folder or is there a sub-folder for your links?</li><li>Is the issue happening on a different user profile?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor that Microsoft asked to assist customers. I'm an experienced user of Office but do not speak for Microsoft. I've been assisting my fellow users for more than 20 years. I hope I can help you.
<br />
<br />It has been mentioned that users are having problems with version 16.9 and higher of Office. Office for the Mac has undergone dramatic changes in Office 2016/365. Developers are trying hard to make the Mac and Windows versions have the same or equivalent features. They are making real progress. However, fixing one thing sometimes breaks others.
<br />
<br />You can use the User Feedback feature to let them know if they've broken something. There may be a fix coming soon. I‚Äôd suggest checking for updates - it may take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />Here is the link about progress on Word:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/word-for-mac-2016-wont-open/828eb03c-ce40-4839-a601-cce785db2004">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I suggest using a previous version or update until it is fixed.
<br />
<br />To do that, you‚Äôll need to uninstall the current version, download the old version, and install it.
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:

<br />
<br />Here is the link to install the latest stable version:

<h2>            Excel Crashes when Sorting Data</h2>
                    I have a list of names (428) in a column and there area other 3 columns with data for each... every time i try to sort the data (descending or ascending) Excel does not perform the sort and crashes. &nbsp;I was fine for the first maybe 100 lines but once the
 list got larger, it began presenting this problem. Any insights?

            The first point to address is that your installation of Office 2011 is significantly out of date. The error report indicates that it's at 14.2.4 but 14.3.9 is the current version.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first go to Help&gt; Check for Updates in any of the Office apps in order to get the software to a current status. Once the software is updated run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions &amp; restart your Mac.<br />
<br />
If you continue to have a problem please reply with any additional details you can supply. FWIW, 428 records really is not a 'large' list &amp; should not present any problem when sorting. If the issue continues it is most likely due to something about the integrity
 of the list... merged cells, inconsistent data type, etc.<br />

<h2>            New Stock Function.  Observation.</h2>
                    <p>Tried out the new Stock function in Excel this morning.</p>
<p>(Data / Data types / Stocks )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just picked a few symbols.</p>
<p>90% were totally wrong!</p>
<p>(wrong symbol, wrong descriptions, wrong prices, etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't list every one of them, but this is the funniest.</p>
<p>I almost hit the ceiling when I saw American Airlines (AAL) at $1,600 !!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94cf4e89-e075-4748-8179-d6113339b961?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94cf4e89-e075-4748-8179-d6113339b961?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I realized, its not the real AAL.</p>
<p>Not sure where the $1648 came from.&nbsp; I did a simple market scan on prices in this area, and it didn't reveal much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a 'real' scan</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf6e28f-d83f-4b69-b936-2a47238c5358?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf6e28f-d83f-4b69-b936-2a47238c5358?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another stock with the "Description" tag says it's a US Company doing...whatever,&nbsp; but the .HeadQuarters tag gives the correct address in Athens Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty bad when my first random sample gives an error of 90%.</p>

<p>Go to bigcharts.marketwatch.com.&nbsp; Type AAL.&nbsp; You'll find that AAL can indeed be Anglo American PLC -- in the UK.&nbsp; And it did indeed close at 1646.80 today.&nbsp; I presume that bigcharts reports everything in dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The London stock exchange does not show American Airlines for AAL, presumably because it does not trade on that exchange.&nbsp; And the London stock exchange also says that Anglo American closed at 1646.80 -- GBX (pence!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm a bit confused.&nbsp; I'm not used to looking at "foreign" exchanges (from a US perspective).</p>

<br />According to this information from Microsoft, the stock quote is still in beta mode.

<p>Thanks Joeu2004.</p>
<p>I had searched all over and didn't come up with that.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>Another was showing the symbol as NGLOY. (from snip above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that on some platforms, one needs to specify the exchange.</p>
<p>I didn't see any options for specifying an exchange on the Excel platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On StockCharts.Com, (just for something different)</p>
<p>AAL.L&nbsp; does indeed show Anglo on the London exchange.</p>
<p>AAL defaults to the US exchange as Amer. Airlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>That would be pretty neat if we had a way to specify the exchange</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>Never mind.&nbsp; I guess we do.&nbsp;&nbsp; See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone figure out how to get the basic Dow Jones, or ES mini?</p>
<p>I've tried all the variations, but had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like it has potential.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; :&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Added]&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like the Dow is either DJIA, or !DJI</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Added]&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Joeu2004.&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a wild guess based on another Trading platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AAL.US&nbsp;&nbsp; is Amer Airlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Added]&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; I got a little more info to share.</p>
<p>Type in a bad symbol like AAAA</p>
<p>You will get a question mark for this data type.</p>
<p>Click the ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it brings up the Data Selector on the Right Side.</p>
<p>Typing in AAL gave a list.</p>
<p>I saw that they are using "LON" for the London exchange, (instead of UK, or something else)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, going back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AAL.LON pulls up AAL on the London exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok.&nbsp; Making progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Added]</p>
<p>Looks like you have to get the search words correct.&nbsp; Trying S&amp;P 500 brought up
</p>
<p>!SPX as the symbol for S&amp;P 500 Index.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&gt;)</p>

<p>Hi Dana,</p>
<p>The system is supposed to understand what all is contained in your selection and then try to find appropriate matches, so for example if the entire list was comprised of companies that were listed on the London Stock Exchange, it would choose those results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we know we're not perfect and still have a lot of room for improvement.&nbsp; If you could share the list of symbols that you tried to convert and the results you expected for them, it would help us in debugging and refining the algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few ways to check the results - the fastest would be to pull out the&nbsp;<strong>Exchange</strong> property from all of the data types, but you can also click on the icon contained in the cell to view all of the data for that cell. If you need to
 change any of the results, you can do so by right clicking on the cell and choosing&nbsp;<strong>Data Types &gt; Change...</strong>&nbsp; Or alternatively, you can include both the exchange abbreviation and the ticker symbol, so your
<strong>AAL </strong>example would look like&nbsp;<strong>NAS AAL</strong> (Morningstar exchange abbreviation) or&nbsp;<strong>AAL XNAS</strong> (ISO MIC code)&nbsp;and that should return the correct result.&nbsp; The order does not matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback!<br />

<h2>            How to code macro to download a zip file&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to download a zip file by using macro, I have tried to record the download process by importing external web link, of course, it cannot be imported, and request to save into my PC, then I save it, and click stop recording. Once I look into the
 macro, it cannot record any action on saving zip file into my specific directory. Does anyone have any suggestions&nbsp;on how to do it in excel? Is there another approach to download zip file through macro?</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since the new Version 7.4 I got problems with the OneDrive-App.</p>
<p>I can open shared PDFs and I am able to make annotations.</p>

</p><p><strong>BUT </strong>if I go back to my shared documents by tapping on "shared" in the upper left corner, the app is crashing and it is not possible to open the app anymore.

<h3> gpcady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unread Folder</h2>
                    <p>Switching to Office 365, the "Unread Folder" seems to be no longer offered. I can check unread email in each folder, but this is&nbsp;not what I need. I have&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;folders with 20-50 unread emails dispersed between them at any given time. I need to see
 all at once, <em>in one folder</em>, as older versions of Outlook allowed. There&nbsp;are no "Search Folder" options with 365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it back?</p>

            As I stated, the 'Filter' is of no use - it covers only one folder. 'Unread Mail' is NOT a user defined or created&nbsp;email folder, it is a Microsoft construct that displays ALL unread email across all folders, all pulled together in one location. It is a
 critical email tool.

<h2>            Japanese Fonts. Subject line turned to garbage on pst when attached to profile</h2>
                    One of our user had pc problems which caused us to move them to another pc.&nbsp; We backed up their .pst files and reattached them to their mail profile onthe new pc.&nbsp; After that all the subject lines and subfolder names turned to garbage characters.&nbsp; Did
 I forget to do something ?&nbsp; Japanese language pacjk is installed.&nbsp; Body of email is fine.

<p>Dictation in Windows 8 with Word 2013 works fine for me. Which version&nbsp; of Word are you using?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also right click the round microphone button on the Speechbar and click Options. Is Enable dictation scratchpad checked? If so, uncheck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of microphone are you using? If a headset, move the microphone element off to the corner of your mouth as breath inhales can be picked up and interpreted as commands.</p>

<p><br />
I think I see what you mean? In using Chrome, I found I could dictate in the address field and search field. However when I said to show numbers, it only showed numbers in the menu and toolbar. It did not show numbers in the searched for links. Also, I then
 tested this in Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer seems to work much better. However, I find I could not dictate into the response message fields of this forum. I'm actually dictating this into Notepad and will copy and paste by voice into the message field.</p>

I have created a rule run a script to set the expiration date. I know the script is being executed because when I put a break point in the script, it stops at the break point when I receive an email, yet the expiration date does not get changed, it is still
 zero after the script runs.
<div><br />
<div>Here is the script:</div>
<div>
<div>Sub SetExpire(Item As Outlook.MailItem)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Item.ExpiryTime = Now + 14</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems like the expiration date should get set as the break point stops right where I set it at theitem.ExpiryTime stmt. What am I doing wrong</div>

<h2>            What action will remove the &#35; on the Outlook icon on my phone&#39;s main screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a Nokia Lumia 950 and as you know, it tells you when new emails arrive by displaying a # sign in the Outlook icon on the home screen.</p>
<p>But lots of times it doesn't go away after I tap it to see the Inbox, even if I tap &amp; open each of the new emails and even if I hold the &lt;- and slide the Inbox down to close the APP.</p>
<p>But sometimes it does go away and I've never figured out how or why. What is a surefire way to make it disappear or is my phone just mad at me and misbehaving?</p>
<p>I've already told Feedback Hub about this issue.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;Jeff A. Davis</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question here on our website</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the notification on your Outlook it might be that there are some emails on the bottom part of your Outlook that is still highlighted and not yet been open, normally it would take a couple of second for the # sign notification&nbsp;to be removed after you
 read all of the emails, I suggest you check until to the bottom of your outlook for unread and highlighted messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to&nbsp;checking for unread messages, I suggest you also check if your Nokia Lumia&nbsp;950&nbsp;has the updated Software version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is the step to update Software for Nokia Lumia 950:</strong></p>
<p>1. Connect your phone to a <strong>WIFI</strong></p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>3. Go to <strong>System</strong></p>
<p>4. Go to <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Phone update</strong></p>
<p>6. <strong>Check for updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if it did help you resolve your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anthony</p>

            <p>Working with the Date/Time Picker is tricky, since it is not an Excel (or Office) control. It may not be available on all PCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could use the calendar from <a href="http://www.vbaexpress.com/kb/getarticle.php?kb_id=543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vbaexpress.com/kb/getarticle.php?kb_id=543</a>&nbsp;instead. (The download link is near the bottom of the page.)<br />
This is a calendar created entirely from "native" userform controls, so it should work in all versions of Excel.</p>

            I can't reproduce the problem, and you posted your code in a picture as opposed to text, so I can't copy it to test. Could you possibly upload your test file to the cloud somewhere so we can download it? I work with tables quite a lot (even
<a href="http://exceltables.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wrote a book</a> on it), so I'm genuinely interested in finding the problem.&nbsp;

<p>Zack, I will upload the file as you suggest, when I'm back at my PC. &nbsp;In the meantime, since I'm a newcomer to Excel tables and I haven't touched VBA since I retired over fifteen years ago, it seemed sensible to buy your book, so I just did.</p>

</p><p>Here is the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AkH-gORCnL-QgchYTYgIPSkUC3mSWA</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran this program this morning and it succeeded.&nbsp; I then ran it again, after setting a break-point at the Listrows.Add line in New_Item2().&nbsp; It failed at that line ("Add method of ListRows failed") and then Excel closed down.&nbsp; I had changed nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards I did make changes, by the way, but these were only the addition of a few comment lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be down to some stupid mistake I've made, because I wrote another short application doing the same sort of thing and it works every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">There are a few items to note here. &nbsp;There is a logic change in how you check if a value exists in a range. Instead of looking at it as 'is unique', the above looks at the revers of 'is existing'. It's also more flexible in that
 the range to look in is not a parameter, making it usable in other applications (in this case, within the userform, but it could just as well be put in a standard module and be used elsewhere in the project).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I saw you were wanting to apply a sort to your table after adding a value. Since tables retain their sort [fields], there isn't any reason to keep adding a new sort field, just apply the sort which is there. This is how the last
 two [optional] parameters came about. Really we just need to know if you want to sort your data, and if so, do you want to use the existing sort field(s)/order(s).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The 'AddTableItem' above is represented as a function as opposed to a sub. I did this in order to return a result. This way you can interpret the results of the called method. Right now it's just printing to the Immediate window,
 but it illustrates returning a value from a more complex method call. You can manipulate it however you see fit inside the called function.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The last thing I want to mention is that you do not see any Select or Activate calls in my code. They're not needed. Now, if you want to activate or select something for the user to see, that is one thing, but it certainly isn't
 needed for the code to run. In fact, doing so will slow down your code execution tremendously. As such, it's generally recommended you don't use these actions.</p>

<p><span>Many thanks for the work you‚Äôve put into this, Zack.</span></p>
<p><span>I have keyed in your code and tested it briefly ‚Äì there were no problems.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I will be spending some time getting my head round the detail.</span></p>
<p><span>I now think the reason you couldn‚Äôt get my clumsy code to fail is because the apparent error in it arises from outside the code.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Since sending you the link I have written another, similar, Excel application incorporating the common routines from this one.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I merrily used it for a couple of days until yesterday, when it failed on that Add method.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Now when a program is run twenty or thirty times without problems and then fails without any changes being made to the code, I would assume either the problem is with the data or with an ‚Äúexternal‚Äù area: Excel itself
 (as installed on my PC), Windows or the PC.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Since it subsequently ran a few times without crashing, I assume it‚Äôs not the data that‚Äôs the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>The original problem was, therefore, a red herring, but I‚Äôve learned a great deal from you through this.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>On the matter of the Activate and Select methods, I used these after following code that I found in on line forums.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I stopped using Select on your advice, but I found that, without Activate, one routine had written to the wrong Sheet.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, I can see now that it‚Äôs not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>This all started when I was asked to take over the bookkeeping for a local social club.&nbsp; The previous treasurer had used a paper-based system which I found unwieldy,&nbsp;so I created an Excel application
 which</span><span> worked very successfully, especially after I bought Mike Smart‚Äôs
</span><em><span>Excel 2016 Expert Skills </span>
</em><span>and extended my&nbsp;knowledge of formulas</span><em><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></em><span>I wanted, however, to make it easier for a future, non-technical,&nbsp;bookkeeper&nbsp;to use.&nbsp; This club has two other members, out of about ninety, who use PCs&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî for sending email, and even then one of them seems to feel
 a PC might steal his soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both use a Dark Ages version of Office.&nbsp;This is England.</span></p>
<p><span>I also wanted to protect the data from errors, by introducing VBA and User Forms to validate and control input.
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Little did I realise how much Visual Basic had moved on and how much I had forgotten in the last seventeen years.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>As my code shows‚Ä¶.</span></p>
<p><span>I had Bill Jelen‚Äôs </span>
<em><span>Excel 2016 VBA and Macros,</span></em><span> which got me started with VBA and recommends your book.&nbsp; Mike Smart‚Äôs book pushed me towards a better appreciation of Excel Tables, and, as you know, I
 eventually got around to buying your book. </span></p>
<p><span>My bookkeeping project will take a while to complete, but I‚Äôm having great fun with VBA in the meantime.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If only there were more hours in the day‚Ä¶.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again, Zack.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I‚Äôll let you know how I get on.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers</span></p>

<p>I understand that story very well, it's all too familiar to myself. I started tinkering with Excel because I thought it was cool, then a little here, a little there, pretty soon I'm using it for everything. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember reading Bill's book on macros some years ago (2007 I think?), and I really enjoyed it. It's hard to find good sources for learning VBA (which, consequentially I'm hoping to develop some courses on). Doing what you're doing, learning through application,
 is one of the best methods. While learning through forums/blogs can be slow - everyone claims to be an expert, you'll start seeing the same people around, or pointing to the same resources. It's a small world. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you said caught my attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Now when a program is run twenty or thirty times without problems and then fails without any changes being made to the code"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Does this mean you're using the ListRows.Add method multiple times, as in an iteration, loop, or other recursion? If this is the case, it might give cause for concern. While I don't know
 definitively, I'm fairly certain there's a memory leak in Excel with this method. Loop a hundred times, adding a listrow on each iteration, it will get slower, and slower, and slower, until you want to punch your computer. This is why it's better to do it
 all at once, which is the reason I came up with the <em>InsertRows </em>routine I posted above.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If there is anything else I can do, please let me know, I'm happy to help. I love Excel and I love Tables.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Dominic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that you set the experience on advance setting, but it didn‚Äôt work.</p>
<p>If so, I suggest you try InPrivate Window to check if the issue still exists, as we need to confirm if this is related to cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. How did you change the advance settings, from Classic Experience to New experience?</p>
<p>2. Check if all libraries have the issue.</p>
<p>3. Check if you have set Default experience to new experience in SharePoint admin center. (Sign into Office 365 Portal&gt;select Admin&gt;click Admin Centers&gt;select SharePoint&gt;click settings&gt;confirm the option ‚ÄúSharePoint Lists and Libraries experience‚Äù)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

<p>That is not what I described...</p>
<p>What I say is that if I go to List Settings/ Advanced settings, There is no <span>
experience preference section at all.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point I would like to switch a particular list to new experience because I want to use Flow but I cannot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The option is there on some other lists in the same web but not on a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't want to change anything at the tenant level I want it on specific a list. Whichever setting I have at the tenant level should enable me to impact a specific list no matter what... It does for other lists!</span></p>

<p>Still have the issue yes.</p>
<p>1. No not a group site, group site didn't exist at the time of its creation, most likely blank.</p>
<p>2. The list has been there for years. Don't remember every steps.</p>
<p>3. This list is stocked in classic mode.</p>
<p>4. Was a custom list created years ago other custom lists created at the same time&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't have the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, it's possible that your Skype number settings is configured to allow calls from your contacts only. This means that all calls from non-contacts will not go through, to check this, please check your Skype number's privacy settings. You
 can refer to this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10615/why-am-i-not-receiving-calls-to-my-skype-number?q=cannot+receive+calls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you for Trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of Skype version 8.11.0.4 is tagged as the latest and as I follow the instructions for a MAC there is no such menu item. On my iPhone, which is where I want to use Skype - in settings there is also no option for "privacy".</p>
<p>The closest is "Application Settings" -&gt; "Manage how people find you", but only entries are for a mobile number and eMail address. Same on my Mac and my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other entries in the "community" suggest that the new version cannot be logged in more than one device and I've tried that as well - no connection. &nbsp;I'm in the UK and wanted to be able to receive phone calls from my friends and colleagiues in USA, so far
 only works with Apple's Facetime for people who have iPhones, but even though people who have Skype accounts can connect, but nobody can be understood because of bad quality connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No calls show as missed even though I've asked friends to test the Skype number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My siter cannot be heard over Skype calling another party, since the new software version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft apparently does not care about customers, since there is no tech support that can be found.</p>
