<h2>            USB disconnect&#47;reconnect issue with Windows 7, regular solutions not working</h2>
                    Cannot find infcache.1 in Windows 7 x64, USB keyboard and mouse constantly disconnecting while in use, sometimes shutting off completely. Already turned off the power saving mechanism, and uinstalled/reinstalled drivers multiple times. Found stories online
 about fixing it when deleting infcache.1, but cannot find it anywhere on computer even after giving ability to search hidden files. Help!

            Did you ever find a resolution?&nbsp; I am having the same problems.&nbsp; USB devices disconnect, or, when turned on, give a message that "A USB device on this system has malfunctioned".&nbsp; I'm trying to find the infcache.1 file which should be in
<p>C:\windows\system32\driverstore\, and it just is not there.&nbsp; I have checked to show all hidden and system files, I've rebooted multiple times,&nbsp;and it's just not there.&nbsp; I was under the impression that windows would automatically
 regenerate it after deleting it, but I can't even find it to delete it.</p>

<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>

<p>3. Did you try the steps provided in the previous post to fix the issue?</p>

<p>No, I have not yet uninstalled and reinstalled the USB hubs themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the setupapi.api.log file, I see messages about corrupt or missing INFCACHE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I have, very specifically, is should there always be an INFCACHE.1 file in windows 7?&nbsp; Mine is missing.&nbsp; If there should always be this file, ***how do I force windows 7 to recreate the infcache.1 file?***</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>That's referring to the hard drive encryption feature, which Microsoft has trade-marked under the name "BitLocker".&nbsp; However, Windows RT devices do not have the required "TPM" chip inside them to enable this type of encryption.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows RT does still include encryption for your hard drive, and it is enabled automatically if you sign-in using your Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>NO version of Windows has <strong>EVER</strong> come with Office included unless you paid extra for it. If you want Office you will have to pay for it in addition to the cost of the OS.</p>
<p>There ARE reports of people managing to install Windows Mail on Windows 7. How reliable it is I don't know. If you want to do that then google for how to do it.</p>
<p>All your data will stay intact as long as you back it all up first before attempting any change to the OS.</p>

<h3> gustavo ignacio g&#243;mez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems while contacting customer service &#40;press 1 for options etc&#41;</h2>
                    I tried calling an airline to get customer support. When they prompt "press 1 for english 2 for spanish" i keep pressing the number 1 but the customer support automated system doesnt "hear" or recognize the prompt. This happens with every single automated
 customer service number I ring. Skype is useless for calling customer service for me and I must dial from my phone directly. Is there a way to fix this?? Thanks in advance.

            It might looks little complicated at a first glance, but... when I saw that feature in action long time ago I was really impressed. It looks like something appears on the presentation screen from "nowhere".<br />
<br />
Here you can see how the extended feature works: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGmH9zGfKE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Youtube: Windows 7 and 2 monitors</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/fGmH9zGfKE4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/fGmH9zGfKE4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> <br />
<br />
But if you really want to do that in different way, you may try to change the resolution of the presentation:

    <title>new asus win 10 login issues plus factory reset stuck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellycurry  say:</h3>
<h2>            new asus win 10 login issues plus factory reset stuck</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Windows 10 Asus Convertible Notebook TP200S with my student aid for school (lets face it, who doesn't have distracting programs on their personal laptops!). I went to set it up, and ran into several issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I could not log into my Microsoft Account at all. It would not even give me the login screen when I went into settings to attach my account (it did not give me the option while setting the computer up either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I could not enter the windows store at all, instead turning up an error message (cannot recall what it was however but I saw where some said it was a connection problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I factory reset it in case windows had not loaded into the computer properly because I could not access anything related to my account on the computer without entering the windows website like I am now on my regular computer. Factory Reset is stuck at
 40 percent and has been for over an hour. The HDD is a solid state 64 gig drive so should not be taking anywhere near this long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the computer was having issues right off the bat, I did not back up the Operating System like I did with the computer I am using. The OS was clearly corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no optical drive. I do not have a USB Flash Drive large enough to have backed it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to fix the computer, or do I have to take time out of my schedule to return to the school bookstore to exchange the computer tomorrow. I bought the computer today.</p>

            <p>I was unable to reach Asus support, however, I was able to fix it on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the reset was frozen, I did a hard shut down, restarted (I don't recommend doing this), let it reenter the factory reset mode, and it resumed to where it was, and within two minutes was on 45 percent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The factory reset corrected the login problems that were preventing me from entering my account and the microsoft store/microsoft programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm trying to fix the wake lag on this one which its had since the November Update... (i've started another thread for it).</p>

 that it has been phased out, and I was forced to upgrade to the v.8, I will start phasing out your app by switching to other, more adequate apps with my contacts. Do you want to know at least a&nbsp;few points why?? OK, here's a couple of examples. Why can I no
 longer sign out of Skype and get it prompt for a password while remembering my login name?? What minds do your designers have to eliminate this basic, foundational feature. Now I have to either sign out completely and make Skype forget all my login info including
 the name, or let it log on automatically. On a work PC. Really??? Also, where is my compact view? It has been there for years. Now I have to deal with a monstrous window taking 2/3 of my monitor real estate. Why, Microsoft??</span>

            <p>Hi malen,<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
1)&nbsp;Have you made any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2)&nbsp;When exactly do you receive the error message?</p>
<p>3) What troubleshooting steps&nbsp; have you tried yet?</p>
<p>Method 1: Could you check if the same issue occurs in safe mode.<br />
Please follow the below link on how to boot the Computer in safe mode.<br />

<p>Method 2: Perform clean boot to check whether it is a software conflict issue.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

<h2>            Is It Possible to Enter Numeric ASCII Character Codes With Microsoft&#39;s Arc Keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    Since the Arc Keyboard does not have the numeric keyboard on the right-hand side and therefore no number lock key, I am looking for a work around way to enter characters when a Drag-n-Drop situation is not available.

            It isn't possible to use the ASCII codes if the keyboard doesn't have a number pad.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are trying to find a way to do what you were asking about in your previous post: use a check mark from the wingdings font and paste that into a document or some other place.
<br />
<br />
What Wunders said in your previous thread pretty much sums it up:<br />
<br />
Programs that support rich text such as Wordpad or Office Word will work fine.<br />
<br />
As you have noticed, Notepad does not support rich text, it uses a single font and so you would not be able to do what you are wanting.<br />
<br />
The other example you gave were these forums. When you post here, the font formatting is removed just like in notepad.<br />
<br />
If you are determined to use special characters in a plain text formatting, the best I can suggest is to find a symbol that closely matches what you want by using the character map and a standard font like Arial.<br />
<br />
As an example, for a check mark, using the square root symbol may suffice:&nbsp; ‚àö<br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<ul>
<li>Which Windows version are you using? </li><li>How long have you been facing this issue? </li><li>What were the changes made before the issue? </li><li>What is the complete error message you receive?</li></ul>
<p>I would recommend you to perform clean boot and try installing it in clean boot state.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Configuring your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />

<p>I've been looking for an answer and since I've encountered the same virus&nbsp;variants sirefef.(x), after removing virus I remembered the place it has effected.
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_MSIL</p>
<p>As a solution,&nbsp; I've think that if a system component is damaged I shuould repair it first.</p>
<p>Actually, I've made a full upgrade to Windows 7 (same build) with OS DVD. </p>
<p>I have to mention about&nbsp;extraordinary capability of Windows 7 about upgrading.</p>
<p>After all&nbsp;upgrading process that took about 2 hours&nbsp;"Windows 7 Setup" found out that .NET framework 4.0 is damaged and repaired. And I could start ICS again.</p>
<p>Without all that hassle If you could try to reinstall .Net Framework 4.0, I think this dependency problem will disappear.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Gold replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kizza023  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gold replacement</h2>
                    <p>To whom it may concern,</p><p><br /></p><p>I purchased&nbsp;an Xbox one S over a year ago. Just before it had a battery problem, I purchased 3 months of Xbox gold. I was sent a "new" console as a replacement, but it had a similar issue as soon as I turn it on. I have been waiting for yet another replacement and I consider it an inconvenience as I have been without an Xbox for most of the school holidays. This means I have purchased a 3 month Xbox gold membership that I have nearly been able to use, and kindly request a new code to cover this issue as it is not my fault.</p><p><br /></p><p>(Purchased from ****, Shellharbour)</p><p><br /></p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kieran Ryan.</p>
