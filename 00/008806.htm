<h2>            Allen &#38; Heath ZEDI8 with Skype</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>I just bought an Allen &amp; Heath ZEDI 8 and I cannot for the life of me get it to work with Skype. AH told me it does not work for Google Hangouts but does work for Skype. I've changed my sound settings in Skype to read Speakers-ZEDI8 Microphone-ZEDI8. I can
 see the level of my mic in the test screen but once I make a call it says NO MIC CONNECTED. Why? What did I do wrong? BTW I have no issues with any other recording program. Please send your guidance. Its killing my PODCAST and I do that on my own :)</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Business - Sharing External works for all except 1 user</h2>
                    <p>I have a site that is setup to share files externally for Anonymous.&nbsp; I have roughly 90 people using the site and sharing files via OneDrive from both PC/Mac and iPhone/Android.&nbsp; 89 of the 90 can share links without any issues.&nbsp; I have 1 problem child.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1 user that cannot share files from their iPhone. When you have the file displayed on your phone that you want to share from OneDrive:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. User taps the 3 stacked dots which brings up a menu on the lower portion of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. User taps Share</p>
<p>3. Screen comes up where you enter the recipient and message.</p>
<p>4. Just above where you enter the recipient, you can select:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Anyone with the link</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. People in companyname with link</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; c. People with existing access</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; d. Specific People</p>
<p>For the 1 user who cannot send links, a &amp; b above are greyed out on their iPhone.&nbsp; The only options this user can choose from is c &amp; d.</p>
<p>With c selected he enters a Gmail address to share the link with and gets the message "Your organization's policies don't allow you to share with these users. Please contact your IT department for help."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the group used for access to the site and this user is in the group just like the other 89 people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where to look for the solution.&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>You were correct.&nbsp; I checked the folders/files and the group was assigned contributor access even though the group had the rights I listed above for the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many users had tried sharing links with themselves and have limited access.&nbsp; I cannot remove this from them.&nbsp; The group that all of the users in also has limited access as well as editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into each folder and removed unique rights which set the group back to editor everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to have the users do some testing before I declare this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Alec,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern, but unfortunately there is no option to change the e-mail address in Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as a workaround, you can create another Outlook.com e-mail address, add them as an alias and then make it as a primary e-mail address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information on managing alias, refer the link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/add-alias-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Please reply for further help or clarifications. We will be glad to help you.</p>

<h2>            Music player not finding new music</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know this has been posted like a hundred times or more and I've followed all the threads around this but if anyone has a new suggestion that would be REALLY apreciated .</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have a C-5 with latest firmware. Has around 365 songs in it now but when i add new ones it doesn't see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have tried refresh, trashed the databases etc. Reformated the card and loaded them back bit by bit and that worked and then added 9 new ones - that worked. Played it this morning for a few hours and tried to ad some more. Doesn't see them in the refresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Card is a Sandisk 4gb - should be good - no bad sectors etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any ideas? I like the interface of the Nokia player the most - Core although it sees everything has a rubbish interface as do the rest - any ideas anyone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Maya,<br />
<br />
I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I've used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many tables or very long tables can slow down a document. Nesting of tables adds complexity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Equation Editor 3.0 equations can be difficult to Edit unless you install MathType (the trial version is enough).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proofing language can also be a problem but the steps you've taken should help with that. I would recommend a character style set for "Do not check spelling or grammar" to use for anything that is correctly spelled but shows as a spelling error in English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to do the following</p>
<p>Create a new document.</p>
<p>Open your original document and go to the end. </p>
<p>Press the Enter key to add a blank paragraph at the end.</p>
<p>Copy everything except that new empty paragraph and paste into the new document.</p>
<p>Save the new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reporting back with the release number of your Word for Mac would help others who do have Macs give some advice. Generally make sure that your OS and Word versions are updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope these ideas help. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.</p>

            Hi GCHJO,<br />
<br />
I often do this by making&nbsp;text hidden:<br />
<br />
1. Select the text<br />
<br />
2. Right click and choose <strong>Font...</strong> from the pop-up menu<br />
<br />

<h3> kenaltfather  say:</h3>
<h2>            DoCmd.SendObject causing Access 2010 to Crash</h2>
                    <p>We have an Access Database with which we are trying to send report attachments via Outlook and the DoCmd.SendObject statement. Every time and on every computer we have, execution of the statement causes Access to become unresponsive. Here's some test code
 that fails every time.</p>
<p>
MsgBox "Entered Procedure"<br />
DoCmd.OpenReport "Report1", acViewPreview<br />
DoCmd.SendObject acSendReport, "Report1", acFormatPDF, "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", "", "", "Test of SendObject cmd"<br />
MsgBox "Returned from Outlook"
</p><p>
</p><p>Outlook does it's function and sends the attachment. However Access never gets control back to display the message box "Returned from Outlook".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck?? Somebody, please help.</p>

            Tom, thanks for the help. I went through your recommendations and still no help on the first computer. Then recreated the code on a second computer and it worked fine. I guess I'll have to uninstall and reinstall Office on the first computer. Thanks again

            <p>I have the same issue, but I have found that the problem is only present if the user have Outlook 2016.&nbsp; For me it works&nbsp;if the computer has Outlook 2010, but not Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to have Access 2016, the Outlook 2016 will hand back control to Access 2016.&nbsp; The trap with this is that many users with Outlook 2016 got it trough Office365.&nbsp; Unless they bought it with Access 2016, you are out of luck, since they don't allow
 Access 2016 runtime to be installed on the same computer/user that has Office365.&nbsp; Not a very friendly move by Microsoft, towards independent software developers and the likes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason the chaps from Microsoft don't seem to want to deal with this issue.&nbsp; I have mentioned it in a few different venues, but I either get no response, or told that others will handle it.&nbsp; As late as yesterday I posted it as a separate question
 here on this community, but so far there is no takers from within Microsoft or any of the MVP's.&nbsp; Do they know something&nbsp;we don't?</p>

            Mor10. I installed Access 2016 to run with my Outlook 2016 and it seems to work fine. So, I think your assessment of the problem is correct.

            Office Automation requires, by&nbsp;license,&nbsp;the user to have Outlook installed. Not everyone does, so SendObject is used to ensure&nbsp;that one's solution&nbsp;works for everyone.

<h2>            Restore a backup without hard reset</h2>
                    <p>I had an 822 which had a hardware issue and was replaced.&nbsp; I believe automatic backup was set up.&nbsp; When I set up the phone again I was not prompted to restore.&nbsp; I have a couple questions regarding this scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a way to tell if there is a backup associated with a particular device?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If there is a backup is there a way around a hard reset to get that data back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jud_III,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to tell, if there is a back up on the Phone or on the live id.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have activated by logging in with your Microsoft Account then the phone&nbsp; is backed up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When there is a change to the settings or Phone or when there is an update, there is a backup done.( if activated )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you don't get the option, on the initial start up and setup to restore, then there is no back up.</p>
<p>The only way to restore a backup is at the initial setup or after a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to windowsphone.com that may help you.</p>

<h2>            Access 2016 Search Button</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a resource guide in Access 2016.&nbsp; The purpose of this is for an individual who is in need of resources may go into this database and find what they are looking for by clicking on a drop down which has all counties and then they click on a

 How do I connect the search button that is on the form to only bring up food banks in this one County?&nbsp; Any help on this would be appreciated, thank you!</p>

    <title>Publisher 2016 displays differently from Publisher 2003 on the same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mighty casey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2016 displays differently from Publisher 2003 on the same Windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>I have read the threads about Publisher 2013 and 2016 printing differently than previous versions of Publisher and on different versions of Windows.&nbsp; But they don't address my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that Publisher 2003 and Publisher 2016 don't display the same way on the screen for the same file on the same Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; And naturally, because they look different on the screen, they print differently on the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference is the version of Publisher.&nbsp; So, this is not a Windows 10 vs Windows 7 issue!&nbsp; And it is not a printer driver issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both Publisher 2003 and Publisher 2016 installed on my Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; I do not have any other versions (such as 2007, 2010, or 2013) available to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot from Publisher 2003</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43a8affd-3d88-4b00-97c0-ec6127b54b7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43a8affd-3d88-4b00-97c0-ec6127b54b7a" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a closeup of the part in question.&nbsp; This is what the document is supposed to look like:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdc1b779-6e38-4819-81b5-a72b78d5bdb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdc1b779-6e38-4819-81b5-a72b78d5bdb3" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the screenshot from Publisher 2016:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f800ee3-7a2d-42c0-bad7-593775a87ac6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f800ee3-7a2d-42c0-bad7-593775a87ac6" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the closeup of the same part of the document.&nbsp; Note the corruption in the spacing at the top and in the horizontal lines lower down.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6aa0d6f3-aeab-4228-91f6-333736e67b8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6aa0d6f3-aeab-4228-91f6-333736e67b8b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem was just this one file, and if I was the only person involved, I could fix the document and move on.&nbsp; But this problem has happened on several files and there are other people involved, and we all have different versions of Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first post to this community forum, and I'm not sure if it should be a question or a discussion.&nbsp; Basically, I think I'm reporting a bug in Publisher 2016.&nbsp; Is there a better way to report such deficiencies?</p>

            <p>If you install Pub 2007 or 2003 in Win10, Win8, Win7, WinVista or WinXP then the files still render text the same and are cross OS compatible. The text rendering issue because of a different font is limited to Pub 2010 and newer.<br />

            IMPO, no Internet connection is definitely fine for Nokia Maps as the software uses offline map data to guide your drive.<br />
<br />
BUT, the phone must be under your mobile provider's coverage as it needs A-GPS to help lock the position. Othewise, it would take ages to lock or might be not working at all.

<p>So if it were my device I would hard reset then set it up again with the same Live ID BUT I would not reinstall any apps until you perform the update then add back the apps you want or need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me there is an advantage to doing that every once in a while. It cleans the device, gets rid of just you no longer want or use (we all tend to keep stuff we don't need) and the device will run smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>assume </strong>you currently have <strong>Windows 10 </strong>on your device and when I check my 950XL, it shows I can uninstall the calendar and mail. So I assume you can on yours and it should give you ample space but truthfully IMHO you are
 better off with a fresh start so I would hard reset if it were mine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW, I usually hard reset once a year just to do a refresh and I DO NOT reinstall from a back up. That way I get a fresh start and put back just want I want and need.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts...</p>

            Hi Jack, thanks for the speedy reply to my question !<br />
<p>
</p><p>Its a Lumia 640 I have running windows 10, I was hoping that a hard reset would be my very last option, not my 1st.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive looked in the app list, Mail and Calendar can only be pinned to start, no oprion to uninstall .....when i go to storage and look at whats on the internal storage it says i only have 440mb left. I moved or uninstalled everything i can including Word,
 Excel and Powerpoint with no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Apps and Games the only items that are left belong to Microsoft Corporation and cant be moved to SD or uninstalled so its not like i have anything on there that i could do without (well not according to microsoft anyway) and the folder (Mail and Calendar
 1.60GB) also cant be moved or removed.....ive even set the emails to only sync with the bare minimum and its made on difference to size of folder.</p>
<p>

            I'm not sure why you cannot uninstall it may well be something included in that update. Again, if it were me, I would hard reset and start fresh. I wish I had more to offer but as long as you have pictures saved to onedrive (are you using the auto upload
 to onedrive option?) and use the same Live ID so you get all your calendar and contacts, the rest is easy to do.

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give it a day or two incase someone comes up with another option but I fear it will be the hard reset which i find a rather strange way to resolve what looks like it should have a simple fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue the other day with getting updates for apps like Powerpoint, Word and Excel, plus one or two others,&nbsp; couldnt figure out why they wouldnt update and nobody could give me any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end i figured it out and it was due to the fact I had moved them to the SD card, moved them back to internal storage, they updated fine and then I put them back on the SD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasnt an issue before so who knows why the last updates wouldnt work.</p>

<p>I can certainly appreciate the frustration but life goes on and if you want it to work you have to deal with it. Not seeing your device make it difficult to determine the why but my best guess is with all the updates it is something stored in other like
 temporary files that should have been deleted after previous updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hard rest will wipe all that crap off your device and possibly the update you are going to get will cute some of that issue. As an aside, I have never had an issue (I guess I've been fortunate) but I would say that IMHO a hard reset will fix your issue.
 I would wipe the SD card of all programs so you truly get a fresh star otherwise you will get some issues.</p>

<p>With no other options available i went with the hard reset which managed to reduce the size of the mail and calendar to 136mb from its previous size of 1.6gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a rather drawn out process for something that should have had a simple solution and although I had everything backed up I still had to go through all my settings and make changes.</p>

            I'm assuming that even though it was a "drawn out process" that all is well now and you can get the&nbsp;OS update and that all is well now. I hope I was able to help out in some small way. Good luck!

<p>Hi Jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the hard reset allowed the OS update to download and install, Mail and Calendar now stands at 133mb instead of the previous 1.6gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just dont get why something so simple as making some space to install an update should need to factory reset the phone in order to sort one rogue app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to help and hopefully sometime in the near future Windows 10 mobile will run smoothly and no more need for for hard resets</p>

<p>I'm really happy to hear that. It is too bad there was not an easier way but I have found that although temp files are supposed to disappear after an install sometimes it just doesn't and over time it adds up. Who knows, someday they just might fix that
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that you now have a fresh device and I assume you will only add back what you really need and the stuff you no longer be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my post above helped solve your issue I would appreciate you making it as the answer. Good luck and thanks for getting back!</p>

    <title>Zoom only the text and not the images&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterpanino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zoom only the text and not the images&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In several Word 2010 documents I use the Calibri text-font with size = 10 as the default body font which fits my needs for printouts of these documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as I use a 2560 x 1600 screen resolution on a 30" monitor, this text is too small for
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">comfortable</span> reading on the screen, so I use a 120% - 140% zoom in these Word documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when using this zoom factor, images inside the text always appear somewhat blurred, as they are zoomed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: Is there a setting in Word 2010 which zoomes only the text and not the images? (When using the Weblayout display mode).</p>

            <p>What on earth are you talking about?&nbsp; There is nothing cynic or ironic about either answer.&nbsp; The answer to your original question is, "no."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your first follow up&nbsp;question is that this forum does not accept replies that are less than six characters in length.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the simply answer (no) is only two characters long, I couldn't simply answer&nbsp;"no."&nbsp; I answered "No, no." which does&nbsp;meets
 the length requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely you understand&nbsp;what no means so I'm assuming&nbsp;that Ms. Barnhill attempted to clear up&nbsp;any confusion&nbsp;that my &nbsp;"Repeated myself because just no isn't good enough in this forum."&nbsp;had caused.</p>
<p>There is certainly no irony in her reply.&nbsp; She simply stated a fact.&nbsp; Regardless of the simplicity of the question, you can't answer&nbsp;questions in this forum with the simple answers&nbsp;"Yes" "No" or "Maybe" because they don't meet the minimum&nbsp;length requirement.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, the normal behavior would be to at least elaborate a little bit about the "no". In the Western social behavior norm a simple "no" is almost always understood as an "unfriendly tone". This is not me imagining something, it's an objective fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I am not used to get a simple "no" as an answer. Why not discussing about it?</p>

            <p>First you&nbsp;ask why a simple "no" as an&nbsp;&nbsp;answer is not good enough, and now you complain that you perceive&nbsp;it in a unfriendly tone.</p>

<p>back to my iphone google search, local, shows the salon information, map, and telephone number, click to call, make my appointment.</p>
<p>seriously, if bing want to compete with google, make yourself better first!&nbsp;</p>
<p>why windows trying to compete his own weakest with googles strongest?! it just make himself looks silly and ridiculous!</p>

<strong>3 user pack of MS Office 2010</strong> from an online store in India in 2011. At that time i had windows 7 on my PC that was genuine too!! That time three of us have registered it on our individual PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">All was working fine. Thereafter i upgraded my system to windows 8 and the to windows 10!!! And the bad part started.... one fine day my PC refused to boot up and then i handed it over to genuine service center of Lenovo for repair
 they recommended me to replace my hard drive as it was corrupted with some bad sector!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I gave them one new 1 TB hard drive the reverted my system to windows 7 and gave me PC back...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But now i wanted to Install MS office 2010 on my windows 7 genuine PC (on same earlier office 10 was installed and activated) i am facing following problems:-</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. &nbsp; I'm not getting link for downloading Office 10</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. &nbsp; So i contacted MS over online chatting helpdesk and provided them with my original Office 10 key and to my surprise they told me that the key is blocked after 3 uses... I asked them that i was the 1st user of the same on my
 same machine sl. no. , i requested them to cross check the details of users , but they could not and told me that i can not use it again and advised me to purchase office 2016...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Now pls help me that how if somebody's PC with genuine soft wares from Microsoft crashes and if we install a new hard drive , the user with genuine details of purchase is denied of his genuine rights!!!!!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even if i purchase office 2016 and if again my pc crashes the what is the gurantee that MS is going to help me!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            Start button no longer functions after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>My start button fails to do anything when left clicked and cortanna text field is unresponsive after the update on Feb 18th. &nbsp;Right click on the tack bar or start button function as intended. &nbsp;Task bard functions as intended. Just the start button is dead.
 Restarting the explorer task, or the machine fails to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what its worth I did restore to a system restore point i made this morning, after virtual box caused Windows 10 to hang at a black screen with a mouse cursor after installing it. &nbsp;But the start menu failed to function before this.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The solution to this is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall all the updates you unnstalled or system restored out of. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then open a Admin command prompt by right clicking on the start menu and choosing admin command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type "powershell" with out quotes to get to the admin PS promopt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paste this with out quotes "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}"
 and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After a few&nbsp;seconds&nbsp;it will finish. wait about 10 more seconds for the shel.experience app to restart properly. and your done&nbsp;everything is happy.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>Drop down no longer shows indented sub-folder when moving emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lennyk27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop down no longer shows indented sub-folder when moving emails</h2>
                    I have outlook.live.com and ever since beta became permanent a few days ago:&nbsp; When moving emails, the drop down no longer differentiates sub-folders by indentation. The main folders are alphabetized but sub-folders&nbsp;show directly beneath (also "sub" alphabetized).
 but not indented to the right. It is now unbelievably difficult to quickly find the sub-folder to which you are trying to move a message. Is there a setting to fix this?, or will I finally have to move everything to GMail after dealing with so many customer
 "unfriendly" improvements during my 20 yrs as a hotmail/msn/outlook loyal customer. Can anyone help or is this the default that has no option? Thanks to anyone out there!

<p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the left, master folder is "Email Corresp-Misc" and all sub-folders are indented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When choosing an email to be filed in a sub-folder, all sub-folders are not indented nor is the master folder in bold as it was in the old Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pattern exists for all master folders and their subsequent sub-folders and it becomes very difficult to follow the flow and select the correct sub-folder, even though master folders are alphabetized and sub-folders are alphabetized but without indentation
 it is very difficult to locate correct destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope my explanation is not confusing.&nbsp;</p>
