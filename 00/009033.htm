    <title>Internal Server Error on FIleHandler - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal Server Error on FIleHandler</h2>
                    <p>When opening any document library we experience an 500 Internal Server error on a call to GetByType('FileHandler'). We assumed this was due to our development of a custom type handler.<br />
<br />
However, this problem is reproducible on all SharePoint online instances &nbsp;we have access to, not just our development instance. We have asked on external person to verify this as well and he was able to reproduce as well.<br />
<br />
The _api/apps/GetByType('FileHandler') call results in the following error message:<br />
{"odata.error":{"code":"-1, Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient.AuthorizationException","message":{"lang":"en-US","value":"Insufficient privileges to complete the operation."}}}<br />
<br />
Can you please investigate?<br />
<br />
Please let us know if we can provide you with additional information to diagnose this issue.</p>

<h2>            keep getting &#34;bad request&#34; after trying to open my email</h2>
                    I need helps, I am asking for my school email account. In the past 2 days I can't access to my email, every time when I tried to open any email (including the email that I opened before) it states "bad request." In the past 2 weeks, I kept receiving emails
 like Microsoft&nbsp;can't send this email (like when you sending an email to a non-existing email, you will get a return email from Microsoft) for &gt; 1000 or more emails which I had to constant deleting. However, it stops doing so but now I can't open my email.
 I tried to clean out all the browsers, reinstalling, and tried the different browser but all are not working. I can't reach to school IT because there is no number for it, only to go to that place which is not in the USA. Any helps would be great. Thank you.&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Office 365 account that you add to the OneDrive sync client will create a separate folder on the computer. And they will only sync their own folders. In OneNote, if you add multiple accounts
 to the application, the synchronization depends on the Notebooks. Any changes you made in the notebook will only be saved to this notebook under the corresponding account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know if you have any questions.</span></p>

    <title>Empty no name drafts in trash&#47;recover deleted messages folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> argantu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty no name drafts in trash&#47;recover deleted messages folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I logged into an hotmail account i don't access since 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Firstly i would like to know why it has not been deactivated due to inactivity: after all these years i still receive newsletter on it, i thought that after more than 365 days all the incoming mails would have been blocked and returned to the sender.</p>
<p>Anyway, basically i have only emails from this newsletter into the account (inbox and junk), all the other old emails are not there anymore (and they were a lot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i also noticed a strange thing:</p>
<p>In the trash folder, i have an email (i did not open it) without sender name (unknown), no subject, and no preview available (probably it's empty).</p>
<p>I have a bunch of these emails in the "recover deleted messages" folder also, but there they are marked as "draft", and some (just 3) have the name of someone of my old contacts as subject, sender name it's still "unknown" and there is no preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt the account has been compromised in these years since i used the "security mail" all this time, i would have received an email if someone tried to login (indeed this happened to me, i have been asked a code sent to the backup email).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What those draft emails could be?</p>
<p>since someone has the name of an old contact as subject i think they are my old contacts, deleted by the system due to my inactivity, and reported there this way, but i don't know if it's possible... I would like to know what you think.</p>

            &gt;&gt;
<br />Shouldn't they permanently and completely delete the account 60 days after that 1 year of inactivity making it unrecoverable? 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />The mailbox is inactive after 1 year, but can be reactivated if you know your password. The microsoft account and all associated services will be deleted after 5 years and cannot be recovered. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Do you think they are classified as "draft" because of corruption or some error in the purging process?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yes, most likely. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Someone of those has a contact name as subject, still the message it's empty, could that be an attempt by the system to delete the contact reported in the subject of the trashed draft?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yes. This is most likely the cause.

<h3> matthoweson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages reported as 250 queued for delivery, but never received when we send to some hotmail.com email addresses</h2>
                    We send regular emails to members of sports clubs using our web service, these are all active members of a club website (all wish and need to receive emails in a timely manner) some messages are never received by members using hotmail. &nbsp;We have correctly
 configured SPF records and DKIM, include unsubscribe headers and links in every email. &nbsp;We receive a response from hotmail as 250 Queued mail for delivery, for some messages, and this is becoming an increasing issue for our mutual users. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately it seems these effected mails are just not delivered (judging by current checks of mails sent a week ago). &nbsp;At least some other email sent to hotmail is successfully received, but we of course want to ensure reliable delivery across the board.
 &nbsp;How can we find out why this response is given, what it actually means, and how it can be avoided in future so that we avoid upsetting our mutual users.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            What adjustment have you made and to which account? &nbsp;We are sending to your users and they are not receiving the emails we send despite the fact you respond with a message indicating messages re correctly queued for delivery.
<div><br />
<div>This is proving really hard to get any valid help with. &nbsp; We follow all best practice and only send to people who very much want to and expect to receive emails from our systems. &nbsp;These are legitimate notification emails, sent from a domain validated by
 SPF, and DKIM, and offering users unsubscribe options. &nbsp;We have received many complaints from hotmail users saying they don't receive their messages sent from us. &nbsp;On investigation these are correctly sent to you, but the user does not receive them in either
 their spam or inbox, we are not on any known blacklists.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What else can be done when sending messages to hotmail to ensure they are delivered, and if they are not that we receive a suitable notification that they are not. &nbsp;The response we receive is misleading as it informs that the message will be delivered,
 where we have repeated experience that it is not.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I await your advice. &nbsp;I have answered all questions promptly asking for further diagnostic information in the private messag. &nbsp;I have not received any attempt at any explanation for why this happens, and what can be done to avoid it. &nbsp;I'd really appreciate
 your assistance so we can do what is needed to support your users in receiving email.</div>

            Did you find a solution for this ? We, a hosting provider, are experiencing the same on several servers. Get the 250 notification but mail is never delivered or send back.<br />

            No still not found a solution, very frustrating! &nbsp;The reports from our users do seem to have reduced though so maybe something has changed.
<div><br />
<div>The trouble is despite several replies, I haven't had a reply that addressed the specific issue I raised. &nbsp;A familiar path with so much technical support, it's much easier to give a standard answer to a similar issue, or suggest there was a problem that
 is now fixed, rather than address the actual problem... &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>There doesn't seem to be anywhere else to go with this issue, a certain (small I think) percentage of emails are accepted but never delivered. &nbsp;In the absence of any other feedback, I can only assume it is a general problem with hotmail/outlook.com, rather
 than anything specific to us, as otherwise we would presumably get an error code rather than a 250 response.</div>

            We don't get any answers too. This is foresure no problem at our side. Mail is simply accepted and never seen again. The sending ip is more then clean and html of text messages make no difference. SPF records are ok, everything is ok...<br />
<br />
We have more dan 20.000 customers, some have this problem sometimes and they kind of blame us. If we do not find a solution for this soon we will write an article in our newsletter better not to use hotmail/outlook...<br />
<br />
So please microsoft, could you be so kind to simply check a few messages what has happened to them ?<br />

            Hi <font color="#0072c6">MattHoweson</font> and <font color="#0072c6">Weba(1)</font>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting back. It is possible that the bounce message you receive is due to the receivers end. Kindly v<span>erify the validity of the recipient address and if&nbsp;the receiving server is configured to receive messages correctly. Also you
 may&nbsp;try to reduce the recipients on the email you are trying to send&nbsp;and see if issue will still persist.<br />
<br />
<font>Hope this helps.</font><font><font><span>
</span></font></font><font>If you have any other issues, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</font></span>

<h2>            Shift &#43; Command &#43; Down Arrow Not Working With Insert Function</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with the Shift+Command+Down Arrow shortcut when using Insert Function. The shortcut seems to work normally within the worksheet, but when I go to the Formula Builder and select my range, the text box remains active instead of allowing
 me to select the cells I need. Can anybody else replicate this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Move focus to a cell to select it. Press SHIFT + F3. This adds an equal sign to the formula bar and opens the Formula Builder. Press VO + RIGHT ARROW until you access the Formula Builder. Press VO + SHIFT + DOWN ARROW to enter the Formula Builder, and then

<h2>            OTC Updater for Windows Phone - Where&#39;s the Media Creation Tool Equivalent&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's nice to hear that there is currently a PC based updater for Windows Phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is currently on 33% after starting the update to 2017-10 Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for arm-based Phone Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I updated from 8.1 to 10 which went smoothly after failing once after I decided to reset the phone.</p>
<p>For some reason it worked but then it decided to search for a newer update which was also successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But last night it found another update which was also successful but on completion it decided to look again and found the update mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the PCs Fall Update was 1709 so if this one actually goes through before the end of the universe will my phone start looking for the next update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the v1.0 of the OTC but as we have more than 1 Windows Phone in the household it would have been better to have a Media Creation Tool for Windows Phone as we do on the Windows PCs in the home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where's the file to use when we connect the other Phones to the PC via USB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your query about having a Media Creation Tool for Windows Phone, we suggest that you send this to our Software Engineers and Software Developers by using our
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> as they're the best team to provide you with more details regarding this. To launch the Feedback Hub app on your Windows 10 Mobile, go to
<strong>App list</strong> &gt; <strong>Feedback Hub</strong>. You can create a thread or search for a similar issue and tap "<strong>upvote</strong>" to include this on the next update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tool that you need to use to connect your other Windows phone to a PC via USB is the
<strong>Windows Device Recovery Tool </strong>that you need to download on your PC. It'll install the latest version of Windows approved for your phone and remove everything else, including your apps, games, texts, call history, music, and photos. We suggest
 that you create a back up on your phone before using it to avoid data loss.<br />

<p>Thanks Dennis </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that the device recovery tool has been updated from last time that I tried.</p>
<p>I was referring to the recent release of&nbsp;<span>OTC Updater for Windows Phone.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to move on all of the windows phones without having to repeat the same wait.</span></p>
<p><span>The Media Creation Tool allows users to download the official update and install on all registered PCs. This is a much more reliable method from my experience.</span></p>
<p><span>I will run the device recovery too for the next Phone to see if it has changed from the last time I tried it.</span></p>

<p>

<p>Per some other forum user suggestion, I created a new profile and Cortana works just fine on it.&nbsp; Crating a new profile is not acceptable for me though, too much software I have installed depends on that&nbsp;user profile&nbsp;(already checked).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the follow up. I've tried to run cfc /scannow&nbsp;and fails with error after 2% progress. I've been trying to find the issue on the log but still cannot figure it. Sfc /verifyonly doesnt throw an error. Whatever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just would like to find the culprit; because if this is not addressed, many upgrade users will face this (it is clear a good % of people do have problems). Personally, I just got a new HD so i'll probably do a clean install; but would be interesting to
 find the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep digging. I do suspect the language packs, localization, keyboard layouts and related stuff,&nbsp;since I have installed additional ones (removed already, of course).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>That said, I want to move my normal.dotm file into the templates where Word can see it. &nbsp;The search doesn't respond with a location. &nbsp; It took going to the trusted sources to see where Office now places this file. &nbsp;</p>

            That's all well and good if you get to the Insider Hub. &nbsp;The issue is that with this build there was no shortcut for the hub on the desktop. To make this post, I had to go on the net to reach you. &nbsp;On the W10 build, I just had to search for the app and
 create a shortcut. &nbsp;Things need to be easier if you want our comments.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; I have sent the file to a colleague who can open it and edit&nbsp;the objects who is on office 365 and office 2016 Visio, not professional, then when he sends it back I cant edit it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if the original file is created by the colleague? Can you open and edit the file properly in your Visio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please try repairing Office via Control Panel to see if there will be any improvement.

            <p>Thanks for confirming that you have reproduced the problem. My colleague has edited it and sent it back and i can't edit. I really need fix for this. is it possible as I am an office365 user to have office365 visio or not professional made available to me
 until this is fixed as you have reproduced this. The client work needs to be in next week and we can't share the work between us at the moment as I can't edit the &nbsp;file. &nbsp;Any help would be much appreciated even if i downgrade from professional for the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your response. I will upload some test data because I'm still really interested if this is an option, however I don't know how to upload an actual file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a different solution which I will also post here for future reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a sample data to look up and validate:</p>
<p>(On Sheet 2)</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Date Entered</td>
<td>1/01/2012</td>
<td>1/01/2013</td>
<td>1/01/2014</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Course Code</td>
<td>Cost1</td>
<td>Cost2</td>
<td>Cost3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>50</td>
<td>53</td>
<td>55</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>40</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>44</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>84</td>
<td>88</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>150</td>
<td>158</td>
<td>165</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>1,200</td>
<td>1,260</td>
<td>1,323</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>900</td>
<td>945</td>
<td>992</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td>
<td>200</td>
<td>210</td>
<td>221</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to use DV to search for the Course Code, but when the selection was made, to return the course cost from the column/s B/C/D/E etc when the pricing changed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if, in the Entry area (on Sheet 1) Course "G" was selected, it would actually return $900 if it was dated prior to the price change in Col C, and further price changes would be reflected as at whatever date they changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't / couldn't use VLOOKUP without all historical data being changed when pricing changed, so a solution was found as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Entry page, in the Cost column, the following formula worked a treat:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(Sheet2!$B$3:$D$10,MATCH(B2,Sheet2!$A$3:$A$10,0),MATCH(A2,Sheet2!B$1:D$1,1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following data set:</p>
<p>(on Sheet 1)</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>Course</td>
<td>Cost</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1/03/2012</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8/09/2012</td>
<td>H</td>
<td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6/05/2013</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>158</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8/11/2013</td>
<td>E</td>
<td>1,260</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2/02/2014</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>44</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9/06/2014</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>165</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>So, for anyone in future wanting to achieve this - this is an awesome solution, and so very simple and elegant. I actually used it in combination with proper Tables and Named Ranges too, so that made it look even nicer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(ISBLANK(D2),"",INDEX(CourseTable[[Cost]:[Cost20]],MATCH('Entry Page'!E2,Course_Code,0),MATCH('Entry Page'!D2,'Course Table'!$E$4:$X$4,1)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Follow instructions at <a href="http://malwaretips.com/blogs/yahoo-toolbar-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>If you can't follow step 1, skip it and move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check after running AdwCleaner and Junkware Removal tool. You might not have to run Malwarebytes and HitmanPro. Nothing wrong with those 2 programs, but they might not be needed.</p>

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Dontae Jones</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your issue resolved now? If not, based on your problem, I recommend you check the following link first whether you have tried the correct steps to&nbsp;<span>delete delegation.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/set-up-and-troubleshoot-skype-for-business-online-delegation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-skype-for-business-online/set-up-and-troubleshoot-skype-for-business-online-delegation</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:
</span>The link states the steps to add delegate member, deletion is in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, you can also try to clear the cache in Skype for Business and see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Log out of Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Delete the sign-in information.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Exit Skype&nbsp;for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;</span><span>Navigate to "<strong>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>5. Delete the <strong>sip_profileName</strong>&nbsp;folder.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Delete all files in <strong>Tracing</strong> folder.&nbsp; Do not delete the folder itself.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Open the command prompt and run <strong>ipconfig&nbsp;/flushdns</strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            Devicespace&#58; Hotspot framework not available</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was cleaning some applications including Demo games, etc., on my new N95 8GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;By mistake I deleted Hotspot Framework. Now, when I restart a phone I am getting message: "Devicescape: Hotspot Framework Not Available"</p>
<p>How to reinstall it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already tried to update software hoping it will reinstall Hotspot. I removed battery and inserted it back. Still now luck.</p>
<p>I think lack of Hotspot will restrict my access to wirelles network (which I have at home and in the office).</p>
<p>Is there manual process to reinstall Hotspot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Nokia 5235 doesn't have WiFi support, so no you cannot use WiFi at all with it as it doesn't have the necessary hardware.

</p><p>Conclusions so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update broke something</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution would be to disable updates and revert to an earlier version, unfortunately...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Microsoft's infinite wisdom they made reverting impossible (well theoretically possible from command-line, except that apparently is only capable of spitting out long error messages), and have made disabling updates impossible without breaking large portions
 of the Operating System (not something I normally object to).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just wrote a long reply about my multitude of maddening quirks that develop every time MS updates. that F9 key's a snare &amp; a delusion. the log Too tired to repeat what the mail just vanished for me before posting.</p>
<p>As soon as everyone's asleep in&nbsp; my building I'm going up to the roof to fling my problem away. Soooo sick of those helper bots that send me from one obscure unhelpful site to the next equally unhelpful spot.i. Grrrr</p>
<p>Well, this is a 2nd smaller rant than the vanished one, Hope that reply button actually works this time. otherwise I end up writing rude notes to MS that nobody ever reads or responds to. Nice way to let off steam after spending 6 hrs. trying&nbsp; to fix something
 the Company wrecks. my printer also develops total amnesia as to it's functions when some of the upgrades happen. the patch they added is not fully successful so whenever I want to print or scan, I have to run through a huge reset or go to the neighbor copy
 shop, (guess which I do most often).&nbsp; or I'll end up doing my usual swearing because I&nbsp; can't fix anything. The day I toss the entire&nbsp; Surface contraption is fast approaching.</p>
<p>Many thanks for letting me vent. I bought the Surface 3 years ago or maybe it's only 2 long years but I have a life and it doesn't involve hours and hours of futile computer nonsense.</p>

<p>The next update fixed the logging in issue in outlook, other than it continuously having strokes and sitting there comatose a for minute or two, several times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my home computer where I have control over such things update is, and always has been disabled.&nbsp; &nbsp; 108 days of uptime and counting (power blink).&nbsp; Did I mention it is also running decade old xeons and Windows 7?&nbsp; Oh, and outlook 2003, because that version
 actually did what it was told, and nothing more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My home computer, despite being technically lower power, (quad core hyperthreaded i7 at work, dual quad core non-hyperthreaded xeons at home) is far faster and more stable than the POS windows 10 computer at work.</p>

<p>If someone would PM me with a download link for the updated OVI store, I would be greatly appreciative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was supposed to be available by Friday, but in true Nokia fashion, it is not.&nbsp; Some places have already received the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if anyone has the file or knows where I might get it, I would love a PM with the link.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This seems to be an issue with the Indexing feature not working in Office 2016. To resolve the issue we need to rebuild the Indexing. Since you have mentioned about Outlook Indexing
 errors, let us begin with the Outlook application and rebuild the Indexing in Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to rebuild Indexing in Outlook 2016:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>In Outlook click on <strong>File</strong> and then then click on <strong>Options</strong>.</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the Outlook Options window click on <strong>Search</strong> and then under <strong>
Sources</strong> click on the tab <strong>Indexing Options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the Indexing Options window click on <strong>Advance</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Under <strong>Index Settings</strong> click on <strong>Rebuild</strong>.</p>
</li><li>As Indexing takes a long time, allow Outlook to rebuild the Indexing for about 12 to 24 hours and verify the result after about 24 hours.
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After completing the above steps, make sure to restart your computer and check after some time if the search is working normally in Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Hope it helps. Please post to us if you need any further assistance with Office products.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<h2>            Voice recorder issues on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Window 7 and 8 had a sound recorder that could record off the sound card. whatever was playing on the speakers could be recorded. Windows 10 has only a voice recorder and you must use a microphone. I have downloaded several different sound programs, some
 say they are for windows 10 but have nothing but problems. Some did not work at all. Gives error messages. Some recorded the sound but did not save it anywhere. Is there a program that does work with windows 10 that will record anything that is coming through
 to sound card. I really enjoyed the original sound recorder in 7. Simple to use, worked very well for my purposes. I really miss it. Getting an off brand program does not bather me, what does is as I said. I tried 5 different programs and none of them work.
 Any ideas?</p>
