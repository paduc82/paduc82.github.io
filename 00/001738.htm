            <p>Dear munstertowin, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to delete an album on your phone, please open Zune on your phone, choose "music", then choose "albums" and then tap and hold on the album that you would like to delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to delete a single song, open the album first and then tap and hold on the song that you do not want any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this was helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Achim</p>

    <title>Digital Security Certificate Signed by Kaspersky Labs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurencerockwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Digital Security Certificate Signed by Kaspersky Labs&#63;</h2>
                    This morning, all of a sudden, after Microsoft updates last night, when addressing "https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum"using Firefox Browser version 50.1.0 I am receiving messages that "Your connection is not secure".&nbsp;
<div>"The owner of answers.microsoft.com has configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox has not connected to this website."</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing "Advanced" button,&nbsp; I got this message:</p>
<p>"answers.microsoft.com uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown. The server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates. An additional root certificate may need to be
 imported. Error code: SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER"</p>
<p>Activating the SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER link I read: "https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows8_1/windows-security-certificate-errors/1d24527b-e954-4ba9-9956-b861c76cd878 Peer’s Certificate issuer is not recognized. HTTP Strict Transport
 Security: false HTTP Public Key Pinning: false" </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depressing "Add Exception" I then saw button to "Get Certificate". When I depressed "Get Certificate" I got a certificate issued by Kaspersky Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Does Microsoft contract with Kaspersky Labs for their digital certificates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, what shall I do?</p>
<p>Thank-you in advance,</p>
<p>LR</p>

            <p>Which antivirus do you use? I have seen some antiviruses registering their certificates in browsers to be able to scan SSL traffic. If you have (or had) Kaspersky, maybe the certificate you saw came from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update your Firefox to update list of Intermediate and Root CAs. Is this problem limited to Firefox or you are seeing this on other browsers too?</p>

            Is this a recent infection? <br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptowall-ransomware-information#cryptowall3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">CryptoWall 3.0</span></a></strong> is an
<strong>older</strong> ransomware infection and like previous versions, does <strong>
not append</strong> an obvious extension to the end of encrypted filenames but it will leave files (ransom notes) named HELP_DECRYPT.TXT, HELP_DECRYPT.HTML, and HELP_DECRYPT.PNG. CryptoWall is currently identified by how the files are renamed...it not only
 encrypts the contents of the file, it encrypts the actual filename itself. CryptoWall 3.0 and 4.0 encrypted files typically will have the same 16 byte header which is different for each victim.<br />
<br />
If you were infected recently, you probably are dealing with another ransomware infection.<br />
<br />
You can submit (upload) samples of encrypted files, ransom notes and any contact email addresses or hyperlinks provided by the cyber-criminals to
<strong><a href="https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/index.php?lang=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">ID Ransomware (IDR)</span></a></strong> for
<strong>assistance with identification</strong> and <strong>confirmation</strong>. This is a service that helps identify what ransomware may have encrypted your files, whether it is decryptable and then attempts to direct you to an appropriate support topic
 where you can seek further assistance. Uploading <strong>both</strong> encrypted files and ransom notes together provides a more positive match and helps to avoid false detections. Any contact email addresses or hyperlinks provided by the criminals may also
 be helpful with identification. If there is no known way of decrypting your files, IDR will ask if you'd like to opt-in for notification if there is any solution in the future.
<br />
<br />
Most crypto malware ransomware is typically <strong>programmed to automatically remove itself</strong>...the malicious files responsible for the infection...after the encrypting is done since they are no longer needed. That explains why many security scanners
 do not find anything after the fact. The <strong>encrypted files do not contain malicious code so they are safe</strong>. Unfortunately, most victims do not realize they have been infected until the ransomware displays the ransom note and the files have already
 been encrypted. In some cases there may be no ransom note and discovery only occurs at a later time when attempting to open an encrypted file. As such, they don't know how long the malware was on the system before being alerted or if
<strong>other malware</strong> was downloaded and installed along with the ransomware. If other malware was involved it could still be present so be sure to perform full scans with your anti-virus.<br />
<br />
If your antivirus did not detect and remove anything, additional scans should be performed with other security programs like

<h2>            Script error in Office 2016 help</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having an issue with help in Office 2016.&nbsp; We have a fully updated Windows 10 clean installation with Office 2016 installed and fully updated.&nbsp; In an Office application, in the "Tell me what you want to do.." box on the ribbon, you can type in a word
 or phrase to search.&nbsp; In the drop down box that appears as you type, click on "Get help on (your search words)" to open the help window.&nbsp; The search results appear as links. When you click on the home button, a script error is returned:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f941891" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can click yes or no, and it will work correctly until the help window is opened again.&nbsp; We tried disabling the scripting in Internet Explorer, displaying scripting errors, turning off the security, and&nbsp;adding office.com to the trusted website list and
 the compatibility view mode list.&nbsp; The URL in the error box works correctly if you paste it into Internet Explorer itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this problem?&nbsp; Thank you</p>

<h2>            OneNote Storage Using OneDrive For Business</h2>
                    <p>I'm considering adding content to my OneNote libraries. I have OneNote personal that has gone from 15G to 5G.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a subscription to Office365 For Business which includes OneDrive For Business which I don't use as I found the sync features a PITA to utilize and could not keep up with the changes and nomenclature the past 18 months (Sharepoint, Onedrive, now you
 see it now you don't storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Question: Can I use my 1TB cloud storage that comes with OneDrive For Business to store OneNote notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that OneDrive uses it's own sync and have read to NOT use OneDrive For Business to sync OneDrive notebooks, at it can screw things up. I get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But... no other way to ask this so this luddite understands it. Can I have OneNote 2016 IN ANY WAY utilize that 1TB of storage? If so, how? Or.... Do I have to pay BillGatusOfBorg $1.99 a month to get more storage for my OneNote notebooks beyond the 5G I
 now have when "I'm suppose to have" 1TB of cloud storage (but just not for Onenote).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am more than willing to start with new notebooks in OneNote if I can use that 1TB rather than worry about moving existing notebooks to OneDrive For Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I made this clear enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can answer this for me, please enlighted me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>all I did in the 'Settings' under 'Country or region' is change the country to United States in the drop-down window.&nbsp; Then I went into the System options -&gt; Cortana &amp; search and then 'Customize Cortana &amp; search settings' in the right window pane.&nbsp; once
 I there, you can tell Cortana your name and tweak your search settings / preferences.</p>
<p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below, explain how move your files from one account to another OneDrive account please follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Hit the Windows start key and type OneDrive then click on the App 
<br />
<br />2. Once the OneDrive folder opens highlight all the files right-click and select "Always keep on this device" 
<br />
<br />3. Once all the files and folders have a Green filled in circle with a tick next to it then left click on the cloud icon in the system try (bottom right) and hit the three dots then hit settings 
<br />
<br />4. Click "Unlink this PC" and then click "Unlink this account" at the popup then follow the setup instructions and log in with the account you want your OneDrive files to be stored in and select "use this location" at the pop up.
<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

            Hi GregoryWikle,
<br />
<br />Each Microsoft account will have it's own OneDrive. Microsoft doesn't allow merging of accounts, but you can move the files over by sharing them from the account you don't want to keep and then signing into onedrive.live.com with your other account when you go to the share link that you create when sharing from the first account. Then copy the files into the other account.
<br />
<br />Please see here for instructions on sharing OneDrive files and folders:

</p><p>When I sign on to Outlook.com, for each email address, I can see their individual One Drive. The one for my old email address has all the files in it that I have put there. The One Drive for the new email address is pretty much empty except for a couple
 folders that are put their when it's created.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, I have a <em>Favorite</em>, when I click on <em>My Computer</em>, that is linked to the One Drive that is tied to my old email address. When I click the icon on
<em>My Computer/Favorites</em>, I see all the files tied to my old email address One Drive. What I really want to do is change the favorite on My Computer so it points to the One Drive for my new email address (or a favorite for each One Drive would be OK).
 Then, of course, I want to the move the files from the old One Drive to the new One Drive (or share them)</p>

            On your computer, you would need to sign out of the old account in the OneDrive app, and then sign into the app with the new address. 
<br />
<br />When you do that, it should find the old OneDrive folder on your computer and ask if you want to use that. If you do, it will then copy the files in that folder, which was for the old account.
<br />
<br />This will then move the files from your old account into the new one.
<br />
<br />To do it, right click the OneDrive cloud icon in the system tray by the clock and choose Settings. On the Account tab choose Unlink this PC and then Unlink Account.
<br />
<br />Then sign back in on the app with the new account.

            So, if you highlight the message instead of opening it, it should let you select Forward.

    <title>Cannot open Hyperlink excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pureirishpia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open Hyperlink excel 2007</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>One of our office girls uses a spreadsheet to keep track of some Purchase Orders by creating a hyperlink to a PDF. She had many that she has done in the past and they all work. She tried creating a new one and it would give me an error that it can not be
 opened. The file has not moved and I can open it with adobe. When she tired another file the hyperlink for the new file worked, but still can get that other one to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:</p>
<p>What factor could be causing this one file not to open? Would the Files name size have any factor?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'd look at the following:</p>
<p>* what characters are in the filename (anything other than alphabet, numbers, and spaces)- is there anything unusual?</p>
<p>* total path/filename length: is the total length longer than other working files?</p>
<p>* Is the "broken" file located somewhere else, like in a different directory on the server than any confirmed working files? Are you able to click on the file directly (not the hyperlink) and still open it?</p>
<p>* If the woman in your office makes a *copy* of the file and then renames it - actually deletes the whole existing name, and types a new name in, then creates a hyperlink off that new file, does it work?</p>
<p>* Is the error only happening for you, or for anyone that tries to open the file? Is there any chance that the filename might have been edited after the link was created? Even just removing or adding a space?</p>

</p><p><strong>Issue: </strong><em>What is wrong with the font with the new version of skype, it looks like everything has been done with crayons.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The colors and font in New Skype are one of the improvements and modifications&nbsp;made in the latest version. And unfortunately, it is not yet possible changing the font on that version. However, you can still use the most recent version
 of <em>Classic Skype</em> as an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to these steps on how to get Classic version.</p>

            Unfortunately, you'd need to get help from HP with this.&nbsp; Having worked HP's forums for a number of years, I can tell you that there isn't an official, supported way to change the language of your IPAQ from german to english.&nbsp; You should sell your german
 ipag and find one in the language of your choice.<br />

<h2>            On Microsoft Outlook 2013, how can I save Multiple Attachments from &#42;MULTIPLE&#42; messages &#40;with one save&#41; in Windows&#63;</h2>
                    I have over 7 years of emails with work to save and am not able to use a RULE or create one that I can see in Outlook 2013 on Windows to get all the attachments from my emails. How can I secure my files from a work server or create this rule? I would like
 to be able to copy the attachments and move them to a folder outside of Outlook (like a New Folder I create on My Desktop). Please assist as soon as possible anyone. Thank you!

<p>Thanks for reposting in the correct forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your question is no, there is no way to save multiple attachments from multiple messages with out-of-the-box Outlook.

    <title>PowerPoint background changing to grey - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PowerPoint background changing to grey</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using PowerPoint 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the SlideMaster to import an image that has our header/footer designs in it with a white background. The issue is that whenever I use "Normal View" to work through the deck, the background shows as grey on the current slide. However, on the left hand
 side where it shows the thumbnails, the backgrounds are white like they should be. If I look at the "Print Preview," the backgrounds are white there as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to see the white background on the current slide so I can adjust my secondary colors accordingly. Any help you can provide would be appreciated.
</p>

            <p>You have 2 things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The background of the Slide Master is set to 100% transparency. This effect doesn't display in the slide list on the left.</li><li>You've been given graphics that have colors in the top and bottom areas, but in between the graphic is also transparent.</li></ul>
<p>To fix it, move the graphic, right-click on the slide background and select <strong>
Format Background...</strong> In the Fill panel, change<strong> Transparency</strong> to 0%. The background will go back to white and you can move the graphic back to where it was.</p>

            <p>I'm not able to select or move the background file. I'm guessing it's because I wasn't the author of the PPTX whenever the background was loaded. The transparency was set to 0%. I think your second bullet point is right in regards to the image itself being
 transparent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried saving the PPTX as a zipped file and then opening the media files to see if I could get the image. I could, so now I'm going to intentionally set the background to white and reload the image to my background and see if that fixes it. A whole new
 can of worms. Consider this case closed. </p>

            If you open Slide Master view and select the larger slide at the top (which is the actual Slide Master), then click on a colored area of the graphic, you should be able to select and move it. You can't move it on any of the Slide Layouts (the smaller slides
 below).

            <p>Just tried that. I am not able to select anything on the graphic. I even went as far as selecting all and deleting anything that it allowed me to delete. All of my text and page numbers and such went away, but the graphic remained unchanged and unselected.
 All of this was on the very top slide in the slide master. </p>

            <p>I don't want you to have to do that. As long as I load white paper into the printer, it should come out with a white background the way I want. It's more of a nuance than a true issue at this point. Thanks for the offer, though.

            <p>I know this is over a year old, but thought I'd add a reply for those who are having the same issue in the future.&nbsp; The reason why the slide is gray in the stage area is because the Microsoft Account Theme setting is set to either a "Gray" background or
 something other than "White". &nbsp; This also happened to me.&nbsp; To correct...</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From any Microsoft Office program, click "File"</li><li>Click "Account"</li><li>Under the "Office Theme" drop down menu, select, "White"</li></ol>
<p>You should notice that your PowerPoint slide background now matches what's actually in the outline view and what's actually seen in the slide show view.</p>

            Sorry, this is a bad solution. You're trying to fix a structural presentation problem by changing the interface display. That doesn't correct the underlying problem, and as soon as the deck is moved to a machine with a different theme enabled, the issue
 will recur.

            <p>Hello NabilaSekkat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly you haven't accessed your account for a long time and you receive an error message when you try to access it. Let me help you with that. Since you've mentioned that you didn't sign in to your account for&nbsp;years, it is possible
 that your account has been tagged as <strong>inactive</strong>. Please be informed that Outlook.com accounts become inactive if you don’t sign in for more than
<strong>365 days</strong> or <strong>within 10 days</strong> after signing up for an account. Mail and contacts in Outlook.com accounts will be purged after 365 days of inactivity. Any existing mail cannot be retrieved from the accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to verify if account inactivity was the cause of this issue, we need you to provide some information in the private message area that I've created. Just click on the "<strong>You have a private reply to this message</strong>" link above your post
 to view the message. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks Karla.&nbsp;I just&nbsp;sent you a private reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am concerned by your response:&nbsp;if the account is inactive, does this mean that all contents (mails, contacts etc)&nbsp;are deleted?</p>

            <p>Hi NabilaSekkat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing the requested information in the private message area. I have checked your account and it doesn't exist in our server. As what Karla mentioned, it is really possible that your account has undergone inactivity and the account name
 is now deleted from the server. Once the account has been deleted, it will be available again for registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have more questions, always feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Messages hung up on &#34;Sending&#34;</h2>
                    I'm running a MacOS High Sierra and the<span> latest Skype version 8.26.0.70. I am unable to send messages to one contact in my list, getting the perpetual "Sending" on every message. When I group chat with her and one other person, I can send
 messages fine. I can also send messages to her through Mobile Skype. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Blocked and unblocked. Restarted several times. Changed WiFi routers to increase speed. Nothing has worked. Any suggestions?

<p>You can use the Insert&gt;Symbol facility, or if your keyboard has a numeric keypad holding down the ALT key and typing 0149 will insert • &nbsp; If you want a smaller dot, typing 0183 will insert ·&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            In Word 2010, I have &#40;and want&#41; several blank pages in my book document. How can I leave the header and footer off those pages&#63;</h2>
                    In Word 2010, I have a book document that has chapters, etc.&nbsp; I have a blank page on the back of a chapter title page for each chapter.&nbsp; How can I NOT have the header and footer appear on those two pages throughout the book?&nbsp; Those two pages would (I think)
 be counted as the first two pages of the new section.&nbsp; But, when I put the header on, I only see where I can take it off the first page.. so that leaves the header still appearing on the blank page and the page 1 of the chapter, which I don't want.&nbsp; Is there
 some sort of code to give certain pages where you don't want the header or footer to appear, when they are in the middle of a section or something (such as Notes, etc.)??????&nbsp;

            <p>And note also that you will have to unlink the blank header from those preceding and following. That is, if we designate the preceding chapter as Section X, the chapter title page section as Section Y, and the chapter that follows it as Section Z, you would
 need to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert a Next Page section break (replacing the existing page break) both before and following the chapter title page.
</li><li>Unlink the Section Y header from the header in Section X. </li><li>Unlink the Section Z header from the header in Section Y. </li><li>Then delete the header content in Section Y.</li></ol>
<p>An easier approach, if you don't want a header on the first page of the chapter proper, and assuming that every chapter begins on an odd page and every chapter title page is also an odd page, is this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set "Different first page" for all sections. </li><li>Insert Odd Page section breaks before and after the chapter title page. </li><li>Assuming you leave the Odd Page Header empty, you will have no header on the chapter title page or the first page of the chapter, AND Word will automatically insert a totally blank even page following the chapter title page (you won't see it, but it will
 "print").</li></ol>

    <title>PowerPoint files won&#39;t save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim-w  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint files won&#39;t save</h2>
                    <p>When the preview pane is visible in windows 7, PowerPoint 2007 files don't save.&nbsp; They go through the save process, and even update in the preview window, but they don't actually write the file.&nbsp; The time stamp doesn't change and as soon as you close the
 PowerPoint file the preview reverts back to the original file -&nbsp; which is what is actually on the disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps to replicate:</p>
<p><strong>Open Explorer in Windows 7 and turn on the preview pane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create and save&nbsp;or open an existing PowerPoint 2007 file.&nbsp; (seems more prevalent on larger files)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note the timestamp on the file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make a change to the file and save.&nbsp; Best if change is in the first slide so you don't have to scroll to verify&nbsp;in the preview.&nbsp; PowerPoint goes through the save process without error.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pick off of and back on the file in the Explorer window&nbsp; to refresh the preview and scroll in the preview to see the "saved" changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note that the timestamp has not changed even after multiple saves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Close the PowerPoint file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Re-open the file and it is the original file, sans changes.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the preview pane turned off, the file saves, the time stamp updates and all is good.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue particular to PowerPoint or occurs with all MS Office files?<br />
</li><li>Are all updates for MS Office installed on the computer?<br />
</li><li>Is the location of the file on the local computer or in a remote location on a network computer?
</li><li>Did the application work fine on the computer before?</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Visit the link provided below and read the article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Create a new user account and check if the issue persist. Use the link given below for help on creating new user account.</p>

            <p>This is consistantly happening on a number of different systems on a network, logged in as different users.&nbsp; If I turn off Explorer preview the problem goes away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Adobe Acrobat X has a similar problem with the preview turned on but at least it will give an error message and not make the person believe they saved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The systems have current updates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have not tried local files. The files tested were created on the network.&nbsp; It is not a file corruption as it happens only when the preview is turned on and with any file.</p>
<p>We have disabled Explorer preview through a group policy until we can find a resolution.</p>
<p>We're migrating to Windows 7 as we upgrade computers and people are slowly finding the preview window in Explorer.&nbsp; We were seeing this as an infrequent anomoly with a few users, but as more users got Windows 7 systems and found Explorer's preview window
 it became obvious it was not user error.&nbsp; Error messages in Acrobat X tipped us off and we found the work-around from that.</p>

            <p>It's a known bug, Jim.&nbsp; It's been reported to and confirmed by MS.&nbsp; In other cases it may refuse to save at all, claiming that it's a read-only file.</p>
<p>The preview pane can cause other problems as well ... it can cause invisible zombie versions of the PPT application to hang around.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Until MS sorts it out, the preview pane in Win Explorer is best avoided, and it sounds like that's what you've already worked out.</p>

            <p>&gt;&gt; Can you point me to Microsoft's confirmation so I can track their progress?</p>
<p>Afraid not .. it was in private email; there's no public confirmation and no means of tracking anything.</p>
<p>It may be something the PPT team has to take up with the Windows group (since it's a Windows app that's really the cause of the problem, or at least we might look at it that way).&nbsp; PowerPoint's a pretty small flea on the tail of the Windows ... ermmm ...
 dog, so changes could take a while, is my guess.</p>

            <p>I know there is a fix for Excel 2007 on this issue and I believe it pertains to all of office.&nbsp; This is for open, but it affects open or save:</p>
<p>942146 You receive a message when you try to open an Excel 2007 document on a Windows Vista-based computer from a remote shared folder, even if no other user is using the document: "File in use"</p>
