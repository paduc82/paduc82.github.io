    <title>WINDOWS 10 CANNOT ASSOCIATE FILES using OPEN WITH - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jolie princess katana  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 CANNOT ASSOCIATE FILES using OPEN WITH</h2>
                    <p>I am no longer able to choose a program I have on my own computer- it does not show my program in the list of programs. All is grayed out except go buy an APP at the MS store!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Twice in last two days I have contemplated going back to WINDOWS 7 so I don't have to deal with being sold apps I don't need or want. And that will not open my files anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 examples: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example1: Right click a JPG- in this case I want to open in PHOTOSHOP - not in list at all- Used to be able to set a simple view for most photos for PREVIEW and then for OPEN you could set another. As a pro photographer this is a HUGE frustration. Sometimes
 a quick peek is all I want to see, other times I need to OPEN IT. I now have to open the program and hunt again for the file to OPEN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 2: I have a game UT2004- Normally I can double-click a MAP file (unusual format only in this program ) and it will open the game and show me that map. I tried open with again to associate it to Unreal and not in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO I went to settings..apps...no way to add a file type not listed and no way to add programs not listed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY WHY does MS insist on messing with what worked and REMOVE IT??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just starting to like WIN 10 now my opinion is it's just way to totally control our computers and force us to use MS apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to add ALL my installed programs to that list of apps. And a way to add the file types not listed or shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>I suspect you are missing something in there.&nbsp; You should be able to Browse your program files for example and thus pick whatever it is that you are thinking of.&nbsp; The reason you can't see it as a possibility is that it has not been registered as one for
 that particular file type and extension association.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a more complicated method involving Default Programs but that could be closer to what you would be used to if coming from W7 or earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding drag and drop:&nbsp; in the case of IE and its shortcuts if you don't want to create a pinned Favorite you need to drag with
 Also, it's possible you aren't picking the right target for your drop.&nbsp; Drag to the Taskbar in the vicinity of the app you want to use to open the file, then wait for the task's thumbnail to open, then drag into the thumbnail, then wait for the task's preview
 window to open, then try to drop it.&nbsp; That's what I have to do with .dmp files for example, even though there is a file type association for the .dmp file extension.&nbsp; The program opens with the extension but then I have to drag the file into the program in
 order to make it do anything with it.</p>

            It could be a problem with your Windows Installer Service. You can download updates from<br />
the link below.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=8483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=8483</a><br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is also done via Windows Updates, but if you have not kept up with
<br />
Windows Updates you should install them anyway (except for the 'optional' ones).<br />
<br />
You seem certain there is nothing wrong with the disk so I guess you have tried it on another<br />
machine or tried copying the contents to your HDD to verify there are no corrupt files on the disk<br />
(quite likely if the error is always for the same file).<br />
<br />
Or - Your Anti-Virus is blocking the file and not telling you. Try disabling the AV temporarily.<br />

            I went to the link you mentioned and it appeared that none of the updates are very recent. Im running windows 7 home premium (64) that came with my machine purchased new March 2011. I also have auto update enabled. I will try to copy the disk to the hdd,
 disable AV and let you know. Wish me luck!&nbsp;<br />

<h3> qwerty-space  say:</h3>
<h2>            So the Buggy Mouse Cursor with Dual Monitor Set up and an AMD ATI GPU is back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After 4 years, it is back. &nbsp;It kind of looks like the very top of the mouse pointer duplicated multiple times below, to look like one vertical line with diagonal lines coming off it. &nbsp;This usually only occurs on one monitor at a time, with an ATI GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many fixes that have been reported.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Enabling mouse pointer trails and setting to short (stops bug while this is enabled)</li><li>Wiggling mouse back and forward between to displays rapidly</li><li>changing the side your secondary monitor is on in 'display settings', then changing it back again.</li><li>Changing your multi monitor set up from 'extend' to 'duplicate' and then back again.</li><li>Wiggling the cursor in the top right of the far right monitor a bit.<br />
</li><li>Rebooting your PC.</li></ol>
<p>Is there a permanent fix? &nbsp;Please help here, and if you find something that helps in the thread, click on the 'me too' button, it really helps.</p>

            I'm not using a laptop, so I don't have a touchpad. &nbsp;And this has been proven to be an AMD GPU problem, usually with dual monitors. &nbsp;I have messed around with many mouse settings to get rid of this bug, and only what I have shown in the OP has worked.
 &nbsp;And right now I do not have the bug, it only happens very occasionally.

            <p>Since i got windows 8 i thought i am cured from this bug. But Yesterday it was back again!</p>
<p>I now use the suggested Pointer Trails since the wiggling in the top right Corner isn't working any more as workaround (Has done it for me in Win7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think MS can handle this i think AMD has to do the fix.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I got a Dell Optiplex 7010 with a AMD Radeon 7570 HD and Windows 8.1 no problems since installing 8.1 but as stated above some days ago problems are back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also got this Problem before with a Dell Optiplex 790 under Windows 7 and Windows 8. Right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Same with the Optiplex 780 with Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our new Dell Optiplex 9020 USFF we do NOT have this problem but only because there isn't a AMD graficcard inside it and we use the onboard from the i5 CPU. ^^</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>As you have mentioned that the issue only persists on the computer which uses AMD graphic card, so this issue could have occurred if a recent update
 for AMD graphic cards&nbsp;is installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to uninstall the recently installed updates for AMD graphic cards&nbsp;and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps to remove an installed update:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Press
<strong>Windows key + R</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2) Type
<strong>wuapp</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3) Select
<strong>View install updates</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4) Click the
<strong>update</strong> that you want to remove, and then click <strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps, get back to us if you need further assistance with Windows.</span></p>

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Refer to this thread for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

<h2>            System Restore not Working</h2>
                    <p>Thank you in advance for any answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted many times with different restore points to restore my laptop, and everytime I receive the same exact answer:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.</p>
<p>Details:<br />
An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x8000ffff)<br />
<br />
You can try System Restore again and choose a different restore point. If you continue to see this error, you can try an advanced recovery method. For more information, see What is Recovery?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online and even tried using safe mode, getting the system restore from the F8 startup menu, turning off any antivirus ,&nbsp; but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>
<p>

<p>Most "security" systems (your internet security software) cause this.&nbsp; In some cases, you can get restore to work by doing it in Safe Mode -- start computer and immediately press F8 repeatedly (once per second).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A tip you might like to see:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>The default restore point space allotment in Windows 7 is 1 to 3% of drive capacity. &nbsp;</span><span>Typically, this
 does not allow for more than a few restore points.&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In almost all cases,
 the computer is using a very small proportion of the space available. That makes it very practical to raise that 3% to say 8 to 10%.&nbsp; This strategy will yield far more restore points that will give you much more flexibility in recovering a bad situation.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
To change the allotment, type create in the text box above the start globe.&nbsp; Choose Create a restore point.&nbsp; Click configure.&nbsp; Move the slide to the right as much as you see fit.&nbsp; Setting it at 50 Gigabytes will have no affect if you have a 500 Gigabyte drive
 and are only using about 100 or so, which is highly typical.</p>

<h2>            Recovery Image showing in File explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have just cloned my disk to my new SSD. The Recovery image was also cloned. It is fraction smaller than the original file, but, I believe contains the whole file. The problem is that the recovery image partition shows up in file explorer, and I get alerts
 that the partition is nearly full and I should do something about it. How do I stop getting the partition showing up in File Explorer and not get the alerts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have not selected the option, while creating recovery image so that could be the reason it is present on the File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can delete the partition by going to Disk Management.&nbsp;</span> </p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows&nbsp;Logo Key+X</span></strong>. Click on </span>
<strong>Disk Management</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Right-click on the recovery partition and select <strong>Delete Volume</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Then&nbsp;follow the onscreen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Warning:&nbsp;</span> <strong>Delete Volume </strong>option deletes every single file on the partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it’s done, you might see a <span>Delete the recovery partition from your PC</span> link on the final screen. If you want to free up drive space on your PC, select the link and then select
<span>Delete.</span> If not, select <span>Finish.</span></p>

<h3> peter5223  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge and windows apps don&#39;t remember network credentials</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a network where credentials are needed to access the internet. However windows apps and edge and internet explorer don't remember my password for my username when I try and access the internet, so I have to re-enter them each time I load a website
 (even when "Remember my credentials" is ticked). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot of credential authentication pop-up:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Could this issue be with a setting in internet options, or with the Windows credential manager? Can it be fixed by creating a new user account and replacing my current user files with fresh working ones from the new user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help</p>

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 7 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wpilcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    I've recently wiped my laptop's HDD and was in the process of reinstalling Windows 7 Home Premium. I bought the disc a while ago, used it to install windows 7 on my main desktop, and used the license key that came with the install CD to get the desktop
 activated. I intend on using the OA license key on the underside of my laptop to activate the Home Premium install on my laptop, but I just get the "This is an invalid activation key" error.<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise on what I should do? I do not see it necessary that I will have to purchase a new license key, as my laptop is now not using the license key on the underside, hence why I should be able to use it on this fresh install.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Will

<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To assist you better, kindly send us a screenshot and provide more details by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you experiencing this issue only when creating desktop shortcut icons from Google Chrome?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried creating a desktop shortcut icon using another browser? If so, are you experiencing the same issue?<br />
</li><li>Was creating a short desktop icon ever worked before?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, you may also perform a clean boot to isolate which programs or application might be causing the issue. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. For instructions, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />

    <title>Rotating videos using Microsoft Live Movie Maker &#40;rotate not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chitterbug13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rotating videos using Microsoft Live Movie Maker &#40;rotate not highlighted&#41;</h2>
                    I see many similar posts, but have not found one yet that explains how to rotate videos using Windows Live Movie Maker when the rotate left and rotate right is not highlighted.&nbsp; I am finding it under the Home tab, and am able to see my video in the time
 line.&nbsp; Any ideas would be sincerely appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
The videos I am trying to rotate are on my desktop.&nbsp; <br />
I am using Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
Service Pack 1<br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. We would need more information about the rotation feature of Movie Maker that you're having inquiries with. To start with, can you click the
<b>Rotate left</b>/<b>Rotate right&nbsp;</b>function? Does the issue happens within different videos/photos that you're using? And, when did the issue start?</div>
<div><br />
<div>We'll await for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The basic steps should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch Movie Maker.</li><li>Add the video by clicking 'Add videos and photos'.</li><li>Select the added video (from your Desktop, in your case) that should now be showing in your project storyboard/timeline.</li><li>On the Home tab, the Rotate left or Rotate right which should be enabled.</li></ol>
<p>If you are still having issues, please tell us the exact steps you are following, the file type on the video you are trying to rotate, the version of Movie Maker, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing you might want to explore, if you are just trying to rotate your video is a 3rd party tool.&nbsp; While Movie Maker can rotate video (e.g. if you took vertical/portrait video on a mobile device) it will always place it within a horizontal project frame.&nbsp;
 This will leave black on the sides.&nbsp; If you just want it rotated without the black bars, a separate tool like Freemake Video Converter can do this.&nbsp; If you do install Freemake though, be sure to choose the 'Custom' install option.</p>

<h2>            New Skype</h2>
                    I understand <strong>nothing</strong> about the new version of Skype - and it's so very frustrating!!! Howcome there's no bar in the top of the screen when having a video chat? How can I take a pic of the one I am talking to during cam - without me immediately
 sending the pic to the person? How can I _at least_ get the text field to be NOT on the left, but on the right or below in the screen? How can I make the pic of the person I talk with during cam to be smaller? Just a few of my many questions - and answers
 are no where to be found! It's so frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can anyone please help me/guide?

            Hi there!<br /><br />Many users have reported having difficulties with the new version. Maybe this could be solved soon. In the meantime, I suggest you try installing Classic Skype <a href="https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223c4e4e9e3e4ce/SkypeSetupFull.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.skype.com/5d7ac191986ccb485223...</a><br /><br />Please make sure you uninstall the current version first<br /><br />“Updating to version 8 of Skype is not mandatory at this time, but support for version 7 of Skype (also known as classic Skype) will be ending in September 2018”<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/upgrad...</a><br /><br />By the way, if you want to send feedback to Skype use this link <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="norefer

            You should install and use Classic Skype which will co-exist with Windows 10 default client. Current Windows 10 default client of Skype doesn't offer many features and functionalities and has some bugs also.. 
<br />
<br />Classic Skype download (valid only till 1-Sep-18 by then a new improved version of new Skype is expected to come) - <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Keep using Classic Skype till 1-Sep-18 and then you should switch over to new Skype which should get improved by then.

            Hi Linda, until Microsoft resolves the bugs and lack of functionality in the new Skype, it would be best to revert to the Classic Skype
<br />
<br />Uninstall that new app before reverting . . .
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

<p>I am assuming you are using windows 8?</p>
<p>Check to make sure the account you are using is this one on the pc. When you sign onto your pc do you use a Microsoft account to log in? It is likely that. Also it maybe that you need to type in your pc login credentials. For example I have a windows 8 virtual
 machine at work that is plugged into the domain, to get past the login I need to put in the domain credentials</p>

<p>Although I don't see this as being possible lol, I did read about games having issues with not being able to get to the game because of games on windows live, and the solution he had was to download Microsoft Flight from steam, then after launching that
 all other games worked.Seems far fetched but give it a go</p>

            I only purchase headsets if the one I am using stops working &amp; if the price is right. In this case, it's neither. Don't get me wrong it's probably a good headset, but the question you have to ask yourself is do you need it?

            Like StuartATrueRed, states I too only buy new if my existing set becomes defective. The main thing is do you need a headset and are you prepared to pay the price. I will pay more for a headset as I game far more than I really should so like a quality
 product. I would suggest spreading your net wide and gaining as many reviews on headsets available (and these) before making a final judgement. &nbsp;

<div>Hi Jerry,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, a shortcut to a folder should display the folder exactly as it was set up. We recommend you to run the sfc (system file checker) scan to find and fix the corrupt or missing system files on the computer. To do this, try these steps.<br />
1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</div>

<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your response. I will begin by answering your first two questions, then I will follow you recommendations.... clean boot etc.... then I will respond again with the outcomes.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1)&nbsp; I recently experienced a vigourous malware attack, picked up by Malwarebytes Pro, who deleted all the hits (several thousand at a time), but every time I logged off and logged on, I got the same warning message from Malwarebytes.....
 with, again, several thousand hits picked up on a full scan. I looked for a UK phone number for Malwarebytes ( who prefer to be contacted by email). I found what purported to be a UK phone number for Malwarebytes Pro Support, only to find, after allowing remote
 access to my PC, that they were in fact a company called "MyTechGurus". They implied that Malwarebytes Pro had passed the problem on to them. They said that they had identified over 300 errors (mainly registry errors), and wanted a payment of £99.99 to put
 things right.... In desperation I agreed and paid. They whizzed around my PC (with remote access), deleting, as far as I could follow, many items. At the end of all this, the malware problem was fixed, but I found that my Anti Virus software (ESET SECURITY)
 had been corrupted along with Outlook Express. Fortunately ESET Security resolved all those issues and, with the assistance of my credit card provider, I got my money back from MyTechGurus (much to my surprise).</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2) As I said above my Antivirus application is ESET Security.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Thank you and regards,</strong></div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carried out a "Clean Boot", as requested, and tried to install <span>WindowsXP-KB955704-x86-ENU.exe and got the same result... The update begins to download, then halts and the updatebr.inf file is invalid reappears. I then reset to Normal Boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method Two.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran Windows Update Fixit, but baulked at the stage which suggested that should I go on I would lose all
</span>System Restore points and implied that I would lose the System Restore function. However, after running Windows Update Fixit, I again tried to download
<span>WindowsXP-KB955704-x86-ENU.exe with the same result.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method Three. (<strong>Download and install X64 bit update from this link.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update for Windows XP x64 Edition (KB955704).</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; This downloaded without any problems, but I still cannot use an external portable harddrive formatted to EXFAT.&nbsp; The same unit works perfectly on a different PC running basic Windows XP.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>I have never had any problems downloading regular&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Updates, which my PC receives automatically.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>I have switched the USB sockets with no success.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the "updatebr.inf file" exactly?..... It must be associated specifically with&nbsp; the Windows XP update... KB955704-x86-ENU.exe.... as I have never experienced this problem downloading any other updates.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check to see if your headphones are set to be used as the default or if both devices are set to default.
 If so, make the speakers as default and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>Perform the task mentioned below to set speaker as default and check if the same issue occurs:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Go to Start and click on control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. In the new windows click on the tab “Playback", and check if Speaker is<span>&nbsp;</span>enable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Highlight that speaker and click on "Set as Default"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span>Thanks Graham. All my updates are 'up-to-date' (Windows, HP and third party software and drivers etc) I appreciate your suggestion but won't use the 'restore-to-an-earlier-date' option because that would undo several things I have done since the Microsoft
 app started crashing my PC. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I prefer to leave my PC the way I have it set up and not be dictated to by Microsoft who can only offer to charge me £65 to restore my PC to Factory condition and that, would involve me in two days re-installing my other 'perfectly functioning' software
 in order to fix THEIR problem software...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So far, I have heard no comment from Microsoft ...</span></p>

            Hello FaithTaylor1,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try repairing boot records, using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /SCANOS
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXMBR
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXBOOT
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD
<br />
<br />6. Close Command Prompt and see if you can boot now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi FaithTaylor1
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. This problem is resolved through point D i.e. clean install. But try other options which may work.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            Problema controle xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Olá,estou com um certo problema no meu controle de xbox 360,tenho ele faz uns 9 meses e nunca tive um problema parecido,mas o botão RT aparentemente está travado , e demora um certo tempo para eu poder apertar ele denovo,mas mesmo assim fica impossivel jogar
 um jogo de fps onde eu não consigo atirar.</p>

<p>Gostaria de saber as opiniões de vocês se é melhor eu comprar um controle novo ou se tem concerto,algo do gênero.</p>

<p>Obrigado pela atenção.</p>

<p>Mano, o mais correto a fazer, é levar a uma assistencia tecnica, não vai abrir o controle pra ver se você consegue arrumar pq isso só piora, uma ves eu fiz isso com um controle de PS2 meu que tava com um botão falhando, abri, tirei as borraxinhas e coloquei
 de novo, ai não funfava mais nada, fiquei umas 3 horas mexendo até perder a cabeça e pisar em cima dele, ai no outro dia comprei outro :)

<p>Sim,quando eu tinha um ps2 eu batia nele quando travava e voltava ao normal. Estou fazendo praticamente o mesmo no controle,tacando ele no chão para pegar o rt,mas alguém poderia explicar essa parada de botão mole? Eu sempre aperto com força os botões e
 um amigo meu nem deixa eu usar o controle dele kk mas será que foi por causa disso?</p>

<p>Cara uma coisa que eu percebi é que quando estou jogando minecraft ele roda normal , mas quando é um jogo de disco ele não pega muito bem . Por exemplo pra dar o zoom no mapa do borderlands 2 funciona normal , mas para atirar fica um bug intenso.</p>
