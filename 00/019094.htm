<p>CloudNet is a dangerous trojan. First off, what I would recommend doing is to reboot in Safe Mode. To do that, press the Shift key as you are pressing the Restart button. This will boot into safe mode. From there, you can see if Windows Defender is still
 disabled and cannot be enabled. If it is enabled, you can run a scan to see if it will be able to remove it. Another thing you could do would be to try to install some secondary scanners and scan the system. Some good options are Malwarebytes, Zemana, and
 HitmanPro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those steps don't work, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Windows key and type Task Manager.</li><li>End any suspicious tasks. (This can damage your system if you are not careful.)</li><li>Press Windows key and R at the same time. Type msconfig&nbsp;and press enter.</li><li>Remove any unknown file from the startup tab. If you don't know what the application is and/or its developer is Unknown, remove it from startup.</li><li>Press Windows key and R again. Type Regedit and press enter.</li><li>Press control and F at the same time and type in "Cloudnet."</li><li>Right-click and remove any file with "Cloudnet" in the name.</li><li>Remove all browsing data from the browser. If you don't know how to do this, you can search how to do it on that browser.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, you can hopefully run an antivirus scan and remove any leftover malicious files.</p>

<h2>            Cisco IPSEC VPN Client fails after update to 9860</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>The Cisco legacy IPSEC VPN client (v5.0.07.0440) fails to enable the virtual adapter now that I've updated to 9860.&nbsp; No issue before the update.</p>
<p>What has changed in the new build that might have affected the Cisco client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated as this is&nbsp;vital to&nbsp;our environment.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp; I had the same issue and now I sorted out... Here is what I did,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Cisco VPN stuck when it was showing "Securing Communication Channel...". While it was showing I opened Control Panel -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Network Connections. I saw 2 Cisco VPN Connections, named Local Area Connection and Local Area Connection
 2 (both having the tag Cisco Systems CPN Adaptor for 64 bit windows)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw the client was trying to establish connection using Local Area Connection 2 where as Local Area Connection was disabled. I manually disabled the Local Area Connection 2 and I would see the Attempting VPN connection was disconnected. Now, I manually
 enabled the Local Area Connection and disabled again...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp; &nbsp;Tried connecting VPN using the client and the client was establishing connection using Local Area Connection and BOOMMMM, it started working fine... So far, no problem.. Hope it helps.</p>

            Also you can't download the music from your cds on to the console something so simple which the Xbox 360 can do for a cheaper hope Microsoft solves this problem. I would like to listen to music while playing

            I'm not certain that the Xbox Music team even writes the app.&nbsp; I can tell you with a fair amount of certainty that they don't decide whether or not it can be used in the background, that would be an architectural issue with the entire Xbone OS.

<h2>            VBA&#58; identify existing &#40;already applied&#41; sort criteria&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a project where I have multiple sheets of raw data, and these sheets need to have specific sorts applied (with up to 6 levels of sort) before running different reports. That means that every time I need to change reports, I have to go back in and
 rearrange, add, and/or remove existing sort criteria. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a little searching, but haven't found a way to grab the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
current</span> sort(s) (columns, direction, and level of sort) for an existing worksheet. I know this is stored
<em>somewhere</em> because when I click the custom sort button, the last sort is shown by default. Does anyone know how to scrape this data in VBA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there I think I can assign a ribbon button to re-apply those specific sort criteria; I just haven't figured out how to get the current sort in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that one option is to just hardcode the sorts into VBA in the first place, I was just thinking this would be way more useful in other situations where I might start with manual sorts and then want to save them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any sample code or ideas on how to approach this!</p>

<h2>            Why did MS screw up the ease of use with Office.... headers used to be an easy to function now I can&#39;t get anything to look right anymore.</h2>
                    Not a question but a rant. 



Prior to Office 2007 headers had a left/middle/right feature... everything went where it was supposed to. With Office 2010 I can't even get these set up right let alone figure out via t/e where the **** it goes... 



Sorry but the new design to Office sucks... it sucks soooooo bad.

            The Header style still has a Center and Right Tab setting. It is just that a bunch of the building block headers don't have this setting. If you just go to Edit Header instead of inserting one of the canned ones, you'll have the old format you are used
 to. Otherwise, you can set the tab settings in a Header you are using.<br />

<h2>             Combining a VLookup with a SumIf</h2>
                    
<p>I have a value (Column A) on a Summary worksheet that I would like to do a vlookup for matches on work sheets in the same workbook then sum up the quantities in&nbsp;(Column B) of each worksheet on the Summary sheet...example<br />
Column A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column B<br />
1060801&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 <br />
1060802&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200<br />
1060805&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300 <br />
1060809&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600<br />
1060810&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 900<br />
etc<br />
each of the other worksheets might or might not have the number in (Column A)but if they do I want it to sum each of the quantities in (column B)on the following sheets onto the summary sheet</p>

<p><br />
With ten possible worksheets to collect data from, your solution may best be solved with a strictly<em> 'brick-by-brick'</em> approach of stacking successive SUMIF() functions. Assuming a named<em>&nbsp;Summary</em> worksheet together with ten individual worksheets
 (<em>Sheet2, Sheet2 ... Sheet11</em>) and<em>&nbsp;Summary!A2</em>&nbsp;contains 1060801&nbsp;(as above)&nbsp; then try this in Summary!B2,</p>
<p>=SUMIF(Sheet2!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet2!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet3!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet3!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet4!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet4!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet5!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet5!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet6!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet6!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet7!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet7!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet8!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet8!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet9!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet9!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet10!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet10!B:B)+SUMIF(Sheet11!A:A,Summary!A2,Sheet11!B:B)</p>
<p>That formula may seem long-winded but it is actually quite readable. A VBA solution to SUMIF() across multiple worksheets is also possible but it has some drawbacks, most notably dynamic updating.</p>

            This has happened to me also. When I now log into Facebook via internet explorer, it comes up with the old version of Facebook, which is not a good version. I will have to buy a different phone now, which is annoying, as I really did not want to do. I
 have also had a notification that Whatsapp will not be available either after December 2019.&nbsp;

<p>Yes, it is gone on Windows Phone. Like many of you, I really liked the app but over time it has not been updated and I had to fvisitFacebook via my web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad9b702a-cd54-4d1c-b60f-3da2f7c7eeff?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad9b702a-cd54-4d1c-b60f-3da2f7c7eeff?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing we can do about it but just adapt or use a new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By adapting, use IE and set it to desktop view (not mobile) or give&nbsp;<span>"<span>F</span>riendbook Lite" a try. It is not bad at all!! There is an ad at the bottom but overall it will do the trick for some.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just feel that it is wrong to dump people from using their devices as intended. I'm not sure if their site was updated if the app would still work. But if it did, why blow people away. Frankly, I'm using Facebook less and less each day. Now I won't use
 it on my device.</p>

<p>Was previously using Oulook in&nbsp;Office 2010 Beta running Windows 7.&nbsp; Have upgraded to Office 2010, and can no longer send emails from Outlook.&nbsp; Can receive emails from ISP (Freeserve) pop3 server, but get the message 'The server responded: 550 5.7.1 Message

<p>No such problems using Windows Live Mail (that I'm using as back-up), so ISP suggests the problem is with Office 2010.&nbsp; Can you suggest anyhting please?&nbsp; It is driving me mad!</p>

    <title>Unable to reinstall MSN Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to reinstall MSN Explorer</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/newmsn/forum/newmsn_browse-newmsn_browsver/does-msn-explorer-work-with-windows-10/91e981db-ab7d-426a-aceb-3c564b080955" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>When I first went to Windows 10, and turned on the IE11, my MSN Explorer works well, with not problems, on both my laptop and in desktop.&nbsp; Then, after a few updates I lost the function on my desktop all together, and I also found that I lost my IE11 history,
 etc.&nbsp; I did find a cure for the IE11 online, but could not find anything to fix the MSN.&nbsp; I then removed my MSN Explorer and tried to re-install it, but it will not re-install at all.&nbsp; Since then, my laptop has quit running MSN also.</p>
<p>I definitely would not have downloaded Windows 10 if I had know of the issues.&nbsp; I truly liked Windows 7, and it performed so much better than 10 does.&nbsp; I do know that there are always problems with updates and compatabilities, I would think that a Microsoft
 product would run properly on another Microsoft product, especially with what they charge for the yearly fee.&nbsp; Even though MSN is an outdated product, I still much prefer to use it for a lot of things.&nbsp; MSN needs to update the product or offer our money back,
 as well as let us keep our e-mail addresses, etc.&nbsp; This is truly a problem.&nbsp; Makes me wonder why I didn't purchase a MAC instead of a PC earlier this year.</p>

</p><p>1. You may simply have a slower connection to the internet than you had in Canada</p>
<p>2. Connecting to an https account should be the same in Canada and Poland</p>

    <title>KeyPress event and the Enter Key - Microsoft Community</title>

The form being used is nearly all numeric, except for a Gender field. You can press the spacebar and cycle thru, "F" or "M" letters, while keeping other hand on the numeric keyboard.  Works great unless the person uses the Enter key to move among fields. 



The Enter key moves across fields fine - unless you stop and enter something in the Gender field. Then the Enter key wipes out the character. 



Private Sub Sex_KeyPress(KeyAscii As Integer) Dim char As String     If KeyAscii = 8 Or KeyAscii = 9 Or KeyAscii = 13 Then Exit Sub     'this works for the Tab key and Backspace, but not Enter IF a character was typed 1st     Select Case KeyAscii         Case 32, 70, 77, 102, 109      'space,F,M,f,m             char = Chr(KeyAscii)             If char = " " Then                 If Me.**** = " " Or IsNull(****) Then KeyAscii = 70    'either toggle thru the spacebar hits, or                  If Left(Me.****, 1) = "M" Then KeyAscii = 70                 If Left(Me.****, 1) = "F" Then KeyAscii

            <p>My question was answered by Ken Sheridan's answer to a different question in 2012.
</p>
<p>The text box controls on a form might have an 'Enter Key Behavior' of 'default'. After 2010 version, it might have a setting of 'new line' . If it is set to 'new line' you get a 'carriage return/ line feed' and not advance to the next field.

<p>
</p><p>Where the Downloaded PDF Files are stored?</p>
<p>Why are my files disappearing?&nbsp; Where do the downloads go? How do I minimize a file?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. USING SD CARD</strong></p>
<p>There is a limitation of 50 PDF files per folder when you add a big quantity of PDFs on the SD card.

<p>
</p><p>It means that you can't read the 51st file on the same folder using the PDF reader app, so you will need to sort the files into folders containing 50 files each.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the PDF's are on the folder Documents, they will be found by the office/phone/documents, but read by the Adobe reader / PDF reader (the system will prompt a message asking on what reader you wish to open it). You can have as many files as you want there.
 No need to separate in folders of 50 files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Want to add a point here you can only send PDF via Bluetooth if its is stored in the internal memory of the phone i.e. Document folder by the user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Office&gt;places(phone document)&gt;Tap and hold on your selected PDF&gt;Select share</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make your before doing this your Bluetooth is on and paired with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: This is only if you copy PDF from PC to your phone and want to share them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi John</p>
<p>You mean the column width, the row height, or both?</p>
<p>In Table Layout/Table/Properties you can set an exact row height in the Row tab.</p>
<p>Columns are a bit trickier, unless you've used VBA to create that table and explicitly set it to a default behavior that pre-dates the "Internet behavior" that was introduced in Word 2000 and later. But...</p>
<p>In the columns tab of the same dialog box, set a "preferred width" and in the Table tab, click "Options" and deactivate the checkbox "Automatically resize to fit contents".</p>
<p>That should stabilize things.</p>

    <title>How to see the timings of a Powerpoint slide show&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berndbausch  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to see the timings of a Powerpoint slide show&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a slideshow with on-click animations and voice-over. The ultimate goal is to upload it to Brainshark, a website that specializes in hosting online presentations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure that the audio is synced in the final product, it seems that I have to convert the on-click animations to timed animations before uploading. It would be considerably easier to do that if Powerpoint showed me the timings in the slide show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A pptx file is really a zipped file structure. In there, I found a directory named tags that contains files with promising content, for example
<strong>&lt;p:tag name="TIMING" val="|22.2|5.8|6.6|5.5|10.4"/&gt;</strong>. The problem: I haven't been able to figure out which timing belongs to which slide.</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>is there a documented way to display the timings?</li><li>if not, how can I associate the timings in the tags files with the right slides?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>
