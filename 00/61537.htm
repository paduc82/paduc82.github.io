<h2>            Where to find more explosive arrows or grenade launcher ammo&#63; &#40;possible spoiler&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have beaten the game and I'm at 99%. Everything is complete except I need one relic in the Research Base. It's the one that is behind the walls that you have to blow up with an explosive arrow or grenade.</p>
<p>The problem is - I don't have anymore of either of them! I've wandered around almost the whole map again looking for more of either. I find plenty of arrows... but no explosive ones. Plenty of other ammo... but no grenades.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating! Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>i think you do blow it up (not 100% thou) but i'm sure as soon as you drop into the research base turn left and you can blow that wall up with the grenade launcher on the assault rifle, also for grenade boxes try tthe later level maps like the last 2 fast
 travel camps</p>

<p>tlmii, I had this exact same problem!@#@$ </p>
<p>I wanted to collect everything before the 'Point Of No Return" (For those who do not know, it's the ***Last camp*** before what I'm assuming is end of game. The game warns you if you want to continue. I haven't advanced yet seeing I want to have 100% on
 previously visited locations) I had the EXACT same problem, and it even is worse than you originally thought.
</p>
<p>CONFIRMED, you can blow up the metal wall in the Research Base. The problem is: YOU NEED 2 GRENADES. Be certain once you FINALLY get both grenades to launch, that your cursor is in fact RED, before you shoot the walls. (Wouldn't want to waste more time trying
 to acquire another grenade.)</p>
<p>HOW I ACQUIRED 2 GRENADES: &nbsp;I fast traveled back to Shanty Town-Helicopter Hill. First and foremost, max out all your other ammo. Then find the two patrol men, and kill them with your axe, then loot them and pray the random drop is a grenade.
</p>
<p>IF, no dice, no grenade drops, try fast traveling to another location and return back to Shanty Town-Helicopter Hill.
</p>
<p>This is how I acquired TWO grenades and was able to blow up both walls in the Research Base.
</p>
<p>But definitely, max your ammo, and kill any patrol men with your axe, and those grenades should definitely drop!</p>
<p>I was just as frustrated and searched the internet. Until it dawned on me to try this approach, luckily it worked!</p>

<p>If you have arrows just press up on the D-Pad to change ammo type, one will be explosive arrows.</p>

<p>With the help of BrainFreezed907, I managed to get one grenade. Went to Helicopter Hill and wandered around. Found two guys, killed them both with the axe. One of them dropped a grenade. The other didn't.
</p>
<p>I've tried fast traveling away and coming back, but there just don't seem to be any more guards. I can't find a person to kill ANYWHERE. I was able to blow up the first wall, but still need to blow up another to get the last collectible.</p>
<p>This is so frustrating.</p>

    <title>Can I resize one window without resizing all of them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie wilkes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I resize one window without resizing all of them</h2>
                    Is there any way I can control the resizing of windows on my desktop? For example, I open Windows Explorer and resize that window because I'm doing a complicated task that involves other open windows. Later, I open the folder that has all the shortcuts
 for my media software or my utilities, and it will have resized the same as the Windows Explorer window. I don't want that. Is there anything I can do about it?

<p>How are you resizing the window? Any window you want to resize permanently must be the last window closed.</p>
<p>Grab the corners of the window and drag it to the desired size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, some settings are global and some are not. (i.e, resizing IE will not affect Windows Explorer).</p>
<p>You might want to try one of these&nbsp;programs.&nbsp;They might do what you need.</p>

            Thanks Bruce. One of these is payware, and the other is freeware. I installed the freeware (shellfolderfix) and it is a partial solution, except it's not completely stable. Eventually windows lock up. When that happens, I can close shellfolderfix and proceed
 from there without any negative consequence. My reading on this suggests that the Windows 7 UI is limited because MS could not figure out a way around the stability issues. I doubt if 3d parties will do any better. I hope MS will work on this. Windows 7 has
 some great features. It has much better backward compatibility than I expected. It is rock stable, at least on my system. But the UI is a mess.

            YW. It is an issue with Windows 7, hence the third party programs. Maybe by SP-39 it will be resolved. ;)

            Godmode is a misnomer. It does not grant you any additional privileges. It simply shows you in a long list everything that is installed on the PC, dozens and dozens of them.

<h2>            I have to wait a month to use my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I tried to use the new "Beam" live streaming&nbsp;tool. I hit Win+G, selected the symbol that activates "Beam" and got a message saying that I need to change some settings at Xbox.com. I go to sign&nbsp;in, and it tells me that I need to verify that I am really
 me. I see what my ALT e-mail is before sending the verification and remember that I don't&nbsp;have access&nbsp;to that e-mail anymore. No problem. I go to change the ALT e-mail, then sign back into my Xbox account. Well, guess what? I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A WHOLE MONTH
 TO USE MY XBOX/MICROSOFT ACCOUNT! EXPLAIN THIS TO ME, MICROSOFT, WHY I CAN NOT USE MY XBOX FOR A WHOLE MONTH?!?!?</p>

    <title>Viva Pinata 3&#58; Do we want it&#63; What new features should it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Viva Pinata 3&#58; Do we want it&#63; What new features should it have&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Like many others, I hugely enjoyed the Viva Pinata series (excluding the Party game). It was a beautiful, euphoric and relaxing game to play, giving you the opportunity to create a green, colourful garden of paradise. I would really like them to develop
 another. I have seen many rumors that Rare are just too busy with their work on the Kinect and such to pay any more attention to the series, but I still have some hope within me. I would very much like to see the option to make an underwater garden, having
 the option to grow amazing corals and have aquatic Pinatas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Do you like the series and would you be happy if they announced it? If you had issues with it, what were the flaws and what could they fix?</p>
<p>All my fingers are crossed that the series will continue.</p>

<p>Viva Pinata was one of the very few exclusive franchises that was truly unique. I would absolutely love a new VP game. I would just pray they don't turn it into a Kinect required title. Sadly, my guess is they would.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to games than just action. Personally, I look at (an overabundance of) action as what developers put in when they can't really&nbsp;think of anything else. But I must agree with GERMIN4TOR, in that I believe&nbsp;any VP3&nbsp;would be ruined by Kinect.</p>

<p>I was never a fan of the Viva Pinata games but I can see why so many people loved them. I wouldn't say no to Viva Pinata 3, but I would prefer they waited til the new Xbox comes out so we can add it to our exclusives list.</p>

<h2>            file history Mount Points and Junctions</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 Pro and I have moved all my Documents Folders (Documents, Music, Videos, etc) to another drive. &nbsp;That drive is actually a vhd that does not have a drive letter assigned to it, it gets mounted to C:\Export\Adam . &nbsp;I have also added a few
 extra libraries that again point to locations which have junctions and mount points. &nbsp;Below I list out some of my paths and junctions.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I enable both file history or try and perform a traditional Windows 7 backup it skips all my mount points, so none of my data is actually getting backed up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems if I give a partition a drive letter windows can access that, I really want to avoid that, I don't want 12 drive letters on my machine, I just like accessing everything via \export\*</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get File History and Windows Backup to backup mount points?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Hi AdamTybor,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand how it feels when you try to use file history and backup and it doesn’t work properly as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Why are you using VHD to mount file history?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><span>Actually this isn’t possible because the VHD’s are classified as a removable drive.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;There is a better way to setup what for mounting file history.</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>Refer the links below:</span></span></div>

            Thanks for the response but I think you misunderstood my issue.
<div><br />
<div>I have properly setup file history on an external drive. &nbsp;Its a normal USB External drive partitioned with NTFS. &nbsp;File history works fine for normal things, I can see the snapshots and restore files. &nbsp;The problem is file history is skipping all of my mount
 points and not including those for monitoring.</div>
<div><br />
<div># - Why are you using VHD to mount file history?</div>
<div>I am not trying to do this, I am trying to get file history to traverse mount points during its backup process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To reproduce and give you an idea of my problem, please try the below.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Create a vhd on a non system disk: D:\MyDocuments.vhd</div>
<div>Mount the vhd to a mount point, not a drive letter: %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Export\MyDocuments</div>
<div>Create a library that includes %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Export\MyDocuments</div>
<div><br />
<div>File history will skip any files in this library, my assumption is file history is not designed to traverse mount points?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Further, I cannot use the regular Windows Backup to backup this mount point either. &nbsp;The backup configuration does not let me choose the mount point to backup, and if I just choose C:\Export the mount points within that folder are skipped.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So my question is how can use file history and windows backup to include mount points that do not have a drive letter assigned to them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Adam</div>

<br />
<div>For reference, I'm doing the same thing but have placed Users on an internal RAID array. I challenge anyone to claim that Windows thinks THAT is a removable drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It looks as though File History is simply assuming that any reparse point is a network share and refusing to follow it. My suspicion is that it works this way because the Users directory itself is littered with hardlinks, many of which end up being circular.
 ("My Documents" -&gt; %USER%\Documents, for instance.) Doing the right thing when links are involved is non-trivial, and I can easily imagine the conversation between QA and the PM when this particular bug got filed. ;-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if c:\users itself is a junction, it seems pretty risk-free to follow it. After all, you haven't started backing anything up yet.</div>

            Same problem here, I have my os on a 120gb ssd and c:\users on a larger hdd, file history will not follow the junction point and I have to give the hdd a drive letter and add d:\users\documents etc to the default libraries instead of the path from c: via
 the junction. Not un-fixable, just a real nuisance

<p>The system asks what mode to start in each time its powered on. The system will appear to boot up in normal &amp; all safe modes but after boot up is finished nothing but a blank desktop &amp; a cursor you can move works. In safe mode with command prompt there is
 no command prompt offered when the boot is complete. What can i do to get this the system to work?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -
<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode)
<br />
is to CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it -
<br />
then on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is
<br />
reached by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss
<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just
<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these
<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />

</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the
<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get
<br />
there.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore
<br />
it only has to be bootable).<br />

<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/141820-create-recovery-disc.html</span><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;Google searches where several have found different solutions :<br />
<br />
Vista Black Screen - check this one 1st<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation
<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or
<br />
three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own
<br />
Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have
<br />
to reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions.
<br />
You will need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type <br />
parenthesis or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            I found this is the problem I have, but the answer quickly and mostly morphed into a Black or Blue screen issue! There is Plenty of help with that. This issue is different. So, please stay on topic and help me! :The screen is Black both in Safe Mode and
 regular mode. I can see and wiggle the mouse, but that's it! I'm wondering if there is a command prompt version of the video-uninstall; That would be worth trying.

 where on this site can I see what games I have queued for d/l ?</p>

<p>Did you have a month/week/day of not being a LIVE member? Any missed time on being a Xbox LIVE member you'll lose the GwG games for the XB1.</p>
<p>That is not the case for the 360 though. You keep what you dl.</p>

<p>And it appears the 360'games for Novemebr are not available on One. As claimed online.

                    My Toshiba laptop keyboard is haywire. When I type, the letters pop up just about anywhere except in the string I am typing. I have to retype everything several times. Any ideas?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be several causes for this issue; I would suggest you to try few troubleshooting steps to narrow down the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Check if the issue persists in safe mode with networking </span>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boot the computer in safe mode with networking, to do this, follow the steps below.</strong></p>
<p>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
<strong>F8 key</strong> before Windows starts.</p>
<p>On the advanced boot options menu select <strong>safe mode with networking</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t persists in safe mode with networking you can infer that the issue could be driver or software related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t persist in safe mode with networking then try Method 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Put the computer in clean boot and test </strong></p>
<p>Follow <strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service. After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup
<strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Provide us with additional information. So that we can help you fix the problem on your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When this occurs, look in Task Manager to see if any process is using a high amount of process'.</span></p>

<td colspan="2"><br />
<p>Anonymous developers have labelled the current state of Xbox One’s graphics drivers “horrible” and claimed the difference between both the Xbox One and PS4 is “significant” and “obvious.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a piece about the performance differences between Microsoft and Sony’s new consoles on
<a href="http://www.edge-online.com/news/power-struggle-the-real-differences-between-ps4-and-xbox-one-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Edge</a>, a number of unnamed developers have said that while the platform holders continue to refine both systems, Sony’s is currently easier to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to one source, Microsoft has "been late on their drivers and that has been hurting them.” Another source says that the Xbox One graphics drivers are "horrible".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also being reported that the PS4’s memory reads between 40-50% faster than Xbox One, and that the PS4‘s Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is around 50% faster than Xbox One’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article says that a “platform-agnostic development build can run at around 30FPS in 1920×1080 on PS4, but it’ll run at ‘20-something’ FPS in 1600×900 on Xbox One”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All sources stress that work on the graphics drivers will continue up to and beyond the Xbox One’s release, so it’s not a done deal. For now, however, it’s reportedly a pain in the ***.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=80951633&amp;postcount=195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft has already spoken on the issue of performance</a> differences between the Xbox One and the PS4, saying “the way people are calculating the differences
 between the two machines isn't completely accurate.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s more detail <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=80951633&amp;postcount=195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
through here</a>, but it’s important to note that this latest information is direct from developers themselves who are used to actually working with the machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, for the period following the PS3’s launch, similar accusations were made about that console, with Valve most famously saying it was “too complicated to develop for.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One launches in November 22nd.</p>

<p><span><strong>PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Performance Compared by Devs</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claims the PlayStation 4 is up to 50 per cent faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>by Luke KarmaliSeptember 13, 2013A number of "high-level game development sources" have claimed the PlayStation 4 is around 50 percent faster than the Xbox One, with the difference being both "significant" and "obvious".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge conducted interviews with anonymous industry insiders, most of whom agreed that the memory reads on Sony's console are up to 50 per cent quicker, with the Arithmetic Logic Unit also being about 50 per cent faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This led a developer to claim that, without optimisation, a platform-agnostic dev build would appear around 30FPS in 1920×1080 on PlayStation 4, but at a slower "20-something" FPS in 1600×900 on Xbox One. Microsoft is aware of the issue, and the recent changes
 to the console's GPU were done in a bid to combat this. Despite this, a developer has downplayed the real effects that will be felt by the move, saying "The clock speed update is not significant, it does not change things that much...Of course, something is
 better than nothing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the launch of both consoles due to happen in a couple of months, things can still change. The graphics driver in particular has been singled out as a sticking point for both consoles, though once again sources have said Microsoft is lagging slightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One does have some advantages over the PS4 however, with one dev explaining, "Let’s say you are using procedural generation or raytracing via parametric surfaces – that is, using a lot of memory writes and not much texturing or ALU – Xbox One will
 be likely be faster."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans have been trying to deduce which console will contain more raw power since they were announced. Just last week, Microsoft's director of product planning Albert Penello argued claims that the PS4 offered better performance that the Xbox One were misguided.
 Despite the supposed gap in performance, everyone's agreed that it'll be near-impossible to notice in multiplatform launch window titles, most of which will near-identical due to time constraints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While all the developers seem to suggest the PS4 will have greater potential in terms of performance, how this translates into reality remains to be seen. From a financial stand-point for developers, it makes more sense to optimise towards the lowest common
 denominator (in this case, allegedly Xbox One) rather than create two different versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One is due to launch globally on November 22, while the PlayStation 4 will be available in North America on November 15 and in Europe on November 29.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 are both available for pre-order/reserve now at online retailers in multiple territories.</p>

<p>Hi Bill, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that the static sound or whirring sound is coming from the Surface Book's speakers. You can check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023471/surface-troubleshoot-surface-sound-and-audio-accessories?os=windows-8.1-update-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> about troubleshooting Surface sound and audio accessories. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the solutions work, I suggest that you bring your device to a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/answer-desk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store near you</a> and have it checked by one of our personnel. You may also contact our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>What user Mark Ole forgot to mention is that there is in fact a huge amount of SB2 users reporting the same "sound" you are referring to. As an owner of a SB2 two days ago (lot 1809) I too experience this "sound". After much research, because it's almost
 like MS is hiding this, I found that there's an actual term for this "sound".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's called COIL WHINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It DOES NOT emanate from your speakers (really?). If you take your 1 hour of free time to drive to a Microsoft Store, even the employee/ tech staff there will likely not know about it (don't bother, I went there yesterday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can we do about it? I would try and get a different SB2 all together. The consensus seems to differ as to how much coil whine their own SB2 is experiencing. Coil whine has been a thing even before the SB2. It happens when (usually experienced on laptops
 but some older desktops also) components push themselves to the limit, the sound it makes is a byproduct of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, if we were to exchange our SB2 for another one under our one year warranty, would we be entitled to a new SB2 or refurbed? I'm thinking about sticking with my SB2 since I've heard only horror stories others have gone through.</p>

            Thank you both.&nbsp; I really like the SB2 except for this noise when I'm quietly coding with the surface dock connected.&nbsp; I hope there is something that can be done about it.&nbsp; I, like you, don't really want to go through an exchange especially since there
 is no MS store anywhere close to where I live in Savannah, GA.
