<h2>            Nokia WS-10 Proximity Sensor</h2>
                    <p>Good morning/evening/whatever. </p>
<p>For the start I need to apologize for my bad english, I am from czech republic but I havent found this category in my language. I would like to ask something about the Nokia WS-10, very useful device. I planned to buy it but I wasn't able to download Treasure
 tag app needed for this device. I have nokia lumia 925 - lumia denim. I read this device works best with lumia black or cyan. Is there any other possibilitie to connect WS-10 with lumia denim, or even with upcoming windows 10 ? Or any other device working
 with lumia denim?</p>
<p>Thanks for your tips and hints</p>
<p>Frank M.</p>

            <p>Hi. The Treasure tag app is no longer available. However, you can still check the treasure tag settings under
<strong>App list</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Gadgets</strong>. Per checking, the Nokia Treasure Tag Mini (WS-10) is compatible to all Lumia Windows Phone 8.1 Cyan or later devices with Bluetooth 4.0 support. Since your Lumia 925 has this feature, it should work just
 fine. If you encounter any issues related to this, let us know by responding to this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the instruction provided is applicable to WP8 and Windows 10 devices.</p>

Hi Rich,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What youa re asking about is commonly referred to as cascading combo boxes.&nbsp; Here is an<a href="http://www.candace-tripp.net/download/CascadeCombo2007.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Example Database (click here)</a></p>
<p>You might n ot need all the make table queries.</p>

<p>You don't really need a subform at all for this; you can put the unbound combo boxes in a form bound to the CombFinalSignoffQRY query, in its header if the form is in continuous forms view.</p>
<p>The RowSource properties of the Region, Business&nbsp; and CreditSubStat combo boxes need to reference the next combo box up in the hierarchy e.g.</p>
<p>SELECT Region FROM Regions WHERE Country = Form!cboCountry;</p>
<p>SELECT Business FROM Businesses WHERE Region = Form!cboRegion;</p>
<p>SELECT CreditSubStat FROM CreditSubStats WHERE Business= Form!cboBusiness;</p>
<p>Note the use of the Form property in the above rather than fully referencing the form as a member of the Forms collection.&nbsp; This is possible as the controls are in the form being referenced.&nbsp; In fact the control name alone can be referenced, but I prefer
 to qualify it with the Form property to avoid any possible ambiguity as to what is being referenced.</p>
<p>Then in the AfterUpdate event procedure of cboCountry set the values of the controls lower in the hierarchy to Null and requery them, and the form:</p>
<p>Me.cboRegion = Null<br />
Me.cboBusiness = Null<br />
Me.cboCreditSubStat = Null<br />
Me.cboRegion.Requery<br />
Me.cboBusiness.Requery<br />
Me.cboCreditSubStat.Requery<br />
Me.Requery</p>
<p>Similarly in cboRegion's AfterUpdate event procedure:</p>
<p>Me.cboBusiness = Null<br />
Me.cboCreditSubStat = Null<br />
Me.cboBusiness.Requery<br />
Me.cboCreditSubStat.Requery<br />
Me.Requery</p>
<p>and in cboBusiness's AfterUpdate event procedure:</p>
<p>Me.cboCreditSubStat = Null<br />
Me.cboCreditSubStat.Requery<br />
Me.Requery</p>
<p>The CombFinalSignoffQRYquery will need to reference the controls on the form as parameters, testing each for a value or Null.&nbsp; Or, if the query is being used for other purposes you may want to create another query for the form's RecordSource in which you
 include the references to the parameters, e.g.</p>
<p>SELECT *<br />
FROM CombFinalSignoffQRYquery <br />
WHERE (Country = Forms!YourForm!cboCountry<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboCountry IS NULL)<br />
AND (Region = Forms!YourForm!cboRegion<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboRegion IS NULL)<br />
AND (Business = Forms!YourForm!cboBusiness<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboBusiness IS NULL)<br />
AND (CreditSubStat = Forms!YourForm!cboCreditSubStat<br />
OR Forms!YourForm!cboCreditSubStat IS NULL);</p>
<p>By parenthesizing each OR operation these evaluate independently of the AND operations so in effect 'optionalize' each parameter.&nbsp; Consequently as a selection is made in each combo box the form will progressively be restricted to the matching rows.</p>

            Can you please explain why and how to use the header in this line of advice given on July 03,2010 to RCCola79: "You don't really need a subform at all for this; you can put the unbound combo boxes in a form bound to the CombFinalSignoffQRY query, in its
 header if the form is in continuous forms view." It sounds like the query is bound to the header section of the form. I'm using Access 2000, which appears to put RecordSources in the form itself, not specific sections of the form, such as the header.<br />

            You only really need to use a subform if its linked to the parent form.&nbsp; Normally this would be where the parent form is based on a table related one-to-may to the subform's underlying table.&nbsp; It is possible to link a subform to an unbound parent form
 by specifying the unbound control(s) in the parent form as the LinkMasterFields property, but that would require all the relevant controls in the parent form to have values, so you can't 'drill down' through the hierarchy in the way the approach I suggested
 allows.<br />
<br />
The main points are:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The form is bound to the query, i.e. the query is its RecordSource property, and will include controls bound to the relevant columns in the query.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The query references the unbound controls in the form as parameters, and in each case tests for the parameter being NULL.&nbsp; This is how it enables you to drill down through the hierarchy, as if a parameter IS NULL this part of the WHERE clause evaluates
 to TRUE for every row, so only where a parameter has a value will it restrict the rows returned by the query.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; The controls&nbsp; cboRegion, cboBusiness and cboCreditSubStat are unbound.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; As a value is selected in each control, starting at the topmost level of the hierarchy with cboRegion then the controls representing the lower levels of the hierarchy, cboBusiness and cboCreditSubStat, are set to Null and requeried.&nbsp; This process is repeated
 as you progress down through the hierarchy.&nbsp; At each selection the form itself is progressively requeried, so as a selection is made in each combo box the form updates to show only those rows for the value selected, first the region, then the business and
 so on.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; The unbound combo box controls only need to go in the form's header if the form is in continuous forms view.&nbsp; This is simply to keep them visible at the top as you scroll down through the records.&nbsp; If the form is in single form view then the unbound controls
 can just as well go in its detail section and be positioned anywhere you like in the section.<br />

            <p>Ken, </p>
<p>Thank you for posting this reply, it is exactly what I am trying to do! I have 3 combo boxes on Form4: cboInstitutionName, cboAwardLevel, and cboDegreeNumber.</p>
<p>The first unbound combo box effectively filters my query (after running a simple 'on click' macro that saves the form, closes the query, and opens (aka runs) the query). I have connected the Form in general to the Query--the record source is the query. Also,
 under the query criteria I have connected it to the form with the following: [Forms]![Form4]![cboinstitutionName], [Forms]![Form4]![cboawardlevel],[Forms]![Form4]![cbodegreenumber], for each of the respective fields in the drop down menu.</p>
<p>However, when I attempt to use multiple combo boxes, my form shuts down (removes all combo boxes and other objects) because the filters are 'too exclusive' the query returns blank. My selections were represented in the data and therefore should have returned
 results on the query. I am unable to get my form back in working order and must start over on a new (or recently saved version of the form). If you have any suggestions on returning my form to working order that would be super helpful! I have tried deleting
 the criteria from the query and refreshing the form, but that did not work.</p>
<p>I thought the reason my combox boxes were not working in unison may be because the combo boxes are not linked, hence my interest in your instructions (although, eventually I would have wanted thecascading combo boxes to filter based on the one prior's selection).When
 I try to use the second combo box, I receive an error message stating 'sytax error (missing operator) in query expression '[Award Level].[Valuelable] Where InstitutionName = Forms!CboInstitutionName'</p>
<p>My source rows state:</p>
<p>SELECT DISTINCT [University List].[InstitutionName] FROM [University List] ORDER BY [University List].[InstitutionName];</p>
<p>SELECT DISTINCT [Award Level].[valuelabel] FROM [Award Level] ORDER BY [Award Level].[Valuelabel] WHERE InstitutionName = Forms!CboInstitutionName;</p>
<p>and my control source is blank--&gt;hence the "unbound" combo box</p>
<p>Any assitance would be really helpful! I am a newbie in Access and VBA. I also have no SQL experience</p>

            You have the WHERE and ORDER BY clauses the wrong way round in the second RowSource property:<br />
<br />
SELECT DISTINCT [Award Level].[valuelabel] FROM [Award Level] ORDER BY [Award Level].[Valuelabel] WHERE InstitutionName = Forms!CboInstitutionName;<br />
<br />
It should be:<br />
<br />
SELECT DISTINCT [Award Level].[valuelabel] FROM [Award Level] WHERE InstitutionName = Forms!CboInstitutionName ORDER BY [Award Level].[Valuelabel];<br />
<br />
However I'm not sure what the following means:<br />
<br />
<i>'The first unbound combo box effectively filters my query (after running a simple 'on click' macro that saves the form, closes the query, and opens (aka runs) the query).'</i><br />
<br />
I assume that the query referred to here is referencing the controls as parameters.&nbsp; The query should be the form's RecordSource, so there is no need to open it independently.&nbsp; All you need to do is requery the form in the AfterUpdate event procedure of each
 of the unbound combo boxes.&nbsp; Since my above post I have added a form which does this to my demo of correlated combo boxes, ComboDemo2K.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

The form, named frmDrillDown, is opened with the last button on the opening form, labelled:&nbsp;
<i>Open form for 'drilling down' through hierarchies to return records.</i><br />

<p>I was amazed that you actually responded, I&nbsp;figured it was a really long shot since the original post was from 2010, so first and foremost: Thank you for responding!
</p>
<p>I reviewed the DB you posted, mine is set up a little differently, it looks more like the sample here:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turns out, my combo boxes property had Limit to List set to Yes, and that is why I couldn't get the query to run. After I fixed the query, I was able to successfully implement the cascading combo boxes by following your instructions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For anyone else out there reading this, when working with Forms connected to a query, in order to get cascading combo boxes to work it is easiest (in my experience)&nbsp;to have a&nbsp;table where the lists in the combo boxes are all together&nbsp;in&nbsp;one place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ken, thanks again for your help!</p>

<h2>            Table borders when table covers several pages</h2>
                    <p>Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a table that spans several pages. It has a number of cell borders included. In the main, the cell borders are for the top and side of each cell. All works well, except when the text in a cell crosses on to the next page. When this happens,
 there is now a horizontal border included at the top of the next page which I don't want as it is splitting a cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find a way to remove this line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple way to do this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have set paragraph format to 'Keep lines together' but this doesn't seem to be happening either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me out here.</p>

            I doubt that your problem is Windows 8 related. I would check the file extension to ensure that is .xls, then be sure that it isn't in zipped state and that it's Read-Only or Hidden properties are not checked. [Right-click on the file name and click on
 Properties.]<br />

    <title>Custom Task Pane - PowerPoint Window Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#225;ximo marques  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Task Pane - PowerPoint Window Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed an oddity while trying to track a Custom Task Pane among Powerpoint windows in my Addin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built an Addin for PowerPoint and it uses Custom Task Panes, and my intention was so that every presentation window would have its own instance of the Task Pane, which is very easy to do, once Addin.CustomTaskPanes.Add allows me to associate a panel to
 one specific window. I tried then to make a toogle button for my Custom Task Pane, associated to its visibility. I understand that the Ribbon has a single instance at runtime, and runs in Application level, instead of Document level, hence I needed to sync
 the Checked property of the toogle button to the visibility of the Custom Task Pane on that window once the window became active. Ok. And this is where I noticed an oddity:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Private Sub CTPs_SyncVisibility(Pres As PowerPoint.Presentation, Wn As PowerPoint.DocumentWindow)</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'This handles Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.WindowActivate</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Wn is a reference to the just activated window</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each ctp As CustomTaskPane In Globals.PPTAddIn.CustomTaskPanes</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If ctp.Window Is Wn Then</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Change the toogle button's Checked Property</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; End Sub</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When multiple presentation windows are open, each with its own taskpane associated, the line &gt;
<strong>If ctp.Window Is Wn Then </strong>&lt;will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
aways return true,</span> for every taskpane, implying that every taskpane is associated to the window that became active, making it impossible to determine in which window a given taspane is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through some exploration I noticed a couple of things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. It's not a problem with Powerpoint Windows direct comparison, once the folowing lines of code return the expected result:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Assume here that .Windows(1) is the actual active window</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim asw = Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.ActiveWindow Is Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.Windows(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; '-&gt; False</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim asw2 = Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.ActiveWindow Is Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.Windows(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; '-&gt; True</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim asw3 = Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.Windows(1) Is Globals.PPTAddIn.Application.Windows(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'-&gt; False</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It doesn't seem to be a problem related to the property CustomTaskPane.Window once I tried to store the window reference in other property, like .Tag, during the instanciation of the Taskpanes, and it still yields the same weird result of True for every
 Taskpane regardless of in which window it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, my questions are: Is this a well known misbehavior of the Custom Task Pane? Does this happens somehow beacuse it is a COM object (the window)? Am I plain dumb and this is not the way it's supposed to be done? And lastly, which method should I use to
 track down in which window is my taskpane?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>M√°ximo</p>

</p><p>I did look over at Technet to see where my question would best fit, but it seems to me that every forum over there is centered around IT issues, not developers. In Office's section of the forums, in fact, I couldn't find a single question about Addins that
 had a similar problem to mine. Are you positive there is where I should post my question? It seems to me I would receive yet again another answer redirecting me to some other place.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t logon to BankofAmerica online banking or Southwest Rapid Rewards anymore with IE.</h2>
                    I enabled cookies for those sites and compatibility view for those sites. I put in user and password and then it just resets to previous log on screen. Google Chrome works as expected.&nbsp; I was having some problems before installing IE9.&nbsp; For example certain
 functions would not work on BofA site and I would often get errors requiring a restart of IE.&nbsp; Now it appears that some links are supposed to run a Java script but if I hover over the link it shows java void(0) and ofcourse the link doesn't do anything. I
 went to the java website and verify that I have the&nbsp;latest java installed.

<p>Hi DorisMcCulloch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most possible reason is related to your credential.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Please check the status bar at right bottom of the window. Does it show<span style="font-weight: bold"> connected to Microsoft Exchange</span> or an error. Click it and check if Outlook
 prompts to ask for your credential, re-enter your credential and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>2)If method 1) doesn't work, please try to manually clear cached Outlook credential on your PC: Exit Outlook&gt;type
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above methods fails, I need gather more information to better help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Please download
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OffCAT</a> and run an analysis of your Outlook, then please export and send the report back to me in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">PM (Private Message)</a>, I will further check it for you.</p>
<p>2)May I ask if you have MFA enabled for your account? For example, you need to provide second authentication like text code, phone call, etc. except your own credential.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

            That's exactly the answer I was trying to provide. If you click on the equation
<em>frame</em>, then using the arrow keys will move the equation on the program screen. Instead, click on the equation itself, instead of the frame around it. It's working here, but it may take some playing around to find the right edit mode.

 work.&nbsp; Thank you for trying to help me.

            <p>When you first click on the equation, the grey highlight indicates the entire equation is selected. The cursor is blinking inside the equation frame (the dotted line with handles):</p>

<p>
</p><p>Pressing on the right or left arrow key to move the cursor to the space between the equation and its frame. When you get to that spot, the equation is deselected and the grey highlight disappears:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using the left and right arrow keys, move the cursor back into the equation. When the cursor is beside the character you want to color, hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> and press the arrow key one more time. The grey highlighting indicates the character is selected. Then use the Font Color dropdown to select a new color for the character.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your issue regarding that kind of message or error message which is (we're having trouble connecting to). Basically it occurs because the provider's web site is unavailable for temporary period of time. This might be due to the website maintenance,
 network connectivity issues and even high traffic volumes. But in order for us to help you to fix the issue. Check the this thread:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/opreview-opemail/outlook-viewing-pane-error-message-we-are-having/8be5aa1d-6966-4bfc-ad6f-eb21ba70e789">
Outlook viewing pane error message" We are having trouble connecting to (my e-mailaddress). Sweeping or moving messages might take a while</a>. Look for Harshavardhan Rathod answer. It contains troubleshooting steps to fix the issue.</p>

            Hi Phillip,&nbsp; This issue&nbsp;with the pane moving up &amp; down on Hotmail is not something that happened just recently I've been living with it like this for over 6 months and have grown pretty tired of seeing it this way.&nbsp; I'll look into some of Harshavardhan
 Rathod's&nbsp;methods&nbsp;but not all of them.&nbsp; I see from reading Gary's response to him that by following all of his ideas on fixing the problem has led to partially crippling his inbox &amp; forwarding capabilities. I also failed to mention that I scheduled an appointment
 back then with a representative at the Microsoft store here in Honolulu and they told me that there where numerous reports of people experiencing the same problem and that Microsoft would most likely have it corrected with a software update.&nbsp; To date nothing
 has changed.

<h2>            Unable to Sync after WM 6.1 upgrade</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Verizon &nbsp;X5800 that I just upgraded to Windows Mobile 6.1.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it will no longer sync (though it does connect) with my Vista computer.&nbsp; The Sync Center tells me:</p>
<p>Synchronization could not be completed. See <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LnkId=72544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LnkId=72544</a></p>
<p>And the phone either just gets into an endless loop synchronizing or it says The desktop could not be reached with a support code of 0X80072EE7.</p>
<p>I've tried deleting the relationship and rebooting on both sides.&nbsp; Verizon says it's a Windows problem and then gave me a Palm support number to call!</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks,</p>
<p>Connie</p>

    <title>How to Group By a Date without also grouping by time in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> verum seeker  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Group By a Date without also grouping by time in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I would like to Group By two different fields. &nbsp;The first field I would like to Group By is the date received. &nbsp;But only the date, not both the date and the time. &nbsp;Obviously, it makes no sense to Group By both date and time (Sort By = makes sense; Group
 By = makes no sense). &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>Then within date, I would like to Group By a second field (like sender, but could be some other second group-by field). &nbsp; This seems like a super basic capability and I am therefore thinking that I must just be missing something simple.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you tell me how to do this in Outlook 2013?</div>

    <title>vba Worksheet_Change, sheet freezes when copy&#47;paste with mouse, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hgood  say:</h3>
<h2>            vba Worksheet_Change, sheet freezes when copy&#47;paste with mouse, does NOT freeze when copy&#47;paste with Ctrl C, V</h2>
                    Hi, my VBA code for a budget spreadsheet has a Worksheet_Change procedure with Intersect and target as part of it.<br />
<br />
When users copy and paste a cell using their mouse to Edit, Copy then Edit, Paste, the spreadsheet freezes. But if they use the Ctrl C and V to copy paste, it does
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> freeze.&nbsp; When I step thru the code in both scenarios, it follows the same path thru the Ifs and End Ifs, etc.&nbsp; Yet one way freezes and the other doesn't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In these scenarios the copy paste actions are not within the target, so the two Ifs solve to 'Nothing', so most of the code is skipped. Yet it still freezes when using the mouse.<br />
<br />
When it freezes, using the mouse, the only way I can get out of it (other than closing Excel), is to hit F5 GoTo, then choose a reference that is on another sheet. It will change to that sheet. I can then come back to the first sheet and continue as normal.<br />
<br />
I can't figure out how to fix this. Would sure appreciate some help!<br />

            <p>Bill / Harold,</p>
<p>I think I have got to the bottom of this one - there are 3 issues here...</p>
<p>1. As noted above the maro leaves ScreenUpdating set to false</p>
<p>2. From the tests I have done, it looks like&nbsp;Excel will usually reset ScreenUpdating to TRUE all on its own - unless there are a lot of changes made to the sheet - e.g. delete a row or two</p>
<p>3. Harold's Change macro does not appear to have protection against being re-entered if the marco itself changes the content of the sheet...</p>
<p>Try this macro...</p>
<p><strong>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
'<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Range("B1").Value = Range("B1").Value + 1<br />
End Sub</strong></p>
<p>If you change ONE cell on the sheet which has this Change macro, the count will (unexpectedly) be 96 or 97.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the screen freezes, sometimes it does not.</p>
<p>I suggest that this is due to the macro being called again (and again) when the value in B1 is incremented by the Chnage macro.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere inside Excel this goes up a loop and then decides that it has done enough /&nbsp; its job&nbsp;and it exits.&nbsp; Usually ScreenUpdating
 is TRUE on exit, other times it is not.&nbsp; If you try to test the value of this in the immediate window it is reported to be false and then (all on its own) flips to TRUE (I kid you&nbsp;not).</p>
<p>The behaviour is variable - on one test, deleteing a row generated an "Out of stack space" error.</p>
<p>Conclusions...</p>
<p>1. If you want to change cell vaules on the sheet to which the Change maro belongs, you MUST make the code non-renterant - see below</p>
<p>2. If you 'manage' system parameters such as ScreenUpdating on entry to a maro, you must remember to set them back to something sensible on exit.</p>
<p>3. When the screen was left frozen I suspect that a 'quiet' stack over flow occurred leaving ScreenUpdating set to FALSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggested full solution... code to be placed&nbsp; on the worksheet object</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>'Control flag variable that exists outside of the macro to inhibit re-entry</strong></p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC blnChangeActive as boolean</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Look to see if this code is already active, if it is go away!<br />
if blnChangeActive then Exit Sub</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Set the macro is active flag so that changes made to this sheet in this macro do not<br />
</strong><strong>'cause this macro to run again<br />
blnChangeActive = true</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Inhibit screen updating to make the code run faster and avoid screen flashing<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False</strong></p>
<p><strong>'<br />
' This is where the Change macro code goes... whatever you want to do!<br />
'</strong></p>
<p><strong>'For example my cell value incrementer...<br />
Range("B1").Value = Range("B1").Value + 1<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Enable screen updating again<br />
&nbsp;Application.ScreenUpdating&nbsp; = True<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>'Remove the reentry lock<br />
blnChangeActive = false</strong></p>
<p><strong>End Sub</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above macro results in the value of B1 being increment by only 1 - as might have been expected!</p>
<p>HTH and fully answers the problem.</p>
