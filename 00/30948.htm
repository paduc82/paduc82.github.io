<h2>            Unable to Prevent Disk Defragmenter &#40;dfrgntfs.exe&#41; From Running During System Idle</h2>
                    
<p>How do I prevent the Windows Disk Defragmenter tool (dfrgntfs.exe) from automatically launching when my Windows Vista machine is idle?&nbsp; I defrag my hard drive with IObit's Smart Defrag software and don't want the Windows defrag utility constantly re-arranging
 files on my hard drive after I've optimized the file placement with Smart Defrag.</p>
<p>I checked the Windows Disk Defragmenter tool (Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Disk Defragmenter) and scheduled defrags are disabled (i.e., the "Run on a schedule" check box is disabled).&nbsp; I checked the Windows Task Scheduler (Start |
 Administrative Tools | Task Scheduler | Task Scheduler Library | Microsoft | Windows | Defrag ) and the ScheduledDefrag task also appears as disabled here.</p>
<p>My hard drive is formatted&nbsp;with the&nbsp;NTFS file system and the Norton Tasks&nbsp;window of my Norton Internet Security 2010 software&nbsp;indicates that dfrgntfs.exe starts running about 30 minutes after my system goes into idle mode.&nbsp; Is there some other Windows tool
 running in the background (e.g., the Windows Search Indexing) that might be automatically triggering the Windows Disk Defragmenter?</p>
<p>I'm hoping that there is a simple configuration change or registry edit that will stop the Windows Disk Defragmenter from running during idle but still allow me to run a manual defrag if I wish to do so.</p>

<p>Lorien - One:</p>
<p>Thanks for the prompt response.&nbsp; I'm failry certain that the ScheduledDefrag task in Windows Task Scheduler is not the culprit.&nbsp; This task (and its trigger) shows as disabled and the task history shows that a scheduled defrag last ran on my system over 2
 years ago, which is about the time I disabled the "Run on a schedule" check box in the Windows Disk Defragmenter tool.</p>
<p>I found a post today in the My Digital Life Forums (<a href="http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/1910-DfrgNtfs.exe-in-Vista-SP1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/1910-DfrgNtfs.exe-in-Vista-SP1</a>) suggesting that there is a Vista boot optimization
 process that runs dfrgntfs.exe every time you re-boot your system, even if scheduled defrags are disabled.&nbsp; One response recommends the following to stop dfrgntfs.exe from running after each re-boot:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open the Windows Registry (Run &gt; regedit)<br />
2.&nbsp; Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Dfrg\BootOptimizeFunction<br />
3.&nbsp; Change the "Enable" key from Y to N</p>
<p>I found some information on the <strong>Boot Optimize Function</strong> on the Microsoft TechNet Library web site (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778290(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778290(WS.10).aspx</a>)
 which states that "Windows automatically optimizes the file location for boot optimization. This optimization occurs automatically if the system is idle for 10 minutes. Boot optimization improves startup time by locating startup files in contiguous clusters
 on the volume, reducing the movement of the disk head when reading the volume".&nbsp; I have no idea if third-party defraggers such as IObit's Smart Defrag or Piriform's Defraggler&nbsp;can optimize placement of these startup Windows system files or if the Boot Optimize
 Function provides some additional benefit to system performance.</p>
<p>I don't know if the Boot Optimize Function is actually the cause of my background unscheduled defrags but it's the only reasonable explanation I've been able to find.&nbsp; When these "silent" defrags happen on my system they take up over 50% of my CPU and will
 run for more than an hour (or until my system is no longer idle).&nbsp; I've had problems with my system freezing after it goes into idle mode (i.e., moving my mouse or using the keyboard has no effect and I have to do a hard re-boot&nbsp;by powering off my laptop)
 and I'm beginning to suspect that that if this unscheduled defrag runs at the same time as other background tasks (e.g., my Norton Anti-Virus daily QuickScan) that a page conflict or lack of system resources could freeze my computer.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who can confirm that the Boot Optimize Function will trigger unscheduled defrags when Vista is idle or knows if the Boot Optimize Function is of any real benefit if you use a third-party defragger.</p>

<h2>            How do I install Windows 7 onto a a new hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to replace my hard drive because my current one is failing. I have&nbsp;purchased a new hard drive to replace it and I do not know how to reinstall Windows 7 onto it. I have a external hard drive that has 81gb of backup data on it. The only thing I don't
 know how to do is to reinstall Windows 7 back onto the new hard drive, and retrieving the data from the backup from the external hard drive. I have the product key to Windows 7, but I do not have a CD or USB to install Windows 7 onto the new hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <em><strong>New Hard Drive</strong></em>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>March 28, 2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.
<strong>IF YOU WANT WINDOWS 10, stop reading this now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You <strong>may </strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very
 technical or difficult for most people.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download and store the following to stand-alone Windows Updates on a USB stick: KB3083710 and KB3102810. Download the correct 32 or 64 bit versions to match your product key.</li><li>Install the new hard drive.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers.</li><li>When the installer asks you where to store the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions except for the OEM partition, if one is there.</li><li>Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1)"><em><strong>BEFORE</strong>
</em></span>your computer actually restarts, disconnect the Internet connection.&nbsp; Timing is critical here.</li><li>Right click on Computer and choose Properties.&nbsp; See if your installation is SP1.&nbsp; If not, Proceed to steps 15, 16, and 17 below.&nbsp; Then return to step 10, once you have installed SP1.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.&nbsp; <em>No internet connection available to the computer.&nbsp; Restart</em></li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.&nbsp; <em>No internet connection available to the computer.&nbsp; Restart</em></li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING</li><li>Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>Choose Check for updates. This is going to take a long time, like many hours, so do not get impatient and stop this.&nbsp; If yours is a lap top, shut off hibernation and sleep functions, plug it in and go a
 working and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type device in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose device manager from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; If the Network driver is missing
 (or has a yellow exclamation point, you are going to have to find that driver using a different working computer.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have
 installed all of them or nearly.</li><li>Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type defragment in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till it completes all passes.</li><li>Check Device Manager once again.&nbsp; If any drivers are missing you need to find them now.&nbsp; Do NOT use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.&nbsp; Use only your computer manufacturer’s support site as a
 source of drivers.</li><li>Next, you will need to take steps to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; First step is to change the Windows Update setting to NEVER.</li></ol>
<p><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

            HI Minahil.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try these steps for Troubleshooting Cortana:  
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/fix-cortana-4151935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/fix-cortana-4151935</a>

<br /><a href="https://equalentry.com/using-cortana-and-speech-recognition-together-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://equalentry.com/using-cortana-and-speech...</a>
<br />
<br />Usually one of those will do it.  If not then there may be problems with your WIndows install.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Constant Blue Screens</h2>
                    <p>I have been having blue screens that say "kernel security check failure" and a few other types. The The one that happens all the time is the kernel one. I've switched cpus, removed the gpu, and changed ram slots and the problem persists. I used the windows
 memory diagnostics tool and came up with no issue. There was a test ran to check the hard drive for errors and it came back saying there were none. Scanning for viruses comes up clean. I thought the issue might be the motherboard; on startup the screen was
 black with the number 99 on the bottom right hand corner. Got help with that and it works now; I just removed the battery for a minute. I went through a suggestion and it said to gather the dmp files, system info, and system specs for more help. Here are the

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your zip file contains 12 .dmp files, so I'll deal with them in reverse order starting with DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That'll give you the opportunity to deal with them as I go through them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL is being caused by an MSI driver called <strong>
e22w8x64.sys</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>MSI is apparently working on a fix for it and you'll find details here: <a href="https://service.msicomputer.com/msi_user/support/techfaqdetail.aspx?formid=3054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>It crashed again saying Kernel Security Check Failure. Not sure why. Maybe because I added the graphics card? Seems like it crashed more often with the graphics card. It's an msi gtx 970. Maybe it doesn't go well with an apu?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past I tried the driver verifier. It caused the system to crash as it should have, but, I don't know what it was supposed to tell me or where I was supposed to look.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mildred, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you need help to be able to send a photo attachment using Windows Live Mail application. Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will endeavor to assist you as best as I can and hopefully we can get this issue fixed for
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that if you will click the <strong>Attach file </strong>button, it will only allow you to send attachments to your friends such as photos, Word, Excel, pdf files, etc. However, if you will select the
<strong>Photo album </strong>option when sending photos, it will automatically be uploaded to your OneDrive account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to send just a pure photo attachment on your email without uploading them automatically to your OneDrive, just select the
<strong>Attach file </strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know. </p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's a very common situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the message window opens with the pictures arranged in a photo album, click on one of them. The&nbsp;<em>Format
</em>tab becomes visible at the top of the window: click on it and then on the paperclip. This will attach the picture to the message in the conventional way.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering. &nbsp;I do know that, but I want the old option of choosing whether to attach a photo normal size, medium or small.</p>
<p>(I certainly do not want the other option of using an "album" and OneDrive account.)</p>

            <p>Hi Mildred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming back. You may actually attach a photo to your email then choose its size after. You can do this by clicking on
<strong>Single photo</strong> and select the photo that you want to add. It will then open a new tab which is
<strong>Format</strong> and it will give you the option for the size as shown below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please let us know if you have other questions.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 LTSB Start menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I installed Windows 10 Enterprise&nbsp;LTSB. And I know that there is no metro apps.</p>
<p>But Start menu always will be so big?? May I make it smaller, without area where metro icons was?</p>
<p>It would be great to minimize start menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> bruce, gibsonia pa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t create a restore point anymore in Win7</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium and can no longer create a restore point or access System Restore.&nbsp; I cannot use the Windows Installer to install new software, because it first tries to create a restore point.&nbsp; Due to this, Windows updates will not install.&nbsp;
 I receive no error messages.&nbsp; System Restore simply hangs and nothing happens.&nbsp; I need to use Task Manager to stop the process.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling Norton 360 Tamper Protection; that did not help.</p>
<p>Another note:&nbsp; My Sytem Protection Properties Tab dialog box shows no drives being protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;The System Restore button is grayed out and inaccessible.</p>
<p>What happened?&nbsp; Is my installation of Windows 7 fried?&nbsp; I would love not to have to reinstall everything.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Sounds like malicious code has infiltrated your system.</p>
<strong><span>
<p>Credit SpiritX [MVP]</p>
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do</p>
<p>a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running</p>
<p>resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the</p>
<p>cause.</p>
<p>No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy</p>
<p>to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So</p>
<p>its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an</p>
<p>extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.</p>
<p>These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run</p>
<p>them in regular Windows when you can.</p>
<p>Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.</p>
<p>(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)</p>

<p>Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool</p>

            Old post I know but I've had this problem on several of my removeable HDs and finally I managed to remove the 'System Volume Information' folder:<br />
<br />
DO NOT DO THIS ON YOUR C: OR YOUR WINDOWS HARDDRIVE!!!!!<br />
<br />
Right click desktop and click [New-&gt;Shortcut]<br />
Write: cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Click [Next] then [Finish]<br />
<br />
Right click the cmd.exe icon and click 'Run As Adminstrator"<br />
Now select the external hard drive (F: in my case)<br />
<br />
C:\&gt;f:<br />
<br />
Now do the following (you can copy paste):<br />
F:\&gt;attrib -s -h /S /D<br />
F:\&gt;attrib -r /S /D<br />
F:\&gt;rd "System Volume Information" /S<br />
System Volume Information, Are you sure (Y/N)? y<br />
<br />
And you're DONE ;-)

<p>Hi sephera,</p>
<p>WSCAPI.dll is a system file for Windows Security Center API. It seems to be that the file has got corrupted so we are getting this error message. I would suggest you to run the System File Checker to scan your system for corrupt system files and let Windows
 replace the corrupt files with Windows version. To do this, follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>1. Click the Start button.<br />
2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories.<br />
3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option.<br />
4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option.<br />
5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue&nbsp; button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.<br />
6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter.<br />
7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'.<br />
8. Be patient because the scan may take some time.<br />
9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue.<br />
10.If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".<br />
11.After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.<br />
<br />

Then try to install McAfee on your computer and check if it’s getting installed properly.</p>

                    <p>Like i said in a title up there, UFC Undisputed 3 should be added on Xbox One backwards&nbsp;compatibility. This game is really amazing, even after a long time that game was made. You have to believe me. I'm fighting for this game for a long time, so please comment and let this game be on Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually Xbox Ideas is no longer accepting any votes or posts regarding backwards compatible games and has been that way for a while now. Any posts regarding backwards compatible requests will more than likely be removed. The Xbox team also stated there
 won't be anymore backwards compatible titles released until early 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best way to get your ideas heard is to post on the developers/publishers community website or social media accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we shouldn't be reviving year old threads and instead we encourage everyone to create new discussions. I will now be locking this thread but feel free to create your own threads and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

                    <p>I found locked and closed threads on this EXACT topic back in 2016 which I cannot view to see if my question is answered, so I'm left to simply repost in hopes that someone knows the fix.&nbsp; And why it hasn't been universally fixed already at 2019 is interesting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 and a Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp; All firmware and Windows, and Microsoft updates are taken care of regularly. for all devices, OS and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use my Wireless Display Adapter to connect my tablet to any device (TV, LCD Projector, doesn't matter...) All my programs seem to work just fine, including my internet, email, and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my other Office 365 programs work just fine, until I get to PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in edit mode of PowerPoint the display still shows on the second device, until I select to SHOW PRESENTATION.&nbsp; Once I'm in display mode, within seconds the tablet will flash and the connection is lost and my screen is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This program is the VERY PROGRAM I need to use the Wireless Display Adapter for.&nbsp; And I make presentation all the time.&nbsp; This is beyond ridiculous and I've been trying to get a straight answer off and on to solve it more months, almost a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step is to get rid of everything, I'm that frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have video to show the exact things happening on the tablet and display... but I have no where to submit it.</p>
<p>

This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory<br />
sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<h2>            Web pages will not load after upgrading to Windows 8</h2>
                    Help anyone who can. &nbsp;I upgraded my wife's Dell Inspirion laptop from Win 7 to Win 8. &nbsp;Install seemed to go well. &nbsp;restarted several times with no problem. &nbsp;After the upgrade was complete, did an update on my ESET security software which required a reboot.
 &nbsp;After that reboot, the laptop shows connected to the network and shows internet connectivity. &nbsp;I can ping google from a command prompt, so I know it is connected, but no web page will load. &nbsp;This occurs in both IE and Chrome. &nbsp;It sits there with the spinning
 wheel showing that it is "loading", but will never load. &nbsp;I have looked at everything I can think of to look at with my limited computer knowledge. &nbsp;what should I try next?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities. From your problem description I understand that after updating your security software you are unable to browse. Please correct me if I have misunderstood.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Stephen</span></b><b><span>,</span></b><span> </span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode with Networking and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on settings, more pc settings and then general.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down to advanced startup, click restart now.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on troubleshoot, advanced options, Windows Startup Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click restart, select safe mode with networking and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode with Networking then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean
 boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span> </span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: System Restore</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>Press <b>‘Windows Key + r’</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>In the run window type <b>‘rstrui.exe’ </b>
and click on OK</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Click on <b>next</b> in the System Restore windows</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Now choose the restore point of your choice, and try to restore your computer back to earlier state.</span></p>

            I found another thread that was similar to this one and had a solution similar to
<b>Method 1</b> described by Wasim. But, it directed me to do a "refresh" in the general settings. What that did was make sure that all necessary files were installed and it uninstalls any other programs on your desktop. This resolved the conflict that was
 preventing the browser from working. The downside is that you then have to go and reinstall your programs. There is a file where all the removed program names are saved on your desktop though, so you don't have to remember what you had installed. The refresh
 process saves a list of all of those programs on your desktop.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the refresh worked for me. It's still annoying that I had to go through this process just to browse the Web. Also, if you don't have another device to view the Web, you'd never find the solution.
<br />
<br />
This seems to be a fairly common issue so far, they should put these solutions in the help and troubleshooting. Because those features through Win 8 would connect, but didn't have these solutions.

            <p>I just got a new Acer with Windows 8 and touchscreen &amp; am struggling with the lack of options given on the programs and the lack of control that I am use to with Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the same problem getting pages to load on IE.&nbsp; The title bar displays the page and I am able to google/bing/etc with no problems.&nbsp; In fact, this page came up quickly while the previous site I tried going to from google results did not load at
 all.&nbsp; I had this problem for the first time last night and worked around it by googling the actual website and bypassing the site's homepage.&nbsp;

<p>I have to use a Verizon mifi hotspot to get online which has limited data (3 gigs for $60!) so I don't want to waste a lot of money having to reinstall the programs (half of which won't download/update from the windows store anyways).&nbsp; Is there anything
 else I can do???</p>

            I have a Win8 computer--an HP Envy that I bought in mid-February. Up until yesterday, I haven't had a problem with it. Then, it installed an update and I haven't been able to use the internet or open Norton Security since. I'm connected to the internet,
 but I can't get IE to open and no pages in Google Chrome will load. The first few times Chrome wouldn't load, it said I wasn't signed into my profile and that Norton Identity Safe had crashed. So I disabled the Norton extension and signed into my profile.
 I got the little icons next to all my bookmarks back and was able to partially load Facebook after I forced a shut down (since I tried to restart and after 15 minutes, it was just loading). I'm REALLY frustrated. I just want to watch some tv on my computer
 before bed and check my Facebook. I've disabled all my Chrome extensions, I've deleted my browser cache from the beginning of time. I tried to uninstall the previous Win8 update, but it won't let me. I've tried to run scf, and it tells me I'm

            <p>I don't know about anybody else, but my problem resolved itself on it's own, somehow. I think it must have been a Windows update; after about 2.5 weeks, I got all use back on everything.
