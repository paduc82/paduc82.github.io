<h2>            Cannot reduce size of pst that isn&#39;t being used</h2>
                    Outlook 2010<br />
3 accounts set up using pst's in user\mydocuments\outlookfiles which seem to be fine.<br />
Issue 1.<br />
Multiple contacts and calendars have appeared:&nbsp; I've asked about this and no one here seems to be able to tell me where they came from or how to get rid of the unwanted ones.<br />
Which leads me to :<br />
Issue 2<br />
I have an "older" pst that isn't connected to any of these accounts which is 1.81 gB in size. I can't find a way to reduce its size. At least one of the calendars seems to be stored in it and I can't get rid of alerts etc&nbsp; because the pst is too big.<br />
<br />
Should I connect that pst to an account and try to delete stuff?<br />
Can I convert it to a newer version so the size problem is mitigated?<br />
Should I just delete the pst?<br />
How do I get rid of unwanted calendars and contacts folders? <br />
<br />
The whole back end of Outlook is really badly designed. A simple explanation of how things are supposed to work would be appreciated.

            <p>Missing some essential pieces of information.....</p>

<p>Were these 3 POP accounts configured using PST files from a prior Outlook configuration?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Re: PST files</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any PST file that is (or was at any point in its lifecycle) configured to be the default in an Outlook profile will have a "default" set of folders created which cannot be deleted in the Outlook UI.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>An old format ANSI PST file (97-2002) would have a max size of 2gb so not clear as to the description of ".............because it's too big". Assuming you can open this PST file normally in O'2010 which seems to be the case based on the description, the
 quickest way to convert it to the current format would be to export the contents to a new PST file (ensure that you export from the &lt;root&gt; of the PST file and&nbsp;check the box "Include sub-folders". You can then close the old PST file and open the one you just
 exported to. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If all of your other PST files are old format, would suggest you migrate these to the current format&nbsp;using the same approach described above and then&nbsp;associate the newly&nbsp;exported PST file to the appropriate account&nbsp;&nbsp;(click on the root of each PST --&gt; Properties
 --&gt; Advanced </p>
<p>(if the format shows as &lt;Outlook Data File (97-2002)&gt; then it's the old ANSI format)</p>

            <p>Thank you.<br />
</p>
<p>2 of the accounts are pop3 and one is Exchange (Online) - I assume all are using "newer" psts because they were created by Outlook 2010, and the content pulled in from the server but how would I tell?</p>
<p>Pretty sure the "old" pst files weren't imported into these accounts. The properties of the pst's in use only show "OL Data File" and clicking "advanced" doesn't show the type of data file like (97-2002) as you describe. If they did, sorting this out would
 be a lot easier.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is one reason I say it's a confusingly designed product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is really about the old psts sitting on the computer presumably from a previous version of Outlook. I never connected them to any account in Outlook 2010. I have 3 accounts set up but 20 contacts folders and 12 calendars. Are some of these left
 over from the old psts? If not, where do they come from and how do I get rid of them ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a lot of people asking about this, but never getting a straightforward answer.

            <p>#1 - "Outlook Data File" means it's the current PST format (when (97-2002) follows the description - means it's the old format)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Exchange email accounts use OST files within Outlook so unless you configured the account as a POP account - PST file does not apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Regarding "old psts presumably from a previous version of Outlook" - doesn't &lt;necessarily&gt; have anything to do with a "previous" version of Outlook but Outlook profiles persist between uninstalls and reinstalls whether between different or same versions
 of Outlook. In short, if the profile has data files that you didn't include, would have existed which begs the question - did you take this machine over from someone else since logic would be that you would have otherwise been familiar with what existed previously
 if this was your machine and would be very relevant information in terms of background info for posed questions. Deleting a POP email account from an Outlook profile does not delete the PST file that it was associated with it - that is something that you would
 have to do manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - Re: (1) I've asked about this and no one here seems to be able to tell me where they came from or how to get rid of the unwanted ones. (2) "I've seen a lot of people asking about this, but never getting a straightforward answer."

<p>
</p><p>No idea as to (1) what exactly it is that you're referring to by way of original post(s)/question(s) (2) in which forum the question&nbsp;was originally posted and (3) the actual context of whatever the original question related to. Have taken a quick look at
 the subject lines for all&nbsp;posts associated with your ID and none are in reference to the question of PST files (at least not in terms of the &lt;subject&gt;). There are a number of people here that respond to posts on a very very consistent basis so would be interesting
 to know which posts went unanswered.</p>

            <p>#1 All the pst's are the "current format". </p>
<p>#2 The Exchange account seems okay - it does have 2 ost files, but I think that's because of #3:</p>
<p>#3 At some point I moved from a laptop with Outlook 2010 to this machine and the extra psts must be backs up I made.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which brings me back to the original question: if all the pst files are the current version, why am I getting an error about the pst being too large when I try to delete an alert or add something to a calendar? A 1.8gB pst shouldn't be triggering
 that. There are NO 97-2002 pst files present that could possibly account for this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 I've asked about Outlook spawning unwanted contacts/calendar folders at the Office 365 forum (my Office set up is an O365 subscription). I've also mentioned it here:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/remove-or-disable-suggested-contacts/f53d7cbb-2998-4f30-8ba0-afc61181b9c4?page=2</p>
<p>And I've read many threads in various forums asking similar questions without ever seeing a definitive response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the questions are:</p>
<p>Why are there 20 contacts folders and 12 calendars on a computer that's only ever had 3 accounts max set up?</p>
<p>How do I delete the unwanted ones?</p>
<p>Why am I hitting a size limit that prevents deletions when I only have current format psts?</p>
<p>Why does Outlook "think" I'm using an old pst?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The post you referenced was in regards to a post related to "Suggested Contacts" (a thread started&nbsp;and answered in Nov '2010). &nbsp;Given you're description&nbsp;in item #2 - there are more questions than answers as to what exactly transpired in your "move" from
 the old machine to the new one. Outlook does not add/delete email accounts or folders on its own without some other factors at play - either in terms of what existed on this machine prior to the move or whatever actions were taken after the move. That much
 is a certainty without any ifs, ands, buts or maybes. In the post you referenced you stated "As far as I know I never knowingly asked for these or did anything to create them" but in item #3 you mention the possibility of ".......and the extra psts must be
 back ups I made" - to repeat, Outlook doesn't add PST files on its own.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you seem to indicate that you have 2 OST files for a single Exchange account implies a corrupt Outlook profile. There is also no description of what kind&nbsp;of "contact folders" this is in reference to, how many data stores are included in this
 profile or how these were added (i.e. if you used Easy Transfer to move Outlook to a machine where Outlook was already used - ergo a profile already existed - then anything is possible. If you copied a PST file over-writing one with the same name referenced
 in a pre-existing profile, problems could also occur if the original PST file was the old format and the one you copied over it is a new format etc etc etc etc). Far too many &lt;IFs&gt; to try and go through everything since only you know for sure what exactly
 happened on this current machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Create a new profile for the 3 accounts involved. For the POP accounts, use the existing PST file. Once completed, make sure that the new profile is set as the default.<br />
<br />
How to create a new profile in Microsoft Outlook<br />
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/tutorials/profile/profile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/tutorials/profile/profile.htm</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - For the PST file encountering the "size issue" - add it to the profile manually (assuming it's not one added in step #1). See if the problem remains.</p>
<p>#3 - If the "size issue" remains for the problematic PST file, suggest you run ScanPST on this file to eliminate the possibility of errors in the file potentially causing the PST file to be corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, you're really going to need to add some screen shots showing the email accounts / data files and complete folder list if the problems remain with a complete description of what steps "exactly" were followed in the creation of the profile to
 which the screenshots apply - otherwise this will be an exercise in futility.</p>

            <p>The quote from the old thread - "As far as I know I never knowingly asked for these or did anything to create them" -&nbsp; was in reference to the additional folders, not the psts. The number of contact / calendar folders exceeds the total number of pst/ost's
 on the computer, so that statement remains true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more tidbit - when I try to change a contact entry, the error references a pst that is not being used by any of the active accounts. How can a pst that is not "in use" still have a contacts folder available?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for continuing to try and help but as a mere mortal, I guess I just don't understand the logic behind Outlook. All I want is one contacts folder and one calendar. I'll try the steps you suggest first.&nbsp; &nbsp;

So far you have raised 3 separate an distinct items with the primary question (as per the subject line of this post being related to reducing the size of a PST file and not related to "Suggested Contacts"). One post should relate to one question/issue.<br />
<br />
#1 - Multiple contact folders which as best as I can tell relates to the "Suggested Contacts" folder. You can't simply refer to every contact folder in a profile as a generic contacts folder since there is no way for any one to know what exactly you are referring
 to<br />
<br />
In terms of the Suggested Contacts - the following articles may provide some insight<br />
<br />

<br />
#2 - You referred to 2 OST files for a single Exchange account - that makes no sense other than having a corrupt profile if that's the case<br />
<br />
#3 - Error message regarding a calendar folder - suggestion provided as to how to resolve<br />
<br />
As for "multiple calendar folders" - without seeing what you're referring to, impossible to know what this is about since it's not clear as to what exactly is included in your profile by way of email accounts and data files?<br />

            <p>My question's title derives from the Outlook error message about a pst "reaching its maximum size" so that seemed like a good starting point. I thought the other symptoms (unexplained folders) might be related and helpful in diagnosing the root cause.
</p>
<p>Along the way with your help, I've realized ALL the psts on this machine are current and not subject to the 2gB size limit. Scan pst on the errant pst found 2 errors which it repaired, but the error persists. Even so, allowing for the fact that file corruption
 may still account for the error message, if I had to trim it down to one question,&nbsp; it would be:</p>
<p>"How can a pst that is not "in use" still have a contacts folder available?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 I think I mentioned the extra ost is a back up made when I moved to another computer.</p>

            <p>#1 - Any PST file can contain one or more contact folders either automatically created if the PST file is (or was ever) designated as a default data store in a profile OR manually added. If automatically created as the result of being designated a default
 with any given email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - You don't add OST files to a profile - those are created when you create an applicable account (such as Exchange) so not sure where you're seeing these "2" OST files. If it's not part of the profile - extraneous OST files are of no consequence - all
 that matters is the file in use in the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - You should re-run ScanPST until no errors are encountered - it can sometimes take several runs to eliminate different errors. That said, you haven't stated whether you have created a new profile so not discounting the possibility of you having over-written
 a file with the same name which may have been an old format file.</p>

            <p>Since they are both Office 365, they are similar in that way. AFIK, ProPlus just allows install on one computer, while Home allows 5. They have very similar program bundles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you should be able to transfer your ProPlus to the new computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new computer, log in to the MyAccount site. Go to Install. In there you should see the install on your current machine. You can click on the "deactivate" link, then you can install on the new machine.</p>

- <strong>install and re-install Office 2016, Office 2013 and Office 365, or manage your Office 365 subscription, register Product Key</strong></span>
<p><span>Effectively all Office licenses allow you to re-install on the same computer, even after limited system changes like ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù the OS or installing a new HD. Some, not all Office licenses allow you to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù the installation to a new computer.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To re-install Office in general you need 2 things. Your unique product key and the matching generic installation file for the appropriate year and bundle.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>These two elements can be found in a number of places, depending on your specific Year of Office and the bundle. For Office 2010 and earlier you need the key and install file, but with 2013 and later things have been changing
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have Office 2016/365 then you can log in to the MyAccount page to re-install Office.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Office 2016 allows users to do all sorts of license management through the MyAccount page. Office 2016 forces you to associate your license to an email account so the original product key becomes effectively one-time use.

    <title>Sway Full Screen Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devin mcmahon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sway Full Screen Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am experimenting with embedding Sway into a web site.&nbsp; I have successfully done it with a SharePoint page, a page on Wix, and a page generated from another common web editor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the functionality of the Full Screen button is not consistent,&nbsp; It works on SharePoint, and the Wix page, but not on the page created with Website Builder, a tool provided by Network Solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases I am able to add an HTML widget and enter code-behind, but the behavior is erratic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not overly familiar with the gory details of HTML and web protocols to the point where I would recognize that there was a setting or something that I am missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please provide guidance on the embedding of Sway content into web pages, and what it means to get Full Screen to work?</p>

            <p>Hi Devin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you check the embed code you're using?&nbsp; By default, the embed code that Sway provides has the following flags in it:&nbsp; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen.&nbsp; Is it possible you left them out in some case?&nbsp; If not,
 I suspect there is something in your website builder HTML that is keeping these flags from doing their thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Not sure if I am understanding the problem correctly of if this is your problem but when you right click at the location to paste if you hover the cursor over Paste Special then you get another set of icons and if you hover the cursor over each one then
 you should see the Transpose icon. Alternatively, just left click on Paste Special and you will get a dialog box from which you should be able to select Transpose.

            <p>Which type of mail account are you using? POP3, IMAP, Exchange, Hotmail, other...?<br />
Where is the Address Book located? Is it a Contact folder, a Public Folder or a Global Address List?</p>
<p>There is nothing really special that you need to do to get the rule to work. You could set it as the first rule to make sure that it is not affected by any other rules. You can also disable all your other rules during troubleshooting.</p>

            The account is Exchange (office 365).&nbsp; I've tried using the global address book as well as two LDAP address books.&nbsp; It's set up like 'Sender is in specified Address Book rule' in the link you provided.&nbsp; If I change the condition to a single address the
 rule works as expected.&nbsp; I've tried with only one rule and have recreated the profile several times to eliminate a corrupt profile as the cause.&nbsp; I'm able to search for contacts in the LDAP address books so I believe they're set up correctly and tried the
 global address book as well without success.<br />

                    <div>
<div>
<div>First I would like to thank the Microsoft community for all the help I have received. &nbsp;I am now an IT student trying to help others like I have been helped. I now have another problem with my PC. On normal startup
 no shortcuts work - &nbsp;though all are populated, except the shortcut for my HP, (which I think needed an up date) &nbsp;The Internet will not work and does not show any information when selected.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Though the shortcuts are populated - when &nbsp;selected and clicked on - &nbsp;the wheel shows for a split second and then nothing happens. &nbsp;It is as though the startup process is still going on but it's never completed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When using safe mode with networking capabilities the network works fine and all of the populated shortcuts on desktop also work normally. &nbsp;I have run several scans and detected nothing out of the ordinary I
 am thinking maybe it is a root kit. &nbsp;As always I was in the middle of doing my homework when my computer malfunctioned do you have any suggestions? &nbsp;Currently I am running a full Norton scan, But I don't think it will detect when I need to be removed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yesterday I had a similar problem, and the scan detected and removed &nbsp;2 shell key changes. &nbsp; But everything worked fine after that. &nbsp;As always, any help I can get is greatly appreciated. &nbsp; I am still trying to
 complete my PC help desk home work!</div>

            With so limited info we're limited as to how much advice we can give you.<br />
<br />
What makes you think you have a rootkit infection? What does 'detected nothing <i>
out of the ordinary</i>' mean? What rootkit-specific tools have been used? What's its detection's name?

    <title>Access 2013 - Error with entering information into a form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob hess  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 - Error with entering information into a form</h2>
                    <p>I've created a Database that I want to share with my team.&nbsp; I have multiple tables to respond to specific dropdowns on the form (cascading).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tables are tblSite (to select Location), tbl&lt;Manager&gt; (there are 3 of these based on the Location (New York, Chicago, Dallas), tblSupervisor (has&nbsp;Supervisors and Managers in it), tblAgents (Agents and Supervisors), tblRatings (to provide ratings) and
 tblRecords (where the form writes to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Form itself has cascading dropdowns for Site &gt; Manager &gt; Supervisor &gt; Agent.&nbsp; The next 7 are dropdowns for the Ratings and 3 text boxes that are for numerical entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I split the database and put the Back End on a shared drive and email the Front End to my team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon testing, we run into the error that states: The changes you requested to the table were not successful because they would create duplicate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this happens in multiple ways and when one a member of my team gets the error, everyone else starts to receive it as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also had the error happen though when I have entered data to a test form on my desktop that did not point to the Shared Drive (was able to do 7-10 entries in a row) and then closed and reopened the program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following code for Form Load:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmAgentEvaluation", , , , acFormAdd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a couple of other codes entered in VBA:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Command33_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSaveRecord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNewRec<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub Form_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.GoToRecord acDataForm, "frmAgentEvaluation", acNewRec<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some of my team members though can only wind up entering 1 or 2 calls and then the next call they get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my form overall, I have the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filter on Load = No</p>
<p>Order by On Load = Yes</p>
<p>Wait for Post Processing = No</p>
<p>Data Entry = Yes</p>
<p>Allow Additions = Yes</p>
<p>Allow Deletions = No </p>
<p>Allow Edits = No</p>
<p>Allow Filters = Yes</p>
<p>Record Locks = No Locks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a novice with Access so dumbing down for me is very acceptable.&nbsp; This is the only thing that prevents my form from working overall and it's a bit frustrating.&nbsp; I did look up the error but the answers aren't clear to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also say that the only thing that has a Primary Key (set to AutoNumber)&nbsp;is my table where the form is supposed to write to.&nbsp; The other tables have Primary Keys but they are based on whatever the first column is.&nbsp; (Ex. I have a table called "tblAgents".&nbsp;
 First column is the Agents, second column is the Supervisors.&nbsp; The Agents is set to the Primary Key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any assistance that is provided.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>
<p><br />
Rob</p>

            <p>What is the Recordsource of your main form?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i understand it you should have one table for this part:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblAgents</p>
<p>AgentID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>AgentFirstname</p>
<p>AgentLastname</p>
<p>SiteID (foreign Key)</p>
<p>IsManager (Yes/No)</p>
<p>ManagerID (FK)</p>
<p>IsSupervisor (Yes/No)</p>
<p>SupervisorID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your data table, you ONLY need AgentID as a foreign key, since you can get the Site, Manager and Supervisor from the AgentID. Now I'm assuming here that Agents are also managers and supervisors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on your form, you could use Cascading Combos to drill down to Agents at the site with that manager and that supervisor. But, again, only AgentID needs to be stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you properly normalize and clean up your database you will probably eliminate that message.</p>

            <p>Scott -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I apologize if I don't understand your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really understand "Foreign Key" or what you mean by that.&nbsp; Forgive me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let me see if I understand correctly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"RecordSource" is where I would pull the data from to add to the form?&nbsp; As in one table for all of it?
</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>Does "RecordSource" mean where I will record the information once its entered&nbsp; on the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently:</p>
<p>Each table is based off the previous:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Site (drop down) - Table is Sites only</p>
<p>Manager (drop down based on Site selected)&nbsp;- Table is Managers (column1)/Sites (column2)</p>
<p>Supervisor (DD based on Manager) - Table is Supervisor (col 1)/Manager (col 2)</p>
<p>Agents (DD based on Supervisor) - Table is Agent (col 1)/Supervisor (col 2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where the form writes to the order goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Entry #(autonumber and is Primary Key), Agent Name, 7 different ratings (each in own column), Sup, Man, Site</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form is based off of this table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again feel free to&nbsp; dumb down for me and I do appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Everything in Access is an object. Objects have properties and most things are done in Access by manipulating those properties. One of the properties of a form is Recordsource. It defines where the data is pulled from to display. You can view the properties
 of an object but opening the Properties dialog in Design mode. So I need to know what the Recordsource of the form is. just copy and paste from the Recodsource property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't understand the term foreign Key, that indicates you don't know how to properly design database tables. You need to read up on Normalization. It is a key technique for properly designing tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point is you should NOT have seven different fields for Ratings. Rating is an entity. And the Attributes of a rating are what is being rated and the rating itself. Therefore, you should have a child table for ratings like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblRatings</p>
<p>RatingID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ParentID (FK)<br />
RatingTypeID (FK)</p>
<p>Rating</p>
<p>
</p><p>So each rating should be a record in a table, not a field in a table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Since the Agent is unique to the combination of Site, Manager and Supervisor, you do NOT need store all 4 values. You need only store the AgentID as a Foreign Key.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I said 7 different ratings, I meant that we have an Overall, Product Knowledge, Issue Resolution...etc.&nbsp; Let's call them Competencies instead.&nbsp; Each is scored on a novice to expert level (5 choices overall) and those are stored in the tblratings.&nbsp; I
 apologize for the confusion there.</p>

            <p>Doesn't matter whether you call it Ratings or Competencies the point is that they are an entity and that each one should be a separate record in a table related back to the AgentID or PK from tblRecords.</p>
<p>

            <p>The "Competencies" (Overall, Product Knowledge, etc) are all separate fields within the tblRecords.&nbsp; The Ratings of Novice to Expert which is given to each Competency is its own table (tblRatings).&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, on my form for each combo box, they point to the RowSource for the appropriate selection.&nbsp; For example, the combo box to select the Site, the RowSource is tblSites.&nbsp; For Manager, it is tblManager, etc.&nbsp; For the Competencies, each one points to the
 tblRatings to get the Novice to Expert selections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, (I've seen this other places), each combo box is bound with a Control Source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what the Data Properties are for the combo boxes:&nbsp; </p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, again, that is not good design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the Competencies should NOT be separate fields in a record. Data should be defined by values in a record, not by the field names. So Compentencies are an entity. The entitiy has the attributed of the competency type (Overall, Knowledge, etc), the
 rating and the person the compentcy applies to. So you should have a separate table with fields like CompetentcyTypeID, Rating, AgentID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access is a relational database so relationships need exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are entering Redundant information here. As I understand you an Agent has ONE supervisor, ONE manager and ONE site. So all you need to do is select the Agent and you know the rest. Also, as I understand it, a manager and supervisor is also an Agent.
 So you need only one table of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The foundation of a well run database is proper table design and you need to get that down first before you start on the rest of the design. And you are not there yet.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I appreciate your help and all your honesty.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; <br />

Just so I'm clear, I just need to make one table of Agents with fields of Primary Key (autonumber), Agents name (you stated above as though first and last name should each be a separate field.&nbsp; Is it ok for this to be one field like Smith, Joe?)&nbsp;and the rest
 I need to read up on to understand Foreign Key and such.</p>

            <p>OK, The entity here is people. One of the attributes of this entity is whether they are a Supv, Mgr or just an Agent. But, since, they could be both or all three, it would be redundant to repeat them in a &nbsp;Managers or Supervisors table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each field in a table should be the smallest piece of data. It is easier to concatenate data together then split them apart. I generally use 5 fields for people names (Salutation (mr, ms, etc.), first, Middle, Last and Suffix (jr, sr, etc.)) So I would not
 recommend using one field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes sense to use surrogate keys rather than repeating text. So for example, lets say a Site name was Grand Rapids Factory 1. it would be better to use an autonumber key and use that value as your foreign key then repeating the site name, even if you
 are picking from a list.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>RIght.&nbsp; With Outlook 2007, all Sent Items get stored in the default PST's Sent Items folder.&nbsp; Outlook 2010 allows separate Sent Items for each PST if those PSTs are the delivery locations for their respective accounts.</p>
<p>If you specifiy unique Inboxes (and the PSTs that hols them) for your accounts, you can use rules to store sent items in account-specific Sent Items folders.</p>

            If emails from an account are not appearing in the default Sent folder its because you have a rule set that diverts them to another folder.

    <title>Need solution to convert DBX file into PST format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need solution to convert DBX file into PST format</h2>
                    
<p>I always perform all my business operation tasks through Outlook application and use its PST file format for storing messages and then used it for making my communication successful with my clients and other office members. The need of DBX file conversion
 comes from today morning when I have received the file from my new client. The file which I &nbsp;received is in DBX format that supports on Outlook Express Application but I am using Application of Outlook that read only PST files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So is there any manual solution that help me to overcome from the running situation?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ManeetNegi,</p>
<p>No Microsoft supported method is available to convert DBX file into PST format. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, I‚Äôd appreciate it if any community members could share some experience or resources here.</p>

<p>If you want to import Outlook Express' data to Outlook, you can convert DBX to PST format. There's an easy manual trick by using which you can easily import your DBX files' data into Outlook. You need to use
<em><strong>Windows Live Mail</strong></em> tool first, then you can export Outlook Express' emails to Windows Live Mail. After that, you can import your email messages to Outlook by using its Import feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read this blog post: <em><strong><a href="http://wordpress.semnaitik.com/2013/11/11/convert-dbx-to-pst-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">3 Easy Steps to Convert DBX to PST Format | N. Sem's Blog</a></strong></em>&nbsp;It would definitely help you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Authenticator app on my iPhone stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Authenticator app issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago my authenticator app on my iPhone stopped working. It started giving me codes that when entered in outlook.com, the website kept saying: &nbsp;"too many invalid codes have been entered. Please try again later. " A week later I still had the same
 issue. After reading the forum, I saw that people recommended uninstalling the app on the iphone, reinstalling it and setting it up again. The problem, however, is that everytime I scan the bar code on the app and enter the code that it gives me, I keep getting:
 "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">That code didn't work. Check the code and try again."&nbsp;</span>I've tried manually entering the info instead of scanning and I still get the same error. Please help. This is a REALLY frustrating problem
 and I've tried each way a dozen times, entering various codes.</p>

            <p><span>Hi GayathriSelvaraj,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my search, there are some ways for your reference:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open your Outlook client in safe mode and disable add-ins. This can help us know whether the issue is related to add-ins. You can refer to ‚ÄúStart Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins‚Äù in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-can-t-start-Microsoft-Outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-Cannot-start-Microsoft-Office-Outlook-Cannot-open-the-Outlook-Window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Use Outlook online repair to check whether the problem is caused by the Outlook client. You can go to Control panel ‚Äì&gt; Programs -&gt; Programs and Features -&gt; right click Office 365 and choose change -&gt; choose online repair.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Repair OST files. Please refer to the ‚ÄúRe-create an offline Outlook Data File (.ost)‚Äù part in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I‚Äôd like to collect some information to do further troubleshooting:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does Auto complete reset after reopening Outlook 2013? Does it not display
the second time you type one‚Äôs email address?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does this function work well on <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>N95 8GB broken screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heha---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 8GB broken screen</h2>
                    
<p>This topic has been addressed a couple of times before, but I haven't found an answer that really works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - someone stepped on my phone. The screen is broken. I have tried to connect it with USB, but to no avail. It might be that the phone asks for the type of connection (PC suite, mass storage etc). I have tried the arrow keys, and OK, but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have also tried to connect a video cable, but no video output. Probably it asks for the type of connection (headphone, video etc), but I cannot seem to get my phone to do anything still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried it after sliding the cover up so that the keyboard is not locked, no effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it is either not asking me the connection type, or is asking, but I cannot enter the right info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some "force USB PC suite" connection, or "force composite video output" key combination I can use? Or is there some PC/OSX option or program I can use to connect the phone via USB, that forces connection type without needing to type anything on
 the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wifi and Bluetooth are turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really would like to get some pictures out, contacts etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be grateful for any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I do this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it sounds like you've tried everything already.&nbsp; PC Suite mode should be just a press of the middle navigation key, that would let you use Content Copier or Phone Browser to backup up; or mass storage just to copy the contents of the 8Gb mass
 memory would be down once then middle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't a way to affect the behaviour of the phone other than that.</p>

<p>When you turn your phone on, can you hear the Nokia start up tone?<br />
<br />
How do you actually know your handset is&nbsp;working/on properly?</p>
<p>That being said, if someone's stepped on it they may have damaged the top slide, so the select button etc may have been damaged.</p>

<p>Try updating your pcsuite to the latest version first to and see if you can back up the phone.There is a high likelyhood that the screen problem is due to a faulty ribbon cable which connects the 2 halves of the slide. You will need to have this replaced
 by a Nokia Care Point.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for updating the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Which build of Windows 10 Technical Preview are you working with?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could have been caused of pending update.</span><strong><span>Check the Windows updates.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Press <strong><span>Windows Key + W</span></strong> on the keyboard.</li><li>
Type <strong><span>Updates</span></strong> in the search bar and click on the icon
<strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> from the search result.</li><li>
On the <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> window, click on the link:
<strong><span>Check for updates</span></strong> from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</li></ul>
<p><span>If the updates are available, install all the updates listed there. Make sure you install all the updates
<strong>including the optional updates.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this does not help,
</span><span>I suggest you&nbsp;p</span>ut the computer in <strong>clean boot</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you
 boot the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Good day, Kondiba.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to install apps on a Windows Phone is by downloading it from the Store. If you're seeing a message telling you to set up My Family, this means that your Microsoft account is missing a certain information, such as account owner's date of birth
 or country/region. You need to sign-in to <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>account.microsoft.com/profile</strong></a>, and choose <strong>Edit your personal info</strong> to help you resolve this.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I got asked to confirm my security with my email account and since i have a different phone number i have to wait the 30 days to be able to change my info. That is fine but I was under the impression that i would still be able to access my email account
 while this takes place and I can't. It just keeps asking me if sent the request and i check yes then it says it is not ready for me until (date) and all i can do is sign out. This is not ok I REQUIRE access to my email this month for business reasons. Can
 somebody tell me whether this is suppose to happen or not? </p>

            Hello G,
<br />
<br />Skype conference calls are usually sent as an email invitation, which you Accept or Decline. The conference would not be sent as an email address. If any meeting is to be kept, your Skype ID would be used to add you to the scheduled meeting.
<br />
<br />Could you contact the sender who sent it to you to find out how you are supposed to join the meeting?       
        </p>

            Actually, I wouldn't call that blurry at all. A dot pattern has been applied to the photo and the dots are quite sharp. If you've been playing the Artistic Effects, select the photo in Edit mode, then from
<strong>PICTURE TOOLS&gt;FORMAT</strong>, choose <strong>Artistic Effects&gt;Artistic Effect Options</strong> and click on the
<strong>Reset</strong> button.
