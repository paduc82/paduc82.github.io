    <title>Help&#33;&#33; Spelling check Ignore options are not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help&#33;&#33; Spelling check Ignore options are not working correctly. Or am I losing my mind&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am finding that the "Ignore" and the "Ignore All" functions are not working as I expect them to, AND also as I believe they used to. But I am beginning to wonder if I'm just remembering incorrectly, even though I have used this function
 for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I recall (and as would make sense), if you used one of the those options on a word that is flagged as misspelled, then either that single instance of the word would no longer be flagged (the "Ignore" option), or ALL instances of the
 word in that document would no longer be flagged (the "Ignore All" option.) Additionally, these choices would stick even AFTER the doc had been closed and reopened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, both Ignore and Ignore All are both document-specific, but are NOT session-specific.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That had been my experience for years starting with Word 97 and up through every version INCLUDING the Word 2007 that I'm currently using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no longer working. Words that I have set to be ignored, using EITHER the Ignore or Ignore All options are reverting back to being flagged, sometimes as soon as I type elsewhere in the doc, or after some indeterminate period of
 time after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are all standard Word docx files, nothing fancy. Nor are they long -- it happens regardless of the doc length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched for information on this but haven't found anything helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I incorrect about how this is supposed to work? Am I losing my mind, given that I believe it used to work that way? It's hard to imagine that I am just discovering this after so many years of daily, heavy Word use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping for a solution as this is EXTREMELY frustrating, as the only workaround I've found is to *add* these words to my custom dictionary file, which I would rather not do for any number of reasons, including that I some of the words
 I want to ignore are being irregularly spelled intentionally for THAT document only, so adding them to the would be undesirable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone? Please??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p>

            <p>This is undoubtedly the way the options <strong>should</strong> work, but they demonstrably don't. It is well attested that "ignoring" misspellings is effective only for a single Word session (presumably this is a bug rather than by design).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of adding the words to your custom dictionary, you can mark them as "No Proofing" by applying a character style defined as "Default Paragraph Font + Do not check spelling or grammar." For more on this, see

<h2>            paying for microsoft security essentials</h2>
                    Today I called netgear due to modem issues. My computer was then scanned by a technician who told me my computer had been compromised. He said they would clean my system and add a microsoft essentials security system. I informed him that I already have
 mses installed. He told me well thats the free version and we charging you for a lifetime version that is much more powerful at catching these issues. I paid $169.99 for this improved version and when I later googled I find their are no paid versions. I feel
 that I have been scammed by a supposedly reputable company. I just thought you should be aware of what is going on at nergear.

unfortunately you have been scammed.. there is no such paid version of mse. for genuine windows users its free of charge. If you can still contact that company ask then to show the license agreement and other documents etc.. May be they have charged for the
 technical assistance, but u can simply install mse without any assistance . besides these days, lot more technical support scams are there and don't let anyone to install software if you cant trust them.

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Holding down the shift key whilst opening Excel prevents macros from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that you have excluded the possibility that your own code is responsible, the fact that this stratagem restored the Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V functionality suggests that you have an add-in which is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try, therefore, disabling your add-ins and then restore them one by one. The return of the copy/paste problem will then identify the last added add-in as the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>===</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Norman</p>

    <title>grey&#47;shadow prints as orange Word 2013 &#40;and publisher&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianchc  say:</h3>
<h2>            grey&#47;shadow prints as orange Word 2013 &#40;and publisher&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an odd problem (it happens in Word and Publisher).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I print</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>a text box with a shadow</li><li>an MS clipart object with has&nbsp;a shadow built-in to the original picture</li><li>a colour or greyscale picture (jpg)</li></ul>
<p>The particular "shadow" grey appears as pale orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I set text to grey it prints grey and if I use other greys, they too come out in the right colour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried updating (and downgrading) my printer driver - HP LaserJet M475 (I have the latest HP Universal driver) Windows 8 64 bit.</p>
<p>[I have had a look in the HP forums to see if anyone else is reporting this - not that I can see].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens in Word and publisher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if I take the clipart and recolor it as purple throughout (with purple shadows) the shadow still prints out as orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be the grey and orange that appear in the office theme [i.e.&nbsp;the on called office]&nbsp;(but changing theme doesn't seem to help).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am baffled - is there a setting I could have changed that might be the cause?&nbsp; Is it something to with transparent elements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[choosing to print grey scale on the driver fixes the orange but obviously cancels the other colours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the printer driver - but unless you have specific advice on cleaning up the driver for a better re-install or have had the same problem and know which driver version works, posting "it's the printer driver" won't really help me as "I've tried that".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can try quite a few other things when I have time - currently as a time saving exercise I am wondering if anyone has had this or a similar issue or has a specific rather than looking for a list of things that I might try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I have ever fully understood how Word etc. treat certain special colours (like "transparent).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Try to print into different printer like XPS or&nbsp;Onenote&nbsp;printers of the Computer and check if that works properly.

    <title>Excel VBA method will not accept a concatenated string - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denniscpa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA method will not accept a concatenated string &#34;Array&#40;3, 4, 5&#41;&#34; as valid input to .RemoveDuplicates Columns&#58;&#61;Array&#40;3, 4, 5&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Excel VBA method will not accept a concatenated string "Array(3, 4, 5)" as valid input to .RemoveDuplicates Columns:=Array(3, 4, 5)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an Excel/VBA&nbsp;Function (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I have attempted Eval() and Indirect() to no avail</span>) that will cause&nbsp;a concatenated VBA code line to work:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This works fine as a VBA code line</span>&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ActiveSheet.UsedRange.RemoveDuplicates Columns:=Array(3, 5, 6), Header:=xlYes</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see above, I can manually type ... Columns:=<strong>Array(3, 4, 5) ...
</strong>and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to <strong>concatenate</strong> <strong>Array(3, 4, 5)&nbsp;</strong><strong>using a variable</strong>.&nbsp; The variable (myColumns) is a string variable and contains "3, 4, 5<strong>"</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus <strong>ActiveSheet.UsedRange.RemoveDuplicates Columns:="Array(" &amp; myColumns &amp; ")", Header:=xlYes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that VBA or Excel wants to "see" the object not the text-representation thereof.&nbsp; That said, even if I do not Dim the Array, the code line accepts the typed-in information</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>DennisCPA</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This following code snippet works ... Columns:=Array(Val(myColumns)) ... but it only&nbsp;passes the&nbsp;number "3" of the contents of myColumns which is Text "3, 4, 5"&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi LCBurt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer (IE) in no add-ons mode and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,
</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Start</b> button, and select
<b>All Programs</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Accessories</b>, and select
<b>System Tools.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need
 them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</p>
<p>Please see the section “Disable add-ons in Internet Explorer" in the following article for further instructions:</p>
<p><b>Is Internet Explorer slow? 5 things to try</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/internet-explorer/slow-five-tips-to-boost-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/internet-explorer/slow-five-tips-to-boost-performance</a></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, you may follow the method 2.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>As “octonet http filter” is interfering while using legit sites, you may try uninstalling the program and check if it helps.</p>
<p>You may refer the below article for uninstaaling or removing a program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>uninstall or change a program in windows</b></p>

 see the synchronisation process happening - new contact appears in the phone - but the Contacts window remains blank. Happens for both Bluetooth and USB connections.<br />

            Hi Cadster,<br />
<br />
As far as i know, Nokia PC suite has come up with Nokia Communication centre for Messages, Contacts and Calender(creating new meetings option from 7.0.8.2 i am not wrong i guess) which is a replacement for viewing your contacts/messages on through phone browser.
 Also makes sure that your contact details are in Phone memory and not in your SIM Card, if it is in SIM Card Nokia PC Suite will not recognise those contacts. If still you want to view the contacts through phone browser only(not recommended unless and until
 it is really needed) downgrade your pc suite to 6.86.9.3 version :)<br />
<br />
Dear Forum, Kindly correct me if i am wrong in my suggestions :)

            cricfancy is correct... the old 6.8 version could browse the contacts folder, and the application to view contacts was effectivly the same thing (the browser)<br />
<br />
The new 7.0. version has only one method of viewing the contacts which is to use the application built into 7.0. It is no longer possible to browse the contacts folder (it can't be seen even if you 'show hidden files' or 'show protected files' in windows folder
 view settings)<br />
<br />
Anyhow... you have provided me the answer... downgrade to 6.8 (or tho I'm not sure I regard this as a 'downgrade' anymore ;-)<br />
<br />
Now I'm off to search for a link to 6.8..!

<h2>            Win10 New Features</h2>
                    Is there a web site that details the new features in Win 10 TP? It would be nice to see what we can do rather than stumbling on new features using the OS or from reviews.

<h2>            Runtime Error while trying to access LastPass application on IE 11.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - LastPass</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading from Windows 8.0 to 8.1 and upgrading to Internet Explorer 11, I can no longer access my password application--LastPass. I am getting the following error message every time I attempt to sign in to LastPass:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Runtime Error! Program C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</strong></p>
<p><strong>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please contact the application's support team for more information</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem using LastPass with my Mozilla browser. I prefer to use Internet Explore, however. What&nbsp;steps do I take&nbsp;to correct this problem?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cynthia Crain, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to this application or program?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A runtime error is a software or hardware problem that prevents Internet Explorer from working correctly. Runtime errors can be caused if a website uses html code that is not compatible with the web browser functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>Run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows key + W’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type
<strong>Troubleshooter</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Select
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>View All </strong>and select <strong>
Internet Explorer Performance.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>Enhanced Protected Mode helps protect your PC and personal data from malware and other attacks, and it's on by default in Internet Explorer 11. When it's turned on, add-ons such as toolbars, extensions, and browser helper objects can only run if they're
 compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode. You'll be notified if an add-on is incompatible. If you need to run an incompatible add-on, you can turn off Enhanced Protected Mode in the desktop browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps under “To turn off Enhanced Protected Mode” from this article to turn off enhanced protected mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</strong><span>: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Enhanced Protected Mode helps protect your PC from malware and other attacks. Only turn off Enhanced Protected Mode if you're sure about increasing the level of risk to your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3.</strong></p>
<p>Try clearing the temporary Internet files and check if this helps.</p>
<p><strong>To clear temporary Internet files</strong></p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet Explorer icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Tap or click “<span>Tools”</span> button, and then tap or click “<span>Internet options”</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the “<span>General</span> tab”, under “Browsing history”, tap or click “<span>Delete”</span>.</p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In the “Delete Browsing History” dialog box, clear the “<span>Temporary Internet files” and “website files”</span> check box.</p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tap or click “<span>Delete”</span>, and then tap or click <span>OK</span>. Once this is done, restart the computer and check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, if this doesn't work, then try resetting the security settings.</p>
<span>To reset Internet Explorer's security settings</span>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet Explorer icon on the taskbar.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On the “<span>Security</span> tab”, tap or click “<span>Default level”</span>, and then tap or click

<p>The code&nbsp;worked in MS Access 2003 and stopped working when we upgraded to MS Access 2010. I have a main form with a field paid_in_full_date which i need to set as the current date if the subform where the payment checks are&nbsp;entered inserts a new record.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
 i set a breakpoint and step thur it the code below works. But will not work if i don't set the breakpoint and step thru it. The code always does the first DoCmd.OpenQuery and updates the table with the payment amount BUT it will not do the next DoCmd.OpenQuery
 and update the paid_in_full_date to the system date if the form is run normally, if i set a breakpoint and step thru it works.</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_AfterInsert()<br />
totalpayment (Me!invno) 'totals the&nbsp;payment amount<br />
DoCmd.SetWarnings False<br />
DoCmd.OpenQuery "updatepartial_payment" 'updates table with the payment amount<br />

            Part of the problem here appears to be that you are storing calculated values. If you have the payments amounts and dates in the transactions no need to store them in the parent table.

<p>I"ve never really understood why anyone would execute queries via<br />
the QueryDefs collection, instead of just directly. This is going to<br />
work just fine: <br />
&nbsp; CurrentDB.Execute("updatepartial_payment", dbFailOnError)</p>
<p>I also don't understand why there is a need in the code above to<br />
assign a database variable. It would be a correct thing to do if the<br />
second use of it were something like this: <br />
&nbsp; Debug.Print db.OpenRecordset("SELECT @@IDENTITY")(0)</p>
<p>...but there is no necessary dependency between the two uses, so<br />
CurrentDB should be just fine. The queries are going to take a lot<br />
longer to run than it will take to initialize CurrentDB a second<br />
time. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>
<p><span>I only use two folders in my Hotmail account and my Outlook client.</span></p>
</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Inbox - Is the standard inbox names Inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>File Cabinet - I file all received and sent email in the folder named File Cabinet.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are NO other folders, no special characters in the folder names and the folder names are not too long.</span></p>

<p><span>I do use categories that are assigned to each email, which is how I sort and group email without using folders. This has always worked well in Outlook, however, the categories feature is not
 available in Hotmail or is available at a cost.</span></p>


<p><span>I have removed all email addresses and domain names from the Safe Senders and Blocked Senders in the Junk E-Mail Options in Outlook and in Hotmail. I noted one domain name that keeps returning
 to the Safe Senders in both Outlook and Hotmail, which is strange since I am unable to synch my Outlook client to my Hotmail account.</span></p>

<p><span>This is the second time this has occurred to me and the last time was on an older version of the connector and an older version of Outlook, Outlook 2003.</span></p>

</strong><em>Note: If you use categories to categorize your emails, you will not loose category or categories assigned to each email. At least that was my experience.<br />
</em><br />
<strong>Since no support person from any Microsoft support group could or would tell me whether or not categories would be retained when this procedure is performed, I took the precautionary measure of archiving the folder to my local drive just in case I had
 to restore the email because the categories were not retained.&nbsp;</strong><em>I'm glad I did.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The&nbsp;synchronization between my Hotmail account and Outlook PST did not work in its entirety&nbsp;</span>and approximately half of

            <p>It seems a bit tricky in 2007, but should be available in your MOTS version.&nbsp; Be sure you try to open the file from within Excel.&nbsp; When the file open dialog comes up don't actually double-click the file, but just get it selected in the list.&nbsp; It may not
 even show up in the filename section of the dialog at this point.&nbsp; But now the "Open" button and its drop-down arrow should be available to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've uploaded a Word ('97 format) file with a graphic from a system here with Excel 2007 on it showing just what things look like at this point:</p>

            <p>OK, repairing Excel didn't help.&nbsp; Let's try repairing one or two of the files that you have the problem with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Excel, choose File --&gt; Open.&nbsp; Go down to the "Open" button and click on the drop-down arrow that is next to the word "Open" and choose "Open and Repair" and then open one of the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you get it open, save it with a new name.&nbsp; Close the file.&nbsp; Might even close Excel and reopen it and try opening the repaired file and see how things go.</p>

    <title>IE changes proxy settings on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcrower  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE changes proxy settings on startup</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with Windows 7 Professional 32-bit, fully patched on a domain.&nbsp; It has IE 11.&nbsp; It runs Symantec.Cloud as antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially it had IE10 and the proxy was switched off and it had the IP address of one of our local servers listed as a proxy exception.&nbsp; I wanted to re-enable the proxy and remove the IP in the exception list.&nbsp; I was able to but as soon as IE is restarted
 it disables the proxy and re-adds the IP exception.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer does not use a script to set the proxy.</p>
<p>There is no group policy setting the proxy (either domain-wise or locally).</p>
<p>There are no local programs or scripts running to change the proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to IE11 to see if that would sort it out but it hasn't.</p>
<p>I have reset IE settings to no avail.</p>
<p>I have run IE without addons to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can actually look in the registry and see the proxy setting change when I change it through the Internet Options control panel, and as soon as I start IE it all changes back.&nbsp; I have also tried changing them through the control panel, restarting Windows
 then starting IE to no avail.&nbsp; I even tried logging in under the local administrator account and manually changing the users proxy setting via the registry; again to no avail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas where else I might be able to look?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>jc</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>

<h2>            IE Freezes Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 IE desktop stops responding or freezes my computer whenever I visit a website the contains flash or html5. This started&nbsp;Tuesday or Wednesday of this week after automatic updates.&nbsp;Not sure what I can do to fix it without disabling features that
 I use every time I go on the internet. Would be very thankful if someone could help me solve this.</p>

            I did a test using Steam, and cgcookie's&nbsp;website&nbsp;which uses&nbsp;flash player for videos&nbsp;and I did not get a crash. I will only get a crash on&nbsp;sites with&nbsp;youtube/embedded, and iheart radio.

            Found out it was a bad driver installation thanks to&nbsp;Microsoft automatic&nbsp;updates. Just awesome!! This will be the 8th time I had to re-install this remarkable operating system!!

    <title>Cannot copy and paste a Powerpoint object into Word correctly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot copy and paste a Powerpoint object into Word correctly &#40;Office 2010 and Windows 7 Pro&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to copy a Powerpoint object (diagram) into Word and when I paste it in word the object doesn't paste properly - it doesn't even create the drawing area to hold the object.&nbsp; I have spent almost two hours w/MS support on this problem and
 they have no idea why it can't be pasted properly as an object.&nbsp; It will paste properly as an object in Excel 2010, but not Word!&nbsp; I was able to do the copy and paste on another Office 2010 installation but running Windows Home Premium, whereas I am running
 Window 7 Professional and the tech support was running Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>I've tried everything short of re-installing the Windows operating system - please if anybody has had this issue let me know...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the document you're trying to paste the diagram into running in Compatibility Mode? Take a look at the title bar to see if this is the case. If so, then try converting the document to the newer file format and see if that rectifies the issue.</p>
<p>Note that the reason for this is the drawing engine was upgraded in Word 2010 to a newer&nbsp;drawing engine that was introduced in PowerPoint and Excel 2007.</p>
