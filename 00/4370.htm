<h2>            Unreliable draw commands in Word 2013</h2>
                    <div>I make extensive use of the Draw commands in Word for creating electrical and mechanical drawings, as well as other types of drawings.&nbsp; I recently moved from Word 2003 to Word 2013, and I am shocked at what has happened to the Draw functions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Objects
 disappear when you try to move them,&nbsp; objects sometimes cannot be selected, objects distort when some commands are used, etc.&nbsp; As I continue drawing, I keep finding more bugs.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this problem?<br />

            <p>I would like to add one more observation, i.e., some problems still exist in Safe Mode.&nbsp; A specific example is the following.&nbsp; Draw a line either exactly horizontal or exactly vertical.&nbsp; This line can be selected by a single left or right click.&nbsp; This is
 normal.&nbsp; It cannot be selected using the Select command.&nbsp; This is not normal (at least in Word 2003 it could be done).&nbsp; Now draw a line that is skewed from the horizontal by some acute angle.&nbsp; This line can be selected by both of the above mentioned methods.&nbsp;
 This is normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other Draw problems that I have encountered in Normal mode have not recurred when I tried Safe mode.&nbsp; However, since they do not occur all the time in Normal mode, I cannot say as yet that they do not exist in Safe mode.</p>

            <p>No further replies are necessary.&nbsp; I realize that some of the Draw commands are defective.&nbsp; Also that some of the changes to the Draw commands made since Word 2003 have made drawing harder rather than easier.&nbsp; Even some poor features that were in Word 2003
 remain in Word 2013.&nbsp; One senses that whoever has been changing the Draw commands, and the entire structure of the Draw portion of Word, is not a extensive user of Draw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Draw portion of Word is a very primitive drawing system, and that is fine.&nbsp; In fact, that is one of its good points.&nbsp; As a heavy user of Word Draw (producing electrical, mechanical, and many other types of drawings) I have found that one can become very
 proficient in using it.&nbsp; There are some very elaborate and advanced free drawing programs one can download, but they are complicated and one must spend a lot of time learning them.&nbsp; This is where Word Draw is an attractive alternative choice for many types
 of drawings.&nbsp; Of course, more elaborate drawings will require the use more advanced drawing programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Microsoft has not developed Word Draw to where it should be.&nbsp; Draw in Word 6 was a disaster, and useless.&nbsp; In Word 2003 it was greatly improved and very useful.&nbsp; It had some problems, but one learned to deal with them.&nbsp; Now, in Word 2013, I see
 they have gone backwards.&nbsp; I hope in the future Microsoft will fix the problems in Word Draw, develop it further, and make it the good drawing system that it is capable of being.</p>

            The new "layout engine" in Word 2013, on top of "improvements" in graphics over the past couple of versions, has resulted in the train wreck you describe. It is a common complaint that those who design, code, and test Office products are not power users,
 and the test scenarios often don't uncover the problems before release. To some extent, identified bugs can be fixed in the next version (sometimes in the current version with a hotfix or update), but there are always going to be problems caused by designers
 whose idea of what is "logical" conflicts with the way ordinary users actually use the programs.

            Also, take a look at File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option &gt; scroll down to Show Document Content section and turn on "Show Text Wrapped within the document Window".<br />
<br />
This affects Draft view and Outline view.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for asking this question.&nbsp; Trying that setting I just found that it fixes one of my pet peeves. The odd-ball narrow wrapping of the Outline view. Since I spend a lot of time in that view it is nice to now have the line stretched across the whole screen.<br />

 that is empty, either more than one contact folder exists and one of those is empty or the AB is corrupt but that does impact "export results".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, when using the Outlook export wizard, you are provided with the option of which folder to export (3rd screen in the process)&nbsp;and a &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button would be presented (circa the 5th screen in the process - the last step in the process and
 the same window that contains the &lt;Finish&gt; button.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to plot the SAME Y-axis on BOTH sides of a chart - note I do NOT want to plot a series on a secondary axis. I simply want to replicate the Y-axis that appears on the left, and make it ALSO&nbsp;appear on the right side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Joesao,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to make the same Y-axis appear on bother left and right side of the chart. Since there is no out of the box feature in Excel 2016 to do this directly, you can try to achieve
 this by creating a secondary axis that plots same data, please try the following steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Suppose this is the data and original chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a6b76d7-17ba-49ca-8b31-c155cc750c57?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a6b76d7-17ba-49ca-8b31-c155cc750c57?upload=true" /></a><br />
2.&nbsp; Right-click on the chart and click Select Data.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; On the Select Data Source dialog box, click Add button under Legend Entries (Series).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22f0010a-aeb9-45a5-af27-2e6a520e70f3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22f0010a-aeb9-45a5-af27-2e6a520e70f3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; On the Edit Series dialog box, select the cell that is the column name as Series name, select the data series as Series values, then click OK twice.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bf09990-03c6-4320-b0d6-aed965bc87b2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bf09990-03c6-4320-b0d6-aed965bc87b2?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Click the data series we just added on the chart, from the Format Data Series pane&gt;Click Series Option&gt;Select Plot Series On Secondary Axis. We can see the same Y-axis appear on both side of the
 chart.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65af5935-2b41-406a-83fd-a3d7bb94d39e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65af5935-2b41-406a-83fd-a3d7bb94d39e?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>As a precusror to visiting Nokia Care facility it might be worth trying three key depressed power on "hard reset".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned that all user data upon device both C:\ &amp; E:\ would be deleted, but with device
<strong>off</strong> (remove battery and replace if not certain)&nbsp;keeping the&nbsp;<em><strong>volume down</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>menu</strong></em>,and&nbsp;<strong><em>camera button</em></strong>&nbsp;depressed and for 700 momentarily pressing&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">red</font>&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">phone</font>(power
 on) until first vibration felt then release, keeping other<strong>&nbsp;three</strong>&nbsp;depressed until country selection appears.</p>

<h3> rochelle2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel treating numbers as text</h2>
                    <p>Is there a default setting or some way to prevent Excel from treating numbers as text? Why does it place an apostrphe if front of numbers? Can I prevent the program fro doing this for all fields? We have automation around our Excel imports and because of
 this issue someone has to manually modify each excel import. Very poor assumption on Microsoft's part.</p>

<p>ok try this use only the first code to restore factory settings the default code is always 12345 unless you have changed it and then it would be whatever you chose it to be. those themes should work on your phone that is why i think something might be corrupted
 in the firmware and needs a bit of a motivator to situtate itself the right way. try that and let us know. als you can do code number two which will result in data loss but it will restore everything on your phone as if it were out of the box. make sure you
 do a back up first. also did you install any new apps, stuff that might be causing problems, uninstall those and see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data)<br />
Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list.<br />
2. *#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is dead proceed with reflash if not, turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
re-flash - hold the following buttons *, 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding
 all three buttons<br />
<br />
If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service.</p>

<p>Yes, Nokia, where's an answer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a 2710 after having the 2700 and I'm very disappointed in the functions -- why is the "Insert Contact Detail" missing?&nbsp; What about "Templates" for saving certain messages??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this phone actually a downgrade from the 2700? Do I need to return it or can the software that allows these functions be loaded on the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, fast start is turned off. The problem seems to be related only to Microsoft account, using local account the system works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system is freezed, after several tentative of starting a new&nbsp;process (eg press CTRL-ALT-CANC) appears a message box<span> named "Microsoft Windows" and the message is

                    I am using HP Mini laptop which has maximum screen resolution of 1024x600. But Windows 10 is best compatiable for 1024x768 or higher. So I can't able to run apps, which is one of the important feature of Windows 10. Please suggest me how to use Windows
 10 in future for the small sized laptops.<br />

            I don't know what your laptop is like, but if it's like a tiny Asus Eee, then this will make your desktop bigger than your screen (because the screen only has so many pixels) and you'll have to scroll around to see your full desktop. &nbsp;If you don't mind
 that, then great. &nbsp;If you do mind that, well, you don't need to use any apps. &nbsp;Uninstall all of them, install their desktop equivalents, and ignore the Windows store.

            <p>Mine is an old Acer Aspire AOA150 8.9" screen&nbsp; After the above registry modification I could choose 1024 x 768 and the whole desktop fits on the screen.&nbsp; It is a little bit squashed vertically but it's all there.&nbsp; I don't know about the Asus Eee - maybe
 it doesn't have&nbsp;the Intel Graphic Media Accelerator which might be necessary for it to work.</p>

            <p>You may have the scaling options setting incorrect. &nbsp;I know on most systems, users only have the option for Maintain display scaling, but this setting will scale the desktop to fit the screen, either compressing or stretching to make it fit. &nbsp;Other systems
 could have an option to Center display or Maintain aspect ratio, and I believe either could stretch the edges of the desktop past the edges of the screen.</p>

            The screen only has so many pixels (bits of the screen that can be used to represent a discrete pixel). &nbsp;If you try to have a, say, 1000 pixel display on something that only has 800 pixels, then the remaining 200 pixels are displayed "off screen" and you
 have to scroll over to get to it.

<h2>            Read Only Mode</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, all of my Office 2010 files will only open in read-only mode.&nbsp; This happens in Word, Excel, &amp; PowerPoint.&nbsp; It instructs me to save another copy, but I'm then told that I can not because I am not the administrator.&nbsp; I am the
 only person using my computer, there is only my log in, and my log in is listed as an administrator account.&nbsp; Ideally, I would like to be able to&nbsp;edit&nbsp;and save one&nbsp;copy like I was always able to do in the past.&nbsp; I have read other answers about files opening
 in read-only mode, but they are not solving my problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Try option 3 first -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
2. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />
<br />
4. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
7. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
8. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
10. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
11. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Links open in Modern version of Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Links open in Modern version of Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Why does Win 8 insist that I use IE 10 as an app??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first started using Windows 8 with my new pc, I wanted Internet Explorer to open as it always had and I finally got that to work by installing and putting the shortcut in taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is when I click links in my email, it opens the IE 10 as in desktop.&nbsp; Well, I don't like that because I use the tabs in the browser and also have Norton installed and the app does not allow for that or if it does, I have not figured it out.&nbsp; I
 do not like the way the IE app works at all.&nbsp; I want Internet Explorer to work as it always has.&nbsp; It has worked just fine until a few weeks ago it started closing down when I clicked the x to close a tab and now it does it continually.&nbsp; It closes and then
 reopens saying there was a problem with the website that caused it - not true, it was the browser that is messing up.&nbsp; Could it be an update or something that is causing this??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I was trying to place an order with Amazon and it kept taking me in circles back to a signin window.&nbsp; After several communications with Amazon and finally a phone call, we determined it was an Internet Explorer problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts or solutions out there??&nbsp; I have been to Windows Help and it gave a possible solution to make IE 10 my default program.&nbsp; Oh geez, now I am in trouble as it automatically opens the X$**!!!!&nbsp; app!!&nbsp; How do I get it to default to the IE 10 on my
 taskbar??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help out there.</p>

<p><span>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the
 software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturerâs website.</span></p>

    <title>Word - Formatting paragraphs in a table using VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gilgamesh_au  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word - Formatting paragraphs in a table using VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need some help with formatting paragraphs is a table cell using VBA</p>
<p>The table is being generated using VBA from reading a CSV file as a report with one row for each key item. There are three different paragraphs in a particular cell on each row.</p>
<p>The first paragraph needs to always be two lines high. <span>&nbsp;</span>So if the actual text is only one line then the second line appears blank.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Likewise if the text would extend to a third line then this third line is not shown at all with the text truncated at the end of the second line.</p>
<p>The second paragraph needs to always be one line high no matter how much text exists.</p>
<p>The third paragraph just shows all the text it contains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about inserting text boxes in the cells for the first two paragraphs but the VBA coding for that is a little beyond me. Particularly with getting the right height, width, and making it inline with the text (so the third paragraph appears properly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also thought about using the Left() function to trim the text down. But with different width letters in the fonts a certain size with one text string could be too long with another. Unless there is a way of determining a string length (in cm) and trimming
 it down to a fixed length (7.5 cm).<span>&nbsp; </span>But this doesnât help with the first paragraph which might need to show a blank second line. Again if I could determine the string length I could pad it with spaces to force the blank line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate suggestions on getting the formatting right using VBA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Using a bit of lateral thinking, and assuming that you want the paragraphs to split where they wrap naturally (assuming there are longer than one line), the following might work. In this case it works in cell 2 on each row.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dim oTable As Table<br />
Dim oRow As Row<br />
Dim oCell As Cell<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
Dim oNewRng As Range<br />
Set oTable = ActiveDocument.Tables(1)<br />
For Each oRow In oTable.Rows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oCell = oRow.Cells(2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oRng = oCell.Range.Paragraphs(1).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oNewRng = oCell.Range.Paragraphs(1).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oRng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Collapse wdCollapseStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=2, Extend:=wdExtend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Start = Selection.Range.End<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Collapse wdCollapseStart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oRng.InRange(oNewRng) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .End = oCell.Range.Paragraphs(1).Range.End - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set oNewRng = oCell.Range.Paragraphs(2).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oRng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Collapse wdCollapseEnd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Start = .Start + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdLine, Count:=1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Start = Selection.Range.End<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .End = oCell.Range.Paragraphs(2).Range.End - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Selection.InRange(oNewRng) Then<br />

<p>I saw many videos on YouTube showing where different and more striking effects that bring Symbian Belle. Even in the video of the new FP2 effects are better. Can those be changed?<br />
<br />
Belle Symbian Example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=wWshwXrZ8hE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

The effects of FP2 I like, since they are similar to those brought Symbian Anna.</p>

<p>you can put a lot of theme effects on your N8, there are a lot to choose from, even the ones that are like FP2 ones.</p>
<p>There are very easy to install, and it gives yor phone a better appearance&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>Hope that helps&nbsp; :)</p>

    <title>Issues with Here Drive&#43; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aje1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Here Drive&#43;</h2>
                    <p>I have long been faithful to Here from the days of OVI, etc.&nbsp; However, I am having some real issues.&nbsp; Is it just me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my old NOKIA N8, if I received a phone call whilst using the SatNav then an icon would show in (I think) the corner of the screen but I would still have the SatNav on the rest of&nbsp;the screen.&nbsp; On my Lumia 930, however, I lose the&nbsp;Drive+ screen for the
 entire duration of the call which renders it useless as a SatNav.&nbsp; Is there a way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My favourites are only listed in their groups on Here Maps; in Drive+ they are in one long list in alphabetical order.&nbsp; I have a lot of favourites and having to scroll through a long list is crazy.&nbsp; As is the necessity of going to Maps first to access the
 grouped favourites.&nbsp; Is there any way to correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, since the last update Drive+ frequently crashes.&nbsp; When I receive/make a call or text then the Drive+ always crashes.&nbsp; Judging by recent reviews in the Store I am not the only one experiencing this.&nbsp; Anyone know what's going wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I see how that renders it useless, isn't it illegal to drive and phone at the same time?</p>

</p><p>Regardless, is Heredrive enabled in the background tasks? Go to the <strong>Battery Saver</strong> app to check that out.</p>

            The HERE Drive screen is still there, in the background during a call. Hold the back arrow down, slide back to your navigation screen and tap it. You do not have to stay on the call screen.

            Thanks, but I have tried this but to no avail.&nbsp; It seems that the call screen&nbsp;"occupies" the Drive screen.&nbsp; And even if this weren't the case, I am compelled to wonder why they can't replicate what was managed on Symbian so that the SatNav screen didn't
 disappear in the first place.

            <p>Hi AJE1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in Here Drive+ and the phone rings, and you then answer the phone, press the back button on the phone. &nbsp;It will take you back to Drive+ with a banner at the top of screen showing that you are still one the phone. &nbsp;You can tap the banner to go
 to the phone app and hang up, or wait until the caller hangs up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the call ends, the phone app will be full screen again, but it will automatically go back to the previous app, in this case Here Drive+</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with lacking of group in Here Drive+ is annoying, but you would need to contact Nokia about addressing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had Drive+ crash in a long time, but I have it as a tile on the home screen so it's easy to launch.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Chris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tapping the "back" button does get my screen back on my other SatNav which suggests hat it would with the Drive+ if it weren't for the fact that it crashes.&nbsp; But this is an unsatisfactory arrangement and if it isn't necessary with my Symbian NOKIA&nbsp;N8 I don't
 see why it has to be an issue with WP.&nbsp; Sort it&nbsp;out Microsoft!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I gave up; I have bitten the bullet and bought SYGIC GPS Navigation, Maps - it was on offer with prices reduced.&nbsp; But I am annoyed at NOKIA/Here that this crashing issue has been left to fester for so long (it's clear from the reviews that I am not
 the only one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically I read today&nbsp;that there is an update for Drive+ including "bug fixes".&nbsp; Even if it did fix the crashing issue it's too late - competitor's product bought, good will lost, app deleted.</p>

<h2>            How to customize S60v3 FP2 &#40;N85&#41; home screen&#63; Anyone knows&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
Is it possible to customize the mobile home screen without any apps?<br />
I used to see my mails in the desktop, but now I can't, after a firmware update. Also, I want to remove "Ovi Share" from the desktop menu, as I don't use this service.<br />
<br />
Even if it is not possible to customize everything, is there anything that we can alter?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi arly. im also an N85 user,well when u mean homescreen do u mean that mainscreen bars on the bottom for wlan,email,ect? if so i may have a small solution,try this.</p>
<p>menu&gt;tools&gt;settings&gt;personalization&gt;standby,you can either choose horizontal or vertical icon bar to show it,and Basic to hide it away.</p>
<p>if your talking about customizing the startup,</p>
<p>settings&gt;personalization&gt;display&gt;welcome note/logo</p>
<p>as for customizing those bars on the bottom with your own things i can't tell you how.</p>
<p>try searching out there for a third party program to do so,your best bet is probably 1 of the following sites:</p>
<p>dotsis.com,ipmart-forum.com</p>
<p>mobilecastle.biz</p>
<p>(note all requires free registration as they are forums)</p>
<p>and mobile9.com</p>
<p>I hope this helped and hope your problem gets sorted.</p>
