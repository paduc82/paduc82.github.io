            <p>You should have a digital license attached to the hardware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to
 reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you reinstall the exact edition you had before?</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t block junk emails in hotmail as the sender address is nonsense - what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently getting dozens of junk emails a day and every one of them has a sender address that is basically nonsense and therefore Hotmail won't allow me to us the block sender function as it doesn't see the sender address as a valid email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop these emails coming in and is Hotmail doing anything about this as it is incredibly frustrating?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />

            <p>Yes! &nbsp;When you try to block them, it says the email isn't valid. &nbsp;It's frustrating that they can't be blocked. &nbsp;Only recourse is to delete it and that does nothing. &nbsp;They keep coming every day. &nbsp;This has been happening for a while now.</p>
<p>

            <p>The blocking options is failing to work on spam in the last few months. &nbsp;The email addresses are being formatted in a way that makes the blocking option say that the email address is not valid. &nbsp;Cannot block them. &nbsp;The format they are using is as follows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"</p>

            All they have to do is automatically send any email that cannot be parsed to junk mail. I could write this routine in 2 minutes! Please Microsoft, hire a 12 year old to fix this!

    <title>Application-Defined or Object-defined Error on Report Wizard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rose thorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application-Defined or Object-defined Error on Report Wizard</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have a database that I have set up for tracking people who apply to volunteer for my work (which works with volunteers a lot) There are these tables that I have set up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voluntermatch - where their initial information is entered, and their application is reviewed to see if they qualify to volunteer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interview - The volunteer is sent to the site and the site either accepts them or rejects them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>References - Once a site has accepted them, we have to check their references, and mark the date they are sent to orientation, date they attend orietnation, and the date that their background check, if required, comes back and if it's accepted or rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Primary Key of volunteermatch is set to be the volunteers name, as we do not want any volunteers who have already gone through the process to be pushed through as a new volunteer. If they want to change job titles, it's a much quicker simpler process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a split table, on a share drive. I have the backend hidden in a boring sounding file elsewhere on the drive, and the front end where volunteer coordinators can get to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The volunteers name is the one to one relationship that I have set to link all the tables together, as the volunteers name is the only information that stays the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make a report that takes the volunteers name from the volunteer table, if they were accepted or rejected from the interview table, and lists their references and if their references have passed from the reference table so that the members of my
 team who do the reference checks can easily print out all the volunteers who need reference checks, along with the information on who they need to call etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to use the report Wizard to pull from the different tables, I get Application-Defined or Object-defined Error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look up what this error means, but all I could find was references to code. My table uses no VBA code. It's a pretty simple database, because I have taken all of 1 and 1/3 classes on access and 1/3 class on VBA (It was a general learn a little
 of three type of programs class, the other 1/3 was excel.) All the tied tables are just tied with the look up Wizard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to make anything a trusted thingy, because I do not have the permissions on my computer, though I have been thinking of contacting IT and seeing if they could do it for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my end users suck and keep finding new and brilliant ways to break my database. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Do I need to completely re-do my database? In English, what have I done wrong that makes this error and how can I prevent it in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rose Thorn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Primary Key of volunteermatch is set to be the volunteers name, as we do not want any volunteers who have already gone through the process to be pushed through as a new volunteer. If they want to change job titles, it's a much quicker simpler process.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to make anything a trusted thingy, because I do not have the permissions on my computer, though I have been thinking of contacting IT and seeing if they could do it for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my end users suck and keep finding new and brilliant ways to break my database. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, people names are NOT good primary keys for at least three reasons: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) They may not be unique. There are people with the same name</p>
<p>2) They can change. People can get married, divorced, not like their names, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Text fields don't perform as well as numerical fields in joins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes you should redesign. Use an AutoNumber as the Primary Key (and corresponding Foreign Key) You can then use a combination of values to check to see if a volunteer has applied before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to set the database folder as a Trusted location. If you don't have permissions to do this, get IT involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to work at bulletproofing the database. This will almost certainly involve using VBA to limit what the users can type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, one to one relationships are rare. Without knowing the exact data you are trying to capture its hard to advise whether your database is designed properly. But there is a good chance its not. Tell us more about it and we can advise further.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You should Compact your database when needed, and it's sort of like doing maintenance on the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make a copy of your database. You can do that by closing out of the database, and then use Windows File Explorer to locate the database file. Press Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, and Windows will create a copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open the database back in Access, and click the Office button in the top left corner, then Manage. You should see the Compact option there. Click that, and let Access perform the compact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an article that explains a bit more about Compact:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Compact-and-repair-a-database-6EE60F16-AED0-40AC-BF22-85FA9F4005B2</p>

            <p>Ok, First, Don't accept the default name for Autonumber PKs. I always name my PKs

<p>
</p><p>tblVolunteer</p>
<p>VolunteerID (PK Autonumber</p>
<p>VolFirstName</p>
<p>VolLastName</p>
<p>SubmittedByID (FK to tblCoordinators)</p>

<p>
</p><p>tluReason</p>

<p>
</p><p>tblCoordinators</p>
<p>CoordinatorID (PK Autonumber</p>
<p>CoorFirstName</p>
<p>CoorLastName</p>
<p>CoorEmail</p>
<p>Section (?)</p>
<p>CoorNumber (?)</p>
<p>Supervisor (?)</p>
<p><em>What do the last three fields represent?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>tblReference</p>
<p>ReferenceID (PK autonumber)</p>
<p>VolunteerID (FK)</p>
<p>RefFirstName</p>
<p>RefLastName)</p>
<p>RefEmail<br />
RefAccept (Yes/No)<br />
RefNotes (memo)<br />
BackgroundReq (look up, write own, one only) (<em>What is this?</em>)<br />
BackgroundSent (date/time)<br />
BackgroundCleared (date)<br />
<em>Note: Each Reference should be its own record.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>tblOrientation</p>
<p>OrientationID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>VolunteerID (FK)</p>
<p>OrientationDate (date)</p>
<p>Attended (Yes/No)</p>
<p>Cleared (Yes/No)</p>
<p>StartNotificationSent (Date)</p>

<p>Notes (memo)</p>
<p>
</p><p>tluBranch</p>
<p>BranchID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>Branch</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I use no spaces or special characters in object names. Note that I use a prefix to indicate how a table is used. There is no point assigning autonumber PKs if you are not going to use them as FKs. Keep your field names short. You can use
 the Caption property to add a label with spaces or whatever you want to show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't use the Report Wizard to pull fields from multiple tables. Create a query first and make sure it returns the records you want. Then use the query as the source for the Report wizard.</p>

            there are phones listed that NSU supports if your phone is not listed there is no way you can update your phone's firmware/software unless you goto the nearest nokia care point<br />
<br />
i think 1200 is not supported...<br />

    <title>Corrupt unicode pst file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupt unicode pst file</h2>
                    
<p>I installed Office 2007 about a month ago and created a Unicode pst file.&nbsp; I then imported my pst file from Outlook 2002 ansi type pst.&nbsp; Been OK for over a month.&nbsp; Tried to open Outlook today and got an error saying it could not open pst file and to run
 scanpst.&nbsp; Tried several times but when it gets to step 7 of 8, it asks me if I want to make a backup of the original.&nbsp; When I click Repair, it runs another 2 minutes or so then gets an error saying the repair has stopped.&nbsp; The error in the log is 80040813.&nbsp;
 What's interesting is the pst file is just over 2GB but it is not ansi.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try ?</p>

<p>I would suggest that you might have to restore from a backup.</p>
<p>FYI, do NOT use import/export in future to move Outlook data from one machine to another.</p>
<p>Just copy the pst file and open it in Outlook. Importing causes all SORTS of problems.</p>

<h2>            Pivot Table Excel 2010 -  Subtotal and filter With only one field</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a pivot table - and I want to take the summary information for one column.&nbsp; Excel 2010 has the new subtotal and filter - where I can do custom and choose sum, average, etc.&nbsp; My question is how do&nbsp;I have them appear when it is only one thing in the
 row area.&nbsp; (If I add another level, the totals come up fine </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p><strong>Region&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Northeast</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100</p>
<p>Northeast Sum 200</p>
<p>Northeast average 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is ok&nbsp;&nbsp; -- but I really want&nbsp; (so I don't have the added level of state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Region&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Northeast</p>
<p>Northeast Sum 200</p>
<p>Northeast average 100</p>

<h3> rob_young  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues syncing Word Documents - OneDrive for BUsiness</h2>
                    <p>We seem to have an issue if a user saves a file to onedrive, it wont actually sync until they close the file. &nbsp;Unless they close it, it will not show up on the Onedrive portal. &nbsp;I also see in the Sync folder a temp word doc when they have the file open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do notice on the workstation that IS working fine, it seems to save directly to portal (when I click save, I can see a progress bar stating that it is saving to the portal and not my sync folder) and I do not see a locked file for the word doc in
 my sync folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;How do I set it that the file gets uploaded as soon as they save it?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rob_Young,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, if you synced the OneDrive for Business library to your computer, when you create a file locally and then save it to the OneDrive for Business library, the file
 will automatically appears in the OneDrive for Business library even though you keep the file open. Since the sync may take effect after refreshing the browser page, have you tried refreshing the browser page to check the outcome?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the issue you encountered, could you provide and reply to the following?<br />
</span><span>1. Doesnt the file still appear after you refreshed the browser page? It seems that you can see the file synced to the OneDrive for Business library if you close the file. Could
 you provide us with some screenshots related to the symptom of the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>To upload a screenshot, click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click <strong>Edit/Insert Media</strong>.<br />
</span><span>2. Which OneDrive for Business client are you using, OneDrive for Business 2013, OneDrive for Business 2016 or the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client?<br />
</span><span>3. Where do you create the file you see it saved directly to the OneDrive for Business library, in the other folders locally or in the local synced folder? If you create it in the
 local synced folder, it is a normal behavior that it is automatically saved to the OneDrive for Business library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

            Yes we still have the issue. &nbsp;The file does not appear on the web until we close word. &nbsp;(yes I tried refreshing). &nbsp;I will hopefully get some screenshots later today.

<p style="margin-left: 27pt"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move forward, other than providing the screenshots I mentioned above, could you also reply to the following?</span></p>
<p><span>1. Confirm which OneDrive for Business client you are using? You can refer to
</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba</span></a></span><span>
 and tell us the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Where do you create the file you see it saved directly to the OneDrive for Business library,
 in the other folders locally or in the local synced folder?</span><span> For OneDrive 2013/2016, if you modify a file in the local synced folder, it will be directly saved to the cloud. For the OneDrive Next Generation Sync Client, if you modify
 a file in the local synced folder, you will see two different scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. If you check
<strong>Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong>, the changed file will be saved to the cloud directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. If you uncheck
<strong>Use Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong>, the changed file will be saved locally first and then changes will be synced to the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span>So please also confirm if you have checked the checkbox.</span></p>

    <title>Filter-out News from the SharePoint Home based on a rule - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guisolan raphael  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filter-out News from the SharePoint Home based on a rule &#40;metadata&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>The story</strong></p>
<p>We are building an intranet based on the communication sites.</p>
<p>On the intranet portal, we are displaying news stored only in the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
current </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">site </span>(site pages).</p>
<p>The news are displayed using the news webpart (out-of-the-box).</p>
<p>The news are displayed in different news webpart on the right or left or to the top or at the bottom based on some additional metadata.</p>
<p>By the same way using a metadata "intranet publish date", we a scheduling the appearance of some news in the future. To be precise, the redactors set a intranet publish date for the next week, click immediately on "publish" and the news will be only displayed
 the next week.</p>
<p>Till this point, it works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The downside is starting with the SharePoint Home (sharepoint.aspx) which is of course not taking care of our "intranet publish date". Same problem with any news webpart using "recommended for the user" as source. The results is that some news that are in
 "published" state but where the "intranet publish date" isn't reach, those news are already displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>Are the results of the sharepoint.aspx based on the default result source (Local SharePoint Results) of sharepoint-online or are the results of this page based on Graph?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>In the case where the results are SharePoint-Search base</strong><strong>d)</strong> In order to get rid of this news on the sharepoint.aspx, my idea was to try filtering-out the news directly from the Result Source on the
 Search Service level based on our "intranet publish date" metadata. Does someone already achieve something similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>In the case when the results are Graph based)</strong> In the case where the sharepoint.aspx is based on Graph, is there any way to filter-out some results based on metadata?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Sorry about the inconvenience caused by this issue.</p>
<p>Per your saying, you have set a date metadata for the News pages but the News will be published in the Home.aspx even if the date isn't reach.</p>
<p>We would like to perform the test on our side, if its convenient for you, could you share us the reproduce steps? That will be a great help.</p>

<p>Hi Alex</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our Intranet Portal, we used a "Page properties" Filter on the "News" Webpart with the following condition:&nbsp;<strong>Intranet Publish Date</strong> Before
<strong>[Today]+1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that is at the moment fully normal that the SharePoint Home News are not taking account of our "publish date" metadata, as the sharepoint.aspx is provided by Microsoft with the "News from sites" section displaying items based on Graph, without any
 option to add a filter as on the modern webpart "news" of a communication site.</p>
<p>Therefore, i was thinking about "filtering" those news based on the custom "intranet publish date" at the search engine level, before that they get into the index. Is there anyway to do that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, is there any way to deactivate the "News from Sites" section on the /_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx page of SharePoint Online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Guisolan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to your concerns:</p>
<p>1.Techically it could be achieved with search scheme, but that might take some complicated steps, I would kindly suggest you raise another thread in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a> to seek for a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Per my research, you should be able to disable the "News from Sites" by following the method in this thread:</p>

<h2>            How to access an ex-employee&#39;s OneDrive for Business on Office 365 Small Business&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am sure this has been asked previously, but we have an Office 365 Small Business account and a user has left the company and we need to access her ODFB files. I am global tenant admin.</p>
<p>What is the right way to access this? The usual method I've used in other tenants (i.e. Enterprise tenants) &nbsp;is not available because Small Business tenants do not have the "Profile Admin" and therefore I don't have any direct way to grant myself access
 to the user's account.</p>
<p>I suppose I could reset her password and "login as her" but this seems like there should be a better way to do this. Any help/advice appreciated.</p>

<p>Bob</p>

You can try to reset the Internet Explorer setting:
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Start Internet Explorer. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the </span><strong><span>Tools</span></strong><span> menu, click
</span><strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the </span><strong><span>Advanced</span></strong><span> tab, click
</span><strong><span>Reset</span></strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the </span><strong><span>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</span></strong><span> dialog box, click
</span><strong><span>Reset</span></strong><span> to confirm. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
I suggest running Internet Explorer without add-ons by clicking <br />
Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Internet Explorer (No add-ons)<br />
Then you can revisit the website to see if it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also perform a clean boot to make sure startup programs aren't causing the issue.<br />
After the computer restarts without the startup programs, you can try using the website your need.<br />
Here's an article on that:<br />

<h3> straven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 failing to install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Internet Explorer 11 keeps failing to install on my system, which is Windows 7, 64 bit, SP1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've determined why this is happening and cannot resolve it, any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently you need all the pre-requisites mentioned here <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2847882</a>&nbsp;to actually successfully install IE 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have them all installed except for 2670838, I receive an error message that this 'Update is not applicable to your system' whenever I try to install it (64 bit version).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my windows updater is stuck in a loop, it continually tries to install IE 11, but fails each time due to the fact 2670838 is not applicable to my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE Microsoft take a look at this.</p>

    <title>Access 2010&#58; Clicking subform removes custom ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterbda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010&#58; Clicking subform removes custom ribbon</h2>
                    My Access 2010 form has a custom ribbon and three subforms (continuous forms), each linked via pass through queries to SQL server queries. When I click on a record in the first subform the other two subforms show details of the selected record. This works
 ok. However, as soon as I click a record on the first subform, my custom ribbon disappears and is replaced by the default ribbon. I have other forms with subforms (admittedly only one per form) and this problem does not occur. I canot see any differences in
 the properties of the (sub)forms. The problem still occurs if I remove all the code in the Form_current event of the first subform.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions welcome.

            I have just solved this myself. Problem was that the focus was remaining with the subform. Returning the focus to the main form at the end of the Form-current event of the subform solved this.

<h2>            How to loop through cell ranges calculating datediff</h2>
                    <p>I have a question on regard to calculating date difference in days, looping through a cell range. This is the code that I have come up with but it only calculates for the first record on the spreadsheet. Im totally missing the looping function to go through
 each of the rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a button on the spreadsheet that when clicked it references the below macro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
Sub Test2()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' Select cell A2, *first line of data*.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Range("A2").Select<br />

<p><br />
Then download and install the app by opening this URL on your phone:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ce3895c7-01d0-4daf-a4c3-25c10463942d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ce3895c7-01d0-4daf-a4c3-25c10463942d</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will give you the access point option in Settings.</p>
