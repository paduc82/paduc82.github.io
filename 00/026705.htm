    <title>Unread mail, disapears as soon as I open it. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aviator_spartan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unread mail, disapears as soon as I open it.</h2>
                    <p>I was cleaning/organizing my inbox. I had a lot of unread mails so I filtered to get only the "unread" displayed.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>I had 8 pages of "unread" mail and I jumped to the last page to start reading/moving/deleting the older mails. When I clicked on the last unread mail, it opened (for about one second), and then I got back to the message list again (and that mail, wasn't
 on the "unread" list anymore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to repeat the procedure on the fist page of "unread" mails and had no problem at all. I just have the problem on pages, other than the first!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused! What can it be? How can I solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty annoying when you are trying to organize your mails, and they just get "read" without being "read" and properly dealt!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out?! Please?</p>

<p>We are sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We are happy to hear that, after changing the option under&nbsp;<strong>"default view after moving or deleting email"</strong> option selected to
<strong>"my message list"</strong> you are able to read the unread messages before it is deleted. As per the design, the performance may vary from option to option. I recommend you to continue using the same option for viewing unread messages in the mail.</span></p>

<h2>            web app not working in IE11 for 1 user profile unless it is in inPrivate</h2>
                    <p>We have 1 user who can only get these certain apps on our website to work in inPrivate mode.&nbsp; If she logs in as administrator or a different user on the same machine, it works.&nbsp; If she uses her login on a different machine, it works.&nbsp; If she uses Chrome,
 it works.&nbsp; If she logs into her machine as herself and then uses "run as administrator" for IE, it does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have deleted all the temporary files, cookies, cache, etc and did the reset to factory settings.&nbsp; Still does not work for her.&nbsp; What happens is she fills in the form to log in and once she hits login, the form empties and she is back to a blank form.&nbsp;
 No error or anything, just doesn't go anywhere.&nbsp; If she uses an incorrect password or username, it will give an error.&nbsp; So it seems to be taking the data, just not going anywhere with it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on web app.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happen when you trying to access the web app?<br />
Are you getting any error message?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run that website as trusted website:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press Windows key+R.<br />
b.&nbsp;Type inetcpl.cpl and press enter.<br />
c.&nbsp;Click on security tab.<br />
d.&nbsp;Click on trusted sites.<br />
e.&nbsp;Click on sites.<br />
f.&nbsp;Click in box and add the website.<br />
g.&nbsp;Click on close and then apply and then ok.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> As you already tried to reset the Internet Explorer, so try to restart the computer in safe mode and check if it helps:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting the computer in safe mode, then perform clean boot and check if it helps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />

<h2>            Multiple Office 365 Apps stuck on &#34;Setting Up&#34;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I set up Azzure AD Connect and today after assigning E3 licenses to myself (admin) multiple apps including Word and Excel have been stuck on "Setting Up" for more than 2 hours. I have removed the license and added it again and the issues persists.
 This same issue happened for a second user that I set up. I would guess it happens to all users in our organization. Before today both of these users were setup with only cloud sign in and all apps were working. What needs to be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this also have something to do with my second issue, which is that I can't sign in to Skype for business anymore. I am also unable to see myself as a user in the Skype Administration section of the Office 365 Admin, even-though I have checked to make
 sure that that license is on for that user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Endri.</p>

            Hi there Joshua,<br /><br />Are you able to access your work emails from home?<br /><br />If you aren't able to, and depending on how your IT team have this configured, you should be able to go to portal.office.com and login with your work account and download the office application however I cannot confirm this as I don't know what the setup is.<br /><br />I would advise asking your IT Team

            Best option would be to check for a code, i am not sure there would be anything withing outlook 2011 mac to do so, all i can think off is to add the signature withing the main document in word.

<p>
</p><p>I am able to reproduce the problem. I looked into the HTML code that is generated and it turns out that the file name is coded incorrectly. The file name of the picture comes through as image/PNG instead of image.PNG in the resulting mail merge message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can report this as a bug to Microsoft. To do so, while your Mac has a live internet connection, go to the Help menu in Outlook and choose the Send Feedback option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, a work-around is to include the picture in your Word document instead of relying on Outlook to append it for you automatically.</p>

<h2>            Problem with advanced search in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2010 (32 bit) on Windows 7 (64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a short macro that searches (using a DASL filter) an&nbsp;Outlook&nbsp;folder for emails where the sender name or sender email address&nbsp;contains, eg, "john".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then load the results into a table using "GetTable".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then add a column to the table, in my case being the sender email address, using...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">MyTable.Columns.Add ("<a href="http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x0065001f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x0065001f</a>")</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test this, I have a loop that displays two message boxes for each email in turn, showing first the subject and then the senders' email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to the problem....When I run the macro for the first time after opening Outlook, I get what I expect, which is two message boxes per found email, showing me the subject and then the email address of the sender. If I then run the macro again, however,
 I still get the message box with the subject but the message box that should show the email addresses merely shows blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone think of a possible explanation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Selecting Photo Attachments for Report</h2>
                    I have a database that has an attachment field with multiple photos inside. I would like to be able to select 3 or 4 photos in form view and then be able to print these photos out in a report. Right now, I have a report that has 4 separate photo fields
 displayed on a report, all of which are based on the attachment field in my table. Each field in the report displays the first photo that was added to the attachment field when I was inputting them into my table. Is there a way to have the 4 photo fields in
 my report display different photos and then be able to print this out?

            A far more efficient way to associate images with records in a table is to store the paths in a column of text data type in a related table.&nbsp; This then enables images to be selectively loaded into an image control in a report at runtime.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at Images.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
The file ImagesOnDemand.accdb in the zip archive includes a facility in the form to 'View Selected Records' to select specific images associated with each record to be returned in a report.<br />

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information. I should've stored my photos the you suggested. However, I am stuck with hundreds of photos wrapped up in an attachment data type field and would prefer not to go back and assign an image path to each record manually. Is there
 a way to pull each photo out of the attachment where it is it's own record? I tried querying them out and come up with the screen shot ive attached. However, this method no longer lets me view the photos.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d466b4e-264b-4808-b1a3-05698f40322f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d466b4e-264b-4808-b1a3-05698f40322f?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><blockquote>Is there a way to pull each photo out of the attachment where it is it's own record?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably the last man to ask as I've always used the method illustrated in my demo to associate images with records, so I'm not familiar with how attachment fields can be manipulated.&nbsp; I'd expect it to be possible as its such an obvious requirement,
 and others more familiar with this type of field may have an answer, but everything I've tried displays the first image multiple times rather than the separate images.<br />
<br />
I did achieve the end result you are looking for some years ago when I was asked to look at a museum catalogue database which used attachment fields.&nbsp; The way I did it was basically to replicate the model used in my demo of having each image per parent record
 in an attachment field in a row of its own in a related table.&nbsp; I've experimented to see if it would be possible using conventional decomposition techniques to append the images from a multi-image attachment field in one row into separate rows in a related
 table, but without success I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
I hope someone more knowledgeable than I about attachment fields will be able to help, but I've always eschewed multi-valued fields of any sort because of their fundamental departure from the principles of the database relational model.<br />

            Thanks for trying! If I am to manually plug in all my photos again, or plugging in photos in the future, you would suggest the field type be a path to the image location rather than an attachment field type? Even if there is only one attachment per record?

<p>HI,</p>
<p>First thing you really need to do is store the path as a text field rather than use the 'attachment' data type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a copy of the photo's in a folder, and you do have the file name in the table (as shown), you should be able to append the path to the file name and remove the attachment i.e. store the path/filename instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only have the photo's as the attachment then you will need to save the photo's to a folder first and, as above, append the path to the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving each attachment one at a time would be time consuming considering you have 'hundreds'. the following code will get you started to export all photo's to a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To display the photo/image in the report you can use an image control with the control source set to the appropriate field name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps?</p>

</p><p>Absolutely.&nbsp; If there can be only one image per record then store the path in a column in the main table, as in my Images_Simple.accdb file.&nbsp; Otherwise store the path in a column in a related table as in the other two files in my demo.</p>

            Okay. I am still a little confused on how to take the image path and display the photos on a form or report. Are you able to achieve this with your basGetFilepath module on your ImagesOnDemand database?

<p>Hi Cole_804,</p>
<p>The recordsource for the report or form must contain the text field which has the image path/name as it's data. As I said in the previous post:</p>
<p><span>"To display the photo/image in the report you can use an image control with the control source set to the appropriate field name" i.e. the one which contains the image path/name.</span></p>
<p><span>So... place an image control on your report or form and set it's control source to that field.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should get it working first as above until you understand how it works, then add all the extra's in Ken's dbase ... start simple and build on that.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The GetFilePath function in the basGetFilePath module is a simple little function which uses the FileDialog method of the Application object to browse to an image file.&nbsp; In the relevant form it is called to assign the path to the ImagePath column in the
 table.&nbsp; You can see more easily how it is used in the Images_Simple demo:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cmdAddImage_Click()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo Err_Handler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strPath As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' open 'file open' dialogue and get path to selected file<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strPath = GetFilePath()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(strPath) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.ImagePath = strPath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.ctrlImage.Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.lblNoImage.Visible = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Exit_here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Err_Handler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
You should copy the module into our own database.&nbsp; You'll then be able to use code like the above when associating a record with an image.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; Images_Simple file the code assigns the path to a column in the Addresses table.&nbsp; In the other files the model
 is different, to allow multiple images to be associated with each record.&nbsp; In this the paths are stored in an Images table and the many-to-many relationship type between the Addresses table and the Images table is modelled by an Addresses_Images table which
 resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types in the usual way.&nbsp; When you browse to an image file the code first checks to see if the path already exists in the Images table before inserting a row into the Addresses_Images table.<br />
<br />
If the relationship type between the Addresses table and the Images table were one-to-many, i.e. each image can only be associated with one record, then the Addresses_Images table would be unnecessary and the Images table would have an AddressID foreign key
 column referencing the primary key of Addresses.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reorganized my photo data and now have a separate table containing individual IDs and an image path to the photos I want to display in a report using an image control. I have 4 photos for each&nbsp; individual ID. Each photo appears as I want it to in Report
 View and even Print Preview. However, when I print the report not all photos print. Additionally, the photos that either print or don't print are not consistent. For example, on printing occasion 1, photos 1 and 2 will print while 3 and 4 do not. Then, on
 printing occasion 2, photos 1 and 4 will print but not 2 and 3. In the image property sheet I have messed with Picture Type and Size Mode but it doesn't seem to help with the randomness associated with which photo prints/doesn't print in the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same set up again, only instead of using an image path field I went back to an attachment type field. Using this method, all 4 photos display in the report as well as print out. I could go on and use this method but I have been advised to stay
 away from the attachment data types and I would like to know if and how I can correct the image path/ image control method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word Mac 16.16.10 Unusual template format and automatic TOC generator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> disciphone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Mac 16.16.10 Unusual template format and automatic TOC generator</h2>
                    <p>Hi. As I mentioned, I'm using Word for Mac, version 16.16.10. I need to take an existing, 300-page document that was created by combining Word document created multiple users using different formats into a document with very specific formatting. I have tried
 copying and pasting before and sometimes some of the formats persist. I doubt that I can change that other than manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that I will need to set up a new document and there is a tricky bit I need help with. The author wishes to have his main chapter title written out and the chapter descriptor in 14 pt. bold and the next level in 12-point bold, but with "chapter-number.section"
 preceding it. BUT he doesn't want to maintain numbering after that. So Word fights with me about the numbers preceding the section. Here is an example of his desired format:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p>
<p><strong>Understanding Democracy (14-point)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.1 Definitions of Democracy (12-point)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Schools of Democratic Thinking </strong></em><strong>(12-point)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Participatory Democracy (12-point)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.2 Democracy Versus Autocracy (12-point)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found a way to enter the numbers without Word trying to take over and if I try to use Word then it wants to do the numbering in a way that doesn't match what he wants.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2 is that, given the type and length of the document and the fact that it will ultimately be posted online, I would like to have Word correctly generate the TOC for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After struggling to do otherwise, I realize that my best course is to start a new document that works with Word's preferences as much as possible and paste, section by section, text into the new format. It will be laborious as I will have to check each section
 to be sure the formatting has remained the same (some section want to default to single-spaced, some want to change the numbering for footnotes from superscripts to plain text, etc.), but I am giving up on making the kluge that I received work within Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the solution is not a simple one and help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>The first level numbering occurs in the headings that look like <strong>Chapter 7</strong>. The second level looks like
<strong>7.1 Definitions of democracy</strong>. For the first level, the number appears to the right of the text instead of the left, where you normally see numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the necessary information is in my article and the one to which I link, about the Windows version of outline numbering. The idea is that you create styles without numbering first. Then you use the outline numbering method to add numbering to those styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word has an outline view, which is often used by writers to create a hierarchy of ideas. Each heading style has a text level that corresponds to an outline level in outline view.</p>

<h2>            Cursor moves too far down page after pressing Return &#40;space between lines become virtually page length&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, I'll be on a blank page in word 2016. lets say I write a sentence&nbsp;or even a paragraph. I then press Enter or Return, and the cursor is sent all or most of the way down the page I am on, so I can no longer see my previous writing.
</p>
<p>The more I write on the page the more the writing condenses until finally I can see my previous text/graphs etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press Return over and over again, then go to the top of the page it's not a problem, but it's entirely dissatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going to the Design tab, and changing the Paragraph Spacing to No Paragraph Spacing. But it makes no difference. I've never come across this ever before in Microsoft word, its very peculiar. And extremely irritating and disconcerting when you
 are trying to write a report or an essay. </p>

Dan 394</a>. Are you still getting this error code? If yes, do you receive it while trying to update your phone's software or while updating an application? Also, does it happen regardless of your connection? We'll wait for your reply.

    <title>Can&#39;t edit a spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drswim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t edit a spreadsheet</h2>
                    Ok, I'm in a business setting and really don't have a lot of time to sit around and poke with this. :(<br />
I have an Active Directory user that is trying to edit a spreadsheet on a network drive. Though the problem
<br />
lies here.... It is only happening at one machine. I login as this user on this specific machine, open the excel spreadsheet<br />
with Office 2007. I notice it's read-only and I can't edit it without making a local copy. So I log off that machine and go to
<br />
another machine... Login again with the same username and password... Find where the excel spreadsheet is again and I open it.<br />
When I open it on another machine, shazam, it works. I can make all the edits I would ever want.<br />
<br />
I checked the permissions. Everything seems fine. Both local user permissions are set to administrator.<br />
I'm a bit confused as to what is going on. Both machines are running the same version of Office 2007.
<br />
Both are running on the same operating system (Windows XP).<br />
<br />

<p>It sounds like you have somehow changed your screen resolution.</p>
<p>Start - Control panel - Display, then click the settings tab. Select the native resolution of your monitor by using the slider. If you are using an old crt type display start at 1024x768 and work upwards until you find the resolution you want.</p>

</p><p>Hi<br />
<br />
Outlook 2016 for Mac stores messages and other items, such as calendar events, contacts, tasks, and notes, as a SQLite database in the /Users/username/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles folder.<br />
<br />
To view the location, you need to first unhide the Library folder.<br />
<br />
Look at the thread&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/where-does-outlook-2016-store-its-data/303fc791-f7d1-4cd7-86a6-bc4c897b26a4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/where-does-outlook-2016-store-its-data/303fc791-f7d1-4cd7-86a6-bc4c897b26a4</a><br />

    <title>full system backup and restore in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edman_946  say:</h3>
<h2>            full system backup and restore in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a WD 1TB drive with windows 10 build 14295 installed plus a few other programs. (130GB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I usually do is run disk cleanup, open a command prompt (admin) and type chkdsk /f</p>
<p>after the reboot open a&nbsp;command prompt (admin) and type sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I connect a second WD 1TB drive and use Acronis True Image WD edition</p>
<p>to clone disk1 to disk2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acronis allows me to create a bootable cd that can be used to restore from disk2 to disk1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easy way to do this in windows 10, without using Acronis True Image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And/Or create a partition image, resized to fit on a smaller drive.</p>
<p>currently only 130GB is used on the 1TB drive.</p>
<p>I have a spare 250GB drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try booting with the WD Acronis media and saving a IMAGE instead of cloning... You can save an awful lot of images on the spare 1TB drive...</p>
<p>That 130GB of used space may compress to half that much, depending on the type of files..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then just Recover the image to any drive you choose to use... as long as it has enough free space... Acronis will resize the image to fit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a tool that will create backup images, but it is limited to restoring to a drive of the same size, and if you are lucky, a larger one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually works well if you use it within it's limitations...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just be advised that the WD Acronis will not function if you don't have a WD drive hooked up... This applies to the bootable media as well...</p>

    <title>Backup still not working on Windows Phone Lumia 640 XL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup still not working on Windows Phone Lumia 640 XL</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 640 XL with Windows Phone 8.1 reminds me to back up, but when I try it fails every time. The backup progress bar takes a LONG TIME (odd since the settings are such a small file), then it stalls out at 96% every time. After several minutes I get
 an error message saying "The server connection was lost and the backup failed." Is this still a bug in Windows Phone OS or is it a problem with OneDrive server? Why don't they give us the option of backing up settings to the SD card?</p>

            You can try backing up things in stages like first backup your apps and settings then backup your txt messages then your photos that works for me but its worth checking to see if the backup really failed or your just getting that message as some old apps
 don't get backed up hence the message but when people actually check it has worked

<p>Hi Steve, <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that the OneDrive server is not responding that's why every time you back up your phone's settings it fails. Just to isolate this, please answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if the latest OS build version is installed on your phone? To check, just go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Phone update &gt; Check for updates</strong>.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response. </p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone says it is up to date. It is set for automatic updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using 8.1 because I have not gotten a reply to my previous message re: concerns about Win 10.</p>

<p>At this point, we advise you perform a soft reset by just pressing and holding the power and volume down buttons at the same time until your phone restarts. This will refresh your phone's software, and it won't lose anything on your phone.

<p>

<br />
It's most likely that your carrier has not yet authorized the release of the latest updates for your phone.&nbsp; Best bet would be to contact them (or the manufacturer of your phone) and ask when the updates will be available.
