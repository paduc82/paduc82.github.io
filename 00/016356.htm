<h2>            Unable to configure Office 365 account on a Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company I work for change our Echange account for an Office 365 account. This caused me different problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Since the switch, I haven't been able to use Apple Mail on my Mac which is really frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. January 31st 2019, my calendar stopped appearing in BusyCal. It seems I'm having a login issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. January 31st 2019, the application BusyContacts stopped working. It seems I'm having a login issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me solve those issues? The only app that works right now is Outlook Mac, which I never use and I don't want to use it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p />

            Hi  Benoit, 
<br />I'm a Independent Advisor to the Outlook.com community,
<br />You have come to the support site for <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />If outlook is working the way it should I would suggest that you reach out to 
<br />BusyCal for support of their application or contact your IT department for the correct settings that you need to set up your account on BusyCal

<p>Hi Isamis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already contacted my company's IT support. They are not familiar with Mac and they were not able to assist me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also contacted BusyMac. They have been very responsive and they are trying to figure out the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the issue with Apple Mail that doesn't work since we switched to Office 365 account. That seems to be the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point since this is a Microsoft product I thought they could provide help. Apple Mail works perfectly with other email accounts. The only one that has issues is the Microsoft one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Benoit, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your posting here, based on your description, since your Office 365 account works well on Outlook for Mac, your Office 365 account should be okay, If it doesn't work in mail app for Mac, please try the following steps to manually configure your
 Office 365 account on mail app for Mac to see the result.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Choose Mail &gt; Preferences and go to the Accounts pane.</span></li><li><span>Select your Exchange account from the list of accounts.</span></li><li><span>Click the Server Settings tab.</span></li><li><span>Deselect the "Automatically manage connection settings" checkbox.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You can then enter the internal and external server information manually.</span></li></ol>
<p>Internal URL:&nbsp;<strong>outlook.office365.com</strong></p>
<p>External&nbsp;URL:&nbsp;<strong>outlook.office365.com</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, I still suggest you contact the BusyCal for support and Apple mail support, they should have dedicated channel to check the issue about their product, you can also share it here if there is any updates,. Your time and understanding will
 be appreciate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion in Apple Mail, BusyCal and BusyContacts and sadly it doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll contact Apple to see if they can help. I'll update this post if I find a solution.</p>
<p>

            Hello Benoit, <br />
<br />
I am sorry to hear that your Office 365 for business account does not work with Apple Mail and BusyCal at all. I know how important this is to you as it can be very disruptive to your work, rest assured, I am committed to help you to resolve this issue together
 with you expeditiously. <br />

<br />
In order for me to help you properly, I have a few clarifications to make: <br />
<br />
1. Do you have <strong>two-step verification</strong> enabled in your Microsoft account?
<br />
2. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
3. For Apple Mail, what is the <strong>error message?</strong> <br />
<br />
<em><strong>If you do not have two-step verification enabled,</strong></em> I suggest you to try to
<strong>authenticate your Microsoft account with a browser</strong> (i.e. Safari) first before setting it up with your applications. The security algorithms may have been throttling your login attempts for unrecognised device/unfamiliar network.
<br />
<br />

https://account.live.com/Activity</a> <em>(I'm sorry, I don't know if this link will work for a business Microsoft account, because I'm more specialised for Outlook.com)</em>
<br />
<br />
Or else, just <strong>enable two-step verification.</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong><em>If you have two-step verification enabled,</em></strong> you need to use an
<strong>app password</strong> to log into those apps. <br />
<br />

            Hi Benoît,
<br />I'm very confuse in what your are writing If your having problems setting it up are you using the correct setting for the server to access your email. That is where your IT department comes it they would have to provide you with the exchange account information for set up If they cannot provide then please read the document below. 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/server-settings-you-ll-need-from-your-email-provider-c82de912-adcc-4787-8283-45a1161f3cc3#bkmk_olko365b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/server...</a>
<br />As its an Exchange account you are setting up you may want to contact your IT department to confirm as it is not an outlook appliction problem as you have previouly stated it is working. It then becomes an exchange problem which is your companies back end envionment. 
<br /><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT201951</a> 
<br />All the problem would stem from the actual setting on the application to the exchange account. 
<br />Hope this helps you resolve your problem please let me know. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<div>Hi Sutharsan,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks you for your time!</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. I don't know I have two-step verification enabled in my Microsoft account. If I activate that will it be more complicated to get my emails and such?</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. So far I removed the BusyCal account a few times and I added it back, It didn't make any difference. Have been in contact with the developer, BusyMac, and they are trying hard to solve it but nothing seems to work. For Apple Mail I mostly tried to get
 help from our IT support department, but they were not able to assist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Apple Mail just keep asking me to enter the password, which I know, and every time I enter the password it tells me it's wrong.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Review your Recent Activity</div>
<div>I tried it. The link opened, I clicked to get a phone verification code, but I never received it. Prior to that I validated that my iPhone number is correctly entered in my Microsoft account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your answer is the best so far, but the issue is not resolved yet. I'll try to gather more info and if something change I'll let you know.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much Sutharsan!</div>

</p><p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT did give me the server. I added it in Apple Mail, BusyCal and BusyContacts but it did not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only app that works with the Office 365 business account is Outlook. This is sad because Outlook is probably the worst software in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for my IT department, the problem is not on their end since Outlook works, even if all the other apps are not working anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Sam and have a great day!</p>

            Hello Benoit,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply and compliments. It makes me feel very motivating to help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />1. Yes, if you enable two-step verification, it will be very troublesome in the long outlook but it is also a shortcut way to get this issue resolved right now.
<br />
<br />Though, with all methods, it is important for you to be able to pass Microsoft verification. It is a serious matter that you failed your phone verification.
<br />
<br />Since you are a business user, can you please contact Microsoft Support about this? See: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&amp;tabs=phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admi...</a>
<br />
<br />2/3. Please check with your IT Administrator on your account login attempt logs for the actual reason. It is highly likely the security algorithms is throttling your login attempts. Applications do not support phone verification, and Microsoft wants you to pass its phone verification. That is the reason why you have to authenticate your account with your web browser first before setting it up with applications.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps!
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />Sutharsan

    <title>Multiple animation options triggered by button clicks and continuing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple animation options triggered by button clicks and continuing the animation from the new position</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
Not sure if what I am trying to do is doable without the use on multiple slides, but nonetheless I'll give a description anyway.<br />
<br />
I have an image which is controlled by 4 trigger buttons allowing it to move up, down, left and right. What I would like to do is after having clicked one of the buttons to move the image, I would like to be able to click another button to move it from it's
 new location to another location based on the new location.<br />
<br />
So it would look like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
A goes from:<br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />
to</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;A (after clicking the left arrow button, and returns to)<br />
<br />
A (after clicking the right arrow button)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that is a clear enough explanation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</p>

            Of course, this is doable with VBA, but that, of course, requires VBA. If you want to do this with trigger animations, I think you want to have copies of the image in its different locations. You can then use appear and disappear animations. Clicking on
 a button should trigger the correct version of the image to appear and the incorrect ones to disappear. This is already a lot of trigger animations. But&nbsp; now, if I understand you correctly, you want to be able to move based on the previous location. This is
 much harder. I think this would require appear and disappear animations on your arrow buttons. If I understand correctly, you will have a shape that can have four different locations. If it is in the top right and the left arrow is clicked, you want to move
 it to the top left, but if it is in the bottom right and the left arrow is clicked, you want to move it to the bottom left. That means that anything that moves the shape to the top needs to make a left arrow button appear that moves the shape to the top left,
 and anything that moves the shape to the bottom needs to make a left arrow appear that moves the shape to the bottom left. Using triggers, you are going to end up with dozens of animations to cover about a dozen different shapes. VBA is looking better all
 the time. The whole thing could probably be done with about a dozen lines of code.<br />

            <p>I've personally found the Win 10TP filesystem to be very unstable.&nbsp; After upgrading my original installation to the recent build, I would encounter CHKDSKs and unbootability practically on a daily basis.&nbsp; I would end up running CHKDSK on Win10 from my Win8.1
 installation just do it would boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even then, I frequently got the error message that problems were encountered, a reboot would give me the Diagnosing message, and a long time later, it would finally boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running from an SSD, so I got fedup and reinstalled to a hard drive -- which had less problems.&nbsp; Then I read about installing KBs 3021937 and 3020114 (the latter to address SSD problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've installed these, I have not encountered any more filesystem problems, despite repeated reboots (to force filesystem tests).&nbsp; But, it's only been a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Minitool Partition Wizard Boot CD ISO file can be used to create a bootable CD that can then be used to run a Check on the filesystem, which forces CHKDSK to run, and might get the filesystem into good enough shape that you can reboot it and install
 these Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need another PC to do this, and since this is an ISO file, to make a bootable USB stick from it, you would need an app to do that.</p>

            &nbsp;I suspect the button to actually save is below the bottom of your screen. Try moving the dialog box up. Try double-clicking on the top to maximize it. Try adjusting your screen resolution to a higher setting.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you could just put the name you want to use, select the file format, and press the enter key. I suspect it would work. The Save button is the default active button.<br />

            Unfortunately not. They talk about resizing the picture (number of pixels) and not about the jpg compression ratio.

<h2>            Word and Excel files slow to process and open from One Drive on a Mac</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to speed up the processing and opening of Word and Excel files synced to One Drive? &nbsp;Files which have not been synced and only exist locally open many, many times faster. &nbsp;The advertising for OneDrive suggests files are stored locally as well
 as in the cloud, for speedy access when offline. &nbsp;Is this not in fact true? &nbsp;Why does Word not open the local file and sync in the background, instead of always waiting for the cloud copy to open, which takes time over an average-speed broadband connection?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'll try this, thanks. &nbsp;But my question wasn't about being offline. &nbsp;It was about being online, but the files, which ought, I thought, to be stored locally and synced to the cloud, always being downloaded from the cloud before being opened, with long Processing
 and Downloading times. &nbsp;How can I redirect Finder or OneDrive to open the local file and not the cloud one, when online, and to sync from the local file to the cloud one in the background?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Zixuan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that making the files available offline has not made them quicker to open. &nbsp;It just took me 40 seconds to open a Word file that I had selected and was marked as "Always keep on this device", and the same time for an Excel file. &nbsp;When I go offline,
 the process is much quicker - between 3 and 7 seconds - so it seems that making them available offline does not change the way they open when online - it still takes an unacceptable amount of time to get them from the cloud. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked for more info. &nbsp;Here it is.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Your detailed OS version: 10.14.2</span></li><li><span>Your Office version: 16.20 (181208)</span></li><li><span>OneDrive sync client version; 18.240.1202.0003</span></li><li><span>The a</span><span>pproximate time required to open a file: see above, about 40 seconds when online; 3-7 when offline.</span></li></ol>
<p>

<p>Dear Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you enabled File On-Demand, there should be three kinds of files in your OneDrive sync folder: Online-only files, Locally available files and Always available files. Regarding Online-only files,&nbsp;it doesn’t download to your device until you open it. Therefore,
 it maybe take longer to open. However, we tested in our end but failed to get such big gap(between 40s and 7s) as you.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Given this situation, we would like to suggest you try the following suggestions and share the results with us.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please switch to another network environment to see the outcome.</li><li>Please follow the steps in<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/OneDrive-for-Mac-FAQ-3fc4062c-8051-4392-bff1-551e32840cd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this article</a> to reset OneDrive app.</li><li>Please <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">open Mac in safe mode</a> and open the files in OneDrive sync folder to see the outcome.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Zichuan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following your instructions, files definitely opened quicker in Safe Mode. &nbsp;Once Word or Excel were running, an Excel file took about 10 seconds each time and a Word one 4 seconds. &nbsp;I did not reinstate&nbsp;<span>Files On-Demand in OneDrive for Mac.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will now restart in ordinary mode and see if anything changes, letting you know if it does.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will also reinstate&nbsp;<span>Files On-Demand in OneDrive for Mac.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But you still haven't explained how OneDrive works: are files stored locally, or only if one denotes them available on demand? &nbsp;And, if the latter, why are customers not told that files are normally unavailable when offline? &nbsp;I thought that
 was the whole point, when using OneDrive on a laptop (as opposed to a tablet) - that the files were on your own machine but backed up to the cloud for access from other devices. &nbsp;Was this never in fact the case? &nbsp;Please can you point me to a detailed explanation
 of how the file storage works because I get the impression there is a lot of unnecessary smoke and mirrors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, thanks for your help so far. &nbsp;let's hope it works when not in Safe Mode. &nbsp;I shall let you know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All best - and Happy Christmas - Simon Dormandy</span></p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are two cases: turn off Files On-Demand feature &amp; turn on File On-Demand feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Files On-Demand is turned off: there is a local copy in your local device. You can work with your synced files directly and access your files even when you’re offline. Whenever you’re online, any changes that you or others make will sync automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Files On-Demand is turned on: there are three status of files like we introduced above:&nbsp;Online-only files, Locally available files and Always available files. For the detailed information about these three status, please refer to the following picture:
 (the following picture takes Windows as an example, but the theory of the three status is the same as Mac.)</p>

<p>New files created online or on another device appear as online-only files, which don’t take up space on your device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Zixuan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files continued to open faster once in Normal Mode, at least, after the first time Word or Excel had been opened. &nbsp;The times referred to above, when in Safe Mode, carried on in Normal Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am now exploring a couple of other possible reasons for the slowness - File Vault encryption and a possibly corrupted file system. &nbsp;I have turned off encryption and am in the process of reformatting my hard drive and restoring my data. &nbsp;Once that
 process has been completed I will be back in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to confirm, when I have Files on Demand disabled, and also when I have it enabled but am working from a file marked as Always Available, the computer will always open the local file and not go searching for the online one, only accessing the online version
 to sync it as changes are made?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have Files on-Demand disabled, or when you have it enabled but working from a file marked as Always Available, there will be a local copy in your computer which can be accessed even if you are offline. And as long as OneDrive sync client is working,
 the local files and cloud files are synchronized. After you opened that local copy, whether it syncs the changes to cloud, it depends on whether
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-autosave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5#OfficeVersion=MacOS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AutoSave</a> is available in your Office. If not, the changes will be synced via OneDrive sync client after you save that local copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you enable Files On-Demand and try to open a online-only file, it may be slower because it needs to download that file to your computer first. This is the difference between the above two situations.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using a DTPicker on a Userform to have users select a date and time for leave activity.&nbsp; I would like to set the default to the current date and 8:00 AM. I know how to set it to the current date - Now() - but can't seem to set the default time to 8:00
 AM.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>3 things required. Not sure how much you have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In properties set Format to 3 - dtp Custom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then set CustomFormat property to dd MMM yyyy hh:mm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (or whatever format you require but note that while the format follows the usual formatting you need upper case M for month format otherwise does not work. I think it confuses lower case with minute.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following code sets the default date and time to current date and 8am when the user enters the control. You can place the actual line of code where ever it suits you. ie.&nbsp;Form initialize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub DTPicker1_Enter()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.DTPicker1.Value = Date + TimeValue("08:00:00")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Following added since posting above reply.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a suggestion you could set the default date and time in the Form Initialize event and then use a double click event to change UpDown mode so you can pick the date in the calendar mode and then edit the&nbsp;time in UpDown mode. The double click event simply
 toggles the UpDown mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.DTPicker1.Value = Date + TimeValue("08:00:00")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub DTPicker1_DblClick()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Appears to loose the formatting when changing UpDown mode so re-establish format<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DTPicker1.UpDown = Not DTPicker1.UpDown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DTPicker1.CustomFormat = "dd MMM yyyy hh:mm"<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2016 - Insert Printout to A1 size</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bunch of A1 sized construction drawings scanned to PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to place them in a OneNote so I can use the OCR to assist with search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I insert the PDF file into OneNote only, no OCR seems to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I insert the PDF file into OneNote and add the printout, it seems to print to A4 with text I can't read - and no OCR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the drawing in PDF reader and print to OneNote, the largest paper size available is A3 - which is still too small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nico</p>

    <title>Will Windows 10 literally be RTM on the 29th&#63; There are so many - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> struanmccallum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Windows 10 literally be RTM on the 29th&#63; There are so many things to fix...</h2>
                    <p>Sounds like a rehash of previous threads but here goes. My system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel i7-4770k not OC</p>
<p>ASUStek z87m-Plus MB</p>
<p>16GB DDR3 RAM not OC</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX650 with 3 monitors (2 x DVI, 1 x HDMI) - not OC.</p>
<p>500GB HD fairly new, lots of space still available, no bad sectors detected in last scan yesterday.</p>
<p>Software includes: &nbsp;Office 2013 Pro VL, CC 2015 (PS, DW, AE, ID, IL, PR and Acrobat DC Pro) plus a whole bunch of unprofessional UW apps from a rather ordinary App Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that are STILL not good enough:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Boot time. I'll go away for hot beverage, run a few errands, catch up with team members and then it seems 'clickable'. But no. You still have this random variable lag between you clicking the start menu or clicking the Action centre icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The latest Nvidia driver update has not fixed the constant page tearing when viewing Start menu or Action centre. It's an eye-sore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Still can't make my User Account Control settings save permanently. As you probably know, if you restart without ensuring the control is set at least one notch above "Never notify", it defaults to the "Never notify" and you can't run ANY UW apps. So you
 can't run Microsoft Edge with its unfortunate icon or change UW Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Microsoft Edge - as long as you don't compare features with other browsers it doesn't seem too bad to use. But let's run a few glaring omissions past the dev team: A. Password manager B. Downloads manager with file management features C. Sub-pixel antialiasing
 everywhere. Yes, including the F12 Developers console/tools D. More sharing options or better still a Share-to-service Manager E. Separate button for adding to Reading lists F. Menu icon management G. Pinned tabs H. Restore previous session option I. Full-screen
 option J. Save page as...(list your favourites here) K. Persistent Search bar/ URL bar at the top. Currently I have to click TWICE each time I want to access this feature ***Thats all I want to list for now***</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Settings should be UNIFIED. End of story. Either use the old system or the new system. How many people are you trying to confuse at once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) All UW apps should be able to go Full Screen regardless of the app developers intentions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Give more details and more controls with Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Stop giving false notifications in the Action Centre!</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Give us control of Airplane Mode - which really ain't much use to a desktop user. And during setup, why not have an option which asks the end-user: "Do you prefer to use Windows 10 in tablet layout or desktop pc layout?" This would go hand-in-head with
 hardware ID checking to identify if a tablet is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Font 'squishing" - this is a no-brainer. Scenario: when using UW settings apps, changing between left-menu items causes the the font to shrink slightly, go fuzzy and then revert back. It makes it look like an after-thought. A clean simple transition
 with nice anti-aliasing on all the fonts rendered would be ideal. If you just leave it like it is then it will never be up to the professional standard of your competing operating systems. Surely it isn't a hard choice to make ALL UW apps look clean, load
 fast and feel professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: I've probably lost about an hour of today's productivity typing this out. And nobody is going to actually do anything about these things - which is crying shame because Windows 10 does have some fantastic developers who want the public's perception
 of this product to be the most top-notch OS on the block. Because it is so very true that we as consumers are NOT tied to this ecosystem. We are not obliged to continue down this rocky path without some sort of evolutionary trend and definitive answers. I
 recognise this is the TH1 Build 10240 and not the final product but come on! This won't be the last crazy monologue/discussion from a concerned Windows user. There should be more concern with the MS Store and its not-so-spectacular array of applications. If
 I never create a single UW app in my lifetime, I'm pretty sure I won't have missed out on anything special. End of rant.</p>

            <p>Struan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the idea from reading your post that you feel some of these problems are universal, and bugs in Windows 10.&nbsp; I have installed it on 3 machines and have not seen any of the slow performance on startup you are experiencing.&nbsp; In mine it has always started
 VERY fast, noticeably faster than Windows 8.1 did.&nbsp; So I suspect there is an issue with your install somehow, or hardware configuration - for example, are your system board drivers perhaps not correct?&nbsp; Default drivers could do what you are describing - but
 then, your Ethernet driver probably wouldn't be working either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer specs certainly are good and up to date, that shouldn't be it.&nbsp; But a problem with how Windows is getting to your hard drive sure sounds possible from your description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no screen tearing or font issues as you described - do you realize that hardware companies are still working on driver updates?&nbsp; My AMD display drivers and Intel display drivers are working flawlessly - yours will come, and this is not really a Windows
 flaw but, as you pointed out, a driver flaw that I am sure will be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other things you wrote are not so much issues as preferences.&nbsp; I'm sure you can imagine that Microsoft must get a huge number of conflicting requests like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Edge does have a password manager in RTM. You have to turn it on if you didn't used it in IE before an upgrade.</p>
<p>-Edge does have a&nbsp;download manager but with a very simple interface - you can view all current downloads and pause them.&nbsp; I would like it to have the 'Save As' function back instead of&nbsp;always going to the downloads folder, but&nbsp;I can deal with that - I have
 found it's faster to move the files after downloading than it was in IE to select 'Save As' and choose the folder to put it in.</p>
<p>-I have found that once I change apps to full screen, they then open to full screen next time.</p>
<p>-For your wasted hours, I have no sympathy.&nbsp; Either try to help by reporting problems and preferences, or don't bother and just wait for others.&nbsp; No time is wasted, only spent in a way of your choosing.</p>

            <p>Ah well I just learnt something new about Edge (password manager). Thanks for the tip!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Downloads, yes it would be ideal to have some kind of file directory control e.g. Change default folder to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out something else something puzzling: the Reading lists aren't showing up in the Reading List app...? Maybe I missed a Setting somewhere. I'll keep looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, driver issues are dependent on the hardware vendor. I'm thinking of hardware upgrades soon, going to a GTX Titan and an SSD to replace my primary drive running Win7 (it's going to be hard to let it go but the upgrade should be fine). I do have
 an older machine at home which is running Win10 with a 550Ti card and the same thing is happening with the font rendering. I really wouldn't want to compare the quality of it versus MacOSX or Ubuntu/Mint. It was more obvious using a larger screen as well.
 That said I run the same machine with a separate drive for my MacOSX installation and it looks and runs beautifully. Again, just a driver issue.</p>

    <title>How to display full header of incoming emails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> formuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to display full header of incoming emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to right-click the particular email in the list, or right-click the particular&nbsp;email in the reading pane, but nothing pops up, i.e. no 'settings' or 'properties' or something&nbsp;of that nature&nbsp;pops up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is quite serious. My email address is being used for spoofing, i.e. the partial header of the email appears as if the email&nbsp;was sent&nbsp;from my email address. And the real sender sent the email to me (!!!) and presumably to many, many others
 who think that I am spamming them (!!!) Moreover, my email address shows my real name (!!!)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I like to look at the full header so as to know who the real sender or senders&nbsp;is/are.</p>
<p>How do I display the full header of incoming emails? Thanks!</p>

<p>I use sympatico.ca which is supposed to be the same as outlook.com as I have to login to the Microsoft Account to change passwords, etc. However, I now notice from the responses in this thread that&nbsp;the user interface is different. My user interface from
 my W8.1 desktop &gt; Mail is&nbsp;extremely simple (even kludgy) and I looked everywhere in vain,&nbsp;I can't see email headers in my inbox and junk folder (the offending emails land in the junk folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use Outlook 2013 to access the account, and I do know how to look at email headers in Outlook 2013. But the thing is that those junk emails don't even come to my Outlook 2013 (This is also the reason why I just&nbsp;now discovered the issue, I normally
 don't look into the junk folder of W8.1 &gt; Mail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Please don't address me with 'FU', I would appreciate it if you address me with my forum handle&nbsp;'FormUser', thanks!</p>

<h2>            where is AutoFit in Word 2019&#63;</h2>
                    I have Office Professional Plus 2019.&nbsp; I tried pasting an email I want to save to a blank Word document.&nbsp; Stuff on the right side of the paste doesn't show.&nbsp; It's better when I switch to landscape format and reduce the margins, but there is still hidden
 stuff to the right.&nbsp; When I search online for this problem, I see references to AutoFit in the Cell Size group under the Layout tab.&nbsp; I have the Layout tab, but there is no Cell Size group or AutoFit anywhere that I can find.&nbsp; What is the way to solve the
 problem of a paste to Word having hidden area on the right side because it doesn't fit the pages?

            Hi. ЮрийДмитриев2 
<br />My name is Akiva and I am an independent consultant.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />In MS Office 2019 there is the AutoFit button if it does not appear or you can not use it, because your MS Office has a malfunction which you should correct with the following link
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Once the malfunction has been corrected, I suggest using the following tools

<h2>            Access Denied visiting new sharepoint.aspx layouts page</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Starting today, we noticed "Sites" was changed to "SharePoint" in the app launcher. I am able to view the page as an SPO Admin. My colleague, hoever, gets an access denied message when visiting the new page. My colleague is also on first release and is a site
 collection admin of the root site. The page is located at https://[ourtenant].sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do you have to be a SPO admin to be able to see the new page? Seems like a bug</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks for reporting the issue.</p>
<p>Can you confirm the following information?<br />
1. Let your colleague go to the classic view page <strong>https://&lt;tenant&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/&lt;user account&gt;/Social/Sites.aspx</strong>. Does the same issue occur?</p>
<p>For example, the url for <strong>userA</strong> with tenant <strong>contoso</strong>:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/userA_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/Social/Sites.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/userA_contoso_onmicrosoft_com/Social/Sites.aspx</a></strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’d like to collect account information for investigation. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the information. You can go to this link to access to the Private Message:
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated 5/15</strong></p>
<p>Current workaround:<br />
<strong>#1</strong>. Add “Everyone except external” group in to the visitors of the root site.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To do this, directly open the root site using the Url <em><strong>https://&lt;tenant&gt;.sharepoint.com/
&gt;</strong></em> click the gear icon &gt; Site settings &gt; site permission &gt; click on Team Site Visitors &gt; New &gt; Add Users &gt; enter
<strong>Everyone except external users</strong> and share.</p>
<p><strong>#2</strong>. Navigate to site page using the Url below:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em><strong>https://&lt;tenant&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/&lt;user account&gt;/Social/Sites.aspx</strong></em></p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>We aren't sure what changed, but by end of last week, we were able to see the page without any error, and without performing the workaround steps you provided.

<h2>            Can&#39;t remove hotmail connector add-in</h2>
                    
<p>I tried to remove or disconnect Microsoft Hotmail Connector add-in from outlook 2007 and get a message "This add-in is installed for all users of this computer and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator".&nbsp;As I am an administrator of this
 computer (not the only one however) I am at a loss what else to try.</p>
<p>Any tips would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<h2>            VBA &#124; Run time error for macro - set inputrange</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My team built a macro in Excel 2010 that we need to get to work on Excel 2007. It works great on 2010 and 2013, but in 2007 we get what I'm realizing is a classic error message:&nbsp;<strong>Runtime error 1004: Application-defined or object-defined
 error</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When we hit "debug," one line of code is highlighted:&nbsp;<strong>Set inputRange = Evaluate(dvCell.Validation.Formula1)</strong></p>
<p>I appreciate any help so so so much! I'm very much a VBA novice so I've been really struggling to decipher everything and understand what is going wrong. Thank you in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebecca</p>

            <p>An unusual one.&nbsp; I think we're going to need to see the data validation rule for the cell in question.&nbsp; So you need to look at the code and find out what cell dvCell is.&nbsp; You can use the immediate window to do so - let it go into debug and in the Immediate
 Window type:</p>
<p>? dvCell.Address [Enter]</p>
<p>that will give you the cell address, and then to find out what sheet it is on, type</p>
<p>? dvcell.parent.name[Enter] and that will give you the sheet name</p>
<p>finally you can find out what that formula is by typing </p>
<p>? dvcell.validation.formula1[Enter]</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is the .formula1 information that we pretty much need to see and then we can try to figure out why things aren't working.&nbsp; The cell address and sheet name are actually kind of extra information that may or may not play into it later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if the data validation rule is to get a list or address, then the evaluate() formula is probably going to result in that address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set this code up in both Excel 2007 and 2010 on 2 separate machines and it actually works fine for me; myRange gets set to a reference to $K$1:$K$4 --</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp; Dim dvCell As Range<br />
&nbsp; Dim myRange As Range<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; 'Range G2 on the sheet has data validation<br />
&nbsp; 'set to a list with the formula being<br />
&nbsp; ' =$K$1:$K$4<br />
&nbsp; Set dvCell = ActiveSheet.Range("G2")<br />
&nbsp; Set myRange = Evaluate(dvCell.Validation.Formula1)<br />
&nbsp; 'at this point myRange will reference range K1:K4<br />
&nbsp; 'for me this works in both Excel 2010 and 2007<br />

<p>
</p><p>So far I have found the new Outlook Mail format to be not too bad. &nbsp; I tried some functions like dragging and dropping to move emails to other folders: ok</p>

<h2>            Clutter has disappeared from Outlook&#47;Office365</h2>
                    <p>I use the Outlook client on my work Windows PC. Clutter had been working fine, on Monday of this week it just disappeared. No clutter filtering is happening, there is no Clutter option under Automatic Processing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Android Phone and iPad I use the Outlook client - focused/unfocused is enabled there are works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the suggestion of our IT folks (who remotely looked at my Outlook setup and couldn't figure it out) I turned off Focused on Outlook365, waited a day and turned it back on - no difference to Clutter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to get Clutter functionality back on Outlook Windows Client? Or have Focused/Unfocused apply to Outlook client?</p>

<p>So, is there any such option for IE?</p>

<p>It is not available for any version of IE (and I saw nothing indicating a date they inteneded to release anything like that or that they were even considering it.</p>
<p>I know of no IE 3rd party software that saves as you write -and I spent some time looking.</p>
<p>Sorry, but we're just all going to need to wait until Lazarus releases it for IE or competition emerges with a similar product that does work with IE.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I tried ie7pro with windows 8.1 and it added lots of ads, popups, search nuisances&nbsp;and malware. I don't recommend&nbsp;it.

            <p>There is no Lazarus for&nbsp;IE so there can't be any updates.&nbsp;<br />
<span>Lazarus: Form Recovery&nbsp;</span><span>2.3</span> only works with Firefox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I too am looking for such extension in Internet Explorer. I really want to ditch all these third party browsers on my Surface Pro 2 and just stick to the one that enables me to take advantage of every aspect of my Surface Pro (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet AND
 Pen Digitizer Drawing Board). Chrome was once an option until evil Google began this (http://bit.ly/1AMw3mH).</p>

</p><p>Robert, could you share your procedure for getting OneNote to do this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There's no procedure.&nbsp; Saving automatically is a feature that is apparently in OneNote by design/default.&nbsp; (I haven't seen an option which lets me turn it off but I haven't looked for one either.)&nbsp; You would get more knowledgeable information about OneNote
 on the Office forums.</p>
