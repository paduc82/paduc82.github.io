<h2>            OneNote 2010 Recently Stopped Sync&#39;ing with Error code&#58; 0xE0000024</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote 2010 to connect to SkyDrive for the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I posted some changes to my OneNote 2010 and they properly sync'ed to the cloud.&nbsp; I did some things with another Windows Live ID account, and now can't seem to access
 any of my notebooks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I am sure centers around the fact that I have 2 Windows Live ID accounts.&nbsp; One for work, and one for personal.&nbsp; I have no work related SkyDrive OneNote notebooks, they are only in my personal account.&nbsp; I also have Visual Studio 2010 that I write
 Windows Store Apps in, and use my Work ID for all of that interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Lunch, I noticed red (\) over my 3 personal notebooks.&nbsp; Stating they aren't sync'ing changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem Area 1 (From Edit Page)</strong></p>
<p>I look and in the Yellow banner I see:</p>
<p>"OneNote needs a password to sync some of your notebooks. Click here to see the list of sections and notebooks that require passwords".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I click this, and the FOCUS moves away from OneNote 2010 (as if&nbsp;a modal dialog pops up), but nothing shows up... ever.&nbsp; So I click back on OneNote 2010, which still isn't syncing, but is usable (new notes can be added but don't sync).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem Area 2 (From File Open)</strong></p>
<p>I now click on "File -&gt; Open", and under "<strong>Open from the Web</strong>", it says "OneNote couldn't find any web notebooks or they are already open.".&nbsp;&nbsp; I try clicking "Not TeeJay SD?", and it spins looking for notebooks and comes back with nothing.&nbsp;
 So I click on "Missing a notebook? Check Microsoft SkyDrive.", which opens a browser, and shows me all my notebooks... in the Web App.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem Area 3 (From SkyDrive WebApp -&gt; OneNote 2010)</strong></p>
<p>I login to the Web App, and am able to see my OneNote notebook, and click Open in OneNote.&nbsp; I am prompted with a Security Notice,
<strong>"Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern.&nbsp;&nbsp; This location may be unsafe"</strong>?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I'm desperate to see my data so I click "Yes" anyways to continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then get a "OneNote cannot open the specified location: onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/7073283792.....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem Area 4 (Notebook Sync Status...)</strong></p>
<p>I right click on the desired notebook, and select "Notebook Sync Status", and manually try to sync and get.</p>
<p>A password is required to synchronize this notebook. (Error code: 0xE0000024)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried looking things up on the internet, and keep getting redirected to this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using the FILE.REG key that to reverts to the default system provider (I don't think I have Live Essentials installed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install these two updates and restart OneNote. Let us know how it goes.<br />

<h2>            Bing not indexing or showing up site on searches</h2>
                    <p>I have a http website which is just a blog and just cannot get Bing to index it.</p>
<p>It shows the URL request through the search as 'some results have been removed'. It crawls fine with no crawl errors and I have emailed webmaster support now twice this week but have received no response. Do I have to pay for https to get the search engine
 to recognise my site because if so then it is a cost I cannot either afford or justify at the moment.</p>
<p>Also nothing is blocked through the robots.txt file and checked with my hosting provider that there is no issues their end such as with the htcaccess file etc..</p>
<p>Any help with this would be appreciated as I can find no step by step solution to either understand or help explain how I can correct the issue.</p>

            We apologized for the delayed response. There are several possible aspects that we need to consider as to why your site is not being indexed in Bing. You did a good job on making sure that your website is being crawled. And since this is the case, we can
 say and affirm that the robots.txt file is not causing any issues with the indexing of your website. However, we would like to make sure of a few more points. Please check this

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>For the original question, yes, there are no parental controls for Outlook.com. However, Family Safety has a similar feature called
<b>Contacts Management</b>. Unfortunately, this feature&nbsp;is no longer offered.&nbsp;<span>Note that within Contacts Management, you</span><span><span>&nbsp;can
 choose who your kids can communicate with on&nbsp;</span><span><span>Windows Hotmail</span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span><span>Messenger</span></span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span><span>Windows
 Live Spaces</span></span><span>&nbsp;by managing their contacts. When your kids use&nbsp;</span><span><span>Windows Live</span></span><span>, they’ll only be able to talk with people you add to their contact list.
 They won't be able to talk to anyone who's not on their contact list.&nbsp;</span></span>This also disables the Junk Folder of the kid account.&nbsp;<span><span>(Whole
 article can be read<span>&nbsp;</span><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Protecting-your-kids-with-Family-Safety#section_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></b>.)</span></span>.&nbsp;</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Since the time of my original question a lot seems to have changed. There are still no&nbsp;parental&nbsp;controls
<i>per se</i>&nbsp;in Outlook.com, but Microsoft has made it possible for parents to exercise a substantial amount of authority over what their children can do or see on Microsoft properties.
<div><br />
<div>The key, as I discovered, is to sign up your child for a Microsoft account <i>
using their real birthday</i>. When&nbsp;the&nbsp;software detects that the person is a child (within the meaning of COPPA), a whole slew of protections&nbsp;kick&nbsp;into place.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To start, the child's Microsoft account must be linked to a parent's Microsoft account. (Technically, it can be any adult.) The 'parent' must prove they're an adult by allowing Microsoft to make a small charge to their credit card (50 cents, goes to charity.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once this is done, the parent's Microsoft account exercises a great deal of control over the linked child's Microsoft account. For example, the parent controls what games the child can play on Xbox Live, what music they listen to on Zune, whom they are
 allowed to have contact with via text, voice, video and chat, and more. I haven't explored all the features yet, but I think the parent can limit the child's email activity on Outlook.com to people in the contact list and Safe Senders list. All other mail
 - including spam - can be processed with rules, so the child doesn't even see it unless the parent lets it through.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And these protections don't automatically expire when your child turns 13. Only the parent can decide when to 'promote' their child's account to adult&nbsp;status. Smart!</div>
<div><br />
<div>An even greater degree of control is possible if you install Microsoft Family Safety on the child's account. We chose not to do this with our son since we use third-party software that, quite&nbsp;frankly, does a better job for our needs than Family Safety.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is very much to Microsoft's credit that they&nbsp;have&nbsp;included these features with a Microsoft account. Nothing like this on Google or Yahoo. Our son signs in to Windows 8 with his Microsoft account credentials, and that puts us more at ease.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. To help me understand the issue, can I ask you some questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the exact step-by-step procedures you took to linked your sons account to your account?
</li><li>What is the version of your operating system? </li><li>Did you install Family Safety client on your son's computer? What is the operating system of your son's computer?
</li><li>Can you explain to us what kind&nbsp;of restriction you want to apply in your son's account?</li></ul>

<p>Thank you.</p>

 block certain apps or websites so that your child can't visit them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Glenda, thanks for your quick reply...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes my child has an outlook account, I would indeed like to manage her account and web activities, but aside of that I would like to know what she is doing on her computer account. she has her own computer, an old windows xp pro where she has her own user
 name, and I have another, but she is the main user of that computer... I would like to know what websites she frequents and whit whom is she talking to, thanks again for your attention.</p>

    <title>E50 Romanian Diacritics PROBLEM .. PLS hELP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E50 Romanian Diacritics PROBLEM .. PLS hELP</h2>
                    I have encountered a problem when writing sms. If i set the "writing language" to Romanian, i can write with romanian diacritics (such as ă, â, î, ş, ţ ) but there is one problem. If i enter a romanian diacritic, the number of letters in an sms drasticly
 decreases. (Example: I write "Good" and i have 156/160 characters remaining in an sms. If i write now "ţ" the number decreases like 67/160 characters available).<br />
Thanks in advance for your solution.

            ok, i found an other topic about UNICODE characters. But i found only a problem not sa solution. I understood the 7-bits thing but is there any solution? I had an 6230i previously and it seemed to work just fine with the unicode characters activated. so,
 i think a new serie (as E50) should have a solution to my problem. Thanks

The option Character encoding is "reduced suport" in text msg settings.

<h2>            Where is Windows 10 storing my OneNote notebooks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have looked in the main documents folder, my user documents folder, and within the OneDrive app — all the places suggested on various help pages. I've tried searching my computer; I still can't find the OneNote notebooks (Work, Personal, Archives--I use
 three).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm having some trouble with OneNote I was thinking of re-installing the app, but I wanted to back up the files first, and I can't find them.</p>

            The folder that Vijay-Verma pointed you to is the default path for locally stored notebooks, which can only be done by OneNote 2016, which is installed with MS Office 2016. From Microsofts view the ability to store notebooks on a local drive is a kind of "leftover" from older OneNotes, Since 2014 they declared OneNote "cloud only" software, which means that all other versions (iOS, Mac, and even the Windows 10 OneNote app) can only store notebooks on OneDrive or OneDrive for business. There also is no backup mechanism in the app and the notebooks on OneDrive are hidden from direct access, so you are not able to even manually download them from there. Microsoft claims you won't need a backup anyway, because everything on OneDrive is much safer than on your PC. Well, this view is at least.... err.... discussable.
<br />
<br />You might think that there MUST be a local copy of the notebooks on your device because you can access and edit your notes while not connected to the internet. Yes, there sort of is. It's called the OneNote cache and only usable by the app itself (the notes are stored in a split up, binary format, for sync purposes only. Copying those hidden cache files would not serve as a usable backup in any way).
<br />
<br />Time for somewhat good news:
<br />If you (like me) are somewhat getting nervous about not having a backup, there are in fact two ways to get a backup which is restorable (to restore those backups you would absolutely need OneNote 2016 from MS Office though!):
<br />
<br />1. If you install OneNote 2016 (in addition to your Windows 10 app), it has a built in backup function that copies opened notebooks to a local folder / drive. The options are found under "Options", "Save &amp; Backup". Be sure to have "Back up notes stored on SharePoint" checked, as this will also backup notes from the cloud, if they have been opened in OneNote 2016.
<br />
<br />2. If your notebooks on OneDrive are not stored in the main folder but in a subdirectory. you can download that complete directory (not the separate notebook "files" which are just placeholders without actual content). This will result in a ZIP file that also contains the "real" notebook files in a format that OneNote 2016 (the version with MS Office) can handle in case of emergency. For all of this ignore the local OneDrive client (your OneDrive folder on your device) and use the web browser instead.
<br />
<br />Summarized: Microsoft does not give you an official method to back up notebooks stored on OneDrive other than the "leftover" function in OneNote 2016 from MS Office. If you use that option for backups (or the workaround I showed you), the restoring of the notes absolutely need a "full" OneNote 2016 from MS Ofifce.

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I'm creating a data base for an equipment operator to track downtime on the system and properly catagorize why it stoped. I've been able to get everyting to work properly except for that I would like to have one button that says "STOP or DOWN" to insert
 a time in the current records field "Stop Time" when it&nbsp;is pushed, and a second button that says "START or UP" that inserts a time in the current record field of "Start Time". Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks, John</p>

                    <p>Expired video rentals show up in my Xbox video collection -- on in the apps on Xbox One and Windows 8.1. They do not appear in my collection on my Windows Phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is undesirable because it clutters my collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I remove the expired rentals from my cloud collection, or filter so that the apps only show current rentals and owned movies?</p>

            <p>Hello JoshBarnhill:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the question you have about managing your collection.&nbsp; The My Collection section of Xbox&nbsp;Video on your devices should be a reflection of your Xbox Video purchase history.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have found, many devices do not give the option to remove content from your collection.&nbsp; From my experience the Windows Phone 8 is the only device that does allow you to manually remove content from your collection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience rentals automatically remove themselves from your collection once the rental period has completed.&nbsp; That is typically 14 days.&nbsp; If you have rentals that are over 14 days old&nbsp;you might try rebooting your devices and clearing your cache.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the Xbox One this is done by unplugging the console for 5 minutes and then reconnecting the console and signing into your account again.</li><li>For your computer I would suggest you press the Windows key + R and typing %temp% in the search box.&nbsp; Select all the files and folders and delete them.&nbsp; Once this is done, shut the computer down and then reboot.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>

            At first sight can't see innovations newer than in v21.0.008, but and no bugs for now. But Navi, Menu and Gallery are faster and i hope to remain, not only after restart. Try it :smileywink:

<p>hi, I installed the new firlware at my nokia n81 2 GB,at first ewerything was wonderfull till I added songs and tried to refresh the music player.When I tried to do this the phone crashes and exited from the music player,despite it never exits from music
 player.Than I desided that it happended because it was the first time I was refreshing,but it happened every time I did it later.</p>
<p>The second problem with the new firmware I came across to is that my phone rebooted two times while trying to open the gallery.</p>
<p>That is to say I did not enjoy the new software at all and I'd like to re-install the older version.I was wondering if someone could help me with this.I would be really gratefull&nbsp; :))</p>

<p>I don't think there's a solution... I still couldn't find a way to repair the problems with this software, I reinstalled it several times but it doesn't help... It's very annoying, I hope NOKIA firmware programmers soon make effective changes to the new
 version...</p>

            according to the general trend of firmware updates for other N-series phones, i'm guessing that with these problems, there is a v30 in the works for N81. should only be a couple of more months before it comes out in my opinion.

            I don't have any problem with the new firmware (accually its working better than before). But they still didn't fix the "green shade" on the n81 camera and this is too bad... Just if they could decrese the 'green colour' on the camera it would be perfect
 :) I guess you all agree with that. Because I like very much this phone but that's the only problem (at least for me) :(

<p>I think it's the only explanation couse I'm not the only one that has this problem and you're not the one that hasn't any issues...:(</p>

 work.&nbsp; I need help or some way to get it open and working and am not getting any help from Microsoft. I am paying for an app thatbwont work. The picture is no longer the word picture but a green monster. What am I supposed to do?

            <p>Here is how I've been doing the upgrades on ACTIVE systems.<br />
<br />
Use this site to down load a ISO version make sure you select the ISO that matches your active system&nbsp; if running&nbsp; 32bit you need to select Win10&nbsp; 32bit ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Win7sp1 and Win8.1 Preview using the ISO on a DVD, only tip I can give you is when doing the install run win7 or 8.1 or Preview first, then put the DVD in and run the setup when it pops up then when it asks for to do updates click on "not right now" I found
 if you say yes it takes about 40 min's longer,when it&nbsp;comes to window asking to save files just click on "nothing" and it&nbsp;will do&nbsp;&nbsp;a clean install, I just do the updates after and it only takes about 5 min's, also I've have had problems with the updated 10
 not finding the WiFi I just use the WiFi install disc. also found if WiFi isn't found just reboot by way of shut down not restart and for some reason it finds the WiFI, this has been sent to MS.</p>

            Hi Ellen,
<div><br />
<div>Don't believe Daniel's statement "a more knowledgable poster will give you a hint" because most of us stand in Daniel's shadow. 8-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you're now certain that you have 12.3.2 installed you might think about trying this. &nbsp;I don't know if this will help but it's what I would try to do to clear the notice message that 12.3.2 update is needed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open Word and go to Help &gt; Check for updates. &nbsp;From the dialog select the Manual button. Close out, quit all applications, and fully power down your system. &nbsp;If it's a Mac Book, closing the lid is not a power down. Wait a couple of minutes before powering
 back up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before clicking on any application, let the system fully come up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now start Word and select Help &gt; Check for Updates &gt; Check for Updates. &nbsp;Hopefully it tells you that there are no updates to apply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know.</div>

            Having Outlook enabled does change things in Word. For instance, <em>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; User Information</em> displays extra fields. I wouldn't know if some hyperlink options are added as well.

<h2>            Does anyone know where we are going with the Insider program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Those of us who signed up for the Insider program prior to launch of Win 10 were told that Build 10240 was in fact Win 10.&nbsp; So, assuming we had upgraded to Build 10240, we were&nbsp; using the same Win 10 OS after July 26th as everyone else who upgraded directly
 from Win 8.1 or Win 7 to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we have continued to receive new Builds, with various modifications to the Win 10 software being used by everyone else.&nbsp; To the extent that we have other computers in our households that we have upgraded to stock Win 10 software, we now have divergences
 between our "Win 10" computers.&nbsp; As newer Builds are issued in the future, these divergences will only become greater.&nbsp; What is the end game for this exercise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, a recent Insider post reminded us that each Build has an expiration date; if we have not upgraded to a later Build by that expiration date our computer will stop working - even though we are all eligible for a free version of stock Windows 10.&nbsp;
 How do we get off this train?&nbsp; If the divergences between the versions of Win 10 become burdensome, or we simply choose not to continue in the Insider program, what process do we follow to revert to stock Windows 10?</p>
<p>

            It will be interesting to see how Threshold 2 is delivered next month. &nbsp;It may be a build delivery like we get. &nbsp;I think the perception of Windows as a service now makes the Insider program a test bed for delivery of that service even more than it is a
 feature-beta program.

<p>Hi WiellighLambrechts4140,</p>
<p>To check the situation from the backend, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Your tenant domain information. (E.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com)</p>
<p>2. The custom domain which you want to add to Office 365.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the information. You can access it via the link below:<br />
<p>Thanks,<br />
Frank</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would not worry about it, just setup an account with xyzedu2.onmicrosoft.com, than add you owned domain name xyz.edu and that will become your site name, which I assume is the end goal.</p>

<p>A new tenant won't help - you can't add a domain that's already associated with an existing tenant. If you can't access the prior tenant, it will be very difficult to remove the domain. The only thing Msft should require to do that is proof you own the domain.
 But though they've been told that many times, they still don't seem to understand.</p>

<p>Hi Wielligh,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information with us in the private message.</p>
<p>After checking the domain information, the domain you want to add in your current Office 365 tenant (Let’s call it tenant A) is bound to another Office 365 tenant (Let’s call it tenant B). Please try to login to tenant B to remove the domain and then add
 the domain to the tenant B.</p>
<p>If you can’t access tenant B, for further assistance, I’d like to collect some tenant information by private message. You can check it via https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Fraser</p>

                    Lumia 550 Since windows 10 mobile anniversary upgrade, all settings says an app is required to be installed; Cortana and MS Edge do not work . They try to run and fail to do so. Edge says it is unable to open a web link eg from an&nbsp;email. Major functionality
 gone. I've tried a soft reset and a reboot without SD card. No change

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's likely that is just how the images are stored.&nbsp; Some apps will allow you to rotate them, but they don't always store the rotation data in the photo itself and Sway does not have access to that data.&nbsp; You can fix this by opening the photos in a photo
 editing app, like MS Paint, and then rotating and saving them before putting them into your Sway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other question.</p>
<p>
