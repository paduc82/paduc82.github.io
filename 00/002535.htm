<p>The Content Copier in PC Suite 7.1.40.1 fails to Backup the Data from the Phone. "The phone did not contain any content ..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Attempts to uninstall, delete Directories and Registry Keys did not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Content Copier from 7.1.30.9 works fine.</p>

<p>I'm also having problems with V7.1.40.1 of this software, running on WinXP Home edition V2002 SP3.</p>
<p>(via Bluetooth Toshiba stack) from a 6600 Slide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to backup Contacts list (the MOST important data!!!) it just sits there forever with the 'busy' wheel twiddling round and zero % progress on the display bar.&nbsp; It DOES say it might take a while but more than 30 minutes with nothing indicated for only
 a couple of hundred contacts suggests actually no progress at all!&nbsp; It IS possible to read contact, calendar, messages etc., using other apps in the suite - but then the progress bar on the PC Suite display tends to stop, showing (eg.) 90%, although it looks
 like all the content has been transferred.&nbsp; Using other apps, of course you can't create an alternative backup file!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the contacts list fails to transfer, the phone screen momentarily flashes up a 'sync complete' message after only a few seconds - although I THOUGHT I was backing-up, not sync'ing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC Suite looks like a very nice software package - but does ANYONE (except US!!!) actually test it with real data and real phones???</p>

<p>This is typical of PC Suite problems. I myself have experienced all sorts of instability &amp; strange behavior from this software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like a very poorly tested piece of software, or software with no quality-testing prior to release to the general public.</p>

<p>I get a slight feeling of 'Frying Pan &amp; Fire' coming over me!&nbsp; What will Ovi give me (apart from grief!) that PC Suite doesn't?&nbsp; And why is Nokia making parallel investment, developing both??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And anyway: according to the Ovi download site, Nokia 6600 Slide users are Poor Relations.&nbsp; Ovi is stated to support 6600 Fold and 6600i only!!!</p>

<p>Yeah - and the Pope lives in the woods and bears are Catholic!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the lack of Ovi support for my Nokia 6600Slide (as already mentioned)?</p>
<p>And who said anything about sharing pictures?&nbsp; All I want to do right now is backup the data in my phone, especially Contacts, in case I lose it or it fails.</p>

<p>Don't really know why I bother - but anyway I decided to debug this ridiculous software a little further.</p>
<p>Uninstalled PC Suite completely, used RegClean to flush out (10 or so) bits and pieces that the Nokia uninstall process left behind, reinstalled it from scratch.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; EXACTLY the same behaviour as before: just sits there with 0% progress and
 the little wheel thing turning reassuringly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be worthwhile mentioning again that the phone screen lit upwith a couple of messages about sync'ing, the last one (after only a few seconds) saying 'synchronisation complete'.&nbsp; **bleep**???&nbsp; What has content-copying for backup got to do with synchronisation?
 And I have no software installed (specifically, Outlook) which I could sync with the phone calendar and directory anyway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I DO wish there was SOME evidence that Nokia folk actually read any of the messages posted here.....&nbsp; It's perfectly obvious to me already that this software is unfinished.&nbsp; It would be nice to think that there was even one competent programmer doing some
 proper testing and debugging.&nbsp; But judging by the marketing effort going into Ovi (not supported by either of my phones!), PC Suite is currently 'demphasised' and will soon be defenestrated.</p>

<p>when you say you uninstalled completely, do you mean you uninstalled PC Connectivity Solution as well?</p>
<p>I tested the backup of my 6600 slide with 7.1.40.1 and it works just fine.</p>
<p>What do you get in the Nokia PCSuite Help-&gt; about -&gt; info (i).</p>
<p>I have something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC Connectivity Solution:</p>
<p>Version 9.44.0.3</p>
<p>Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver:</p>
<p>Version 7.1.22.0</p>

            It's JUST possible that the Content Copier DOES work - but glacially slowly and without any attempt to update the progress bar.&nbsp; (I was using the Bluetooth option initially.&nbsp; Using a USB cable connection to the phone and the same function did apparently
 produce a valid backup.&nbsp; With the cable, it was also unrealistically slow but at least completed before I lost patience!)

            <p>Downloaded both apps from iTunes app store yesterday onto my PC then transferred them over to my iPad mini.&nbsp; I do not have&nbsp;access to&nbsp;the internet from my iPad which I intend to use simply as an extension of my PC to create documents and spreadsheets while
 I am travelling, then transferring them over to my PC when required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no use for anything more complicated than that. When I try to open the apps they show as Read Only and I am asked to Sign In which I obviously cannot do without internet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apps
 are described as allowing me to create and edit while offline, which is not happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Microsoft Works on my PC which I am happy with and do not want to upgrade or change this in any way.</p>

            <p>This seems to contradict the information in an article by Karen Haslem on 7 Nov 14 in Macworld regarding the free apps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>She states "Microsoft has just made new versions of its' Office apps for iPad available for free.&nbsp; The updates mean that iPad users can now access and edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint docs on their iPads, as there is no longer any need to have an Office 365
 subscription to access editing features."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a subscription is no longer needed, why&nbsp;are "appropriate credentials" required?&nbsp; I downloaded the Apps through iTunes to my laptop then transferred them over to my iPad.&nbsp; Why can't these "credentials" also be directed to my laptop/email address or whatever
 for me to then key into my iPad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have wasted enough time on these Apps, which now appear to be useless for my particular &nbsp;purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your time.&nbsp;

<p>Since the latest update i'm having the same problem with my Outlook 2016 (Office365) client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm connecting to my works Exchange (2013) environment over https. Normally when i check the "remember my credentials" box Outlook won't ask my credentials the next time i start Outlook. Since the latest update i'm prompted wit a logon box every time i start
 Outlook. Even when selecting "remember my credentials".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently on build version 1704 (build 8067.2032)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i've already tried to fix the problem;</p>
<p>- Create a new password</p>
<p>- Create a new Outlook profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Antimalware Service Executable high CPU and DISK usage</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest Win10 pro. Dual boot to Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all started on one day (last week), I received a file from a friend Keygen.zip. It is obviously a virus / malware. I have deleted it right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot into Windows 10. Windows Defender detected it in my $Recycle.bin folder, and failed to remove it (after many hours), maybe because of permission issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I noticed this. I boot into my Win 7 and emptied my recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I boot back into my Windows 10. Windows Defender removed that file from its list. Shows nothing in its&nbsp;GUI.&nbsp;But Antimalware Services&nbsp;continue running at the background, it&nbsp;consumed 20+% of my CPU and writing 100~200mbps to my SSD. Over a period of one
 day it had consumed almost 3TB of my SSD TBW lifespan, and it is still going on. while I have only used up 150GB storage space (in total)&nbsp;on that SDD&nbsp;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had disabled Windows Defender from my local security policy. Everything is back to normal. And SSD activity drops back to near 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, obviously there is something gone wrong with Windows Defender itself. Even if it is scanning for malwares, why does it need to write constantly to the SSD? I still wish to keep Windows Defender running to protect my machine, but I do not want to kills
 my SSD. Hope someone can tell me how to reset / clean Windows Defender, so that it starts fresh all over again.</p>

            <p>Win 7 was installed first. Using windows defender and security essential as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact Win 7 was installed in a 1TB HDD, and Win 10 was installed in another 1TB SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS doesn't aware of each other existence. The HDD / SSD can be removed without affecting another OS. I boot up using the BIOS to select which drive to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Win 7 / Win 10 are very clean, no pirated software, no games, no keygen, and I didn't browse any ****, download any hack.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is used primarily for my development. With Intel I7 +&nbsp;16GB RAM + Nvidia 660M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was newly installed for about a month. After I have sent my SSD back for warranty claim. (That is also the reason why I monitor my SSD usage closely and noticed this abnormal behavior).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am registered windows insider, but never participate in the insider program.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Did you purchase Win10 or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When did you send the SSD back "for warranty claim?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did you extract the contents of the ZIP file when you&nbsp;were&nbsp;booted into Win7 or Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Are you seeing the "Antimalware Service Executable high CPU and DISK usage" behavior when booted into Win7 as well as Win10 or only Win10?</p>

            <p>1. I can't remember the exact date, but should be 1 or 2 days before Christmas 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes it is a genuine win10 pro license, the ISO image was downloaded from MSDN</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I sent it back for warranty claim on the 12th Dec</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No, I didn't extract the content, just delete it right away (in my Windows 7).&nbsp; The ZIP file was in a thumb drive (never auto execute) when my friend pass it to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Only in Win10. No issue in Win7. I don't really use Win7 nowadays except for some testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The $Recycle.bin that I was referring to in my earlier post is actually the Win7 Recycle bin. Not inside win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if my Win7 is infected by Virus / malware (which I don't think so), my Win10 should be clean. Because during that time, my Win10 SSD was not inside my PC.</p>

            <p>Your best bet is to get and update sophos, run it, then reboot, then get AVG and do the same. Stop MS security and rerun Sophos in safe mode if possible. If the two do not come up with anything then you are possibly clean so if you can delete or rather uninstall
 the MS security, run Sophos again and also run a computer cleaner like Winoptimizer and then reinstall Microsoft Security. Check with the task manager to see if the security file is still being silly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Moral always always always check any file with AVG before opening it. Be it music, letters, or other people key drives. It seems here in France almost all computers are infected, the worst took me 24 hours to clean 300 infected files and then the girl did
 not pay me or even say thank you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Moral to that either tell others to f/off or say only if you give me something up front. Me now it is the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Incidentally I used lime wire and never got infected.</p>

            <div>1a. The SSD was replaced, they returned an empty drive to me, and I have lost all my data together with it.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>1b. The thumb drive belongs to my friend. He passed me some documents, and I copied the folder on to my Desktop (I was using my Win7 that time). Then I noticed that there was this Keygen.zip in the folder. I have just deleted it right away.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to trust that I am not stupid enough to run the zip file, and also trust that I do not allow any executable to be executed from the zip drive automatically. I always enable (show) file Extension, and know what type of file I am opening.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SSD writes activities dropped to near 0 after I have stopped the Antimalware services.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2a. I have stopped the services and have no intention to re-run it. But I am sure it is the latest. Because when I noticed something abnormal, the first thing I did was to ensure that I have the latest version of software and definition file. The date was
 yesterday morning.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2b. Yesterday morning.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2c. I didn't click the UPDATE button since it was already having the latest. But if I remember correctly, it should say something like I already have the latest software.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>3. No. No anti-virus, no internet security, no firewall. But I do have adblock plus (again, latest version) installed for both IE and EDGE.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>4. No, the SSD was empty, since Samsung told me that my SSD was damaged beyond repair and there is not way to retrieve my data. So if it wasn't empty, I also won't know because the first thing I did was to format the whole thing, make a single largest possible
 partition and re-install win10 pro.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>5. 1607, 14393.693</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>6. 24,0,0,194</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>7. No FF, no Chrome or any other alternative browser. Only IE and EDGE</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>8. No. I do not have any of the software that you have mentioned in your list. The last time I use RegClean was I think .... in Win95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite sure that I have not installed any software / drivers without my attention. Except those stupid Printer, Xbox, Router, Linux-link .... bla... bla, automatically installed by Win10 when it discovered those devices in the network neighbor (before
 I manage to disable it). Hope someone can ask MS to have this disabled by default in future releases.</p>

            Yes, because it constantly writing 100 ~ 200mbps into my SSD, going to kill it in few days. That is why I have to disable it in local policy. Prevent it from running for now.

<h2>            Mac OSX 10.8.4 Mountain Lion connection issues to RDS 2012 server with Microsoft RDC for Mac Client</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
I was referred to this part of the Microsoft Community from the Windows Server 2012 Remote Desktop Services TechNet community. &nbsp;I am hoping you are able to help me in this situation. &nbsp;I wasn't aware MAC RDC Client support was through the Office support community.
 &nbsp;I guess you learn something new every day.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Issue:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently set up a new RDS 2012 server to handle the applications that will not run in our school district's Mac network. &nbsp;Currently we are unable to connect to the RDS 2012 server from any Mac using the 2.1.2 and 2.1.1. &nbsp;It first complains about a certificate
 issue as we are using a self signed certificate, but you can click through this message on the mac just like you can on a PC to connect anyway. &nbsp;The certificate error is below:<br />
<br />
"The server name on the certificate is incorrect"<br />
<br />
After clicking the Connect button, it fails to connect with an error message saying:<br />
<br />
"You were disconnected from the Windows-based computer because of problems during the licensing protocol"<br />
<br />
We were able to connect to the server for about a week then all of a sudden there was no connectivity again. &nbsp;I have run through every article I can find online with no luck on getting closer to a solution. &nbsp;Here are some things I have attempted.<br />
<br />
Microsoft RDC client 2.1.2 (found on some random person's Dropbox account so I don't know if it is official) no difference from version 2.1.0 or 2.1.1.<br />
<br />
Attempted to try different applications for remote desktop access like CORD (has cursor issues where the cursor disappears) and Thinomenon (disconnects randomly with no rhyme or reason). &nbsp;These are not solutions to the issue...<br />
<br />
I have tried removing the licensing role and have moved the licensing role to the RDS box itself. &nbsp;This had no effect on the error message or connection issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please, Please, Please can someone help me from going bald with this issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Joe,
<div><br />
<div>I understand that, however is it Microsoft's intention to just stop there and have no way to successfully connect to the newer server OS from the Mac machines?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am by no means a Mac user, but my school district is a Mac district that needs to use software designed for PCs. &nbsp;This puts me in the situation to either use BootCamp on all machines or use a Terminal Server environment. &nbsp;The terminal server environment
 is the most cost effective solution to this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am just looking for a solution whether or not it ends up being the MS client. &nbsp;Does anyone else connect to that server version with an alternative to the MS RDC Client?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Would talking to Support through an official support ticket get me any closer to a solution or would I just be tossing money away? &nbsp;I don't mind going the support route if it will solve the issue.

            So I solved this issue with lots of trial, error, and searching for bits of info in all dark alleys of the internet. &nbsp;In the end it is a MAC issue, not a Microsoft issue, however the only way the issue is evident is through the Microsoft RDC Client...
 &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Cause: &nbsp;This is the short version... &nbsp;When the RDS server was set up initially, I didn't have the licensing server correctly configured and licensed so the users were running in the Grace Period. &nbsp;When connecting to the RDS server, the MS RDC client pulled
 down licensing information related to the grace period. &nbsp;When I finally got the licensing server to work, that's when the Macs lost their ability to connect. &nbsp;Due to permissions on the Mac client, the new license information was unable to be downloaded to
 the client.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So this seems simple enough right? &nbsp;It is once you find the area where the permissions issues happened. &nbsp;Here are short and to the point steps to fix the Mac client:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<blockquote>
a. Navigate to&nbsp;<span>Macintosh HD &gt; Users &gt; Shared &gt; Microsoft &gt;&nbsp;</span><span>RDC Crucial Server Information</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>b. &nbsp;Deleted the contents of this folder</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>c. &nbsp;Change the permissions of this folder to Everyone -&gt; Read and Write</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>d. &nbsp;Change the permissions of the Microsoft folder as well to Everyone -&gt; Read and Write</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>e. &nbsp;Reconnect with the MS RDC Client v2.1.2 and verify creation of the files</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>f. &nbsp;you should be able to reconnect easily at this point with no licensing error</span></blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>If you still encounter the licensing error you will need to follow the steps outlined to correct the certificates. &nbsp;Follow the steps below then return to the above client steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\RCM</p>
<p>
** Make a backup if you want to but it should not be needed<br />
</p>
<p>
Right-click each of the following values, click Delete, and then click Yes to confirm the deletion:</p>
<p>
Certificate<br />
X509 Certificate<br />
X509 Certificate ID<br />
X509 Certificate2<br />
Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the server.<br />
Reactivate the Terminal Services Licensing server by using the Telephone connection method in the Licensing Wizard. (I just reactivated online though and it worked just fine.)</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
If you want to read more back and forth banter about this issue and where I found most of my information, check out the following site:&nbsp;<a href="http://mydanat.co.uk/blog/?p=59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mydanat.co.uk/blog/?p=59</a>. &nbsp;I am not affiliated with them but boy did
 they help me out.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
So in the end, neither Microsoft nor Apple will own up to the cause of the issue nor offer a solution that actually works. &nbsp;To be honest I don't really know where to point the finger either to place blame and I really don't care. &nbsp;As long as the server works
 for the users I am now happy.</p>
<p>
<br />

Just another day in the life of an IT person...</p>

    <title>Markup formula for Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericconner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Markup formula for Excel</h2>
                    I’ll try to explain my question as clearly as I can. I’m trying to create a worksheet in Excel to calculate markups on parts based on the purchase cost. I other words if I buy a part for between $0.01 to $9.99 the markup would be 4x, but if the part cost
 is $10.00 to $20.00 the markup would be 3x. Is there a formula that can detect the purchase cost price and apply the corect markup. I have 9 different marup levels in case that changes things.&nbsp;

            A 9 level nested IF is going to get cumbersome. A lookup may be cleaner to work with.
<br />
<br />This tip is right on target. Use the price to look up the markup then apply it to the cost to get price.

            Hi Eric, can i ask one more question . . .
<br />
<br />When you say 0.01 - 9.99 = 6.00
<br />
<br />Do you want the formula to return 6.00 or 9.99 * 6.00

<h2>            One Note 2010--Screen Clipping and Clipboard not working like OneNote 2007. Help&#33;</h2>
                    Using OneNote 2010 and am a heavy user of screen clips--it's not working like it did for me in OneNote 2007. In ON 07, I'd clip a screen shot and it would bypass the pop up dialog box, I'd navigate to the page I needed and BOOM! It would insert (and always
 with a trackback). Neither are working for me and I'm annoyed with the dialogue options every time!&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I select the default of Send To Clipboard every time, then I don't have a trackback of web clips and URLs--only the images. Ugh...</div>

<h2>            Excel 2007 opens in manual calculation mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Isn't automatic calculation mode the default setting for Excel 2007? When I open a blank Excel 2007 it opens in manual calculation mode (I must say,&nbsp; there is no personal or any other template file in XLSTART folder to change the default behavior&nbsp;) . Is
 this a bug in Excel 2007 or any setting which controls this behavior?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem was an addin which was set to manual calculation and it was changing the calculation mode for all Excel files.</p>
<p>BTW to correct this we don't need any VBA we can save a Excel Template with its calculation mode set to automatic in XLStart fodler.</p>

<h2>            Word is flipping to different languages when copy&#47;pasting</h2>
                    <p>This is a strange one to explain, but very frustrating.&nbsp; I am a musician and use Word to chart various songs.&nbsp; When I copy paste certain chord patterns (ex. (F&nbsp; G/B&nbsp; Am&nbsp; D/F#) it flips Word to Russian and I can't undo without rebooting Word.&nbsp; It looks like
 it has something to do with the slash chords D/F#, or some combination of these.&nbsp; I can't find anything in Windows settings that shows a shortcut turned on or anything.&nbsp; Anyhow, this is pretty frustrating.&nbsp; The worst part is that it will flip my whole document
 to this Russian language and there is no way to undo.&nbsp; I just have to start over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Did this even make sense to anyone?</p>

<h2>            Access 2010&#58; How to create a cascading combo box in a navigation form subform &#40;in datasheet view&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a form that allows me to include contact name and address information. It has cascading combo boxes that work great when I open the form in datasheet view. However, they do not work when I placed the form in a navigation form that I am using to tie
 the whole database together and make it user friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relevant fields in this form (frmContacts) are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>comboContactCompany - shows the company at which a particular contact is employed - this is a child key to CompanyID in qryActiveLocations.
</li><li>comboContactLocation - is intened to show the location at which a particular contact works (if a company has branch offices around the country, for example) - this a child key to LocationID in qryActiveLocations.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a query (qryActiveLocations) that filters the locations that can be selected based upon whether or not they are "active". I want comboContactLocation to filter to show only those locations in qryActiveLocations that are associated to the selection
 made in comboContactCompany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The row source for comboContactLocation is as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT qryActiveLocations.LocationID, qryActiveLocations.LocationName, qryActiveLocations.CompanyID FROM qryActiveLocations WHERE (((qryActiveLocations.CompanyID)=[Forms]![frmContacts]![comboContactCompany])) ORDER BY qryActiveLocations.LocationName;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above works fine when&nbsp;I open the form directly, but falls down when placed in a navigation form.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help with this would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It fails because referring to a subform control is more complex than referring to a main form control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way to refer to a control in a subform is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms!mainform.subformcontrol.Form.controlinsubform</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms!mainform.subformcontrol!controlinsubform</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are subtle differences between what those two syntaxes work, but either should be ok in your case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, you should change the query to something more like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT LocationID, LocationName, CompanyID</p>
<p>FROM qryActiveLocations</p>
<p>WHERE CompanyID = Forms!frmContacts.NavigationSubform!comboContactCompany</p>
<p>ORDER BY LocationName</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; NavigationSubform is the default name of the subform CONTROL on the main form so if you changed the name, replace that with the name you used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I removed the redundant table/query name, parenthesis and brackets just to make it easier to read.&nbsp; The query designer is not very sophisticated and adds them in whether they are needed or not.</p>

            <p>Hi Marshall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice, which I followed, but it still doesn't work. I tried both variations of the syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms!frmNavigation.NavigationSubform.Form.comboContactCompany </li><li>Forms!frmNavigation.NavigationSubform!comboContactCompany</li></ul>
<p>In the code that you suggested I replaced frmContacts with frmNavigation. frmContacts is the name of the form that is placed in the NavigationSubform control.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve the result I am looking for with VBA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe, you did not have the other parts needed to deal with cascading combo boxes??&nbsp; Check to make sure that you have VBA code like this in the comboContactCompany combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure:</p>

            <p>Hi Marshall,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies for my lack of clarity ;) I really appreciate you taking the time to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try to expand a little further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a navigation form called frmNavigation. This form has horizontal and vertical "tabs". There are five horizontal tabs and for each horizontal tab there are a varying number of vertical tabs with each one leading to a NavigationSubform control in datasheet
 view (I have not renamed the NavigationSubform control).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: one of the horizontal tabs is communication management and there are the following vertical tabs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>countries (nsfrmCountries), </li><li>companies (nsfrmCompanies), </li><li>locations (nsfrmLocations), and </li><li>contacts (nsfrmContacts). </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nsfrmContacts is the only form that has cascading combo boxes (so far). The intention is to create contacts for each company, but also grouped by location in cases where a company has more than one office. Therefore I have the following cascading combo boxes
 in nsfrmContacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>comboCompanyID (this is the control formerly known as comboContactCompany) </li><li>comboLocationID</li></ul>
<p>I want comboLocationID to filter to show only the locations for the company selected in comboCompanyID. Thereafter, there are a number of text boxes in the&nbsp;nsfrmContacts that handles the information specific to each contact, such as mobile telephone number,
 e-mail address, position and department etc. The selections from comboCompanyID and comboLocationID are also stored in the contacts table (tblContacts), with relationships established to the primary keys in the companies and locations tables (tblCompanies
 and tblLocations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The control sources for comboCompanyID and comboLocationID are queries based on the aforementioned tables which filter to show only those companies and locations which have "active" accounts (qryActiveCompanies and qryActiveLocations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bound column for comboCompanyID is the CompanyID field from qryActiveCompanies (autonumber), with column count 2 set at widths 0cm; 5cm (therefore it displays the company name instead of the ID).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bound column for comboLocationsID is the LocationID field from qryActiveLocations. Again, this control has column count = 2 set at widths 0cm;5cm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The row source for comboLocationID was created using the query builder found by pressing the ellipsis on the row source property in the control's properties sheet. I showed qryActiveLocations and then selected the following fields for the row source property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>LocationID, </li><li>LocationName, and </li><li>LocationCompanyID.</li></ul>
<p>As per your suggestion, LocationCompanyID has the following criteria:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>[Forms]![frmNavigation].[NavigationSubform]![comboCompanyID]</li></ul>
<p>I also tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>[Forms]![frmNavigation].[NavigationSubform].[Form].[comboCompanyID]</li></ul>
<p>In both instances,&nbsp;when the form is loaded and also when I requery comboCompanyID via VBA code in the forms On Got Focus event, I get a popup asking me to enter parameter value:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms!frmNavigation.NavigationSubform!comboCompanyID</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added Me.comboCompanyID = null&nbsp;to the After Update event (I already had the requery) and Me.comboContact.Requery to the form's Current event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still get the request for the parameter value when I load the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the above is probably too much information (I've gone from one extreme to the other), but I'm not certain what might be tripping me up here and I thought it could be related to the architecture for the database instead of the syntax of the query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, again, for your assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I've had success, of sorts, with the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The row source for nsfrmContacts.comboLocationID is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT LocationID, LocationName, LocationCompanyID FROM qryActiveLocations;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ensures that comboLocationID is NOT filtered when the form loads in the NavigationSubform control. I no longer get the "enter parameter" message box when the form loads. I suspect that the problem was that the comboCompanyID control has multiple values
 given that the form loads in datasheet view and the form can't identify which&nbsp;value to use when the form loads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to filter LocationCompanyID, I included the following VBA code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub comboLocationID_GotFocus()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fCompany = Me.comboCompanyID.Value</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.comboLocationID.RowSource = "SELECT LocationID, LocationName, LocationCompanyID
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM qryActiveLocations WHERE (((LocationCompanyID)=" &amp; fCompany &amp; " ));"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when the control gets focus it filters correctly for the current record and any other record where the fCompany has the same value. However, for those records where fCompany has a different value, comboLocationID goes blank. This isn't great for sorting
 and filtering purposes, but I feel that I'm on the right track and that I can find a complete solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep you updated :)</p>

            <p>There is an awful lot going on here and I'm not at all sure I followed all of it.&nbsp; What I will try to do is address some of the stuff in the post I am replying to, even if you later changed things around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; You said "... this control has column count = 2 ..."</p>
<p>But, then you said "... selected the following fields for the row source property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LocationID, LocationName, and LocationCompanyID</p>
<p>If the ColumnCount does not agree with the number of selected fields in the RowSource, nothing can be expected to work so make sure you straighten that out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Whenever you get an unexpected prompt from a query, it's telling you that the thing it is prompting for can not be found.&nbsp; The usual reasons are the thing is misspelled or that the form/subform reference is not open.&nbsp; You indicated that the prompt occurs
 when the form is loaded, but since all this is happening in a Navigation form, you are loading the subform every time you click on the tab for that form.&nbsp; Both of these combo boxes must be in the same subform for any of this to work in a navigation form because
 there is only one subform control and consequently only one subform&nbsp;will be open at any point in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The architecture of your database may or may not be an issue, but I am concerned with your use of a navigation form to flip between many subforms.&nbsp; It&nbsp; kind of sounds like you think that all the subforms are open all the time, which is definitely not
 how a navigation form works.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Setting the combo box's RowSource to an SQL statement is simply an alternate way to requery the combo box with criteria.&nbsp; Using the GotFocus event to do it&nbsp;changes the timing of when it gets done, but I don't see how that can have a big effect unless the
 navigation form loading different subforms is getting in the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it seems to have made a big difference and made everything work correctly, I am lost as to what is going on and why you are getting the results you are.&nbsp; Having other rows in a continuous or datasheet (sub)form go blank when the row source query's
 criteria is changed or it's requeried is normal and has no effect beyond some rows displaying blank.&nbsp; There is a convoluted way to deal with that, but if it's really important, let's wait until everything else is working to address it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't figured it out already, I want to say that I am not a fan of the navigation form.&nbsp; It does nothing that could not have been done in any old version of Access, except make it easier for people to think it's a cool thing to do.&nbsp; To the contrary,
 the capabilities of the navigation form could always be done simply by using a single subform control and some command buttons that set the subform control's SourceObject property.&nbsp; With it being so easy to do, one has to wonder why almost no one ever bothered,
 perhaps because it just is not a good solution to anyone's problem.</p>

<h2>            Excel - How to highlight a cell to indicate it needs populating if a certain value from a pick list is chosen</h2>
                    Apologies if this is a noddy question but.... I have a s/s that has pick lists in several columns. What i would like to do is highlight the cells in the s/s that need populating depending on what has been picked from the list in the first column. EG. If
 i choose dress from the pick list in the first column, i want to highlight the cells in the other columns that need populating like size, colur, style to ensure i do not miss any required information. Hope this makes sense, can anyone help me with this please?

<br />- Select the cells that should be colored if e.g. A1 contains "dress".
<br />- tab Home \ group Styles \ Conditional Formatting \ New Rule
<br />- Choose "Use a formula to determine which cells to format"
<br />- Use this formula for e.g. A1:

<br />- Ok

<br />That's it.

<p>hi danielfarquhar,</p>
<p>the assign policy option is not available in outlook 2016 for mac by design. i suggest you use
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app (owa)</a> as a workaround.</p>
<p>by saying “when online at 365, it says i can only use the parent folder policy”, do you mean that you can only choose
<b>use parent folder policy </b>without other options available as the following picture shows?</p>
<p>please capture a related screenshot as below and upload it for further analysis. to upload a screenshot, please click&nbsp;<strong>use rich formatting</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>insert/edit media</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9faced4d-0819-4ea7-8173-61ed6dd9c49c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9faced4d-0819-4ea7-8173-61ed6dd9c49c" /></a></p>
<p>based on my experience, if you don’t add any retention policy in owa as the below picture shows, you will not be able to use the other retention policies.</p>
<p>please check if you have added the retention policies in owa by navigating to <b>
options&gt; retention policies</b> and upload a screenshot for further analysis.</p>

<p>hi danielfarquhar,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>the retention policies in owa are all created in exchange admin center (eac).</p>
<p>by default, the default mrm policy is applied to the user mailbox.</p>
<p>retention tags are classified into three types based on who can apply them and where in a mailbox they can be applied: default policy tag (dpt), retention policy tag (rpt), personal tag.</p>
<p>dpt is automatically applied to the entire mailbox and rpt is automatically applied to a default folder. both are not shown in owa for your choice.</p>
<p>by default, the rpt (<i>deleted items</i>) in the default mrm policy is applied automatically to the deleted items folders.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7530a986-dab7-486a-b480-10219609ac85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7530a986-dab7-486a-b480-10219609ac85" /></a></p>
<p>only the personal tags which are available in owa can be applied by the users to items and folders.</p>
<p>please check if you have changed the retention tags in eac and upload the screenshots as below.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=de8c31ce-f947-471d-a2cd-d7db9e9b6747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dde8c31ce-f947-471d-a2cd-d7db9e9b6747" /></a></p>

<p>based on my experience, it may take some time or even up to 7 days for the server to update. i suggest you use powershell to start the managed folder assistant:</p>
<p>1. connect to exchange online using remote powershell. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> is for your reference.</p>
<p>2. run the following command:</p>
<p>start-managedfolderassistant -identity <i>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</i></p>
<p>if you run into any problem in the process, please post back with the error for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            IE 11 &#40;version 11.0.9&#41; poor history cache&#63;</h2>
                    I have the surface pro running the latest updates. I've noticed recently (don't remember when exactly) that whenever I'm browsing in the Metro version of IE and then swipe right to get back to the previous page, I'm taken back to a page I visited a LONG
 time ago instead of the actual previous page. Is there some kind of history cache bug in IE?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desktop Internet Explorer version and the Modern Internet Explorer shares the same browsing history. Try deleting the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a. </strong>Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and click on the <strong>
Tools</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>b. </strong>Click on <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>c. </strong>In the <strong>General</strong> tab, under the section: <strong>
Browsing History</strong>, check the box next to <strong>Delete Browsing History on Exit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d. </strong>Click on <strong>Delete</strong> and check the options: <strong>
Temporary Internet Files</strong> and <strong>History</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>e. </strong>Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>f. </strong>Restart <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and check </p>

<p>A specific example would help.&nbsp; For example, one could get that feeling using these forums but in fact, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;just that the "previous page" was really a previous iframe inside a previous page, so in that case (and any others for similarly constructed
 websites) it is better to use the website's Previous button than to try to use the browser's guess about what "Back" might mean.</p>

            I don't know exactly what you are saying, but here's an example: I visit CNN, follow a couple of news stories. Then I search on Bing (I do this by directly typing a search term in the address bar straight from the CNN webpage). I scroll through a couple
 of hits. Then I type another search into the address bar. After looking at the available hits, I decide that my previous search was better. So I swipe back as one should in Metro IE. But instead of getting back to my previous search, I end up on one of the
 news stories from CNN. What's wrong with this picture?

<p>Thanks for the clear description.&nbsp; I can't reproduce it but I would agree you should not be skipping over the first search results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you sure you aren't swiping too hard or something?&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using some more precise procedure than swiping to see if the page is still there in the browse stack?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. even without seeing an Address bar for its Back button you could try pressing the usual Alt-CursorLeft or even the (more problematic)
 Backspace key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I had to change my Search provider to BING (from Microsoft) to do the test and to do that had to close MUF IE--proving that MUF IE caches registry settings instead of looking at them dynamically.&nbsp; That is something that I have suspected but having clear
 proof is helpful.&nbsp; Another quirk I noticed while doing this is that&nbsp; Ctrl-e&nbsp; opens the MUF IE Address bar but does not provide the reassuring question mark space to start my search; nevertheless I tried starting my searches both ways, with no apparent consequence.&nbsp;
 However, there would be a consequence if the "search" had not been at least two words.&nbsp; I always make sure that I have a question mark space (? ) to start a search from the Address bar with my default search provider.&nbsp; You can get that reassurance by pressing
 Ctrl-e again, even though it may seem redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrolling the search results meant that my Address bar disappeared so I was induced to try the "swipe from the left" gesture that you mention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally I would never do this because it has always seemed so flakey a procedure, e.g. often resulting in unintended
 effects, especially when more than one MUF app is running.&nbsp; And in fact, my swipe attempts weren't always as precise as they might have been if I had been&nbsp;more experienced with&nbsp;the feature.&nbsp; So, as well as getting the expected result I was getting no result
 (not swiping hard enough?) or picking up the App switcher (swiping from too high a spot?).&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for looking into it. I've noticed that the issue comes up when the tab is old. By this I mean I sometimes have multiple tabs open at once, and I can leave them like that for a week sometimes (I hardly ever shutdown my Surface Pro). Then one day
 as I go to create another tab, I decide to just use an old one that I no longer need. So here's the more appropriate example: I visit CNN, follow a couple of news stories. Then I leave the tab open for a few days. I then decide to use this same tab to search
 on Bing (I do this by directly typing a search term in the address bar straight from the CNN webpage). I scroll through a couple of hits. Then I type another search into the address bar. After looking at the available hits, I decide that my previous search
 was better. So I swipe back as one should in Metro IE. But instead of getting back to my previous search, I end up on one of the news stories from CNN. Does this mean the old cache is dominant over anything I do recently?

<p>That sounds like something that I have seen reported before.&nbsp; Some kind of phantom page for swiping to find?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Adding a "few days" to the repro procedure is going to make it unlikely that such a&nbsp;bug is ever uncovered.&nbsp; Have you tried using a more
 precise procedure than swiping (e.g. when you have a keyboard or mouse or even pen to use) to find out if there really is a navigation problem or if swiping is the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; Swiping and even Touch (even using a Pen of the "capacitive" type) means you are
 no longer using binary logic, but using hardware and software which is making guesses about what you are intending, so it's really little wonder that in the infancy of this technological shift in paradigm that errors may happen.&nbsp; FWIW I don't think that they
 have worked out the use-case scenarios sufficiently to keep old folks like me who are used to precision satisfied with the new reality of indeterminacy.&nbsp; I don't think everything needs to be so "sloppy" and haphazard but that seems to be the case in many instances.</p>

            <p>I've had this problem as well. I would explain it like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the Modern (app) version of IE11, you can swipe back to go back. It should be the equivalent of clicking 'Back' once, bringing you to the previous page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens, instead, is that with one swipe it goes back MANY pages. It might be a page you visited 5 minutes ago, an hour ago or a day ago. I think the actual stack of pages you visited in that tab is still kept intact, because you can swipe forward through
 all the pages in between to get to the one you were trying to go to. The first hop just shoots you past it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not have anything to do with Bing Search (that was just an example of a previously visited page) and it does not have to do with the browsing history being intact or not, since I've had it happen without me doing anything to my browsing history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>destaks brings up a good observation with the additional tabs. It doesn't happen all the time and I was wondering what the pattern was. It seems plausible based on what I've seen: It happens after browsing in one tab, opening another tab, maybe browsing
 around in the second tab and maybe closing it, and then going to the previous tab and swiping back.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, it would be that whatever marker is telling the firrst tab which page to go "back" to is being disrupted when the second tab comes into play.</p>
<p><br />
Please fix this bug, it is very annoying to try to go back one page and having to wade forward a dozen or so pages to get to where you wanted.</p>

<h2>            Too Pricy if you accidently damaged a Nokia&#47;Microsoft Windows phone.</h2>
                    <div>I bought a Lumia 1320 approximately 6 months ago. Two days ago, I accidently dropped it while pushing it in to the pocket and I ended up shattering the glass of the phone (corning gorilla glass 3). Fortunately I had a screen protector
</div>

<div>on, which prevented the glass particles from spilling out.&nbsp; The screen is intact, touch screen is working fine and the only damage happened is that the glass is shattered. I visited Microsoft devices service centre for getting it fixed
</div>

<div>and they said it would cost me 11,750 ₹ (185.41 $) for the replacement which would include the (touch pad + screen/display). The disappointing fact is here the phone is available for 8,500 ₹ (134.13 $). I am a student and bought it from
</div>

<div>my pocket money believing that Microsoft would be a better option than other smartphone manufacturers. I gave it a shot, and now the service centre would charge me more than the actual cost of that phone. Being a new phone available for
</div>

<div>just 8,500 ₹, how could the screen could cost 11,750 ₹ which is more than the phone's over all price?. No one could afford a minor repair for more than the actual price of that product!. Getting a Windows phone means you cant repair it
</div>

<div>if a little bit damaged?. That's not expected from Microsoft. This makes it impossible for me to recommend a Microsoft device to any one due to this problem. I did recommended to get a Microsoft Lumia 640XL to a friend of mine and he
</div>

<div>did get it too, but this incidence has made me turn around from the brand loyalty.</div>





<div>Kindly address my problem at the earliest and rescue me from this disastrous position and advice your community to help me and your brand loyal' s&nbsp; at the earliest.</div>





<div>Eagerly waiting in anticipation for your reply. Your earliest action in this regards would be highly appreciated.</div>

            8,500 ₹ (134.13 $).&nbsp; On contract I am sure. Look up how much the phone is to buy NOT on contract and then realize that you cannot get something for free because YOU made a mistake.&nbsp; Does it suck? Yes. But you are not carrying around a 134 dollar phone
 in your pocket. Otherwise you should buy a new one right? Doesn't matter what phone maker you went with. Sorry you had an accident.

            <p>There is no contracts in India. That said, the quotes price for the 1320 sounds like either a second hand or some sort of deal as the 1320 is quite a bit more expensive, actually more than double the amount quoted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, the screen/digitizer is the most expensive part of a phone and you choose to take a risk here with no insurance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, this is no different for any other brand really so there's not much to see here honestly.</p>

            <p>Try the Divide and Conquer method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make two copies of your presentation. &nbsp;Delete the first half of the slides from one copy, the other half of the slides from the second copy. &nbsp;Save both of these as PPT. &nbsp;If a problem with one or more of the slides is preventing the save, it'll likely happen
 with one of the "halves" and not the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, divide the "problem" half presentation into halves, save each as PPT and so on. &nbsp;Keep dividing until you've found the problem slide. &nbsp; Delete that same slide from the original presentation and try saving as PPT again. &nbsp;You'll have to re-create
 the problem slide.</p>

<h2>            Broken screen on n9 Is it possible to sync&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I crashed my N9 last night with this result : <a href="http://i48.tinypic.com/234k0p.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://i48.tinypic.com/234k0p.jpg</a></p>
<p>So i want too transfer my contacts, SMS, and pictures before i send it for a repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the crack is in the inner display and is all black.</p>
<p>The most functions seems to work, speakers, vibration, buttons, and reacts when i touch the screen hard.</p>
<p>The light in the corner shine up when i connect it with a charger or my PC.</p>
<p>It shows up in "Devices and Printers" (Windows 7) but no harddrive shows up.</p>
<p>Nokia suite finds my n9 but need nokia link, neither nokia link or ovi seems too find it and says that i need to select sync, but i can't when its all black. and i tried to press where i think the button should be.</p>
<p>Would be nice to get the exact placement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it any way to force the phone to sync?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thanks in advance</span></span></p>

<p>Sorry to hear of your misfortune here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presumably device is left in default of "<strong>Always ask</strong>" upon USB connection, whereas always advisable to leave in "<em><strong>Sync and connect mode</strong></em>" for such eventuality as this. Here is photograph of N9 screen although unfortunately
 can't provide screenshot, but correct proportions can be determined from this image. You will of course be only prompted
<strong>once</strong>&nbsp;so need to hit right spot first time, but could take another shot with ruler on screen if it would help!</p>

<p>Do you have latest version of Nokia Suite Beta installed upon your PC?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your N9 was set at "Ask on connection" the advice in my previous post to compare image size with N9 to determine proportionally where you need to tap "Sync and connect" remains.</p>

    <title>How do you convert a UK document to US document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauliw25  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you convert a UK document to US document&#63;</h2>
                    I was recently sent a .doc document created and&nbsp;formatted&nbsp;in MS Word 2010 in the U.K.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is - whenever I type text into it using U.S.&nbsp;English&nbsp;- many of the U.S. words when I use spell check show up in error. For example: the word - favorite.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This spelling of <u>favorite </u>is correct in the U.S. - however inside this specific document it will be underlined in RED as if in error and spell check will want to change the spelling to
<u>favourite </u>- which is UK spelling.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Inside of Word - with this document open, I verified and or changed everything I could find to U.S. English. Yet, the document still&nbsp;spell-checks&nbsp;in UK English.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I convert this document to U.S.&nbsp;English&nbsp;and maintain it's formatting?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW - I use MS Word 2007<br />
