<h2>            Build 10240 - 2 issues with update that may cause heartburn</h2>
                    <p>I have both a Surface 3 and a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; Both were on build 10166.&nbsp; Surface Pro 3 is my work machine, Surface 3 is my play machine.&nbsp; S3 is only a couple months old with no 3rd party programs and worked fine under 8.1.&nbsp; Updated SP3 first with no issues.&nbsp;
 Great build and worked great!&nbsp; Updated my S3 next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1 - All the apps (things like Ebay, Paypal, Facebook, etc.) that were on my SP3 now showed up on my S3.&nbsp; Not good.&nbsp; My S3 does not have the memory or horsepower to use these apps and I didn't want them loaded.&nbsp; No choice or option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2 - I didn't catch problem 1 immediately but noticed that not all of my apps showed up on the start menu.&nbsp; No problem, I'll just add them from the full menu.&nbsp; Not.&nbsp; When I right-clicked on the apps and selected 'Add to Start', they didn't.&nbsp; Tried
 my MS apps like Word, Excel, etc. and no problem (shouldn't they have been on my start already since they were there in build 10166).&nbsp; Tried to add a bunch of apps with same result.&nbsp; Turned out I noticed that the apps that wouldn't add to the Start where the
 apps that I hadn't had on my S3 anyhow (they were only on my SP3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Decided to do a Restore (keep my programs and had to log in to Office 365 and re-download) and it worked (but didn't keep my programs).&nbsp; Anyway, after that I was able to download apps (the ones above for a test) and add them to the start.&nbsp; Not a show stopper
 but a PITA.&nbsp; Just sayin', MS software, MS hardware, people are going to expect a flawless update (especially those not tech savvy).</p>

    <title>Export limitations - is using OneNote a recipe for a future disaster - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> umma-2-gumma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export limitations - is using OneNote a recipe for a future disaster &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Over the years, I had to move my data from one service to another more often than I would like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with Evernote back in 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hated the format, so I tried some other services (Springpad in particular, which is now defunct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Springpad bit the dust, I had to export all info to EN and it was a PITA. Never want to have to do this again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept coming back to Evernote because Onenote did not have a good mobile client until recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I saw the updated ON clients for iPad and Android, I made the switch using 3rd party importer (don't think MS had their importer yet as of January 2015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Onenote but the latest decision by Evernote to limit their free version functionality and jack up the price of their premium subscription plan, plus MS decision to cut the free space in Onedrive accounts, made me wonder what can I do should MS at
 some point make changes that would make me want to leave Onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am realizing that I have a few gigabytes of my data in an application that doesn't really allow me to export it in any usable format.&nbsp;There's no export option that I can find, that will preserve clickable file attachments. Yes I can convert pdf attachments
 to printouts, even though it's a waste of screen space half the time, but what about zip files, .msg files, Word and Excel files ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am starting to ponder if it makes sense for me to keep investing my time and effort into populating the application I may be forced to stop using 5-6-10 years from now. Perhaps I should just copy all of this data into a file system &amp; invest
 into a good indexing software instead. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A very simple solution would be to allow exporting notebooks in a HTML website format with in-line file attachments converted to clickable images linked to the file saved in the attachments directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone from MS comment on the plans for expanding the export options ?</p>

 the Microsoft account you've set up on the phone to people.live.com and onedrive.live.com. Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Its not necessary to enter them manually, instead contact your operator and ask them to send you MMS settings, once received configuration SMS, open it, go to Options&gt;save&gt;it'll ask if to set them as defaults&gt;select "Yes" and thats it. now try to send
 MMS.<br />
Good Luck.

<h3> rsmol  say:</h3>
<h2>            E61 cannot import personal certificate</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I can't import personal certificate. I have personal certificate in p12 (pkcs12) format and it can be imported into firefox without any issues. However when I open this certificate on E61 I am asked for:<br />
<br />
password for my certificate - I enter correct one<br />
E61 proceeds to to Screen where it says:<br />
<br />
File contains:<br />
1 private key<br />
1 personal certificate<br />
1 authority certificate<br />
<br />
Save? When I click on save I get message:<br />
<br />
Private key corrupted!<br />
<br />
then it proceeds to CA which works fine.<br />
<br />
What I am doing wrong? Kindly assist as this is show stopper in 170K+ employees company.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I've got the same problem.<br />
And yesterday (after many hours of testing) I've found a solution (if you use a Mircosoft CA to generate your certificates):<br />
<br />
I'm using certificates generated by my Windows 2003 CA Server.<br />
<br />
Normaly CSP (Crypthographic Service Provider) is set to "Microsoft Enhanced CSP v.1.0". And that's the problem: Change this to Microsoft RSA SChannel CSP and your phone can read your private certificates...<br />
<br />
That's it.<br />
<br />
Hope that will help you out!<br />
<br />
Greetings,<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm not only unlucky, I'm frustrated! :-(<br />
<br />
I've got exactly the same problem. Modell: E65.<br />
<br />
In our company around 50000 users are already using personal certificates, generated using an openssl pki framework.<br />
Installing/migrating/running a Windows-PKI instead, only for importing P12-Files into our Nokia mobile's is not a solution nor an option.<br />
<br />
All our user-certificates (Server-,Client-,Multi-Level-CA-Certificates) are working fine within standard-protocols and standard applications (e.g. IMAPS, VPN/IPSec, WPA-EAP-TTLS/TLS, HTTPS, LDAPs,...), even within Microsoft's client-appilcations (IE / Outlook)
 there are no problems importing / using them for encryption, authentication or signing purposes.<br />
<br />
So there should be no problem, regarding the import into a E65?!<br />
<br />
I tried to convert some demo-certificates various ways, exported, converted them to DER, build different P12-formated files but not chance: the E65 always reports "File corrupted".<br />
<br />
I also followed the instruction found under<br />
<a href="https://blogs.forum.nokia.com/view_entry.html?id=412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.forum.nokia.com/view_entry.html?id=412</a><br />
<br />
So I tried to download a p12-Container directly from a test-webserver using the correct mime-type, no luck: Corrupted File!<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, any p12-file, which the E65 says is corrupted, could be imported into IE/Firefox/Outlook/Thunderbird (the later two on windows &amp; linux plattforms) or opened/investigated using openssl (0.9.8c and 0.9.8d) on the command line without any
 problems.<br />
<br />
The hint (two posts above), creating certificates using MS-AD-integrated PKI gave me a small hope again. (Please do not understand me wrong, migrating all our user/server certs and PKI-Infrastructure to MS is completly impossible, but a small test will show
 whether out p12-Files cause the corruption problems).<br />
So I imported (doubleclick, windows wizard...) the openssl-generated p12 into IE (flagged "exportable") without problems. Right after the import, I exported it various ways (e.g. w/o stong encryption) into a MS-pfx (aka p12) formated file. Renamed the suffix
 from pfx to p12 and gave it to openssl for processing / investigation:<br />
<br />
openssl pkcs12 -in testuser.p12 -info<br />
Enter Import Password:<br />
MAC Iteration 2000<br />
MAC verified OK<br />
PKCS7 Data<br />
Shrouded Keybag: pbeWithSHA1And3-KeyTripleDES-CBC, Iteration 2000<br />
Bag Attributes<br />
localKeyID: 01 00 00 00<br />
friendlyName: {EE88EF5C-5404-487C-AB22-AA56E79D447C}<br />
Microsoft CSP Name: Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0<br />
Key Attributes<br />
X509v3 Key Usage: 10<br />
<br />
Ok the content seems to be in "Microsoft CSP" format!!! (remembering two posts earlier, that's the container-format MS-PKI produces, so a successfull import of this file should be possible?!.... No way either!!! "File corrupted!"<br />
<br />
Another point: during my first p12 import try I used a corporate-standard-p12 file, that means, it contains:<br />
1 x User-Cert<br />
1 x User-Key<br />
1 x Intermediate-level-CA-Cert<br />
1 x Root-level-CA-Cert<br />
<br />
The E65 successfully imported the two CA-Certs, ask for a name and stored them under "Authorities". They are accessible within S60 (Security-&gt;certif.manag) and anything is fine with them. But the also contained user-certificate and the user-key resulted in
 "File Corrupted!". :-(<br />
<br />
So, for me in the moment it looks really that there is a bug in S60-3rdEd. (E65). Our certificate-containers are as far as I can say completly standard conform all software (opensource/closed source) can read/import our p12-contents without problems, even the
 E65 can partialy (CA-Certs) read the p12 contents (but not the user-cert/key). :-(<br />
<br />
I would be very happy if someone else can confirm the above results and even more happy if someone else can give me more ideas where to look for a possible solution.<br />
<br />
What I'm missing is an exact specification from Nokia/Symbian, regarding the P12 contents. That means, Certificate/Key Encryption, Formats, Hash-Algorithms, Iterators, Mac-Iterators, and so on... If such an specification would be available/accessible chances
 are good to be able to generate a valid p12 file containing importable private keys. Information like DER/PEM and mime-type that's by far not enough.<br />
<br />
Because I was not able to find such details specs, all I can offer in the moment is to generate test certificates and p12-container-files for further in-deep debugging?!<br />
<br />
If it is not a bug of S60-3rdEd. perhaps someone else reading this thread can offer a MS-PKI-generated (and of course successfully imported ins S60) p12-File (even revoked should not be a problem) with all passphrases for download, so I can try to investigate
 in deep the formats and the differences?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help!<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Krum

2. I opened the attachment on E61, saved the root certificate<br />
3. ensure, you answer with yes twice on request<br />
<br />
PART B User certificate with private key<br />
thanks for your tip on sending just a p12-file.<br />
it worked great. all other tips with CER-files did not work in my case.<br />
<br />
1. Send p12 with cert and private key via email<br />
2. open attachment and save it<br />
3. I was asked for pwd of the key<br />
4, I was asked for new password for the key-storage<br />
<br />
Nothing more.<br />
By means of this I was able to setup https-connections to my server, which are restricted to my E61-clients authorized via self signed openssl certificates.

            <p>Then you will have to talk to the developer of the database, or someone who does have design privileges on it. If that person is not available (and it's a pretty old database, it seems, so that's quite possible) you may have some difficulty! To fix this
 error you will have to change the design of the form, and - with the current database security and your privileges - you can't even SEE the design, much less change it.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Flynn,<br />
<br />
Please confirm whether you have chosen "Convert to HTML format" when sending messages in Rich Text format to Internet recipients.<br />

<p>
</p><p>You mentioned "I have test 3 distribution group. Just one group happened". It shows that the Outlook feature works fine. Based on my experience, I'd like to confirm if there is any transport rule applied to that problematic group removed the voting property.
 To check it, please run a message trace for that group referring to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Moreover, if mail route is OK, please let me know:<br />
1. Are all the recipients internal or external?<br />
2. How many recipients are there in that distribution group?<br />

    <title>Outlook Block Sender Option Never Works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordongoodfellow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Block Sender Option Never Works</h2>
                    <p>The block sender option in Outlook doesn't work. It never works. It has never worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this, and is there a way of making this pathetic piece of junk actually do things you tell it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me cite two examples. I have been getting unwanted emails from a sender with the email address mlgn2ca.com and rockshopz.com for longer than I can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I get these emails (along with many other unwanted emails) I use Outlook's own Junk&gt;Block Sener option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this more than a dozen times for each address. The emails keep coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently I have taken it a step further. I have used Junk&gt;Junk Email Options&gt;Blocked Seners&gt;Add ... and I have taken the time and trouble to manually enter the domains of the email senders into the list of putatively blocked senders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet still these junk emails come to me, touting all sorts of rubbish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore Outlook's junk filters do not work. So why have them at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More importantly, when are Outlook's engineers going to get round to making a junk filter which DOES work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technical standards Microsoft sets themselves are so low it is unbelievable they even have a place in the market at all!</p>

            Hi Gordon,<br />
<br />
Based on the description that you provided it seems that you have successfully added the unwanted email address on the
<strong>Block a mail sender Option</strong>. However, you are still getting a message from those unwanted email address. For this, we'll be needing additional information for us to further isolate the issue. Kindly answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
• Which <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">email version</a></strong> are you using?<br />
• How was your email account configured in Outlook?&nbsp;<br />
• How many names are on the Safe and Blocked Senders list? Is it too long?<br />
<br />
For the meantime, you may verify if the unwanted address or domain is not also on one of the Safe lists because it can override the list of your blocked list sender.<br />
<br />
If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

<p>Thank you for replying, albeit three weeks later!</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Which <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">email version</a></strong> are you using?</p>
<p>I have Office Professional PLus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• How was your email account configured in Outlook? </p>
<p>I am using the default configuration; in other words, the settings are as Microsoft made it without my intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• How many names are on the Safe and Blocked Senders list? Is it too long?</p>
<p>There is nothing on the application to tell me how many name are on there but a quick sum tells me 145. There is nothing to indicate what is too long. There are no figures at all. So how do I know what is too long? Where is this information?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find the idea of leaving blocked senders in the safe senders list completely absurd.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On further online chatting a MS support person also said I needed to block these addresses on my webmail, or the Outlook blockings would not work. You do not mention this, though. So it seems that this is yet another example of one MS person and another
 MS person giving completely different advice. This is typical of what MS does; it trains people to say different things. I found a similar thing happening when I had an issue with my email when I was using Windows Live Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suggest that MS just retrains all of its people and gets it right at some time in the future. Unfortunately as a civilisation it seems that we are stuck with MS, together with the shoddy low bar to quality that it espouses, until another supplier supercedes
 it. For the sake of all in humanity I hope this happens soon.</p>

            Hello. If you just want free applications, there are a couple of good sites,
<a href="http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">freewarepocketpc.net</a> and <a href="http://www.freewareppc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
freewareppc.com</a>. Note that Microsoft closed the Windows Mobile Marketplace and you have to access alternate stores such as
<a href="http://www.handango.com/Home.jsp?siteId=2218&amp;platformId=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">handango.com</a>,
<a href="http://windows-mobile.handster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">handster.com</a>, or the developer's website. Windows Mobile installation files have a .cab extension. Basically, if you can get the .cab file to your device and execute it, the app will install. You can choose
 to install to main memory or SD card. Always try SD card first to conserve main memory. If it doesn't work well, uninstall and reinstall to main memory. You should be able to run practically any app designed for Windows Mobile.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to insert double quotes mark in front of every paragraph using Find and Replace&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain that previously I was able to insert a double quote in front of every paragraph in Word 2010 using Find and replace and wildcard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bench of United Kingdom means the bank that is currently used for all purposes</p>
<p>Bench of Spain means the bank that is currently used for all purposes</p>

<p>"Bench of Spain means the bank that is currently used for all purposes</p>

<p>

</p><p>I think I was using something like </p>
<p>Find=paragraph mark</p>
<p>Replace="</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful for your help.</p>

<p>You're close, but not quite there. The Replace expression has to keep the paragraph mark in place; otherwise you'll wind up with all the text in one paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use these entries:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/280bf527-82c7-43f3-a852-cf6d0ab21a2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/280bf527-82c7-43f3-a852-cf6d0ab21a2a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The code ^p represents the paragraph mark.</p>
<p>The code ^&amp; represents the "Find what" text that was matched. In this case it will be a paragraph mark in the same style as the current paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will almost do it all when you click the Replace All button, except for one more step: There won't be a quote mark before the first paragraph, and there will be an extra one at the end of the document. You have to fix that manually.</p>

                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>We're having an issue with some of our O365 users closing out Office products but they still hang up in task manager using about 15% CPU. The problem then compounds every time they open and close another Office product until they are eventually maxing
 out the CPU.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>I've used Process Explorer and it seems like it's </span><span style="font-weight: bold">mso20win32client.dll</span><span> that is chugging CPU cycles when the problem happens.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>We think we have it mostly settled by putting everyone on the semi-annual channel and version 1808 and then turning off updates but I was hoping someone had insight into what's going on.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span>Also, does anyone know if having Microsoft updates turned on overrides the Office update setting? I have a few users who got updates turned back on and put back on the Monthly
 channel and that's the only thing I can think of causing it.</span></div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Count_Blacula,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the trouble it has caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About this dynamic link library, there was an issue that causes Excel crush:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/excel-crashing-faulting-module-name/1f7f01cc-86e7-4e53-8a79-f60363e58e03">Excel
 Crashing: Faulting module name: mso20win32client.dll</a>. You can check the thread see if the symptom has anything in common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the update channel, whether you set it in Admin Portal? If not, you can try this: Portal&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portal.office.com</a>&nbsp;&gt; Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Services &amp; add-ins &gt; Office software download settings:
 change the setting to Every 6 months:</p>

</p><p>For further support, here are some questions we want to confirm with you:</p>
<p>1. The problematic Office version and build number</p>

            Assuming that the numbering is coming from the heading itself and has not been applied to the TOC style, then the bold is also coming from the heading itself. In the document body, place the insertion point in the first Heading 1 and select
<strong>Define New Multilevel List</strong> from the <strong>Multilevel List</strong> dropdown in the
<strong>Paragraph</strong> group of the <strong>Home</strong> tab. Select Level 3. Beside the number box, click
<strong>Font...</strong> and make sure that the <strong>Style</strong> box is clear. If it says "Bold," select that and delete it. Then click
<strong>OK</strong> twice to exit both dialogs. Update the TOC again.

            Make sure that you modify the Heading 3 style so that it includes bold formatting, as opposed to making each individual heading paragraph bold. Clear direct font formatting from headings in the main body of the document, for example by selecting the text
 and pressing Ctrl+SpaceBar.

            <p>If your Heading 3 style is bold, the numbering will automatically be bold, too, so you don't have to specify the formatting in the Define New Multilevel List dialog. I don't think you have (as Stefan suggests) applied bold formatting as direct formatting;
 if you had, the entire TOC entry would be bold--not just the numbering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As Stefan suggests,&nbsp;however, you can start by clearing any direct font formatting from the headings; even if the heading itself doesn't have any direct formatting, the numbers will be bold if the paragraph mark is formatted as bold.</p>

            <p>Suzanne and Stefan:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both very much for hanging in there with me and helping me.&nbsp; I have followed your instructions (at least I believe I have) and it hasn't changed anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My header level 3 is formatted as bold,&nbsp; and the text of it is bold in the document and
 not in the TOC.&nbsp; The numbering is provided by my&nbsp;multi-level list numbering (which is linked to header Level 3) and I turned the bold off the font of that and it changed the numbers back to regular (removed the bold) in the text of the document.&nbsp; Which they
 are supposed to be bold in the document itself.&nbsp; In addition, the other levels of headings and multi-level lists are set the exact same way and it works correctly for levels 1 and 2.&nbsp; It is only in levels 3 and 4 in the TOC that suddenly the numbers become
 bold in the TOC.&nbsp; The way it's supposed to look is that the Item level is all Header 1 with the multi-level list providing the numbering and linked to Heading 1.&nbsp; in the TOC this whole line should be bold.&nbsp; After that, in the TOC there should be no bold.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 And as mentioned above - right now I've got everything with the same settings which causes my confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; any chance anyone can help?</p>

            <p>When you turned off the bold format for the numbers in Heading 3, did you confirm that the Heading 3 style is formatted as bold? If so, when you press
<strong>Ctrl+Q</strong> in a Heading 3 paragraph, does this make the numbers bold? This should work as described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the TOC entries to be bold, you have to modify the TOC styles--TOC 1 for Level 1, TOC 2 for Level 2, and so on. It looks like your Level 1 is already bold, as desired, and the rest are not, also as specified.</p>

    <title>Build 10162 Scaling issue with 4k monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travdark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10162 Scaling issue with 4k monitor</h2>
                    <p>I've been experiencing an issue with scaling in the latest build of Windows 10. I'm using a&nbsp;ACER 32" B326HK 4K monitor. Under "Customize your display" panel in Settings, I have the 100% selected. However, when booting my computer up and logging in the system
 doesn't remember the setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open the same panel and it shows it's set at 100%, but all my icons and other interface elements appear at what looks like 300%. The only fix is to move the slider away and back to 100% and then sign out and sign in. I never experienced a scaling problem
 like this with Windows 8.1 or earlier builds.</p>

                    <p>In my O365 Outlook settings page, I &nbsp;have enabled the Suggested Meeting add-in but it does not do anything when an email arrives with a time and date. The Action Items add-in does work as expected.

            Hi Dean,<br />
<br />
Yeah, I have received the email you sent to my Office 365 account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Via checking the email which couldn’t generate the “Suggested Meeting”, we have found that it doesn’t meet the requirement of “Suggested Meeting”. As I have mentioned that there are 2 conditions to be met for the “Suggested Meeting”:<br />
1.<span> </span>A time/data in the message.<br />
2.<span> </span>The message should be
<strong>underlined</strong> but not hyperlinked.&nbsp;<br />
In the email you sent to me, although there was the time and data (9th Feb 2017, 11:00am to 12:30pm), it wasn’t underlined;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, please let the sender resend the same email with the data and time underlined (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">9th Feb 2017, 11:00am to 12:30pm</span>) and check the result. Or, replace the data and time with “<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Could
 you schedule a meeting for 1 pm tomorrow</span>?” instead.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<h2>            Problems opening google Streetview</h2>
                    I've just installed IE10 for Windows 7 64 bit version.&nbsp; I've found that I can no longer open "street view" in Google maps.&nbsp; It opens a dialogue box telling me to install the latest version of Adobe Flash, which I have done but then reopens the dialogue
 box with the same message.&nbsp; I have searched the web and found some others are having the same problem but no solution.&nbsp; I am using google.co.uk if that makes any difference.

<p><span style="color: rgba(91, 103, 112, 1)">It appears that my outlook messages have changed its settings recently. We have an excel document where the cells have the custom formatting of "#,##0..00;[Red]-#,##0.00" applied to them. So any negative figures turn into red
 font.<br />
<br />
However, when I come to paste this into outlook, it pastes it as a black font.. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to fix this. It used to paste this correctly. I can get around this by pasting as a picture but sadly not the solution I need. I have
 tried pasting as "keep source formatting" but it still pastes in black font.</span></p>

<del>After&nbsp;we set the format for minus numbers as Red, it is not feasible to copy the red format to Outlook application. As a workaround, we can use the paste as
<strong>picture</strong> option to show numbers in red. I know it would better if we can do this. I suggest you submit your feedback via

<del>Thanks for your understanding.</del><br />

            That's not true though is it? I have been able to do this before last week, and I can do it right now on my colleagues computer(s). Settings are all the same but mine seems to paste in black now in the past few days.

<p>The reply from Linda Wu is incorrect. Here is a screenshot of my worksheet. I copied the&nbsp;data to Outlook and sent myself a message - the insert on the screenshot.</p>
<p>Try doing an Office repair. Failing that, post a message to the Outlook forum</p>
<p>best wishes</p>

<p>Hi MK_VT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the wrong information posted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After more tests, I can reproduce this issue in all Office channel except the Deferred channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can I confirm the following information to clarify the situation?</p>
<p>1. A screenshot of the Office version you are using. To check it, click File &gt; Account &gt; capture all information under Product information.(You can mask your account information)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02ea89e9-d0b8-47be-8d64-6044ef573c71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02ea89e9-d0b8-47be-8d64-6044ef573c71" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you update Office today?</p>
<p>3. Do other users in your orgnization have the same issue? Which version and channel are your colleagues using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Linda</p>

<p>
</p><p>2) Haven't ran any office updates as far as I can tell (unless something ran auto overnight at some point)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) No-one else so far seem to have the issue. Other colleagues run 2016, 2013, 2010. No issues their end.</p>

            Hi MK,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Based on the screenshot provided in your above post, I presume you are not using Office 365 for Business subscription.<br />
<br />
Given this situation, I will move this case to <strong>Office &gt; Outlook &gt; Other/unknow &gt; Office 365 Home</strong> to handle this case properly. Guys there will continuing support you.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
Linda<br />

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just nudging this up to see if anyone is able to assist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I tell if my office was recently updated? Now that I think back, I had a yellow bar up top on my programs that said update - thinking this might be the cause?</p>
