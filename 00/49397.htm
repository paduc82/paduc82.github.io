    <title>Skype incoming call volume too high - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> particlesplus99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype incoming call volume too high</h2>
                    <p>The recent skype update to Skype version 8.30.0.98 changed the overall interface substantially.&nbsp; Most the changes were fine once I got used to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the audio volume for incoming call ringing is at the maximum volume for my speakers it seems and
 doesn't track the audio volume setting within skype (the one for the actual volume during a call).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can imagine it's incredibly annoying in that I nearly jump out of my chair everytime there's an incoming call now.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want to adjust the overall windows volume level, since then every other audio application I use will be affected.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there
 a way to set the ring volume in Skype or have it use the volume level already setup for the call itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Since you're using Windows 10, you can adjust the volume from your volume mixer. Just right-click&nbsp;the speaker icon beside the system tray on your taskbar and select
<strong>open volume mixer</strong>. You can adjust Skype's volume&nbsp;individually from there.</p>

<h2>            Mail on surface pro 4 will not sync with Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use my gmail email accounts through the mail app on the surface pro 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its setup by using the gmail option when creating an email account and I allow the Microsoft mail to have access. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are received on the Microsoft mail fine, but when I mark them as read, they don't get marked as read through the gmail email when logging into the account through the standard browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I want to use the Microsoft mail on the surface pro, rather then always going to the browser and login in, I would at the least assume that it will sync with gmail but doesn't seem to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dies anyone one know the reason for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            microsoft 10 computer will not start up</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my computer and got a message&nbsp; "preparing automatic repair" then "diagnosing your pc".&nbsp; After a while I got a message "your pc did not start correctly".&nbsp; Press "Restart" to restart your pc, which will sometimes fix the problem.&nbsp; You can also&nbsp;press
 "advanced options" to try other options to repair your pc. &nbsp;Pressing "Restart" and it went through the same thing that had occurred when I turned on my PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried continue (exit and continue to windows 10) which started the same&nbsp;procedure all over again.&nbsp;
 I then pressed "Troubleshoot" which gave the options to Reset my&nbsp; (which reinstalls Windows 10 and removes all my apps).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried "troubleshoot" which gave me "advanced options".&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the options I was at a loss as to what to do with them; ie Command prompt.&nbsp; It brought up a DOS screen but I had not idea what to do with this screen and there were no instructions.&nbsp;
 I attempted "system restore" .&nbsp; Was informed there was no restore point even though windows 10 is suppose to create restore points automatically whenever a change is made.&nbsp; Could not utilize any of the 6 options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously created a recovery drive but when I attached this to my computer it was the same as not even having a recovery drive.&nbsp; I thought this would boot up my computer.&nbsp; Guess I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option that might work out of all&nbsp;the options available was to "reset this pc".&nbsp; This would be my last resort since this reinstalls windows &nbsp;10 removes all my apps.&nbsp; I have had to do this
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 times</span> before and it seems like the problems occur after Microsoft has updated something.&nbsp; It is at the point where now I have to
<strong>pay</strong> to get&nbsp;the apps that are removed by reinstalling windows 10 in order to reinstall them.&nbsp; Something is terribly wrong with this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had problems with Microsoft before I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now I feel like I have to go back to school to study computer technology just to be able to use my computer&nbsp;since I have windows 10.&nbsp; I spend more time fixing problems than actually using
 my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am not computer savvy I even paid a computer tech on one occasion to fix my computer and the&nbsp;end result&nbsp;was that he reinstalled windows 10.&nbsp; He also had a lot of negative comments about Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that anyone in the community has an answer to my problem.&nbsp; I just wanted to let you know the latest problem I have and if anyone in the community has any influence with Microsoft let them know how dissatisfied I am and I'm sure based on all the numerous
 comments I have viewed and conversations I have had with other uses that I am not the only one.&nbsp; I am at the point where I am seriously considering discontinuing all association with Microsoft and going with another operating system.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Scaling Issues with Printing Preferences Dialog Box - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Scaling Issues with Printing Preferences Dialog Box</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.885) and a Konica Minolta Bizhub C364e Photocopier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the screenshot below, the printing preferences dialog box drop down menus are cut off and difficult to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried adjusting the scaling (Settings – System – Display) but this seems to make it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also installed the latest printer drivers and it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read the&nbsp;Advanced Display Settings and Customizing are now missing in Windows 10 so I'm unsure how to increases the font or drop down menu height.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave both of those suggestions a try and unfortunately they didn't work. The Printer Properties dialog box doesn't seem to be affected by changes to Windows settings as I've read it's a legacy driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will contact Konica Minolta to see if they can offer a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,<br />
Kev<br />

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />If the problem persists, I recommend downgrading to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />You can downgrade to Windows 10 1703 by downloading the ISO at <a href="http://windowsiso.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net</a>
<br />
<br />Create a bootable copy:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Perform a clean install:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Avoid installing kb4041676 see how you can block it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-uninstall-windows-10-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-un...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue using Windows 10 1709, you can try updating the driver to see if it helps or uninstall the reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />One thing I would suggest you do is remove all monitors, reinstall the driver, restart, connect each monitor then press Windows key + P then click Extend.

<p>Is Microsoft Edge not available under <strong>Web browser</strong>? Could you please provide us a screenshot for further verification? And could you also try to type
<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> in the Start menu, for us to know if it is really available or not in your Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Loreto</p>

</p><p>Yes Microsoft edge is installed, I use it all the time and I also typed Microsoft edge in the start menu and it opened-up. Microsoft edge also shows up as the default web browser in Default apps (see pic).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information about your concern. Are you saving a URL/Link from Internet explorer and want to open it using Edge? Also, if you want Edge to be on the taskbar, you can do this by typing Edge on the search bar or Cortana, right-click and select
 Pin to taskbar, the same suggestion by "RonBarker". See the image for your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the web page you created/saved and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change</strong>. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23cc14f3-4295-47e2-a436-c4e6012fe621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Renny,
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if that item is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list see if that item is listed there, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />
<br />If you still cannot find the item you are looking for:
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator

<p>Кто нибудь уже получил бонусы за предзаказ QUANTUM BREAK ? Время идет не Алан Вейка обещанного не второго ключа QUANTUM BREAK&nbsp; на windows 10. Как то уже боязно стало, может забыли про меня.</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My apologies. With chats having moved to cloud, you don't have chats locally stored. Currently there is no utility to do what you need.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hello Ean,
<br />
<br />my name is Manuel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />It is possible to edit messages you've sent as explained here:
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34789/how-do-i-edit-instant-messages-i-ve-sent-in-skype-on-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34789/how-do...</a>
<br />
<br />The pencil shows that a message was edited but as far as I know it is not possible to view a change history of a message.
<br />
<br />Greetings,
<br />Manuel

</p><p>I see, i tried this app SkypeLogView. But I think this app does not support&nbsp; the new version of skype.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if i could check it on local database, but as what you have said it is on cloud now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much! I can explain it now to my colleagues.</p>

            Microsoft intentionally removed the option to disable Auto Arrange, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but it's still possible with a workaround.</span> &nbsp; See the Auto Arrange links below.
<p>Microsoft's answer for not being able to disable auto arrange: <span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/8eead0fb-acba-4054-aa18-bab533864dc7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Can I manually arrange files within folders?</span></a></span></p>

</p>
<p>This will not work in Library folders, but it will work in normal folders to disable auto arrange.<br />

                    <p>Original Title: windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past month, every time I boot up, I get a warning notice that says "Driver Support is not working". Then it says "windows is looking for a solution".&nbsp; Then both notices go away and my homepage comes up like normal. But as I use the computer, I find
 it freezes up while downloading. And it will take various periods of time before the download starts. Sometimes I have to reboot.</p>

            Changing from &nbsp;64bit to 32bit, or 32bit to 64bit,&nbsp;Operating Systems&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;a clean install.<br />
<br />
There is no upgrade/downgrade path involved.<br />
<br />
Save all&nbsp;your Data, and be prepared to reinstall all your Programs.<br />
<br />
If your 64bit came preinstalled, you will have to buy a Full Vista 32bit Disk/Licence.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer, and see if they will sell you a FULL&nbsp;32bit Vista Operating System at a discount price.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<h2>            Windows 8 0x80070015 during install</h2>
                    I am&nbsp;re installing&nbsp;8 on a computer that had a pretty effortless install initially but am having nothing but problems now. Currently, I get a 0x80070015 error when trying to install on my drive. I have tried both GPT and MBR formats depending on my boot
 option set in the BIOS. I have also tried using my DVD and a USB drive for my boot media. Any Ideas?

            I just noticed that most of the folders except the Windows folder were copied.&nbsp; Are there restrictions that won't allow Windows XP operating system to be backed up to a hard disk drive.&nbsp; I bought the Windows XP from a retailer and still have the Windows
 XP CD so I don't really need to back the operating system up but I would like to backup the VLC files.

<p>If you are just wanting a backup of your files then you can do that with windows explorer</p>
<p>If you want to backup your XP installation then you need to use a ghosting /cloning application which will transfer all files including windows updates to the receiving hard drive.</p>
<p>I used hdclone from miray&nbsp; which runs fro within windows and is very easy to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.miray.de/products/sat.hdclone.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.miray.de/products/sat.hdclone.html</a></p>
<p>You can download and try outthe free version to see if it works with your system.</p>
<p>The free version just takes longer&nbsp; then the paid versions.</p>

<h2>            Issue with Audio Drivers Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So I'm having issues with any of my audio drivers not working on Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among that my on-board audio driver for realtek is not even showing up. </p>
<p>I'm running on a MSI Gaming M7 Z170A board which is designed for Windows 10.</p>
<p>I've tried everything ftroubleshooting, uninstalling the drivers and letting windows reinstall them, reinstalling realtek from the manufacture website, to resetting windows but nothing is working.When I look at the issue with the drivers it says error code
 52 a file is not digitally signed and the file on every single one is the drmk.sys driver file.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

<p>2.) No strangely enough this happened after I rolled windows 10 back to a previous update</p>
<p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0x80070490</h2>
                    Error Code: 0x80070490 -- "Windows cannot find a location to store temp installation files. To install windows make sure that a partition on your boot disk has at least 686 MB free space." I have a Dell computer that has 3 partitions. They are 39MB, 3.42GB,
 &amp; 100+GB. Any ideas to get around the error code or should I reinstall Windows XP (currently running) and create different partitions? Thanks!

            Hi Crispy75, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. The issue you are describing may be because the installer is trying to put temporary files in your OEM partition. Please try the following as a workaround.
<br />
<br />
Put your Windows 7 disk in. <br />
Now with XP booted:<br />
Click Start &gt; Run<br />
Next to open, type CMD<br />
This should open a command line. <br />
In the command line type D: (or whatever your DVD drive letter is)<br />
From here type setup.exe <strong>/tempdrive:</strong><em>drive_letter (driveletter being whatever your hard disk system drive is,,.,, usually c:)<br />
</em>Now allow the setup to run and reboot your computer to continue the upgrade.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

    <title>Error Code 0xd000003a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grumpy44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 0xd000003a</h2>
                    <p>Had a notification that my password for my Google a/c had been compromised and I should change it. I changed it and now I keep getting the above code with the message "something went wrong" and my emails are not arriving. I`m using Win10 mail. This is only
 on my laptop, when I fired up my desktop I had the error triangle appear on the gmail account and it cleared itself, also Win10 mail. I`ve tried what I guess are the usual fixes but my pc knowledge is very limited.</p>
<p>Can anyone help please ?</p>

<p>Hi Vijay, before I try that there was some extra instructions I did not put in my post I don`t know if it makes a difference, they were,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"settings out of date, sign in to continue to windows"</p>
<p>"enter password"</p>
<p>"windows wants to access your Google a/c"</p>
<p>"allow"</p>
<p>"something went wrong"</p>
<p>"sorry we weren't able to do that"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make any difference to your instructions or just carry on and follow them ?</p>
<p>
