<h2>            Excel upload on Microsoft Teams removes&#47;omits object attachments in excel</h2>
                    For the first time today tried to upload an excel with images/object attached in it, on Microsoft Teams. On opening the excel from Teams to verify, I do not see the attachments inside the excel. I tried to also edit an excel from Teams but I do not see
 an option to attach/Insert an Object while editing the Excel document.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Viji_365,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I can reproduce the same behavior on my side. According to the error message, this is because the Excel workbook is opened in Excel Online in Teams, while Excel Online doesn't support the features of inserted objects:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24732730-af07-4045-97e4-ea01b376aee3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24732730-af07-4045-97e4-ea01b376aee3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As this behavior is about the feature limitation of Excel Online, I'd recommend clicking the ellipses at the top right to send your request of this feature to the development team of Excel Online:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82333a40-3b5f-4f7a-96c7-65418f99e3c5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82333a40-3b5f-4f7a-96c7-65418f99e3c5?upload=true" /></a></p>

                    I have inserted a subproject into a master project.&nbsp; It is there.&nbsp; However, it is like a dangling tree branch.&nbsp; Nothing changes when I make changes to tasks in the master project.&nbsp; They are supposed to be linked, but nothing changes between the two when
 I make updates.&nbsp; Please advise.

<p>Didn't we just go down this path, or at least a very similar one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to understand the "dangling tree branch" concept. First, did you create a dynamic master (i.e. left the default "link to project" option checked in the Insert Project window)? Second, describe in more detail your process of "making changes to tasks
 in the master". Third, what exactly are you expecting to happen (a screen shot might be helpful)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know we'll get to the bottom of this cause we've already been to the top.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; The "dangling tree branch" refers to my nectarine tree in my back yard that was losing a branch because it suffered impact from the bad weather and it was just dangling there.&nbsp; I had to pull it off.&nbsp; I used that to compare my subproject
 being just a stagnant bunch of tasks sitting in the middle of the master project.&nbsp; LOL</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change dates in the master, nothing happens in my subproject.&nbsp; When I change dates in my subproject, nothing happens in the master.&nbsp; I cannot send a screen shot due to sensitive information.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all the research I have done, what I gather is that once you insert a subproject into a master, it automatically links.&nbsp; But I don't think they are linked due to the "Links Between Projects" is empty for External Predecessors and External Successors.&nbsp;
 Unless that is only when I link two separate projects via just tasks.&nbsp; You helped me with that the other day.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, dumb question, but I cannot find the option you were referring to.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Lu,</p>
<p>Just for reference, damaged branches should be cut off at the branch crown and not "pulled off" :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, time for a little primer on master projects. There are two kinds of master projects, dynamic and static. By default Project creates a dynamic master when a user inserts subprojects into a master. The option I was referring to is in the lower right
 corner of the Insert Project window (i.e. "link to project"). What that means is, the subprojects do not actually become part of the master, rather, the master contains pointers (i.e. links) to each individual subproject. Changes made at master level are reflected
 in the subproject and vice versa (i.e. the files are dynamically linked). However to preserve those changes, the user must save both master and subprojects when closing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user de-selects the option "link to project" when the master is created, a static master will be created. A static master basically copies the contents of each subproject into the master such that the master is a snapshot in time of each subproject
 when the master was created. The structure is not linked so changes made in either the master or the original subproject files are not reflected in the other. A static master is a single independent file and must be recreated any time the user desires to "update"
 the subproject data. This is easy to do by recording a macro the first time the static master is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a dynamic master does not create any links between tasks in the inserted subprojects. To create links between tasks in one subproject with tasks in another subproject, a separate process is required and we discussed that in a previous thread. The
 option for "links between projects" applies to these inter-project task links and not to the master/subproject link structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is easy to tell if the master is dynamic or static by looking at the ID field. If the ID field is continuous throughout the master, then it is a static master. If the ID sequence repeats for each inserted subproject, then it is a dynamic master.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is your statement about not seeing changes when you edit a date at either master or subproject level. The only way I can make that happen is if I have a static master and the calculation option is "off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I understand you cannot post a screen shot of your "live" files but what you can post is a screen shot of a new test file (i.e. master and at least one subproject) that is configured the same as your "live" file. Can you do that for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I assume we are talking about Project 2010. What is the version number (go to File/Help and click on the "additional version and copyright information" in the middle of the right side of the screen. The version is shown at the top of the About
 Microsoft Project window). That would be very helpful.</p>

<p>You are probably getting&nbsp;<span>0x800706d9 because Zone Alarm has taken control of the firewall.&nbsp; I do not recommend running multiple antivirus products unless they target different vulnerabilities.
</span></p>
<p>I run the Windows Defender and on occasion will use Malwarebytes to scan my pc. I do not use the real time scanner of both products at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Zone Alarm to address some vulnerability or are you running it because you think that it will make your pc more secure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it were my pc, I would uninstall Zone Alarm. If you want to use Zone Alarm, then turn off Windows Defender.&nbsp;</p>

            Go to Settings &nbsp;System &nbsp;About and see if you are on a Insiders build, as for signing up either you or that "somebody else"(an old time friend from childhood you know the other one "not me") had to ok the EULA before joining the Preview/Insiders program,
 and if you are on an Insiders build just do a search how to quit the Insiders program.

            <p>Hello Leanne and Delvir, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum! </p>
<p>
</p><p>First of, please accept my apologies for not being able to respond to your query in a timely manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you need help to be able to receive the account security code to your new alternate email address so you can access your account smoothly. Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will endeavor to assist you as best as I
 can and hopefully we can get this issue fixed for you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that this new security feature of Microsoft will not affect your access to your mailbox and will still be able to view, send and receive emails. However, you'll need to verify your account first by safeguarding up-to-date security information
 on the account before you can access your mailbox. For more information about this, you may visit the help article that I'll be providing below:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/account-security-password-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account security info: FAQ</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the alternate email address associated on your account is no longer working, you may select the
<strong>"I don't have these any more" </strong>option so you can enter a new contact email address where our system will send you the security code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've changed the security information of your account, you won't be able to access the<em> "Security &amp; password"
</em>tab in the Account Summary page within 30days and you'll have to select the <strong>
"Yes, this was me" </strong>option acknowledging that you're the one who requested to change the security information of your account. Once done, you'll need to go to
<a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a> to access your mailbox.

<h2>            Multiple Exchange accounts &#40;more then 10&#41; in Outlook 2013 problem.</h2>
                    I need to add more than 10 Exchange accounts in Outlook pro 2013<br />
but I had the error that I had reached the maximum number of accounts.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/068885ff-0d10-484a-a89a-b4c2887bd579" /><br />
I have find out that I had to change the policy for the maximum number of accounts and so I did:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36dcb77b-76aa-483e-a89d-8b0f7b47e50e" /><br />
<br />
The client had the updated policy and the registry has the appropriate reg key:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f43c37e5-e827-48d9-b315-5aeee1ce9a91" /><br />
<br />
The problem is that&nbsp; when trying to create a new exchange account the error is still here.<br />
<br />
Is any other configuration I have to make in order to have more the 10 exchange accounts ?<br />
<br />
The server is a SBS2011 and client windows 8 pro both updated and restarted.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
To narrow down the issue, could you please firstly clarify the following information?<br />
1. What actions have you done before the error occurs?<br />
2. Could you provide us with a full screenshot about the error message for our reference?<br />
3. Does the issue happen to some specific users or all the users in your organization?<br />
<br />
Please post back at your convenience and we will continue to assist you based on the update.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your post, installed app does not show up in the app list on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you delete temporary files and browser history (in&nbsp;Storage Sense&nbsp;&gt; Phone &gt; Temporary files&nbsp;&gt; Delete and in Internet Explorer &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Delete history).</span></p>
<p><span>Then , please do a soft reset by pressing and holding volume down + power buttons until the phone restarts.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure the date and time are correct: in Settings &gt; Date + Time &gt; turn Automatically to Off &gt; set up current date, time and zone manually.</span></p>
<p><span>If you use SD card, try changing the location for the new apps to the phone.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also enable Push notifications (in Settings &gt; Find my phone) and try installing the app through web browser
</span></p>

            Having this issue also. One of the things I suspect is the issue is that according to some MSDN posts, this functionality requires a Microsoft Exchange 2013 (maybe 2010 but so far none found) account as a user in Outlook 2013. If you go to Files you should
 see an option called Manage Apps. If you only see Manage Add-Ins, then you will not be able to install apps. I have to believe that you really don't need an Exchange account to use this.
<div>I will update when I find the workaround.</div>

 in Australia and Telstra the Company looking after 365 here told me that Apps cannot be installed at all in Australia. I know this is not true - very frustrated!

            <p>If you are using with Exchange 2013 then you have to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log in to Exchange Control Panel<br />
Go to the 'Organisation' on the left hand side<br />
Select Apps at top<br />
Find Insightly App and Install<br />
Once installed, edit the app to 'enabled by default'</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be then be available in Outlook.</p>

<p>Hi DaiManuel,<br />
<br />
Generally, after upgrading from Outlook 2013 to 2016, the email account you have added in Outlook 2013 will be kept in Outlook 2016. That means the emails, calendar and other data in Outlook 2013 will be kept in Outlook 2016.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you are using an Office 365 account and add this account via Exchange mode into Outlook 2013 client, then the data in Outlook client will be synced with Office 365 Exchange Online. If the data in Office 2016 has some corruptions or the data isn’t
 been kept in Outlook 2016 client, you can just create a new profile and re-add the Office 365 account into this new profile referring to the article below.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to create profile and set up an e-mail account in Outlook</a><br />
<br />
If you has some data that need to be kept on your local computer, you can also backup the data into a PST file before upgrading to Outlook 2016. Then after finishing the upgrading, you can import the PST file into your Outlook client. Here are articles about
 export the data to a PST file and import the PST file into Outlook client.<br />

            Hi. The availability of Windows 10 Mobile as an upgrade for existing Windows Phone 8.1 devices will vary by device manufacturer, device model, country or region, mobile operator or service provider, hardware limitations, and other factors. See this link:

            <p>Thinking about this, I wonder if the combination of the hotmail migration and the new premium outlook offering is to blame for all of us with custom domains having issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your in the US, you might want to sign up to the&nbsp;https://premium.outlook.com site. &nbsp;This allows you to hook up the domains again for up to 5 accounts.</p>
<p>

            You are probably right. It is very clear that they don't want this category to exist unpaid anymore. I have had so many issues with all the changes they are making. All my email accounts (all of them are wired to custom domains) have had issues for ~3
 months now.<br />
I am in Sweden so the offer you mention is not available here yet. If I get confirmation that it solves problem and is stable I would consider it.

            <p>Unlike you my Windows Live Custom Domain still worked when the format of Outlook.com was updated, just that I could no longer select the REPLY FROM address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware if you remove this 'connected account' that you will no longer be able to add it since Microsoft's Answer Desk said it doesn't support the connecting of two Outlook.com accounts at all, only third party email services like gmail and yahoo.</p>

                    I sized down a word document window to make room on the page, and now it won't re-expand. I've tried dragging from the bottom right corner, as it has always worked. Nothing. The window is now about 3" high and 2" wide. How can I get it back to full size.
 Can't find a solution in view above.

<h2>            Solved&#58; Wifi connection randmly dropping for no apparent reason</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be specific to my hardware configuration but it may apply to others as well. So, I was getting two TCP/IP errors (event ID 4291) in my event viewer logs on every boot or restart and my wifi connection would just randomly drop from time to time.
 This happened on my Lenovo B575 laptop, equipped with the Ralink/Mediatek RT3090 wifi adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fix was to force an installation of the previous Win 7 driver. That fixed my issue and it also stopped the errors in the event viewer; however, I had to turn off automatic driver updates or it would revert to the latest Win update driver on every reboot/restart.
 I noticed that the new driver version from Mediatek (formerly Ralink) was later than any available from the Mediatek website so I gave the old Win 7 driver a shot and it worked. You can turn off automatic driver updates here if you need to force the installation
 of an older driver:</p>

<h2>            i cant put my call unhold</h2>
                    when my phone rings due to an alarm, it always puts my skype call on hold and i cant resume it again, despite there being a resume button on the messaging screen ); its a pain having to end the call and recall them. i use skype on my iphone 8, by the way

            Skype 8.10.0.5 / Calling Version 2017.22.01.51. Does this on iphone alarms and incoming voice calls. &nbsp;There is no resume/off hold button. &nbsp;Skype is frozen and does not respond to anything. &nbsp;I can only close the app and restart it to call the person back.

    <title>Text disappears when Frutiger font selected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruudfood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text disappears when Frutiger font selected</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to apply the Frutiger font to text in MS Word 2016.&nbsp; However, when I apply the font the text disappears.&nbsp; This only happens in Word.&nbsp; The other Office applications are fine and so are other non-MS applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The font doesn't have a designation or category when I look at the Font applet in Control Panel and the embeddability is "Print and Preview".&nbsp; However, other fonts with the same properties are displayed just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be causing this?</p>
