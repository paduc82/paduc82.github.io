<h2>            Sway sharing</h2>
                    I shared my sway with several people by using the link created in sway, but they are not able to access the sway. For me it works fine, even if I sign out of my microsoft account. Can someone without a microsoft account also access my sway through the
 link?

<p>If you can access your Sway when signed out, then everyone should be able to access it regardless of whether or not they are signed in.&nbsp; Sway URLs are case-sensitive so if they have the URL slightly wrong it won't work.&nbsp; Another possibility is that if you
 put punctuation (like a comma or period) at the end of the URL, many email clients and social media sites will absorb the punctuation mark into the link and your Sway will fail to load if the punctuation is present in the browser URL bar.&nbsp; Can you check to
 make sure they are using the proper URL?</p>

<h2>            All of my uploaded grouped images have a black border</h2>
                    <p>No matter the image size, background or anything Sway adds a black border to any images I upload then group. When they are ungrouped the images appear fine. I am trying to show a slide show that contains images as well as just exported slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this expected behavior? if so, do you recommend changing the design to account for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, how do you work around or fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Good question.&nbsp; Sway attempts to display your content at an ideal size to fit on whatever screen it is on.&nbsp; In the first screenshot, Sway has the entire window size to work with and shows each image at its native height/width ratio.&nbsp; In the slideshow control
 from your second screenshot, however, it is sizing that control to fit all of your images which could potentially have different height/width ratios.&nbsp; Additionally, Sway content is sized to fit whatever window you show it in.&nbsp; While the navigation layout and
 design type you pick for your Sway will influence this, I think you will find that if you resize your window, you will end up with different sized content and the black bars may or may not be there.&nbsp; All of that is to say, you may not be able to remove them
 completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because these images have text, they are probably automatically marked as the entire image is important so that they don't get cropped at all.&nbsp; You could try turning that off and see what you get, but I don't think you'll want to use that if you find that
 they get cropped.&nbsp; To try it, click on the card for one of the images and click the Focus Points button.&nbsp; In the pane that opens, check the state of the checkbox below the image preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you could try is creating a separate Sway with only these images and then embedding that Sway.&nbsp; If you do that, then you won't need to use the images and can put the text directly into the embedded Sway and have far more control over how the
 text looks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope one of these things helps!</p>

            OK, I figured it out.... thanks - your suggestion pointed the way. I have tracking turned on, and inserting a new row not only changes the text color, but adds a background/shading to tables. &nbsp;The rows are actually clear, but they appear to be shaded,
 because they are new. Thanks again

            <p>Hi piefacebuster,</p>
<p><br />
1. Which operating system is installed on the computer?<br />
2. Which version of iTunes are you using?</p>
<p><br />
Alerts with codes in the 3000 range generally mean that iTunes cannot contact the gs.apple.com server on ports 80 or 443. This may be because out-of-date or incorrectly configured security or firewall software&nbsp;interfering, or due to your Internet proxy settings.
 If you are using a proxy, refer to below link and check for settings -</p>

<h2>            Opening .doc attachments in Word 2007 without warning message</h2>
                    I have just got a new Sony Vaio with Windows 7 and Office 07.&nbsp; When i get an email with an any attachment, including .doc and .docx, it warns me first about only opening emails from a trustworthy source.&nbsp; It does this for every attachment in any email,
 regardless of the file type.&nbsp; There is a box for unchecking "always ask before opening this type of file" but it is greyed out.&nbsp; I have administration rights under my account, but can't find an option anywhere that unchecks this such that attachments open
 without asking each time.&nbsp; I am familiar with Office 07 from XP and never had this issue before i got Windows 7.&nbsp; The help options on this topics do not address this.&nbsp; Any clues would be gratefully received...

            <p>Mohan is correct: If the source text (any text larger than a single character) contains a mix of direct, non-style formatting, then the
<p>
</p><p>If you must copy/paste formatting from one place to another rather than applying a style, you'll have to apply it separately to each run of target text that doesn't have some other directly applied formatting. One way is to double-click the Format Painter
 button, which makes it stay selected while you apply it to more than one location (press Esc or click the button again to turn it off). A better way is to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+C to copy the source formatting, then Ctrl+Shift+V to apply it to
 each target area. The copied formatting will remain on the clipboard until you copy some other formatting, or until you close the Word session.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need more information and clarification in order to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean that Format Painter does not implement any format on the Target Paragraph, i.e. it does not replicate italicized words, underlined words or bolded words?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>When testing on our computer, we find that it replicates only the 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span> format,
 in this example it only replicates the italicized words and does not underline or bold words in the target paragraph, because Format Painter cannot apply all 3 formats instantly and at the same time.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try to install Dell Nvidia driver from Dell support site ? &lt;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/tr/tr/trdhs1/product-support/product/xps-15-9560-laptop/drivers?newtab=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dell Support</a> &gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, manufacturers do not release drivers for beta OS. But you may try.</p>
<p>

<p>So have you even checked if you have the latest Nvida driver. The Nvida card might not function without the correct driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Device manager to check the driver. If you want things to work as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: The Video Card is there for a reason. It is to give you advanced graphics management and all so if you do not want to take advantage of that I guess it is your choice.</p>

<p>But if the Intel adapter is disabled and the Nvida card was not being used you would not have anything on screen. The Problem is the Nvidia card is using the wrong driver.</p>

            Further to my post above, the Dell support site also includes BIOS update dated 20 Mar 2018. You may also consider installing that. It may resolve issues not related to your current issue but who knows.

<p>Yes. It returned my phone to windows 8.1. I then updated to windows 10 and the problem was solved. It took the best part of a day to get my phone back to how I had it set up but it is now set up on the latest version of windows 10 mobile. Thanks for all

<h2>            How do I check the legitimacy of an email sender when using an &#64;outlook.com account to recieve&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the new @outlook on one of my accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed something in the junk folder that appeared to have been sent from my own account. But I realize that there are all kinds of tricks these guys use to make it look like it came from me when it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example in first photo below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see if I click the down arrow next to the Reply button there is an option to "view message source".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is any way to interperet that data to determine exactly where or who the message originated from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doubting it did come from my account as there is obviously nothing in my sent items folder corresponding to the offending date received, unless of course they removed it etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would go a long way to helping folks identify whether that scam email in the inbox is legit or not when it appears to be legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I included the upper portion of the data from the "view source" data in that email to the second photo below. I blocked out my email address and left in other stuff that maybe you can point to that I could identify that this email did NOT originate from
 my account.</p>

            <p>Nearly everything you see in the Internet headers can be spoofed if the sender is using the correct tools. Email was never designed to be secure and the security layers that have been added over the years are really just bandages covering the fundamental
 lack of true authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The originating address appears to be&nbsp;52.169.190.122. This is a Microsoft address in Dublin, Ireland. However, the mailing system appears to be in Brazil (ig.com.br).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not expect Microsoft to send you a message where your address appears as the sender. I would treat all such mail as either spam or phishing.</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Network troubleshooter first and then test your Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Network troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering network troubleshooter
 in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking Identify and repair network problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Try resetting the TCP/IP stack.</strong></p>

<h2>            VB&#58;   How to call another code for Follow HYPERLINK</h2>
                    <p>hi,&nbsp; i have been working on a UDF for a custom hyperlink &amp; have it working pretty well.&nbsp; the only problem is the formula in cell is lower case instead of dsired Ucase:&nbsp;&nbsp; clink("friendly name")</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not sure how to call multple pages to open with a new customHYPELRINK()&nbsp; being called:&nbsp; CLINK()</p>
<p>able to have multiple pages open for an old method that uses:&nbsp; goFHL()&nbsp;&nbsp; (follow hyperlink,&nbsp; sample at bottom / below)</p>
<p>would guesse the fix to be on how it is called?&nbsp; or do i need a different goFHL()&nbsp; /&nbsp; don't think need a split,&nbsp; the new custom hyperlink is to just have a friendly name.&nbsp; thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think the problem might just be in the section below marked with double lines / equal signs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>do not know if using the correct techniques, for just clicking on a cell in a column i have the hyperlink working.</p>
<p>i have code for when select a cell in a row (for specific column),&nbsp; vb will activate.&nbsp; i want to be able to call multiple copies of CLINK to open.&nbsp; (each page will have a variation).&nbsp; eg:&nbsp; normal click / first page will be:&nbsp; CLINK1,&nbsp; others might be CLINK2&nbsp;
 CLINK3..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>guesse should inlude instructions:</p>
<p>'instructions:&nbsp; 1. call as:&nbsp; =CustomHyperlink(A1)&nbsp;&nbsp; change to:&nbsp;&nbsp; call as:&nbsp; =CustomHyperlink("friendly name")<br />
'2. create hyperlink in cell: rc, hyperlink (pick any hyperlink valid or invalid)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. put friendly name in cell eg:&nbsp; "T"&nbsp; or:&nbsp; =CustomHyperlink(Left(B5,1))<br />
4. if result has some cell attached to end of hyperlink, rclick, hyperlink &amp; remove eg:&nbsp; #A1 from the end, before you paste it down a column<br />

            <p>hi,&nbsp; if i understand the problem well enough / not sure if this is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i currently have a script that splits hyperlinks so can follow the hyperlink thru vb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>it seems that is not enough if want to manipulate the hyperlink as well </p>
<p>
</p><p>which to say:&nbsp; want to put the hyperlink itself into code so can disect the web address &amp; make different variations of the destination occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what trying to use is a udf for:&nbsp;&nbsp; =CLINK("friendly name")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so the vb for calling a split hyperlink will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the code for following a hyperlink by vb i have is:</p>
<p>goFHL ActiveCell.Formula, ",friendlyname"</p>
<p>
</p><p>that runs the macro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (which will split off the friendly name:&nbsp; ",IF(P612&gt;0" etc,&nbsp; in the next example below.</p>
<p>Sub goFHL(strF As String, strDL As String)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so by vb to run the hyperlink in a worksheet:&nbsp; </p>
=HYPERLINK($BM$4&amp;BH9,IF(P612&gt;0,"O","F"))<br />
<p>i would use this vb:</p>
<p>goFHL ActiveCell.Formula, ",IF(P"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>==========</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The question would then seem to be how to follow a hyperlink that has been put together by vb,&nbsp; for example used is a custom hyperlink being called like:&nbsp; function CLINK(strFriendlyname)</p>
<p>
</p><p>by the instructions for that code,&nbsp; a logical? / in document? / hyperlink exists in the cell by right click cell, hyperlink,&nbsp; (and per a NON-requirement:&nbsp; select any hyperlink) - where the code will run any link item variables supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>QUESTION:</p>
<p><strong>this method allows a click on the cell to follow the hyperlink.&nbsp; i am not sure /&nbsp; how to write code to inititate follow the hyperlink..</strong>&nbsp; thru code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call CLINK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'does not seem to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>if haven't said,&nbsp; the code i have for following a custom hyperlink will allow me to make changes in any portions for eg:&nbsp; LINK1 LINK2 etc below:</p>
<p>&nbsp; link1 being:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "http://www.google.com/search?q="</p>
<p>&nbsp; link2 being:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(ActiveCell.row, B5).Value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '(i have these already working in my workbook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>'<strong>HOW DO I CALL THIS MACRO..&nbsp; TO RUN IN ANOTHER VB?</strong>&nbsp; thanks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call CLINK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'does not seem to work</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wonder why Microsoft created an option to download/install office 365 for Mac - Arabic language, where in fact there's</p>
<p>no available on the website. I've tried to download it on my Office 365 account but it says "404 - Not found. File was possibly removed ..blah.blah"</p>
<p>Is there any chance that maybe the Link was not updated? Tried also downloading Office 365 Personal for Mac - English Language, by just</p>
<p>changing some keyword in the URL and it worked. Anyway, I'm using Mac Book Pro. Did some troubleshooting like, using another network
</p>
<p>connection, login-logout, used other laptop, it has all the same result. this "404 - not found - file possibly removed."</p>

            <p>hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I'll try to post the link when i get to work. </p>
<p>My problem is downloading this Office 365 personal - Arabic language on my account.</p>
<p>Like when you login at office365.com, there you can see the list of registered device</p>
<p>where you installed office, and there also there is a button " INSTALL"</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I click that. it gives me the error " 404-not found "</p>
<p>The product key is already activated/associated with my other email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you gave is when you want to purchase online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway. i'll try your suggestion to change the region setting&nbsp; of the Mac Machine.</p>

<h3> jdgreen17  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I calculate working hours between two dates&#47;times &#40;Excel 10&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I am trying to make a downtime log that tracks the amount of working hours a machine is out of service for.<br />
<br />
I need to find a formula that will calculate the amount of working hours between the date/time the machine went out of service and the date/time the problem was recifitied and the machine began working again.<br />
<br />
I've tried a number of different variations of the NETWORKDAYS and WORKDAYS formulas but I can't seem to get them to
<a href="http://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/909252-calculating-working-hours-between-two-dates-times.html?p=3169182#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="blue"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1) !important">work</span></font></a>
 perfectly.<br />
<br />
The working hours are 8:00 - 16:00 (Monday-Thursday) and 8:00 - 13:00 (Friday). I need the formula to take these working hours into account as well as ignore weekend dates.<br />
<br />
For <a href="http://www.excelforum.com/excel-formulas-and-functions/909252-calculating-working-hours-between-two-dates-times.html?p=3169182#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="blue"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1) !important">example</span></font></a>:
 If a machine was logged as being out of service at 13:00 on Thursday and came back into service at 10:00 the following Monday, the formula would return 10 hours. (13:00-16:00 on Thursday (3 hrs), 8:00 - 13:00 on Friday (5 hrs), ignore Saturday and Sunday,
 and 8:00 - 10:00 on Monday (2 hrs). So 3 + 5 + 2 = 10!) <br />
<br />
Any help you can provide will be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Here is a UDF that will give you the correct answer. Add this code to a general code module:<br />
<br />
Public Function NetWorkHours(ByVal StartTime As Date, ByVal EndTime As Date, ByVal StartOfDayTimes As Variant, ByVal EndOfDayTimes As Variant)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Day As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Day = Fix(StartTime) + 1 To Fix(EndTime) - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NetWorkHours = NetWorkHours + EndOfDayTimes(Weekday(Day)) - StartOfDayTimes(Weekday(Day))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next Day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NetWorkHours = NetWorkHours + Application.Max(0, EndOfDayTimes(Weekday(Fix(StartTime))) - Application.Max((StartTime - Int(StartTime)) * 24, StartOfDayTimes(Weekday(Fix(StartTime)))))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NetWorkHours = NetWorkHours + Application.Max(0, Application.Min((EndTime - Int(EndTime)) * 24, EndOfDayTimes(Weekday(Fix(EndTime)))) - StartOfDayTimes(Weekday(Fix(EndTime))))<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
The formula to calculate the net work hours is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =NetWorkHours(A1,B1,{0,8,8,8,8,8,0},{0,16,16,16,16,13,0})<br />
<br />
where A1 is the start Date/Time and B1 is the end DateTime.<br />

            I checked your replication. It is one to one correct. After you select the text, right click and past working. I see that. I haven't made the one drive file ready yet. But in my case as I explained above, Word translator is translating the sentence, when
 i select the translated sentence it is getting blue OK. But right click, no action. STOP. Only Ctrl-C and paste or Ctrl-V are working.

<h2>            Cannot access Skype account</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I need help urgently. I tried to log in to my Skype account about a week or two ago and it didn't work out right, sent me to a completely new account. My old account is still there but I can't access it, have had a friend check that it's still there and it
 is but no matter what i try nothing is working. Anytime i try put in my e-mail address and password it sends me to the new account I didn't create, have research every kind of solution to this problem and no luck. I really need to get on my account as I have
 a lot of contacts on it that I can't contact elsewhere or have no contact information for, I also have interviews to be had on this account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anyone could help in any way I would highly appreciate it.<br />

            <p>If the error is down in your For ... Next loops where you have statements as:</p>
<p>Sheets(Trim(c.Value)).Visible = ...</p>
<p>Take a close look at the value in cell c and the worksheet you believe it should be working with.&nbsp; If the actual sheet name has any white space (spaces, tabs) at the beginning or end of its name as shown on the sheet tab, that could cause the error.&nbsp; You
 might be looking for a sheet names "Sheet1"&nbsp; but on the tab you may have typed it as "Sheet1 ".&nbsp; But I must admit that your test in the IF statement of '&nbsp; Trim(c.Value) = Sheets(i).Name&nbsp;&nbsp; ' should prevent that from happening.</p>

    <title>Cannot sign in on Macbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mainedave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign in on Macbook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a 2013 Macbook Pro and using Microsoft Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and Excel.&nbsp; Up until yesterday, everything was syncing perfectly so that I can add information on the Macbook and then access it on my iMac.&nbsp; I have a subscription to Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I cannot log in to any of these on my computer, except for OneDrive.&nbsp; Outlook continues to ask me for the passwords for email accounts, however only for the Gmail and the Godaddy MS account (the primary MS account and the Yahoo account passwords did
 take).&nbsp; OneNote and Excel continue to ask me to sign in and when I do, it asks me again.&nbsp; OneNote does give a pop-up window that states "The authentication session has expired.&nbsp; Please sign-in again."&nbsp; after each attempt to sign in.&nbsp; I just received a notice
 from Excel telling me that I have attempted to sign in many times and would I like help (and I accidentally said no!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN save the Excel sheet into a file my OneDrive where it is current, but I guess that saving it directly onto the cloud doesn't work (if that even makes sense!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted the computer, restarted the programs, updated the programs, and changed the password and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then only thing I can think of is that I bought an HP laptop this week but decided to return it, so I deleted all my MS information on it.&nbsp; During the course of this troubleshooting, I also removed that entry from my list of devices on my MS account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what to do.&nbsp; I can work around not being able to save the Excel sheet to the cloud because it is saved in a file that is on OneDrive that DOES update, but the continual asking of the password on OneNote is a real drag.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get this back to the way it was where everything updates seamlessly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />
<br />
Dave</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook Formatting problem in Contact Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thepianolady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Formatting problem in Contact Notes</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook 2010, The problems happened when our office switched to Microsoft 365 Outlook.<br />
<br />
I keep an incredible amount of information in the Notes of my contacts. To keep it readable, I use a lot of formatting with color, fonts, indents, underlining etc. I also used the 'All Fields' section with User Defined Fields. None of that transferred over
 with the change. Fortunately, I have a copy of that Contact Database. I tried recopying it into my current one. But they change back-possibly after rebooting. I can't keep looking back at the old Outlook file and trying to keep it up to date as well as my
 current one. It's just not working.<br />
<br />
I am extremely frustrated that all of my efforts have been for not and my long string of notes is just that - a non-stop run of mish-mash with no paragraph returns or anything. I have reformatted some of the contacts numerous times only to have them return
 to Arial 12 in all black and run together. This causes a lot of aggravation with my job because I constantly need to access this information.<br />
<br />
Do I need to hunt for another software program that is recommended for contacts on the PC, or is there a fix for this?

Please see my response to Daniel Jackson.<br />
<br />
No, it is not an Outlook.com account.<br />
<br />
I didn't use export/import.....used Skykick application.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -later, tried copying and pasting from the previous database into specific contacts. But, the formatting always returns to the non-formatted version.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>This could very well be a limitation of the Skykick application. It could also be caused because of synching with some type of smartphones (some overwrite the Notes field when they don't support formatting or only a limited amount of characters and then
 push these changes back to the server).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you directly move or copy&nbsp;an item from a pst-file into an Office 365 Exchange Online mailbox, then both Notes field formatting&nbsp;and custom properties are maintained. The only thing which you might need to do is adding the custom property to your Contacts
 folder again so you can see it in the List view.</p>

<div>Hello, I have a similar problem when importing from my copied Outlook 2010 pst file (corrupted personal computer requiring new install). When importing, using a backup copy of my pst file, i'm able to retrieve all 'e' mails &amp; contacts and my notes fields
 did carry over the many formatting variations (color fonts, font variations) and hyperlinks,&nbsp;. However, i'm not able to retrieve the many graphics (pic files - bitmap/JPEG/Enhanced MettaFile Pictures of tables, graphs, etc.) and file attachments in my Contacts'

    <title>Moving or resizing text boxes in OneNote for iPad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptjohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving or resizing text boxes in OneNote for iPad</h2>
                    <p>It is great that one can tap anywhere and start typing, but is there any way to move text boxes in OneNote for iPad? In OneNote for Mac, you can click and drag on the top border of the text box, but I can't seem to do that on the iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, there is no apparent way to resize text boxes on the iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something, or is this basic functionality AWOL?</p>

<p>Sorry, but I don't know the difference between text boxes and note containers. When I have a blank note page open, I can tap anywhere on the page, the keyboard comes up, and I can start typing. The resulting text is in a "box" that can be moved and resized
 on OneNote for Mac or OneNote for Windows, but it cannot be moved or resized in OneNote for iPadat least I haven't been able to figure out how to do it. Hence, my question.</p>

            <p>I too experience this issue, and this is one of two painful bugs I have just registered here to investigate. If you click into the wrong area and accidentally create a new text container, there doesn't seem to be a way to move or delete it without going
 to a Mac or PC to fix it. Reeeaaally annoying.</p>

            This bug/inability is probably the one thing keeping me from ditching Evernote and switching to the Onenote product, it is that big of a deal. It makes keeping the notebook orderly next to impossible. Microsoft needs to fix this ASAP.

            <p>Agreed. Incredibly dumb not to be able to move the note container on an iPad.</p>
<p>The Move handle is clearly displayed on the iPad, and yet, you can not interact with it. Wow... just dumb.</p>

            <p>I just confirmed that this is correct. On an iPad, using Safari, you can log into your Onedrive account, and open your OneNote Notebook in a Safari Web browser tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here, you CAN move a Note Container using the handle. In the web-based version of the App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, from the native iOS OneNote app, this feature isn't possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incredibly. Dumb.</p>

 4G/LTE might not be supported by your network service provider or by the service provider you are using when traveling. In these cases, you may not be able to make or receive calls, send or receive messages or use mobile data connections. To make sure your
 device works seamlessly when full 4G/LTE service is not available, it is recommended that you change the highest connection speed from 4G to 3G. To do this, swipe left on the start screen, and tap Settings &gt; cellular. Switch Highest connection speed to 3G.</p>

<p>Then what is the point of your question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft timetable for releases are up to Microsoft.&nbsp; You reading the latest information and complaining</p>
<p><em>"As per the test, 820 should receive 4G upgrade"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Noting</p>
<p>"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Important: 4G/LTE might not be supported by your network service provider
</em></span><em>or by the service provider you are using when traveling"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The question was asked on 11/09/2015 so under 2 months [July ???],&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information as you can see is provided FIRST to the network NOT this forum, it is just recycled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed I gathered </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft had released&nbsp; the update you and all other 820 users would have a 4G enabled phone, and would have been
<strong>alerted </strong>prior to us</p>
<p>Your 820&nbsp;still works on 3G</p>
