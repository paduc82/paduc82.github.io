<h3> byurocks23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-installing Windows 7 help. Tried lots of ways to fix my problems, but keep getting new ones after fixing old ones.</h2>
                    <p>I've been able to re-install windows 7 in the past without any problem. I usually download the ISO and format it onto a flash drive on the computer I am reinstalling windows on. This time however, the computer I want to re-install windows is so messed up
 it wont even get past boot. I then decide that hopefully re-installing might fix it. I've now been trying to do this for a couple of days, and I've ran into a lot of problems, below are a list of my attempts and the errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I am re-installing Windows 7 professional x64<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other computer I own is an old giant fat one running Windows XP that is sitting in my basement collecting dust. I decided to lug that thing up and use it. I download the ISO file and USB download tool. I went through all the steps and everything
 looked good, but at the very end it gave me some bootsect error. I did some research and found that since it is a 32 bit, it needed to work with a different ISO file or something and it told me to download it from my account. I didn't have an account when
 we got the windows 7 so I was unsure of what I should go download. I gave up momentarily until I was able to use a 64 bit machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend loaned me a windows 8 laptop so I thought I could now fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I downloaded the correct ISO and the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool on the Windows 8 computer.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After I installed the USB download tool, I proceeded to browse and choose the ISO file. When I clicked "next" and error message popped up titled "Invalid ISO File" and said "The selected file is not a valid ISO file. Please select a valid ISO file and try
 again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>WTF, how could this be the wrong ISO file? I downloaded it directly from where I usually download it. I went to a Microsoft page that had the list of downloads and saw it links to the same file to download. I obviously have the right ISO, it just doesn't
 seem to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did some research on how to fix this problem, and I found this website and followed the instructions on it. &nbsp;http://www.intowindows.com/fix-the-selected-file-is-not-a-valid-iso-file-error-in-windows-7-usbdvd-download-tool/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following those instructions, I was able to click next and everything looked like it was working. However, right when I got to 99% complete on step four, some error popped up saying somethin "Status: &nbsp;We were unable to copy your files. Please check
 your USB device and the selected ISO file and try again." I did some research and found a site that told me I should format and wipe the USB using the command prompt and had instructions for me to do so. I did it, but still got the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe the Flash Drive was the problem, so I grabbed a different one and got the exact same error. This means that the problem is the ISO file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the point I am at now and I have read so many other Microsoft answers questions, I decided that I might be able to get some help if I asked my own question. Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p><strong>Starting the installation. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The following describes the standard way to start the installation, especially if you are dual booting a 64 bit version of Windows 10 alongside a 32 bit version of Windows. Another way is&nbsp;to start the installation from within a runing version&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and
 select the partition where you would like to install Windows 10. See below for further instructions how to do so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, see the following tutorial:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help. I figured that the file might have been corrupted on the download. Thus I went to my old XP and copied the ISO that was downloaded on that computer onto a the windows 8 one.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok, the USB download tool finished, but I got the same status that I got on my 32 bit XP, which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status: &nbsp; Files copied successfully. However, we were unable to run bootsect to make the USB device bootable. If you need assistance with bootsect, please click the "Online Help" link above for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the online help button, and this is what it said.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When creating a bootable USB device, I am getting an error about bootsect</strong></p>
<p>To make the USB drive bootable, you need to run a tool named bootsect.exe. In some cases, this tool needs to be downloaded from your Microsoft Store account. This may happen if you're trying to create a 64-bit bootable USB device from a 32-bit version of
 Windows. To download bootsect:</p>
<p>1. Login to your Microsoft Store account to view your purchase history.</p>
<p>2. Look for your Windows purchase.</p>
<p>3. Next to Windows, there is an&nbsp;<strong>Additional download options&nbsp;</strong>drop-down menu.</p>
<p>4. In the drop-down menu, select&nbsp;<strong>32-bit ISO</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Right-click the link, and then save the bootsect.exe file to the location where you installed the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool (e.g. C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Apps\Windows USB DVD Download Tool).</p>
<p>6. Once the file has been saved, go back to the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool to create your bootable USB device.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">First off, this computer is 64 bit, so I am not sure why it is getting this error. Secondly, my version of Windows 7 I got a long time ago and isn't recorded or found on my account, so I can't download what it says to download.</p>

            <p>Well it is, and its confusing me. I am now re-downloading using the link you gave me, however it will take about an hour to complete so I wont be able to try to format it to the USB flash drive till tomorrow. However I am retrying to run the ISO file through
 the USB download tool. Also, I think I am going to uninstall and re-download and install the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool if the retry doesn't work just in case.</p>

<h2>            Who owns the Windows 10 Freeze Problem - could they share what is known thus far&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Are there groups that are currently working the Windows 10 Freeze issue and is there a website or contact to find out what is known thus far?</p>

</p><p>It might be useful to share what is known at this point, what options are available to users and specific questions from the group or groups working the problem that users might be able to answer.&nbsp; From the end-user point of view, it is unclear who actually

</p><p>Below is what I have found thus far:</p>

</p><p>1.&nbsp;Windows 10 was freezing every 5 to 10 minutes on my machine.&nbsp; Prior to each freeze, the following error was recorded in the Application Event log:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2. Since I am working on a Lenovo laptop, I went to Lenovo and downloaded the latest drivers for the Intel(R) Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework and installed.&nbsp; This has reduced the frequency of the freezes from every 5 to 10 minutes to one freeze every

            <p>Are we all supposed to know what "the Windows 10 Freeze issue" is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem with freezing, and apparently neither do the millions of Windows 10 users who have no reason to post here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the way to a problem free Windows 10 system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Make sure all your hardware is supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>2- Do a clean install.</p>
<p>3- After the install, only add applications and drivers that are supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>4- When setting up a computer, only make configuration settings that are supported in Windows 10</p>
<p>5- Take the time to learn how to use the new operating system correctly (because there's not much about operating a computer that's intuitive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps that the 'pros' follow to achieve success, and amateurs (like me) can follow them too. The result is a Windows 10 computer that works properly. You may not like the way it was designed (I sure don't) but it works properly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I appreciate the suggestion I received, but decided to reset the computer instead.&nbsp;The process&nbsp;reinstalls Windows, but deletes applications. While its a lot of work reinstalling the applications, it leaves the computer like new, and it now runs better than
 ever. This process will solve many problems that are not mechanical, but make sure you have all your application codes at hand. A 7-year old computer like mine can accumulate a lot of garbage over the years, so perhaps performing this operation every few years
 will keep one's computer running like new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this ill be of some help for others.</p>

            <p>Acrobat 8 is compatible with Vista, not Windows 7 or 8. It is asking for the AdobePDF.dll and if you could get it, the installer would ask for another, then another, theh ............ and it still wouldn't run correctly. If you want a compatible version,

<p>Thanks Danida. In answer to your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 on my phone I am using 6.35.0.54. On my laptop I am using the latest version for mac. (I don't have my laptop with me at the moment as I am away but I checked for updates to the app when the issue arose and it said it was fully update to the latest version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 on both phone and mac skype updates automatically in the background so I can'5 tell if the update was what triggered the issue. It does seem to be a server side issue though, as it doesn't matter whether the calls come to my phone app or my laptop app.
 The issue remains the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 yes, the same issue is happening to multiple users who leave voicemails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help. I am tearing my hair out as the ability for people to leave long voicemails for me is something I really need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice given to anyone who has any phone calls, etc.&nbsp;like this about Malware, License Expiry, etc.</p>
<p>And your machine does not send out messages to anyone saying that it has problems or is infected with Malware, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have errors and warnings&nbsp;in our event viewer, which is another ploy they use to scare you</p>
<p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who knows if you have given them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>

            Hi Ryan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Use the manufacturer's bootable diagnostics to see if the drive is failing:

<br /><a href="https://mashtips.com/ssd-health-test-and-performance-monitor-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mashtips.com/ssd-health-test-and-perfor...</a>
<br />If none use Seatools bootable diagnostics long test from Seatools created here:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />User manual:  <a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />There are also diagnostics built into HP and Dell by powering up while pressing the ESC and F12 keys respectively.  Other testing tools here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow this with a Disk Check:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a> from booted Windows media Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />If drive is failing or undetected, replace it and follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If drive checks out, I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />At this point if you have files to rescue see here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 applictaion issue &#40;0xc0000142&#41; when running command prompt as administrator and other apps</h2>
                    When trying to run command prompt as an administrator (to fix an issue with another app, Steam) a window appears saying "Allow this application to make changes to your device" and when I hit yes, another window for cmd.exe appears saying "The application
 was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142). Click OK to close the application". This happens with other applications, too.

</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined only with that particular internet radio?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which browser or application are you using to play internet radio?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Close out unnecessary applications while playing the Internet radio stream. Utilities like Web browsers,
 graphics software and antivirus software can slow down the Internet connection and hog the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory). With the computer's temporary memory devoted to your stream, and backed by the full speed of your Internet connection, you can
 avoid choppy playback and lowered stream bandwidth. Media players will often lower the size and quality of a choppy stream, so that the content gets to you without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Update the software for the media player you're using to play the Internet radio stream. A software update
 can remove bugs and other issues affecting the quality on the user end. Web-based media players are generally updated on the server side, while operating system-based utilities must be updated by the user. Check the support page on your media player developer's
 website for an updated version or patch for the player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Adjust your media player's equalizer to make the Internet radio stream's sound more dynamic. For example,
 if the stream sounds muffled, raise the higher frequencies in the equalizer to give your stream a fuller sound. If you're using a browser-based player and the media player doesn't include an equalizer, you can use your Windows built-in equalizer effects.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Navigate to the sound menu (Start&gt; Control Panel&gt; Sound). Right-click on your audio device in the "Sound"
 menu, and then select "Properties" from the drop-down menu that appears. Click on the "Enhancements" tab in the "Properties" menu, and then click on the "Equalizer" option beneath the tab. Select an equalizer preset from the drop-down menu box labeled "Setting."</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

None of these steps work with Windows 10. They had no effect whatsoever and I continue to get the 1721 error.

            <p>I experienced a similar issue with an installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was run the compatibility troubleshooter, which set its compatibility mode to "Skip version check" -- an option unavailable as a manual setting for some reason, and that was all it took to get it going again.</p>

<h3> elda m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re&#58; All boot options are tried...</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have a Samsung Intel laptop with Windows 10. It's about 5 years old. Unfortunately,&nbsp;it won't boot up. Prior to this issue, it was working normally, maybe not optimally, but it was working.&nbsp;I tried turning it on and this is what I received:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All boot options are tried. Press &lt;F4&gt; key to recover with factory image using Recovery or any other keys for next boot loop iteration</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I pressed F4 which took me to another page that had a box with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot Menu App Menu</p>
<p>1. Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p>2. SATA HDD: : ST500LM012 HN-M500MBB</p>
<p>3. SATA CD: : SlimtypeDVD A DU8A5SH</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below this, at the bottom of the screen it has:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up/down arrow-Move. Side to side arrows-Collapse/Expand. Enter-Select. ESC-Exit. Tab-Switch Menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Boot Menu and Windows Boot Manager in the box are highlighted (the box is grey with double-blue lined outline, the highlight is black).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've "escaped" and the Samsung image comes up, but then I'm taken back to the same Boot Menu App Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue what's going on, nor how to fix it. Hopefully it is fixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Elda</p>

<p>Hi Elda, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the boot sequence didn't work, then we suggest try running the laptop in safe mode. To do this, here's a few steps to follow:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Power down your laptop. </li><li>Turn it back on again. </li><li>When you turn it back on, press F8 repeatedly until the power on option appeared.
</li><li>If you see the boot option "Safe Mode with Networking", choose that option. </li><li>See if you can boot up in Safe mode. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response. </p>
        </p>

<p>Josef, correct me if I am wrong, but the F8 key functionality is not on by default in Windows 10 . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If your system does not boot, I think this is the method for getting into Safe Mode:</strong></p>
Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have solved my problem by using 'system restore'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beforehand I had spent some time consulting help pages and therefore had already checked the graphics card driver.&nbsp; The answers to your questions are as follows:<br />
<br />
1. No other changes made.</p>
<p>2. Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems</p>
<p>3. The update was automatically installed.&nbsp; I think it was 2017-11 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4055254).&nbsp; It says it was successfully installed on 23 Nov 17 but I did the system restore in the early hours of yesterday
 morning (26 Nov) so I'm not sure if it has been removed.&nbsp; Apparently another automatic update was successfully installed on 26 Nov 17 (KB4049011).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be interested to know if it was the update that caused the problem.</p>

<p><span>This problem is definitely caused by automatic update (KB4055254).<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has just happened again whilst I was sitting at the laptop watching!<span>&nbsp;
</span>The screen went black and when everything reappeared there is a 4cm black strip down each side of the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I checked my automatic update history and it has just reinstalled (KB4055254).<span>&nbsp;
</span>As soon as I restart my computer to complete the installation I will be back with the stretched and distorted screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will then have to system restore again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please tell me how I can stop this automatic update being installed for a third time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is very inconvenient.</span></p>

<p>The <span>KB4055254 Update is addressing the </span>issue that affects some Epson SIDM (Dot Matrix) and TM (POS) printers, which were failing to print on x86-based and x64-based systems. Since you've mentioned that this Update is
 causing the issue, we<br />
recommend restoring your system to an earlier point in time when the Update was not yes installed. After restoring your computer, we suggest following the steps in this

<h2>            Overheating 360 slim power supply</h2>
                    
<p>so basically this is my 5th power supply in less than a year. &nbsp;i keep them in well ventilated areas. &nbsp;i have even opened one up and replaced the fan with a much stronger fan to no avail. &nbsp;today i recieved my 6th power brick this time i tried a hydra model
 instead of an official xbox 360 model and it has already started making the burnt electronic smell and is getting so hot that you cant touch it. &nbsp;is anyone having this problem besides me where power supplies keep overheating in clear air? its an s model.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you're trying a 3rd party model since those aren't safe nor tested by Microsoft and can actually do more harm than good. As far as why your power supplies are shorting out so soon (5 in less than a year is a problem). I would suggest taking
 a look at the electricity from your outlets because that could cause a surge or something of the sort of make these power supplies fry early. I've been using the same power supply for my Xbox 360 S for the past 2 years now with absolutely no problems.<br />
<br />
It's quite possible that the voltage in your house is causing the power supplies to fry out. I'd look into that before purchasing another one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree it is "possible that the voltage in your house is causing the power supplies to fry out". Also possible is the X Box 360 has something wrong with it.

<p>We've had the same problem. Two power supplies have gone out. They start by going yellow then red and then power goes out. It's extremely frustrating. I've tried external fans and expensive surge protectors to no avail. This has got to be an ongoing issue
 with 360s and should be covered under warranty but of course both our xboxes are beyond warranties at this point. Argh!</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you're having a similar experience, <strong>Tiff</strong>! It sounds like those power supplies were each hooked up to different consoles, is that the case? Let's collect some more info for you, but first, please start a new thread with what
 you've experienced and what you've tried so far. That way we can help you individually without derailing this thread. =)<br />
<br />
<strong>edaw</strong>: You say you're having the same issue in the new place. Was the current power supply used in your old place, or did you get a new power supply for the new home? If there was a power problem in the old home, then it's possible that the
 power supply was damaged before you moved.</p>

<p><span>Hi naasaa,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Did you try to boot in Safe Mode and check?
</span></p>
<p><span>If not then, try to boot in Safe Mode and check, also try the other Advanced boot options like Last Known
 Good Configuration and check.<br />
<br />

<p>
<strong><span>To restart the computer in “Safe Mode”, follow these steps:</span></strong></p>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><span>1. Restart the computer and press and hold F8 key.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and
 then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the “Safe Mode” and then press ENTER.<br />
