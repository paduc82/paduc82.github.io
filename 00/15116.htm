            Hi,
<div>Same thing for me. And after some research also for a lot of people with Omnia 7, and some Nokia and HTC owners.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In a nutshell:<br />
<div>- Update 7.10.8779.8 was OK.</div>
<div>- Update 7.10.8783.12 was NOT OK.</div>
<div>- Update 7.10.8858.136 (=wp 7.8) could not even try.</div>
<div>At the end of the installation of 8783 it said "update failed" and the (in)famous error 80180048 appeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After at lot of searching and reading on the internet, there is no solution:</div>
<div>- Re-installing Zune didn't work.</div>
<div>- Seven-eighter tool didn't work.</div>
<div>- Manually uploading cab files didn't work.</div>
<div>- Hard resetting the phone didn't work.</div>
<div>- Using another computer didn't work.</div>
<div>- Using the update tool from Samsung (Device_Update_Support_Tool_for_OMNIA7_KC3_Ver1.2) didn't work (the same 80180048 error came up for a lot of people during the Mango update - therefore this tool was released).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Weird: a friend with exactly the same phone had no problem at all. The only difference between him and me might be the fact that I used the update tool from Samsung before (Device_Update_Support_Tool_for_OMNIA7_KC3_Ver1.2).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it seems we're all stuck and any help definitely would be appreciated!!!</div>
<div>Wim</div>

            <p>I found another word of advice on the XDA Developers Forum. Flashing the ROM is probably the last resort. I will give this a try during the next few days. If I make any progress I will reply to this thread.</p>

<p><em>"I had the same issue (maybe it's because of the Chevron Unlock?). You need to flash the Omnia 7 with a .rom file and let it run all the Updates via Zune.&nbsp;This is the only method that worked for me, even a hard reset doesn't help."</em></p>

            <p>Hi Robin, I came to the same conclusion but I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable doing it and having to reinstall the entire phone.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to wait until the "official" update will become available through Zune and hope for a fix from Samsung by that time.</p>
<p>Anyway if it works out for you, let me know.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<div>i get the same problem and....unfortunately i m not surprised not to found this error's code on microsoft data base...Just look on all peoples looking for answers and communty managers just answering...."check that page and your problem will be solved"....</div>
<div>I ve never hack my phone and this error just make me feel that microsoft doesn't care about first customer's(omnia mozart ....)</div>
<div>What are they waiting for?(Xmas?)</div>
<div>I was looking to buy a new lumia 920 or Samsung ATIVS but now i will just wait for an issue for WP 7.80...</div>

            <p>Hi Wim and others,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not just walk away from this problem and did another attempt (although I am very happy with my new WP8 device). A co-worker&nbsp;pointed out a tool called "seveneigther" that would&nbsp;make things easier, but that tool also raised exception 80180048.&nbsp;I almost
 gave up but decided to try&nbsp;flashing my Omnia 7 with a (stock) ROM: that did the trick!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent over 3 hours on getting all updates on there, but in the end they are all there and that's what counts. Installing an original ROM will rollback the device to the original state it was in when you bought the device 2 years ago: all updates since
 then need to be installed cumulatively. You'll need to be patient! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;downloaded the ROM from XDA-developers (actually downloaded from an external site, but you'll find the correct links on the forum) and to flash the ROM onto the Omnia I used a utility called "WP7 Downloader Ver 7.41 for Publish".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you will manage to update your Omnia to 7.8 as well doing the above. The only thing is that you will need to be patient and also I'm not sure what this means for your warranty, please use the explanation above at your own risk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Just for the record, after 5 or 6 "old updates", the following were the last set I installed without any problems:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.10.8773.98&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; 7.10.8779.8&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; 7.10.8773.12&nbsp; --&gt; 7.10.8858.136</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck! Kind regards, Robin Paardekam</p>
        </p>

<p>Personally I think it is best to wait for a solution from&nbsp;Microsoft rather than starting flashing your phone.</p>

    <title>A new Windows &#34;Help&#34; system needed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reapur  say:</h3>
<h2>            A new Windows &#34;Help&#34; system needed</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with the way Windows handle any "Help" request by giving you a number of hoop sets to jump through.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>This is a computer, capable of doing incredible things, .....so do some.</p>
<p>If the help file comes up with a number of options on how to fix the problem, why can it not go right ahead and do it all by itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It knows all the possible options to fix the problem, so let it go right ahead and try them one after the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know when it is done, or better, let me know and apologise for the inconveniance.</p>
<p>Let Cortana look at me through my camera, and when I shake my pointing finger at her and say "Just fix it, NOW!!", she should just get it done, and asap.</p>
<p>"Mr Help file" can diagnose, find, update, downdate, replace, and do any kind of electronic handstand, backflip, sumersault maneuver all by itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it needs to search the internet for the best solution, let it do that, and fix it.</p>
<p>I would like to see a major move away from the timid, universally accepted user experience of always asking Windows for help with "MY" problem.</p>
<p>Windows is not my dad, teacher, peer or boss that I need to ask for help with something. It is my instrument to achieve whatever goal I have in mind. I have employed it by spending cash on hardware and software, because I chose to, for whatever purpose I
 may see fit at the time.&nbsp; It is not "My" problem, it is the "Computer's" problem to do what I want it to do. I will tell it in a textbox, or by voice command, and I expect it to comply, preferably rather snappy as well.</p>
<p>Silly compromising suggestions are not acceptable. "Have you tried this ?", "Did that solve your problem ?"(it is not my problem, it is yours!!!!), "Where would you like us to look?".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not ever want to see "Did that fix your problem?" Check it automatically, and keep working untill it is fixed.</p>
<p>Give me a button that switches between Windows BS and Windows no BS mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is so much resources spent on where I am , what I may want to buy, where I may go, what I want to smell, or what toilet paper prefer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, get this, I vote for a Windows operating system that does what I want it to do, and gets it done without distracting me from my goals.</p>
<p>And regarding all the "well you see it is like this..." and we can try to , but...", my answer is simple:</p>
<p>Force 3rd party software to have Windows certification if they want to be part of Windows update/shop portals.</p>
<p>Blacklist software causing Windows not to be able to Help customers. Warn users of those programs detected on PC. Have some backbone and create an enviornment that will keep your customers happy.</p>
<p>Give us an operating system that serves us, not one that we have to beg for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that would really improve my customer experience!</p>

<p>Cal54, love your comment about the registry tracking. Surely there must be someone with enough guts at the next Microsoft Planning meeting to actually stand up and say "I think we need to fix this and it would solve most of our product headaches that customers
 keep us tied down with."</p>
<p>The thing is that as soon as this type of policy is adopted by MS, app developers will soon frantically start scrambling to comply as the public would lap up the effortless option over the current punch the screen option. Dont comply and you die, conform
 and customers storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basic sales technique: Find out what the customer wants, then give him more than he expected. If you make the customer's tail wag, he will do the same for your bank balance.</p>
<p>Now go make yourself a cup of coffee from me while you contemplate what shape the undo button for the registry should have :)&nbsp;<br />

            &nbsp;That would be nice alright, but alas computers are dumb machines that understand no more than high low and equal.&nbsp; They can execute billions of instructions per second, but when it comes to doing the things you mentioned, can only do what programmers
 have anticipated.&nbsp; And when you have millions of users with an OS having millions of instructions and no telling how many possible hardware configurations, it's humanly impossible to anticipate all the possibilities.&nbsp; That is especially true for insider builds
 which are pre-release with limited testing so far.&nbsp; Finding and helping to fix the bugs are what this forum is all about.

<h2>            Outlook crashes instantly when I press the Import&#47;Export button in the files menu. Freeze shortly, then restarts.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook crashes instantly when trying Import/Export anything in Outlook.</p>
<p>I suspect that the problem lies with a newer version of Windows, specifically Version 1809, Build: 17763.195</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I have taken to fix this issue</p>
<p>- Tried repairing Office, offline and online repair</p>
<p>- Tried removing the Outlook profile</p>
<p>- Tried different accounts and windows users</p>
<p>- Uninstalled and Installed Office 365</p>
<p>- Reset Windows to a clean install</p>
<p>- Used the "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365" (SaRa)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this Error event when Out look crashes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I have the same issue on a completely new installation of Windows 1809 and Office 365 (Insider Fast).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best is to report it in Outlook via; tab Help-&gt; Contact Support (you might need to update to the Insider Fast build to have this feature available to you).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm still actively working with Microsoft on this issue and we're already narrowing it down to why not everybody is affected by this. The Import/Export wizard code between Office 365, Office 2016 and Office 2013 is quite similar (if not the same) in most
 areas so it is not completely surprising to see the issue pop up in those versions as well.</p>

</p><p>Just to update, I tried also on several machines. All with the same issue if they are on the latest edition of win 10 (v1809 and fully updated).</p>
<p>I found a machine with older windows (1803). and the issue is not there.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive changing Modified Date</h2>
                    How can I prevent OneDrive from changing the Modified date from the date/time the file was ACTUALLY modified to the moment it was merely moved to another folder or downloaded or uploaded or, for that matter, renamed.&nbsp; I see that a lot of people share this
 problem.&nbsp; I can't read through all their requests/complaints about it.&nbsp; Please just give me step-wise instructions.&nbsp; This was a problem with google drive, which was the #1&nbsp; reason I switched to OneDrive.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Oh no!&nbsp; I don't see anything that relates
 to this or OneDrive on your list of Categories.&nbsp; Oh great, now it won't let me post this without picking something.&nbsp; I don't recognize most of the things on the list and the ones I do recognise, this is not them.&nbsp; Pretend I wrote a really bad swear word here.

<p>Hi Lonna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive keeps Modified time of each files. The Modified column keeps the last modified time of the file. When anything happens to the file, such as renaming, moving, uploading, the Modified column value updates. It is not feasible to change the column to
 other time. There is also a Create column in OneDrive for business,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Created column keeps the created time of the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can add the Created column to the view in OneDrive Online, but it will take more steps to show the view:</p>
<p>1. click&nbsp;<strong>Return to classic OneDrive</strong>(at the bottom-left corner) then follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>LIBRARY</strong> &gt; <strong>Library Setting</strong>s &gt; scroll to the bottom and click
<strong>Create view</strong>.&nbsp; (If there is no <strong>LIBRARY</strong> at the upper-left corner, please click the
<strong>Settings icon</strong> at the upper-right corner &gt;<strong> Show Ribbon </strong>
)</p>
<p>2. Choose a view type (Standard View), give a name to the view, then you can select which columns to be displayed in this view.</p>
<p>3. Back to OneDrive, under the LIBRARY tab, choose a Current View by selecting the customized view name created in step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you need this information, you can return to classic OneDrive and choose the view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also make this view default in OneDrive, but there is only a out of box way that using CSOM powershell to make it:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/how-to-set-new-view-as-default-view-in-onedrive/cfb7fe79-073a-43ed-afa5-e29cec4ec896">How

<p>Alex, I take it that you're a highly trained OneDrive technical person? OK, so how can I have a column that tells me the dates (&amp; times) that the files were actually modified and that if I merely move the file from one location to another this label/info/whatever
 will not change?&nbsp; &nbsp;I know a lot of people have this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine your business has a number of handouts and you want to review all the ones that are more than a year old to make sure they're up to date.&nbsp; Or say you want to take a look at all the files you worked on today.&nbsp; If you also re-organized your filing
 system, moving a lot of files to different folders, you are out of luck&nbsp; They ALL show today's date.&nbsp; Or say you are sloppy enough to have 2 files (in different folders) with the same name.&nbsp; With what I'll cal a "modified date" (following Windows nomenclature)
 you can quickly see which is which.&nbsp; Or...oh well.&nbsp; I CANNOT believe this is soooo hard to do.</p>

                    <p>It's getting really annoying that every time I click the link to open a download, it opens in Edge. I'm trying to open the download&nbsp;in Internet Explorer&nbsp;so I can easily switch back and forth between tabs rather than have to constantly go back and open Edge
 to follow along with the site I'm trying to work on! I read someone else's question on this and the replies and none of them worked. I have my internet default set as Internet Explorer. I don't want anything else. When I open a link I want it to open in Internet
 Explorer ONLY!&nbsp;I've got everything set up the way I want on my internet browser&nbsp;and I'm really tired of&nbsp;Edge even being on my computer and constantly interfering with my work. Somebody please tell how to MAKE THIS GO AWAY!! Ugh. And thank you. :) lol</p>

<p>Yes! Do I have to download a pdf viewer program? Even if I do that, it&nbsp;doesn't give me the choice to open with other programs. I just realized...I have Office 365, I just haven't worked with many of the other programs in it besides Word. Shouldn't it have
 a pdf viewer program included? And if so, shouldn't it then give me the choice to open with another program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if I need a pdf viewer program, do you have a link for a safe one? Thanks for your help!</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1. Open Edge (internet) indirectly, that is from say an email link as an example. Then at the top tabs, the first one is the offending one, DO NOT OPEN IT, just delete it by clicking on the X at the right of that tab, while you have&nbsp;the screen&nbsp;of the site you
 were able to access indirectly on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
2. Now go to the EDGE settings, top right corner of&nbsp;screen,&nbsp;click on the three ... which stand for "more" there on the sub-menus click on Settings and clear the browser data.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
3. Close Edge and re-open; the offending site should be gone. It worked for me.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration of Skype to Microsoft, the option to unlink the Microsoft email linked to the Skype account has been defunct. Although the option might still show on your account's settings, it is no longer useable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers why you cannot unlink accounts.</p>

            You cannot install EXE files on a windows phone - and you couldn't do this on a windows mobile phone either.&nbsp; You can only use software you've installed via the Marketplace on your windows phone and there's a fine Netflix application there.&nbsp; Have you installed
 that application to your phone?

                    <p>Is it okay to create and edit a personal resume (obviously for the purpose of sending it to potential employers) with Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010? It seems like a resume is very personal, and thus it qualifies as non-commercial use, but I would
 like to make sure. Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Listserv messages fail O365&#39;s fraud detection checks and flag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Listserv messages fail O365&#39;s fraud detection checks and flag email as spoofing.</h2>
                    <p>Our institution uses Office 365 for our general e-mail needs and L-Soft's LISTSERV solution for bulk email messaging.</p>
<p>Lately, when sending out these emails through LISTSERV, we get an email that is flagged in O365. The message reads:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This sender failed our fraud detection checks and may not be who they appear to be. Learn about spoofing."</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, when we send out or receive email, whether it be internal or external, O365 has not marked anything as a spoofing attempt.</p>
<p>So far O365 has done a great job of catching legitimate spam in our quarantine. Mail flows as it should. However, It is only when sending out an email to LISTSERV that we "usually" (not always), get a copy of the email with the pink bar that includes the
 spoofing message.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the recipients of the LISTSERV email do not get this spoofing message at the top of their email.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that the issue lies with O365: The message is sent from O365, hits the LISTSERV server, gets sent out to the intended recipients, and then hits our O365 on its way back in to deliver our copy of the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I've tried modifying the SPF record in our external DNS to match O365's required TXT records. The record checks out.</p>
<p>MX Toolbox says everything looks good as well. The domain, subdomain, and hostname have all been white-listed in our O365 spam filtering. Nothing strange shows up in the headers either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth noting that we do not have an on-premise email server. Everything we do with O365 is completely on the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss. Any help is appreciated at this point.</p>
<p>Hopefully it is something simple that I missed :)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi JTorres32,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the detailed information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I’d like to summarize the issue you encountered: You used Exchange Online accounts to send emails from LISTSERV to recipients who also use LISTSERV, the recipients received the email correctly, however, then you received a copy
 of the email with the message mentioned above. Additionally, there is no issue when sending and receiving email using other applications, for example, OWA(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>). Please correct me if I misunderstood
 anything.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it’s the case, to look into the issue, I’d like to confirm some information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I noticed that you use LISTSERV for bulk email messaging, may I know if the issue occurs when sending single email via LISTSERV?</span></li><li><span>If you send some test emails to non-LISTSERV users, will the issue occur?</span></li><li><span>Let the LISTSERV recipients add your domain into their allow list and see if it helps.</span></li><li><span>The .msg file of the message you received. To get the .msg file, you can simply drag and drop the email from the Outlook for Windows to your desktop. For privacy concern, I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can click
 the following link to access the private message.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hello Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like there are no more spoofing alerts.</p>
<p>Turns out one of my coworkers made changes in the server hosting LISTSERV. The host was now referencing our internal DNS instead of our external DNS, which had an MX record that specifically took care of LISTSERV.</p>
<p>Looks like reverting the changes did the trick.</p>
<p>All is good now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to help with this issue!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the spoofing alerts are back and with a vengeance. I say this because we are starting to hear a lot more of the sites that use our LISTSERV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We contacted LISTSERV support and they think it might be the SPF record. They also suggest that the issue is not originating from LISTSERV, but from O365, which reaffirms our suspicions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our current SPF record looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>v=spf1 a mx ip4:</span><span>&lt;1st LISTSERV IP address&gt;</span><span> ip4:&lt;2nd LISTSERV IP address&gt; include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi JTorres32,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From my experience, there is no such a syntax like “a mx” when updating SPF TXT record for Office 365. Here is an article for your reference:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up SPF in Office 365 to help prevent spoofing</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, please make your SPF record like the following and see if there is any improvement.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>v=spf1 ip4:&lt;IP address&gt; ip4:&lt;IP address&gt; include:spf.protection.outlook.com –all</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: It may take some time to take effect for changing DNS record.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken out the "a mx" in our SPF record. For now, I don't think there have been any bulk messages sent out. Or maybe, we just have not been notified of the alerts happening outside of our organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I will address your four points for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You understood correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Don't think we have any list configured to send only one email message...I will try to set that up on a test list and confirm it. Let me get back to you on this one.</p>
<p>3. No. I have sent test emails to my personal email accounts as well as my co-worker's personal accounts and have not gotten anything marked as "fraud" or as a spoofing alert. These accounts are not Office 365 (work) accounts and include Gmail, yahoo mail,
 Outlook, and Hotmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. In the earliest cases, we were the recipients of the LISTSERV messages. With that in mind, we have already added our domain into our allow list.
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, we would send out email to LISTSERV and the list would get distributed to various sites (whether they are using Office 365 or not, I do not know). Among those various sites, was our organization that received a copy of what we just sent
 out. Think of it as Carbon Copying yourself on an email. &nbsp;It was then, that we would see a spoofing alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give a better example, see the attached diagram I created. Below, you will see all the "companies" (with the exception of "Company E") having a green check-mark next to them, meaning they received the message successfully, but without any spoofing alert.
 Whereas, our company and Company E successfully received the message, but with a spoofing alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84eba191-3157-49f4-8de5-53d7a4744a9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84eba191-3157-49f4-8de5-53d7a4744a9a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that "Company E" might be using O365 and have similar configuration as us. But that's just a theory. I have not verified that.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have a good weekend,</p>

            <p><span>Hi JTorres32,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the detailed clarification, it’s very useful.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since DNS records change may take up to 72 hours to take effect, please kindly wait for some time and see if there is any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After checking the .msg file you shared, I found that the email was actually sent from
user@CA**.CU*.EDU, so please add the domain “CA**.CU*.EDU” to your domain allow list and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And based on your tests, if you send tests emails to non-LISTSERV users, the issue doesn’t occur. From my personal experience, the issue may be related to the LISTSERV side. To identify it, could you please send test emails to company
 E using OWA other than LISTSERV, and let the recipients open the emails without LISTSERV, for example, if they are also Office 365 users, let them open the emails using OWA. Then see if the same issue occurs. Also, if you send internal emails within your organization
 using OWA, will you get the alert?</span></p>

            <p>Hey Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>CA**.CU*.EDU was added to our domain allow list a while back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have sent emails to company E before using MS Outlook 2013 desktop app and they do not get any spoofing alerts. Same with our own internal organization - we do not get any spoofing alert if we send emails using our Outlook (desktop) app. No alerts come
 through regardless on how many emails were sent out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it would be any different if we tried sending from OWA as opposed to our Outlook (desktop) app, but I will give it a try anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My team here thinks it's not LISTSERV per se. We think it could be any distribution list encountering O365's email security.
</p>
<p>One of our staff members chimed in and said that O365 probably sees the LISTSERV email coming in and notices that the header contains our domain. Maybe that's why it tags it - because O365 is receiving email from another source (LISTSERV) when that email
 could have only legitimately originated as a send email (not a received email) from within our O365. That's a little confusing now that I'm reading it back to myself haha. Let me know if that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something to note is that these spoofing alerts started right after the most recent DOS attacks. Wondering if Microsoft made changes to heighten security...?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t receive any report regarding the issue. Since the issue doesn’t occur if you send emails using the Outlook client, from my knowledge, it may be an integration issue between Office 365 and LISTSERV – LISTSERV used an Office 365
 email address to send emails to Office 365, this may lead Office 365 to mark the emails as spoofing. Generally, adding the public IP addresses of the sender server should resolve the issue. As a result, please check the IP addresses you added in the SPF record
 and see if they are the public IP addresses of LISTSERV server.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I now understand that you use LISTSERV for distributing emails to different emails addresses. Actually, you can use
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Distribution-groups-e8ba58a8-fab2-4aaf-8aa1-2a304052d2de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you for getting back with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, we recommend that you hard reset your phone using the key combination method below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>V</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong><span>
</span></span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Power</strong><span>
</span></span>buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration.<br />
</li><li>
<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Volume down</strong><span>
</span></span>button until you see a large exclamation mark.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Volume up</strong></span>,<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Volume
 down</strong></span>,<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Power</strong></span>,<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Volume
 down</strong></span>. Your phone will reset and restart itself.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Your phone will still be on the Windows 10 Mobile even after hard resetting. This will clear the bugs and will delete the installation files created in the process of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: You will lose the data on your device. Usually, you can

<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after performing the mentioned hard resetting method.</p>

            Unfortunately, you will have to download the app to use Skype. There is no workaround for this.
<br />Hope this helps!

            The Skype app is the only way, because Skype Web doesn't even work on the iPad in any of the available browsers.

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>What about on Win10 with the new skype version 12.10.572.0?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without logging your account off, you used to be able to right click on the skype icon in the task bar and click 'exit skype', which would unload the program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems this function has been removed in this latest version.&nbsp; I can't see how to exit the program once it's started. I don't want to go into settings-&gt;accounts, etc.. and exit out of my account, because that will require I need to re-enter my login account
 and password upon restarting Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely I'm missing something here and please tell me this very basic functionality hasn't been removed.&nbsp; That would make absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Russ, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To exit with the Skype for Windows 10 application, just <strong>click </strong>
the <strong>x </strong>icon&nbsp;and the app will be close without logging out from your account. For better view, see image below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0d94e42-3618-444f-88f7-93867faea8eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0d94e42-3618-444f-88f7-93867faea8eb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to <strong>Skype icon </strong>still visible on your taskbar, you can just click the
<strong>minimize icon. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact us back. </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but that closes the window, but skype is still running in the background, so others can still see me listed as online or send me IMs, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question was how to exit the application, so it's not running - I won't show up as 'online' or wont' be able to receive IMs, etc., without having to logout of the app.&nbsp; In previous versions, this was accomplished by right clicking on the skype icon in
 the taskbar and selecting 'exit skype'.&nbsp; This option seems removed in this newer version.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, but as written above, I'm looking to exit the app without logging off, because if you logoff to go offline, you need to login again next time you want to use the app.&nbsp; Whereas in the previous version, if you simply exited the app,
 you would be offline, but when you restarted the app, you would automatically be logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed I was missing something obvious, but it sounds like Microsoft's just removed this functionality from their new Windows 10&nbsp; app version.&nbsp; Not sure why they'd do that, but I've already rolled back to the desktop version and will just continue using
 that.</p>

            The process you describe on Skype Classic and Skype UWP is correct. If you close the UWP Skype, it ends the SkypeApp.exe process but the SkypeHoste.exe process still runs so you get notifications of calls and messages. If you want notifications stopped
 and free up the memory, you'd have to End Task that from Details in Task Manage. They'll restart once you restart the app and you'll not have to sign back in. If you don't want to be listed as Online, change your status to something like Invisible (this is
 new to 12.10.572.0) and then close Skype.

<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>We do not have this kind of feature. If you just close the application without logging out you will still be able to receive IMs on Skype, even changing status (invisible)&nbsp;you will get the same result. The only way is for you to sign
 out from Skype. </p>

            PLEASE restore the previous Exit Skype functionality so we can truly exit in one simple step like we used to.&nbsp; The multi-step work around is very inconvenient.&nbsp; I, and apparently many others, want to be able to exit for real with nothing running in the
 background.&nbsp; Why won't MS let us use our computers and apps the way we want to instead of the way they want us to?

<h2>            Health &#38; Fitness App</h2>
                    <p>I had not tried to open this app on Windows 8.1, but now that I have installed the tech preview for W10, I wanted to browse around and try as many of the features available.</p>
<p>Upon opening this app, the content loaded, but after the data loads, it is almost like the app minimizes, as it is still visible on the task bar, but upon clicking the icon, it loads the app as if it were closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error or warning prompts.</p>

    <title>Time zone, Sending meeting requests from iPhone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vidaldk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time zone, Sending meeting requests from iPhone</h2>
                    <p>When I send a meeting request from my iPhone to my Outlook.com account, I get the request one hour before. When I use the same account in a PC, and I do the same action from the PC, I get the request correctly in my Outlook.com account. Time zones are correct
 on both, the iPhone and the PC. Also, time zones are correct in the Outlook account. When I edit the meeting in the Outlook.com calendar, the time zone shown is not for Santo Domingo, but&nbsp;for Canada -4:00. The same thing is happening to other friends.</p>
<p>I'm in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If I send a meeting invitation from my iPhone using my exchange account for a meeting at 11:00 AM, I get a request in my Outlook.com account for a meeting at 10:00 AM. However, when I do the same from my PC, using the same exchange account, I get a request
 in my Outlook.com account for a meeting at 11:00 AM, which is correct.</p>
<p>Time zone is set as Santo Domingo for the iPhone, the PC, and the Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I fix this problem?</p>

<h2>            MMS APN settings for Cricket.</h2>
                    I cannot receive MMS messages after switching my Nokia 928 from Verizon to cricket is there anyway to unlock the windows phone features to allow me to do this?

            <p><span>Hi Chewy M,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this situation, I would perform hard reset of your phone, to make sure that system works without any problems, and then set it up again with your Microsoft account. You can as well do an extra copy on your PC hard
 drive. Of course, please make sure that you backup your data. More info you can find here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/basics/back-up-my-stuff</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then please set up your phone with your Microsoft account and re-add APN settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I would contact with your Mobile Operator as MMS messages are going with Mobile Operator data connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your contribution to the forums!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kind Regards, </span></p>
