<h2>            &#42;&#42;&#42;SOLVED&#42;&#42;&#42; Bitlocker to go &#34;Parameter is Incorrect&#34;</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 Enterprise last week.&nbsp; I had my external drive plugged in and when I did a right click on it I seen encrypt with Bitlocker come up and decided to try it.&nbsp; I found out today that was a mistake to do.&nbsp; I just plugged my drive in again
 to access file in it, the window came up to enter my password, put that in no problem, drive is unlocked.&nbsp; Double clicked the drive to open it and was greeted with:<br />
<br />
THe drive is not formatted, would you like to format it now<br />
<br />
Um, no, I want...need the files that are on it, cancel..<br />
<br />
Drive is not accessible, it is an unrecognized file system.<br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel, security,&nbsp; bitlocker, turn off bitlocker on this drive<br />
<br />
You're drive will be decrypted, make take some time, yadda yadda yadda...<br />
<br />
Thats fine, decrypt...<br />
<br />
The Parameter is in correct<br />
<br />
And then I'm here....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just ran a chkdsk on the drive with /f/r parameters.&nbsp; It took around 5 hours, just finished it.&nbsp; Opened the drive no problem.&nbsp; I am now in the progress of having the drive decrypted and will not make the mistake of using bitlocker again

<h2>            windows 7 black screen after logon mouse in center of screen</h2>
                    HI<br />
<br />
I currently have a toshiba laptop i bought at xmas,&nbsp; I have not installed anything new in the last month ar changed any setting.&nbsp; ( well that i know of my kids use this comp as welll but both say they didnt change anything :)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am running windows 7 home&nbsp; here is whats happening<br />
<br />
I turn it on and right after i get the windiows logo the screen is black with the mouse pointer in the center of the screen i am able to move the mouse but nothing happens&nbsp; ctrl alt del does nothing.<br />
<br />
I started in safe mode with the exact same results.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I tried&nbsp; "last known good configuration "&nbsp; same results black screen with a mouse pointer<br />
<br />
I tried the windows 7 recovery disks it asks me to boot from cd dvd i hit any key and the cd rom spins it then seems to start loading up but after the logo appears the same black screen comes up.<br />
<br />
from what i can see i cant even reformat and install clean ( i have all my dtat backed up so i have nothing to lose )<br />
<br />
Ps. i can hit f8 and get in safe mode i can also get into bios but as soon as windows seems to start loading i have the black screen and mouse pointer no matter which modes i am in.<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me a few ideas on what to do next?<br />

            1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 installation DVD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
<br />
If the machine will not boot into the Repair screen then your DVD is not a boot DVD or your DVD drive is marginal or damaged.<br />

<h2>            File Explorer and other programs are slow or do not respond</h2>
                    This has been happening more and more frequently. When I wake the PC at the start of a new day, or even after an hour or two, file explorer is incredibly slow to respond, if it responds at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moving or deleting files, or even emptying the recycle bin never fully completes. It just sits at 99%.<br />
<br />
When I create a new folder it does not show the folder, or new name unless I hit F5.
<br />
<br />
Programs like Lightroom or even Chrome are sometimes unable to even open.<br />
<br />
Shutting down, or even selecting the restart option either never work or take up to 20 minutes to begin.<br />
<br />
Not even sure where to begin diagnosing this issue.&nbsp;

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What occurred just before this started?    
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />Next go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by&nbsp;<strong>DanzIZme</strong> and <span><strong>auggy</strong> </span>
it is because of third party application, I suggest you to check the issue in clean boot.<span>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Clean boot:</span></strong><span> You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong><span>cleanboot</span></strong>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While installing the printer, scroll down to the HP Officejet section and install the PCL3 Class drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver architecture in Windows RT is v4 and is significantly different from x86.&nbsp;Most printer model numbers&nbsp;are not named specifically but use what can be described as generic drivers for groups of printers. I hope this helps, let us know what happens.

            With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc)<strong> is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard,</strong> so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.

<p>I've tried the solutions you mentioned, but none of them worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-<span>Windows 10 Embedded Product Key Tool:</span></p>
<p><span>I get this error:</span></p>
<p><span>Unable to open MSDM table!</span></p>
<p><span>this pc does not contain an embedded product key - search for product key sticker or contact your manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>
<p>2-&nbsp;<span>Belarc Advisor - Free Personal PC Audit (Version 8.5c):</span></p>
<p><span>it doesn't show any product key.</span></p>
<p><span>but instead there is some stuff written below:</span></p>
<p><span>the full product key is not stored on this computer. however the characters shown uniquely identify your product key.</span></p>
<p>-I've looked for the product key on the entire page, but I didn't find it. and I don't understand what they meant by "<span>the characters shown uniquely identify your product key"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3-</span><span>Product KeyFinder:</span></p>
<p>It showed me a product key.</p>
<p>but when I tried inserting it to the windows activation on pc settings, I got this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>the product key you have entered appears to be the default product key and cannot be used for activation.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>be sure to check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>and verify that everything is valid and up to date, be sure to check the section
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com/services</a></p>
<p>if it shows any issues, if it does then that likely has to be solved first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all is good but it's still not allowing you to purchase anything please specify what you are trying to do and on what device and if it shows any error codes or messages.</p>
<p>Also try to make purchase via console, xbox.com or Xbox app to see if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that currently there is an issue on Xbox Live regarding Social and Gaming, it shouldn't affect purchasing, but you never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

            What is the error you get? Can you try to purchase using xbox store website from your computer, and see if it works that way?

[/quote]I have had lots of controllers, most of them had analogue drift after surprisingly little use, squeaky trigger buttons and the nototiously "naff" d-pad, some of them had battery pack issues, but apart from that, they are the best controllers available
 for the Xbox 360...

<p>It just depends on how much you use them &amp; treat them. Playing while eating greasy food is not good for one. Spilling stuff on them is another bad thing. Then you have other people who get mad and throw their controller. I should know, I use to do it when
 I was young. Now I don't because I'm older and if I break one, it's coming out of my wallet when I have to buy a new one! x)</p>

<p>My d-pad on my New $70 black wireless is screwed, You have to push both right and down way too hard for it to respond. The black one that came with my slim has a drifting up problem on the right stick. Best pad I have is the old white one from 2008 though
 the rubber has smoothed down to the plastic on the left</p>

<h2>            Surface Book Pen</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Surface Book. It came with a pen and everything worked fine for the first week. However, one day the screen stopped responding to the pen's touch. The pen connects with Bluetooth and when I press the shortcut eraser button on the top
 of the pen all the right shortcuts open. I just can't write with the pen. the screen registers my finger and other styluses I own just fine. What could be wrong?</p>

<h2>            Xbox Games Not Updating Properly</h2>
                    So just today (Wednesday , October 10, 2018) I came home and saw that one of my games needed an update. As usual, I pressed update and it was stuck on 0% for around 7 hours. Help?

            I’ve noticed all my game updates for the last two weeks have taken an unusually long time to start. I manually set them to start and they sit in queue with no progress or percentage sometimes for 10 minutes or more. Nowhere near as bad as your situation
 but annoying.

<p>Im getting throttled by the Megaservers like i got “spike stripped” going 200mph in a Lambo. &nbsp;Why are the megaservers not ambitious enough to cater to those who pay for the service?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And YES i have tried everything Microsoft and Xfinity have told me to do to my network setting on Xbox and Router. &nbsp;I wont fall for more BS diversions. &nbsp;Give us the SPEED we pay for. &nbsp;This isnt a Chinese network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything in this post including what im about to say below has been ignored FOR YEARS, in a corporately disrespectful fashion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also im on my 3rd Xbox One X!! (7th in this generation) Im a dedicated Xbox fan, and we all get **** on because microsoft likes buying and building low and selling high from outsourcing manufacturing. &nbsp; Wheres the “Quality American Made” console? (IE: Cheap
 faulty Seagate HDDs) Wheres the Microsoft i use to know? And WHY does my original Nov 2001 Original Xbox STILL WORK perfectly???</p>

<h2>            Keyboard keys not typing after the recent upgrade</h2>
                    <p>We meet again, Microsoft. (Har har.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to start from the bottom, I have ASUS X202E model. When I upgraded that PC from 8.1 to windows 10 manually, all went fine. It even fixed my Korean/English key which was broken in 8.1 upgrade. Now jump to April, from its 4 months sleep, several keys are
 now not functional. I have bought an external USB Keyboard and am using that. I can get over that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is... that I bought a Lenovo Miix320 tablet PC. I was prompted to updated with the recent October update that 'created news' with it deleting people's document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was fine for me, but after about 3~4 days of update, I found 1 and A key stopped working. Soon after that, TAB and Q has joined the cause. I have 4 keys gone missing because of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need an answer quick. I can't afford another laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No recovery point, no registry back up, nothing backed up. Give me all possible solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have single language version, so some pictures if you are going to refer with control panel.&nbsp;</p>

            Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked  
<br />
<br />Source - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/windows-mouse-touchpad-keyboard-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/...</a>
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi Green.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Check also at Settings &gt; Time &amp; Language &gt; Region &amp; Language to make sure the correct Language appears, then choose Advanced Keyboard Settings to see if a different input method is chosen in the dropdown menu.
<br />
<br />This could have been caused by Windows Update.  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then again uninstall and immediately hide them using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update can roll back to in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so we'd want to test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 froze on me not 'not responding', just not working. I (foolisly as i know now) decided to uninstall the app and hopefully be able to reinstall without problem; This is where a big problem arrived. I right clicked the sea of thieves icon and the xbox beta icon
 on my task manager and it gave me the option to uninstall so I did. Now whenever I use the xbox Installer app to reinstall, the program freezes when I click the green Install button. I've looked all over and since it's such a new thing I couldn't find ANY
 support for my problems. I've looked into what I can do as much as I can but i'm not super tech savvy. I've restarted it a few times and reinstalled the launcher a few times (neither worked). If anyone has any idea on how to help I'

<p>Hi cygrips,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the app was possibly not uninstalled or deleted properly from your PC and now it freezes when trying to re-install. Do you see the app still in your Task manager? Click where it says more details and go through each tab and locate the Xbox
 game pass beta app. Right click and then select Open file location, which should open the folder with any files you would still need to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open run window (Windowskey + R) - Type in: "%appdata%" - Delete the Xbox app (beta) for the PC Game Pass folder in the roaming folder (You should be in it already). Go back one folder, then you should end up in Appdata - Go to "Local" - Delete
 the beta Xbox app folder in there too. You can also get to the local folder by typing %localappdata% in the run window. Once you delete the folders for the app that is having issues, try re-installing again from this website&nbsp;https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-pass/pc-games.</span></p>

<p>I upgraded to Windows 1903 (build 18362.175) and downloaded the xbox installer for pc game pass. When I run the installer it sticks
<span>on "making things awesome." The thermometer doesn't budge from zero. I have downloaded new copies of the installer several times, restarted my PC many tmes, but still can't get it to install.</span></p>
<p><span>When I follow the instructions you give, I see the roaming folder but there is no xbox entry at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Task Manager reports that I'm trying to install the 32 bit version, which seems wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>I fixed my own problem, but now I have a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it by running it as administrator. Why did I have to? I don't know. Why didn't Windows tell me to? Beats me. That's why I do my actual work on a Mac.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Now I'm trying to install Metro Exodus.&nbsp; It doesn't show any signs of working and then I get an error message that helpfully tells me that "something went wrong." Well, thanks for that. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same problem. It started after I uninstalled the app. However I checked that I don't have any Xbox app folder neither in Appdata/roaming nor Appdata/local. Also I tried starting the install as administrator and it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no process named Xbox in my task explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help :)&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is it possible to use the Game bar and other Windows 10 gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sega dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to use the Game bar and other Windows 10 gaming features without a Windows key&#63;</h2>
                    I use an IBM Model M with my desktop. It does not have a Windows key. It order to use things like the Game bar, you have to pressed Windows key + G, but since my Model M doesn't have a Windows key, I can't do this. Is there a way to change the key combo?
 Is there another way to activate the Game bar? I don't want to get a new keyboard just to have a Windows key. I've tried to look this up, but I can't find anything relevant. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            I agree I hate this as well and hoped that 8.1 would resolve this. &nbsp;I searched and found that the Windows 8 was set up purposely so you could find apps that you had uninstalled, in case you want to re-install them. (per a MS response to the same question
 in Dec 2012). &nbsp;There apparently was a request made to MS to provide this in Feb 2013. &nbsp;I guess they felt we didn't know what we wanted.
<div><br />
<div>I guess it did not occur to anyone that you might not want to re-install every app that you have tried. &nbsp;All it does is take up space. Yuck! &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Recovering Replaced Files</h2>
                    I recently accidentally replace some very essential files of mine. And before you suggest it, I have tried restoring to previous versions. is there any other way to restore these files or some kind of tool that can help me get them back?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restore deleted files from recycle bin</strong></p>
<p>If you lost or deleted files from your Windows 10 desktop, you can try to restore them from recycle bin. You can open the recycle bin, choose files inside and right-click them by choosing “<strong>Restore</strong>”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Created file with original lost file name</strong></p>
<p>If you can not find any files in the recycle bin, you may try this method. Create an exact same file with the same name of lost files. Check “<strong>Properties</strong>”, choose “<strong>Previous Version</strong>” and select the right file version to restore.
 It requires you remember all lost files names. And this may not work for restoring some media files like videos or audios. But if you wanna restore document files, this will help.</p>

</p><p>If you reset your PC, all the data will be deleted only from the partition in which the Windows 10 is installed. And there is no option to recover the data.</p>

This was already done; it had no effect! I tried various profile options but found them confusing. I ended up creating a new user account. This has worked well - until the WIN UPDATES.

Refresh doesn't work; WIN doesn't even recognize my OEM CDs! Will likely start fresh with a reformat and new install!<br />

    <title>Graphics Card Driver Malfunction &#40;Geforce 9300M GS&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filipvh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graphics Card Driver Malfunction &#40;Geforce 9300M GS&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
The Geforce 9300M GS driver makes windows 7 reset every time. I have no problems installing windows 7. The windows 7 default drivers do not work with this graphic card. It makes the computer reset when it's about to enter windows. (Right when it's about to
 show the desktop)<br />
<br />
I know it's the graphics card for sure because when I disable/remove the drivers for the graphics card, windows boots fine &amp; everything (just uses my CPU for the desktop, crappy resolution, etc..). When I activate it and reboot again, windows reboots right
 before the desktop is shown.<br />
<br />
I have tried using the windows 7 built in drivers through windows update and the drivers from NVIDIA itself.<br />
Neither work.<br />
<br />
I heard there was a fix released in an earlier RC that fixed this problem, but somehow it wasn't included in the latest RC(Or so I heard).<br />
<br />
I heard the solution to this problem was to remove my GFX card, install some kind of a patch that fixed it (though I have no idea how to find this patch) and reinstall my gfx card. And everything would work out.<br />
<br />
I haven't&nbsp; tried this out because:<br />
<ol>
<li>It is a very stupid workaround to be able to install and use an OS </li><li>Hardly a good solution </li><li>I work on a laptop, and remove hardware from a laptop is something I'd rather not risk
</li></ol>
I hope this problem will get fixed in a near future as I'm currently using Vista and everybody is telling me how totally awesome windows 7 is.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,
                </div>

<p><span><span>Hi
</span></span><span>FilipVH,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting Windows 7 Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>It sounds like the graphics card driver is not compatible with Windows 7. I recommend you to check if the driver is compatible and install the driver is
 Windows Vista compatibility mode. To do this, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>First download the driver from the following link and install it, if fails then install in Vista compatibility mode:
</span><span><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/notebook_winvista_win7_186.81_whql.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nvidia.com/object/notebook_winvista_win7_186.81_whql.html</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check for the compatibility of the driver.
<br />
1. Visit the following link to check for the compatibility of the modem or see the manual book:
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Install the driver in Windows Vista compatibility mode.<br />
Download the device driver by visiting the system manufacturer website or device manufacturer website.<br />
To install the driver in Windows Vista compatibility mode, follow these steps.<br />
1. Right click on the driver setup file, click Properties, click Compatibility tab, under compatibility mode, check mark “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” and select “Windows Vista” from the drop down list. Click Apply and then click ok.<br />
2. Under “Privilege level”, click “Run this program as an administrator”, click apply and then click ok.<br />
3. Install the driver successfully and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
<br />
For your reference, I’m adding some links those talk about.<br />
1. You cannot install a device driver by using its installation program in Windows Vista:

            I seem to have bumped into a different problem now. After my last "defeat" while trying to fix it, I reinstalled windows vista. I read your reply, decided to try it out.<br />
<br />
Now I can't manage to install windows 7. I don't know what changed with last time, but every time the setup is preparing my computer to start windows for the first time, the screen goes black (possibly crash?) and just reboots. It keeps going on and on like
 this.<br />
<br />
Last time I had that it actually managed to get through after three hours and showed me the screen. I can't boot safe mode and load the driver you linked above. It probably uses the default windows 7 drivers for the geforce 9300M GS, which causes the reset.<br />
<br />
Any idea on how I can circumvent this problem? Disable the loading of the driver? I have pretty much used up all the ideas I have at the moment.<br />
<br />
I have installed windows 7 identically like I did the first time.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Boot windows from CD </li><li>Install in english, Belgian keyboard (period) </li><li>remove all partitions on that driver so I have 1 left (1 partition with unallocated space)

and after step 7 I'm (obviously) stuck in a reboot loop because it can't start windows for the first time. I can't use safe mode to disable the driver install something else. The only thing I can think of that it DOES get past once is on pure luck (very low
 luck rate in any case, it's been installing for about an hour now (starting from step 1) and no luck still.<br />
<br />
Once I get this solved I'll be able to try your solution above (already downloaded and on my external HD). I can't load / install that driver from the windows 7 boot CD since it's an exe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Ok, it managed to boot now. But booting up still causes it to crash most of the time, but at least I can get into safe mode. The solution you asked me to try didn't work. The driver installed without a problem. It asked me to reboot, i reboot and I'm still
 in the reboot loop.<br />
<br />
It gets to the part where it's supposed to show the desktop (the cursor is visible on a black screen for a few seconds) and then then it crashes. Any other idea's? All driver should be installed (they are installed according to the device manager). I disabled
 my gfx driver and it boots without a problem again.

<p><span>Hello,<br />
<br />
Welcome back.<br />
<br />
I recommend you to download the graphics card driver from the system manufacturer website or get in touch with them to get the graphics card driver that is compatible with Windows 7 and install it successfully to check its functionality.<br />
<br />
If hardware isn't working properly, you might need a new driver—whether you installed the device recently or have had it installed since you acquired your computer. Every device needs a driver that allows it to communicate with your computer. Sometimes drivers
 need to be updated. All your drivers must be compatible with this version of <span>
Windows</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In most cases, drivers come with
<span>Windows</span> or can be found by going to <span>
Windows</span> Update in Control Panel and checking for updates. If <span>
Windows</span> doesn't have the driver you need, you can usually find it on the disc that came with the hardware or device you want to use, or on the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span>There are several things you can try if you have a device that is not working correctly:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check if updated drivers are available through
<span>Windows</span> Update. When you check <span>
Windows</span> Update, click <span>View available updates</span> to determine if an updated driver is available for your device. For more information, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Install
<span>Windows</span> updates</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure that the hardware device is compatible with your computer and with your version of
<span>Windows</span>. If the device is not compatible, you will need to find the correct driver. Check the information that came with your device. You can also search for the device on the
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span></span><span>
 Compatibility Center</span></span></span></a><span> website. This website contains a comprehensive list of devices that have been tested to work with
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Many devices require special drivers to work properly. Be sure that you have installed any software discs that came with the device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer. Restarting might be necessary if the driver requires it or if the driver did not install correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If the device is a universal serial bus (USB) device, disconnect it and then plug it in to a different USB port.
<span>Windows</span> should detect the device and install the drivers, and will notify you if the device drivers did not install properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span>For your reference, I'm adding a link that talks about "Tips for fixing common driver problems":

<h2>            Windows 10 Update killed my computer</h2>
                    <p>Today I installed the Windows 10 Update, without checking the online data.&nbsp; It looked like a normal update, but then my computer went to sleep.&nbsp; Now when I try to start it, I get the normal BIOS messages, then a Windows icon for 6-7 seconds.&nbsp; Then the system

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update that was installed seems to be causing conflicts with the system. Since you are not able to sign in to the computer normally, you can access the recovery environment to perform the necessary troubleshooting. Before we proceed, we'd like to collect
 more information to properly guide you in resolving the problem. We'd appreciate it if you answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What update was installed on your computer?</li><li>Is there a power plan that's currently enabled on the PC?</li><li>Are you able to wake the computer up from sleep when it enters the said state?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the recovery options in Windows 10 to either check the power plans enabled, or uninstall the update that started the problem. Your computer shall give you the options by holding down the
<strong>Shift </strong>key on your keyboard as you restart the system. The recovery options are explained further on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest starting the PC in safe mode and checking what update was installed for us to find out why the computer sleeps when you switch it on.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a>'s a reference about checking what updates are installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the update has somehow changed the power configurations on the system, you can perform these steps once in safe mode to reset the power plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>powercfg /RestoreDefaultPolicies</strong> then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, restart the computer and check if it would no longer enter sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update so we can assist you further if the concern calls for more troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; To answer the questions:</p>
<p>- I'm not sure what update was installed, because I can't access Windows.&nbsp; Windows was prompting me to install a new update, and I shouldn't have agreed.</p>
<p>- No Power Plan, it's running at full power all the time.</p>
<p>- It's not really going into sleep state, but the screens to blank, with the fans and drives running.&nbsp; This happened during the update, and now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the computer, it runs through BIOS, and starts to load Windows.&nbsp; The blue Windows icon is visible for 7 seconds, with the little progress dots underneath, for about 7 seconds before the screens go blank and the fans shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before that, after BIOS tries to load DHCP, i get a message: "PXE-E53: No boot filename received"&nbsp; That would seem to indicate a problem with the primary hard drive.&nbsp; I'm working on that now, but the problem occured just as Windows was installing an update.&nbsp;
 You might want to check that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm tired of being a Beta tester for free.&nbsp; No more updates here.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously suggested, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
start the PC in safe mode</a> to check what could be causing the problem. To get to safe mode, you need to access the recovery options in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC takes you to the sign-in screen before it becomes unresponsive, you can restart it by clicking the power icon while pressing the Shift key on the keyboard. If that method doesn't work, you can hard reset your computer. A hard reset is performed
 by unplugging the power cord as you boot your PC up. This may need to be executed a few times before the computer takes you to the recovery environment where recovery options are available. Once you are taken to the recovery options, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Start-up Settings</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>F4 </strong>to select the <strong>Enable Safe Mode</strong> option.</li><li>Sign in to your account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you can check the updates that were installed in Windows Update.</p>

<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your computer is shutting down unexpectedly is because of a faulty hardware or outdated drivers. To look more closely into this, kindly answer these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer?</li><li>Can you try to put the power supply of your computer to a different outlet and see if the same issue exists?</li><li>Did you get an error code?</li><li>What's your operating system?

<p>I have the exact same problem. After reinstalling my pc for the 40th time with win 10 pro 64, i figured the problem happens after KB4034674. I have a asus Z170-A mobo and an intel i7-7700 cpu. After the KB4034674 is forcibly shoved down my throat, the PC
 no longer will restart using the start/power/restart. It shows the idiot quadrilateral and the circle of death dots for about 1 second than it dies to Blue screen of death(BSOD). Irql not less or equal; collecting error info, auto reboot, BSOD, Driver irql
 not less or equal, collecting error info, auto reboot, BSOD kmode exception not handled, crashes to a freeze while collecting 0% of error info, Preparing auto repair, auto reboot, crashes to Black screen of death(BLSOD), must power off PC with 5 second power
 button depress, start up, Please wait, BSOD, irql not less or equal, auto reboot, BSOD.freezes on quadrilateral, must power off restart with 5 second push on power button, BLSOD, auto reboot, preparing auto repair, BSOD driver irql not less or equal, NORMAL
 BOOT! this happens 100% of the times you select start/power/restart. If you turn off fast startup in control panel/power options/choose what the power buttons do/&nbsp; change settings that are currently unavailable untick fast startup this makes shutdown and manual
 start do the same cycle of BSODs and BLSODs as restart. If fast start is selected (ticked) than shutdown and manual restart works. Another problem is that once the thing gets too screwed up, only safe mode works and in safe mode you cant retick the fast startup.
 Why cant microsoft provide a key sequence to start the god forsaken win 10 into safe mode directly and/or have a safe startup option that only starts the drivers that apparently work in safe mode but be in a real mode that you can access ms installer, all
 options in windows, device manager status, and other functionality that does not exist in safe mode. For example: a windows 10 pro 64 version 1703 does not support the intel hd 630 driver for the i7-7700 cpu. When you install the win 10 it instantly crashes
 in the video driver. You can easily go to safe mode after 3 to 50 crashes when the idiot crash counter decides to allow you to restart in safe mode. Than once in safe mode, you cant install intel graphics hd 630 because it is NOT ALLOWED in safe mode. The
 only way to get past this bug is to install the win 10 an ANOTHER PC with exact same hardware, except a i6 level cpu. then when you have it at the first login screen after it is completely installed, you do not activate, you first take ownership of&nbsp; intelppm.sys
 from windows/system32/drivers than you rename the file to intell_ppm.sht, than you go to intel to download the driver for intel hd 630&nbsp; graphics for windows 10, extract all, go to drivers sub directory and right click on igdlh64.inf and select install. It
 will put it in the inf directory for later use and may complain about the driver compatibility with the device (remember your in a hd 510 cpu machine installing a hd 630 driver) but you must just choose okay. Than in device manager display adapter uninstall
 the device (intel hd 510 or microsoft basic display driver) and the driver, than select the network adapters uninstall the devices, and than all cpu cores from the last(bottom of device manager up) and than when the pc shuts down to restart, as soon as the
 lights on the pc recycle down, turn power off, (turn off or unplug the power supply), take out hd or ssd and put into i7 machine. It will start up and say setting up devices, using the hd630 inf you installed on the other machine. In the i7 machine device
 manager, all cores of the i7 come up with yellow exclamation points (due to renaming the problematic intellppm.sys) but that is the best you can do since intel or microsoft does not have an updated intelppm.sys that works on an asus mobo with an I7 cpu. If
 you leave the intelppm.sys alone the new i7 machine will not start, instead it will complain of intellppm.sys causing BSOD (irql or driver irql or Kmode exception). Note everything works perfect on the same setup with an i6 cpu. Now that the hd is in the i7
 machine it will finish installing. As soon as it starts, connect to the network and immediately go to settings/network/wifi/manage known networks select your network/properties and set as metered connection to on (its the third option down). this will prevent
 any of the KILLER updates at least until microsoft and intel and asus get the lead out and get this problem fixed. I tried uninstalling the KB4034674 but my SSD is still hosed and the restart and non fast start shutdown are screwed. Note the PC works fine
 if I turn on fast startup and only use shutdown and manual start or hibernate or sleep. Only restart (with fast startup ticked) is a problem. Again, if I untick fast startup, both restart and shutdown with manual startup are problematic with the 10 to 50 crashes
 of BSOD, BLSOD, and multiple repair, diagnose, please wait, TSS, safe mode, startup repair and every other stupid message in the world. And what does microsoft do with the eventual correct startup settings that work after multiple crashes you ask? Must throw
 them away with each restart. Also, per other forums on ROG and ASUS, I tried a regular HD in place of the SSD, same problem. I tried turning on and off the fast startup in both bios and operating system, same problem. I tried plugging the SSD ans HD on two
 differnt SATA ports, one intel and one ASmedia. Same problem. I tried the Power Supply from the other machine, the memory chips, the DVD drive, the HD the SATA cables, basically the oly thing different is one machine has an i7 and one has an i6. ASUS says
 the Z170-A supports i7 but really between them and microsoft and intel, it doesnt. Note that I successfully got the i7 to work with windows 7 but only if i select all monthly quality security KBs to be hidden, since microsoft is blocking i7 machine updates
 to security with these monthly quality security KBs. Same thing with windows 8.1, works best on the i7, especially without the BS of Cortana, Superfetch, and Windows Defender, microsoft is also blocking security updates if you run win 8 or 8.1 on an i7 machine
 {[ BEWARE]}. Good luck and hope this helps a little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: uninstalling KB4034674 fixed my PC. After two multiple crash restarts the uninstall of the KB4034764 actually completed and the PC was fixed by the next restart.</p>

            Initially your suggestion worked but I am finding that at least 50% of the time I have to use the Power Button in order to shut down. Any other suggestions and is there a fix coming for this problem?

            Mr Patel, I also have the same problem that I cannot power off from the Start menu. When I do attempt to shut down from Start it says that its shutting down but in fact it restarts my PC. I can only shut off my PC by going on my knees and switching off
 at the power point switch. This has all happened after downloading windows10 whereas I did not have any issues with the previous version. I have tried your suggestion on your post but has not helped. Could you pls help. Thx
        </p>
