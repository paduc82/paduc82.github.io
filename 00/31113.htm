            I having the same issue on a Lenovo tablet on Windows 10 RTM. That same thing takes at least half of the battery life. I started at 100% on 8/1 and by 8/5, the battery is at 38%. Windows tablet idle/sleep battery life is terrible compared to the iPad.
 I am always amazed how much better the iPad can stay in standby seemingly forever. It's always a surprised when I pick up an iPad that's rarely used (like almost never), and it's as if it never discharged.

            <p>Okay, well I believe I have a temporary fix for this, but I'm hoping someone will come up with a more definitive solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that there were two drivers causing the problem for my Surface. &nbsp;To diagnose this, run a software you have installed called "sleepstudy." &nbsp;The instructions to do this can be found here: &nbsp;http://www.windowscentral.com/learn-why-battery-drains-surface-pro-3.
 &nbsp;It is run from the command prompt, but make sure that you run it as an administrator. &nbsp;The file saves as an html file that any browser will open. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found two issues when I ran this report. &nbsp;The first was a realtek card reader error. &nbsp;I have a micro-SD card installed for music storage. &nbsp;When I tried to use Microsoft's "Safely Remove Hardware" feature it said that the device was busy, so I simply shut
 off the Surface, pulled out the card, rebooted, then reinstalled the card. &nbsp;This solved that problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was also showing something else continuously running in my report. &nbsp;This was the Marvell AVASTAR wireless AC network controller. &nbsp;I didn't want to delete the wifi adapter and reinstall so I went to "all settings", "network and internet", "manage
 wi-fi". &nbsp;Here I toggled off both switches, "connect to suggested open hotspots," and "connect to networks shared by my contacts." &nbsp;I then put it in airplane mode when I put it to sleep, and this solved the problem. &nbsp;In sleep mode for 5 hours the new report
 showed the driver active for just a few minutes, then it went completely idle. &nbsp;I consumed about 2% power in those 5 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to put it assleep again today without the airplane mode turned on and see if this solves the issue. &nbsp;I believe the driver was just continually attempting to search for networks while the Surface was asleep. &nbsp;Hopefully, there will be a firmware
 update to address this issue. &nbsp;One other thing, previous to this, I had tried turning on "quiet hours" and shutting of "location" services without success. &nbsp; This was the only way it would stop the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps everyone with this issue.</p>

            Just an update.&nbsp; I put my Surface to sleep this afternoon for four hours without putting it in airplane mode, and the Marvell controller stayed active.&nbsp; Total power consumption in that period was 13%.&nbsp; It appears that it needs to be in airplane mode before
 going to sleep to stop the power drain.&nbsp; Also, unfortunately, the Related cardreader became active with my reboot, and stayed active through the sleep period accounting for 48% of the power drain.&nbsp; The airplane mode is simply toggling a switch before closing
 the lid, but the cardreader error will become problematic to say the least.&nbsp; Hopefully someone will find a solution to this soon.

            <p>I found a setting in System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep</p>
<p>at the bottom uncheck&nbsp; ''on battery power stay connected to wifi while asleep''</p>
<p>
</p><p>that solved anything related to WIFI hardware </p>
<p>(since I dont really care to connect auto to hotspots and share info with friends, I unchecked those as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but yes I do agree the cardreader and USB device host controller in general are still causing problems and battery drain...

            Has a fix been released? It's been more than 3 months now since the OP posted this. I still see "WP Wifi Background Scanning Client" as a main "offender" in my sleep study report. I do not have any shared options on as pointed out by somebody.&nbsp;

            Frustratingly, this does not work for my Surface PRo 3.. Even turning off wifi while asleep still eats ~8% per hour. Changing hibernation to be activated more aggressively seems to be the only fix for me. i.e. Power button = hibernate; closing cover =
 hibernate; hibernate after 10 mins in sleep/standby.

</p><p>Try looking for Logs in&nbsp; C:\Windows\Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, some times we are not allowed to open things in the tools we might like to use (for example ISE) but can use&nbsp;PowerShell&nbsp; Get-Content&nbsp; to get them into Clipboard and then into the tools we want to use.&nbsp; Notepad
 frequently works more often than most but isn't very usable for finding things--for example, no Regular Expression finds in it, which are almost essential IMO for trawling through these logs.</p>

</p><p>That looked OK until it was cancelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it also looked as if downloads of updates were being suppressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW that is one of the preliminary things that I did with my mother's HP Envy:&nbsp; use the HP Support tool to check if there were any updates
 available that way--there weren't but who knows maybe the install needs to check and then having done that would be enough to satisfy such a check?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also was this WSUS?&nbsp; It looks like your error code is not one documented here but is one that is hinted at as possibly being related to WSUS.</p>

</p>
<p>(Hint: do find for the first 6 characters of the abort code)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, this reminds me that there is a method of doing a compatibility check for WSUS...</p>

<p>
</p><p>That could be a good clue.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. find out which driver(s) are causing that symptom and then try to do without their devices in order to get the install done.&nbsp; To find whatever other logs would be involved you could use my PowerShell script (given above).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One likely source will be SetupAPI.Dev.log</p>

<p>i did perform upgrade without internet connection, so bypassed the updates. but i ran another one with internet connection and updates performed, again same problem. error log link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/t3s0atc43fvler8/Error3.zip?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't have any peripheral attached to my Surface book PC or any additional driver installed, and i can not believe it is not compatible with the update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did use below command in command prompt for WSUS compatibility check but it returned nothing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SETUP.EXE /Auto Upgrade /Quiet /NoReboot /DynamicUpdate Disable&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/Compat

<p>I also tried in PowerShell and i got error message that it didn't recognise setup.exe</p>
"SETUP.EXE : The term 'SETUP.EXE' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable<br />
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again."
<p>
</p><p>however, when first i tried the update several days ago, windows update identified two incompatible apps: McCafee visrus scan and Vpn app. i uninstalled both of them, so i no longer have any incompatible apps.</p>

            Issue still exists and no solution yet. The problem also WU downloads the creators update automatically every day and reminds me to install it every day and every time it fails.

<h2>            Converting Powerpoint to PDF Handouts</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Windows 10 and mostly like it, however I can not figure out how to convert PowerPoint to PDF handouts (the 3 slides per page with lines next to them). I am a university student with a surface pro 3 and this is my&nbsp;primary form of note
 taking and its very frustrating that I can't seem to find an option for it with this new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>This one is fairly easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Load your presentation in PowerPoint and then click on "File" and "Print".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change your printer to "Microsoft Print to PDF" and below that, there is a box where you can change the layout (pictured below).</p>

<h3> xrgb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preordered a Game and never got my money back</h2>
                    
<p>So I had preordered Battlefield 1 Early Enlister Edition on June 13th via my account balance, and I live chatted on the 7th, because during the beta I realized I meant to get the ultimate edition instead, so I wanted to get it cancelled and use my $83.99
 on the recent preorder towards the better edition I meant to purchase in the first place. So in the chat It was cancelled and I never got my money back. I have been going back and forth with chatting and calling and haven't recieved my money. I was told it
 was cancelled which it was on the 7th and I was told they only could see it was cancelled on June 13th, which is totally wrong I purchased the game on June 13th and it was completed, I have it installed on my xbox the preorder, so it went through, and I chatted
 on the 7th of September and they cancelled it with no money back. I am very upset and if this doesn't get resolved, I will for sure taking legal action on this, since I paid for a game which I haven't recieved. I am getting really upset with this whole deal,
 as I have never had a mistake ever with Xbox.</p>

<h2>            Account Suspension&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! My <strong>Gamertag</strong> is <strong>Osvaldo9613</strong>, and i got a "suspension" for no reason.</p>
<p>I was in the wrong forum when i posted this. <br />
Sorry, now i think that i'm in the right one.</p>
<p>I bought a Xbox One a week ago, i entered with my account that i have since i was at 8 or 9 years old.</p>
<p>A week ago i got 18 years. This age in my country is considered as an "Adult".</p>
<p>Today i tried to buy the "Ultra" pack of Killer Instinct on Xbox One. But i couldn't buy it because a message in the screen said that my Privacy Settings prohibit me to purchase and download content from the Xbox Live Market.<br />
I checked all my settings, everything is "ok". I'm supposed to be available to download everything.</p>
<p>The i checked the "Privacy &amp; Enforcement" webpage of Xbox. I entered with my account, and a orange rectangle appears with a text: "Your account(s) or family account have active suspensions!"</p>
<p>I clicked in that rectangle to see what i did wrong.<strong> I respect the rules of Xbox</strong>, what i did?</p>
<p>I checked and it says: "Infraction" and "Date", right under the word "Infraction" says: "No Active Enforcement found"<br />
What's wrong? What i did? What are you doing with my account? I never did something against your rules to have that "suspension". I only want to play, i want to enjoy the games. I want to enjoy the xbox. I want to know what is happening with my account and
 this "suspension".</p>

    <title>Unable to play video media content from USB while signed out of - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to play video media content from USB while signed out of XboxLIVE</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Xbox Community,</p>

<p>I've been experiencing this issue for a year or so and have finally become frustrated enough to make this post. I'll try to share all details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ISSUE: <br />
<br />
I have placed various supported video media files (MP4, AVI, WMV) on a USB drive to play on my xbox 360. I plugged the USB into either port on the front of the console where I normally plug in a wired controller. After turning the xbox on, I press the xbox
 guide button --&gt; navigate to media --&gt; choose System Video Player --&gt; select my 'portable device' --&gt; then hit play on any of the files mentioned above. If I am connected to wifi and signed into xboxLIVE, the video will play as expected, but if I am not signed
 in to xboxLIVE I receive the following error message "A media update is required to play this content. To get the update, sign in to Xbox live and play the content again. Status code: 51-C00DF236"<br />
<br />
This issue is easily replicate-able on-demand; happens every time.</p>

<p>STEPS TAKEN:<br />
<br />
After researching your support forums I found the video playback status code article here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/video-playback-status-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/video-playback-status-codes</a>. It
 states to try the following resolution steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Try&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/system-updates-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updating your console software</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the Optional Media Update. Here’s how: </li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Games Store</a>&nbsp;and search for ‘Optional Media Update’ or use this link:&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/product/optional-media-update/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802fffe07df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Optional Media Update</a>.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Download to Xbox 360</b>. </li><li>If prompted, sign in using your Microsoft account information. </li><li>The next time you turn on your Xbox 360 console, the Optional Media Update will download to your console.
</li></ol>
<p>1) I have tried using test connection to prompt any new xboxLIVE updates, so I am completely up-to-date.&nbsp;<br />
2) I have successfully installed the Optional Media Update even though it's meant for ACC format music media.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Neither solution has resolved my problem, so I am out of ideas. I would think it should not be required to be connected to the internet and signed into xboxLIVE in order to play from a USB device plugged into my console.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let me know if anyone has any suggestion.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Corbin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, this could be a licensing issue. Give this a try</p>
<p>Create a new profile on the console but only go for the free membership. Try to play a media file using the new profile and you should be requites to download the optional media update again. If the files then play you can remove the new profile and you
 should then be able to play your media files using your current profile.</p>

<p>i am having this exact same problem. Kind of inconvenient because i don't have internet i am allowed to plug the xbox into at the office. I have downloaded the update to the drive as well, found that suggestion on google but it did not help.

            Can you try creating an entirely new account then perform the switch from there?

            Tried again today (before creating a new account) and the problem has solved itself. I made no changes to my laptop...it just works today!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions. It must have been a problem with Microsoft servers or something similar

    <title>Perma ban appeal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> legalize xans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Perma ban appeal</h2>
                    <p>This is the first post i've ever put on xbox.com regarding my situation. I have an old account from 2011 that was 12-31-9999 banned. (Baker y0) is the gamer tag. Im fairly certain one of my brothers tampered with my account via a 3rd party program way back in&nbsp; the day. i only found out this information far too late before appealing the ban. I was wondering if there is any way&nbsp;to commute the ban or have a 2nd chance at keeping&nbsp;my profile private. achievements and purchases are what im after. i miss them more and more as the years go by. its been 10 years and i still haven't surpassed the gamer score i once had that made me feel like a man. any help or reply is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>The only ones who deal with bans or suspensions are the enforcement team. They dont use or even look at the forums. The only way to reach the enforcement team is by filing for a case review.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If the ban was that long ago it will not be eligible for a case review. Its too late to do anything at this point and quite frankly wouldnt likely make a difference anyway as you are responsible for all activity on your account.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Darleen, thank you for your fast reply. After using the troubleshooter for Windows Update issues, the laptop has been working for 3 hours on installing Windows 10 updates. Now, after restart, I get the message "We couldn't finish installing some updates".
 It's very frustrating. And now the computer is restarting the cycle of downloading updates. I will call a technician to see if its a problem of compatibility of Windows 10 and my Toshiba (already the driver seems to be no longer supported).<br />

            Credit cards cannot be removed while they are attached to an active gold subscription. You would either have to wait for his subscription to end and then remove it, or contact support and have them cancel what is remaining.

                    At first my keyboard didn't work, then i found out it did but i had to hold the keys down for 2-3 sec's. but that was an easy fix, just click filter key to off. but i couldn't get defender to work with Spybot and couldn't remember how i did it in 8.1.
 So i went to delete Spybot and it wanted to reboot. Twice i have updated to 10 but when i need to reboot i get put in a reboot loop. So can someone help?

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to know that you are not able to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us create Windows 10 DVD and perform Automatic repair.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the Automatic repair:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b) The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c) Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>d) After you boot your computer using Windows 8 DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>e) Select the correct time and Keyboard type.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click Automatic repair.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then try the next method to perform a System Restore using the Windows&nbsp;10 bootable disk and check if you are able to boot the computer to the Start Screen successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Perform a System restore and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a System Restore, follow these instructions and check:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact the computer manufacturer to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows&nbsp;10 installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Windows Setup” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Repair your&nbsp;computer” from the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the “Choose an&nbsp;option screen”, click on “Troubleshoot”.</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Advanced Options” in the “Troubleshoot” screen.</span></p>
<p><span>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Advanced Options” screen, select “System Restore”.</span></p>
<p><span>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the on screen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier state when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi WD.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />2) You can also reinstall the apps from Store or it's website,  or re-register any WIndows app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />3) MAIL: What works most is to go to Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) then Manage Accounts, then choose the problem account(s), then Delete the Account.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC and retrace that path to add the account back.  Make sure the Sync settings are as desired for how far back you want mail Downloaded from, whether to include Calendar and Contacts (People app).  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then Reset the Mail app at Settings &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />Finally if nothing else works reinstall the Mail and Calendar app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have broader performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> ehajgbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Connection Sharing &#40;ICS&#41; on Windows 7 stops working after a few days</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a PC with 2 NICs which acts as a router-server and 2 other computers. All of them has windows 7.<br />
I have a PPPOE internet (dynamic IP address) connection on the server and I share the internet connection with Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).<br />
A switch is connected to the 2nd NIC of the server, and the 2 other PCs (lets say clients) are connected to the switch.<br />
ICS is set up correctly (following the official guides), and it works properly. All of the PCs are able to browse the internet, everything works fine.<br />
The problem is that after a few days (it happens randomly) ICS stops working, meaning that the 2 clients loose internet connection.<br />
Earlier I always restarted the server to get back the internet connection on the clients, but recently I noticed, its enough to disable and then enable the connection what is responsible for the LAN (where the switch with the clients are connected to).<br />
<br />
-I tried to change the 2 NICs with each other, but the problem stayed.<br />
-I have the built in windows firewall turned on.<br />
-Before windows7 I had windows XP on all the 3 PCs, with exactly the same setup, and I did not have this issue.<br />
-This issue is not related to IP change on the server, because I know the exact timestamps of the IP changes (from logs), and they dont correspond to the time of the ICS stops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Waiting for your feedback</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>BR</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Please take into consideration that while you call one of your Windows 7 computers Serve,r it is still a client OS ,and as such do not provide some of the service as you would&nbsp; expect from a real server.<br />
<br />
The Firewall and ICS are interrelated leave the Firewall Default On.<br />
<br />
Your system seems to be double vulnerability. I.e., PPPOE and multiple computers on ICS.<br />
<br />
While software PPPOE is suppose to work, it is a troublesome since its invention (that has nothing to do with Windows, it is an issue of how the ISPs implemented the DSL services). This is one of the reasons why many ISPs in the USA give free Modem/Router when
 you subscribe to their DSL service.&nbsp; Giving free inexpensive Modem/Router probably cost less than expensive free&nbsp; support calls.<br />
<br />
Some of the aspects of Internet got their roots in Dialup and slow Internet with No big security problems in more than a decade ago. Aspects of it are still included in Widows but under many circumstances it is Not any more a comfortable way to use today’s
 Network/Internet connections.<br />
<br />
As a principle, I would suggest to any one with PPPOE DSL to buy a Cable/DSL Router even if they do not have a Network.<br />
<br />
The Router provides Internet Routing, Hardware Firewall, DHCP server, 4 Ports Switch, and Most Important, Hardware scheme to keep the PPPOE alwaysAlive without using Quirky resource consuming software.<br />
<br />
As for ICS, usually Dynamic IP scheme within ICS is usually the preferred method, however if the Interaction is with dynamic PPPOE and external IP, it might be different (problems with Stack and hooks does not necessarily follows the immediate time stamp of
 the PPPOE dynamic changes, it is a process).<br />
<br />
If you use it with dynamic IPs try static, (Subnet has to be 192.168.137.x in Windows 7).<br />
