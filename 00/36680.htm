<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s Standard Calculator Bug &#40;priority of mathematical operators&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>standard </strong>calculator from Windows is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Not calculating correctly, or</p>
<p>2) not writing the correct expressions to get to the correct result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the evidence of the same expression with two differents results from the same calculator. Just one result is from the Standard option and the other one is from the Scientific option:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6162c2f-c2f9-43fd-aff1-e024cae509b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6162c2f-c2f9-43fd-aff1-e024cae509b4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the standard calculator should be fixed, cause is completly wrong to say that the result from 2+3+3*11 equals 88. It leads to confuse people, principally the people learning mathemathics, about the priority of mathematical operators.</p>

    <title>Function Key Revered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> batpandapower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Function Key Revered</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello, </strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a Toshiba Satellite L775D-S7226. A few days ago, the function Key was reversed. I liked it when it was the other way which was hold function and then press 4 to increase the volume and 3 to decrease. Now something happened where I don't have
 to hold down the function Key and I can just press 4 on the top number row to increase the volume. In order to type Numbers 1-4, and use the ESC and Space bar keys, and maybe even some other keys that I haven't found out about yet, I have to hold the function
 Key then press the number 1 on the row. To use space bar, I have to press and hold the function Key then press the space bar. Installing the Toshiba Function Key Driver did not fix the problem. Does anyone know a fix?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thank you.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p />

            If this does not work, uninstall the driver and install the one that is listed on The Sysmtics Website instead.

            <p>I finally figured out what the problem was. Their was a driver for the Synaptics Touchpad and Windows was download and installing the wrong driver. Here is how I removed that driver and installed the correct one manually as well as preventing Windows Update
 from installing the incorrect driver again. For reference, the driver from Windows Update that is causing problems has a update name of Synaptics driver update for Lenovo Pointing Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to the control Panel, Click on Programs and Features, and uninstall the following program. It may have a different name, but find the most similar to it. The name of the program that needs to be uninstalled is called:
</p>
<p>Synaptics Pointing Device Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have uninstalled this program, do not restart the machine. We have a couple more things to do first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Right click on the Windows Start Button, and then click on Device Manager. Under Mice and other pointing devices, Select Lenovo Trackpad Mouse. I uninstalled all of mine, Just to be on the safe side. We will install them later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now proceed to go to keyboards, and uninstall your keyboard driver. Just to be on the safe side, once again, I uninstalled all of the keyboards here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Now close out of the Programs list and the device manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Go to the settings ( Not Control Panel) and select Network and Internet. Then on the left side of the screen, Click on Wi-Fi. The in the main setting page for Wi-Fi click on Manage Known Networks.
</p>
<p>From here, select the network that you are currently connected to. Click on it, Then click on Properties. Where it says Metered Connection, turn this On. We need to prevent Windows from installing the update on boot up, so enabling this prevent that from
 happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. You will need to download the following Troubleshooter from the Official Microsoft Website:</p>
<p>http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have downloaded the file, locate the file in the File Explorer and Double click on it, or in your browser click Run at the bottom of the screen. Once the Trumoboshooter opens, click on next at the bottom of the screen. Wait for it to search for
 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this next screen, click on Hide Updates. Select the Touchpad driver (Check the box next to it) and then click okay. Once the Troubleshooter shows the results click on close at the bottom or just close out of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now restart the machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When it boots up, Click on the start button, followed by Settings (Not Control Panel) and then click on Network and Internet. Then click on Wi-Fi on the side panel. Click on Manage Known Networks and then find the Wi-Fi network&nbsp;you are connected to. Click
 on it, then click on&nbsp;Properties and where it says Metered Network turn that off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;Check for updates and the touchpad driver should&nbsp;hopefully not come up. Then go to your Maufactions Website&nbsp;and download the correct driver for your system. I found out that the 64 bit drivers for Windows 8.1 work fine for my Windows 10 Machine. Download
 the EXE and follow the instructions in the installer to install the driver. Then restart the computer and test everything out. Hopefully it works now! Let me know if their are any other problems or if it did not work and I will help you out.</p>

    <title>Lenovo T450s Intel Display Driver Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrosox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo T450s Intel Display Driver Issue</h2>
                    <p>My display driver "Intel HD Graphics 5500" has basically stopped working. It is an integrated graphics card.&nbsp; When it is enabled, it makes the screen go crazy (hard to describe), and it is usable but just barely. I can disable the driver (now using Microsoft
 Basic Display Driver) and the issue stops. So far, the only problem I've noticed with the driver disabled is that I cannot adjust the brightness, but there are probably more issues that I don't know about yet.<br />
<br />
My computer is completely up to date, with both Windows and Lenovo updates. I have completely deleted and reinstalled the driver multiple times (including old versions) with device manager but every time the same issue reappears. I have no idea what to do next.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I can give more information about my system/drivers if needed.</p>

            Hi JR.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You will also not get Sleep or Hibernate with the MS basic driver which is just a placeholder, so it's important to make sure everything to update it is done.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the Lenovo Support Downloads web page for your exact model number  - from the sticker on the PC.  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/</a>
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Thanks for the response!&nbsp; Unfortunately, nothing is working. All of my drivers are up to date (including the broken display driver).&nbsp; I've tried the driver from the Lenovo website (even an older version) and from the Intel website.&nbsp; I went into device manager
 and rolled back the driver into a version from 2016 and then 2015, and both had the same issue.&nbsp; I also installed a program that would completely delete the driver from my system (including registry, etc.), and then did a fresh install of most up to date driver
 from the Lenovo website and got the exact same problem.&nbsp; I've even tried installing different types of display drivers, and they either fail or install Intel 5500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm considering a complete system reset, but I'm concerned that if the issue reappears, it would make setting up Windows near impossible, but I am willing to try it.&nbsp; If you have any other ideas please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            It sure sounds like a hardware problem. if you are still under the one year support and replacement warranty then Lenovo must fix it for you, and I would get it done before the year is up so you can make sure the replacement is satisfactory.<br /><br />Otherwise if you want to try the vastly superior clean install which I linked earlier, then I would first save a Macrium system image which is linked Within so that you can easily go back if you need to due to setup problems.

            Sadly, the computer is 3 years old and the warranty is expired.&nbsp; I just completely reset and did a clean install of windows and the same problem was there.&nbsp; At this point, it almost has to be a hardware issue.&nbsp; Because it is an integrated graphics card,
 I don't think there is a way for me to do a home repair (most I've done is a fan replacement), and it would be very difficult to install an additional graphics card (and expensive/not guaranteed to work).&nbsp; I'm going to take the computer to a couple different
 repair shops and try to contact Lenovo support to get an estimate on repair cost or if it is even possible.&nbsp; Again, thank you for your help and if you think of anything else please let me know.

            If you don't want to shrink C to test if a test install of any Windows edition works which should confirm it's hardware issue, you can also run a Linux Live disk to see if it does the same thing.  Disable the hard drive to make sure it boots only to the live disk and using the Linux drivers whether it futzes the same.

<h2>            Shutdown during sleep &#40;battery ok&#41;&#63; What might be causing that&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new 13" SB2 i7 16G 1TB laptop has shutdown a few times while sleeping. It does not seem to be depleting the battery particularly badly, but if it is left sleeping for a few hours, or overnight this might happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event viewer does not give me any hints and just says that the computer shut down unexpectedly. I've updated the drivers to the latest version ( SurfaceBook2_Win10_17134_1802209_1.msi), but have still had this happen since that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to track this down? Online support isn't very helpful and can only suggest resetting the machine or returning it. I can certainly do that, but I don't want to do that without some understanding that this will have a decent chance of
 fixing the problem.&nbsp; It will take many hours to reinstall everything I need.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This reminds me of the (never solved) problems with my Surface Pro 4 that made me eventually give up on it. This is a high-end machine and I need it to work.</p>

<p>Hello Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that your Surface Book 2 is shutting down during sleep. It's possible that battery may have run low and the device went to shutdown or device may be too hot and shutdown. Since you've already reached out to our online support, can you tell
 us the troubleshooting steps that was performed? Was the Power Supply Unit (<strong>PSU</strong>) attached when you experience this? Have you tried running the Power Troubleshooter to check and fix issues with power settings? To do this, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt;
<strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Run</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>troubleshooter</strong>.
<br />
<br />
It's also advisable to run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> to make sure that
 your Surface and Windows are running in an optimal state. After running the toolkit, force your Surface to shut down and restart to ensure that all updates are applied. To do that, press and hold the
<strong>Power</strong> <strong>button</strong> until the screen turns off (<em>about 10 seconds</em>), then release it.
<span><span><span>Press and release the <strong>Power</strong> <strong>button</strong> to turn it back on.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.
</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Hello Timoteo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC was not connected to the AC adapter when this has happened, and I'm sure the battery had not run down. When I restarted the machine, without plugging in, there was plenty of charge left in the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if the battery ran down during sleep, shouldn't the machine hibernate at that point? It shouldn't just crash, right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the power troubleshooter, which found no problems. I also ran the Surface Diagnostic Kit which also found no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned before, I've reinstalled the latest drivers and FW, and windows is up to date. Is there anything else to check out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Doug</p>

<h2>            Problem with built in webcam on Aspire 5532 laptop</h2>
                    I purchased an Acer Aspire 5532 laptop and it is supposed to have a built in webcam. However, I cannot get it to work!!!!I tried downloading drivers from the acer website for the "crystal eye webcam" but when I sign onto sites like "skype" and try to use
 the webcam, I get the message that "no device" is found.<br />
I'm really frustrated and would like to know what the problem is, otherwise I feel like returning the laptop and getting something else.

            Hello all,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If you are having problems with a built-in webcam, then it would be best to go back to the manufacturer for assistance.<br />
I would first download any current drivers that might be available for the Crystal Eye webcam.<br />
<br />
Acer website click <a href="http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/notebook/2009/acer/aspire/Aspire5532/Aspire5532nv.shtml?Team=/acerpanam/notebook/2009/acer/aspire/Aspire5532/Aspire5532nv.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for support.<br />
They should be able to assist you on the built in hardware.<br />

            <p>It is NEVER a good idea to install an operating system for which there are no OS specific drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can run the Windows 8 Upgrade advisor, see here.. </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, while it will probably tell you that it will work, what it doesn't tell you is how WELL it will work. Video drivers in particular are a problem as it is via the screen that you determine how well everything is running. If the screen isn't running as
 well as it did under Windows 7 because the only Windows 8 driver available is basic,&nbsp;you will be disappointed with Windows 8.. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 is a very good, stable operating system, for which your machine is fully supported. You would do well to stay with it.</p>

            <p>Hi Skuno,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model no. of you computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>COM ports&nbsp;can be used to connect peripheral devices and LPT port are specifically used for connecting printers. There settings in the BIOS and Windows depend up on the system manufactures. Hence, I would suggest you to contact your corresponding system manufacturer
 to check for the exact settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
 the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modification of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are configuring COM ports and LPT ports on a virtual machine, you may refer to the following TechNet articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc708328(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Configuring COM ports</em></strong></a></li><li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc708419(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Configuring the LPT port</em></strong></a></li></ul>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface blue screen on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I have a surface tablet and i'm not sure why it won't start. Every time I try to start it, it just says "your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart, we're just collecting some info and then we'll restart it for you." but that doesn't work
 because then i get a second blue screen after it restarts that says "Your pc did not start correctly" so i can either press restart or I can press Advanced options. I go into advanced options and it says choose an option. The error code i get is ox0000012</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the recovery key so i go to the option to refresh but then it says "additional space is needed on the drive that windows is installed on. free up some space and try again."</p>

 I download it anywhere and probably save it on a usb drive? Thank you anyway.

            I have no copy of windows 8 whatsoever so basically, I cant insert, mount or anything. Why do I want to reset my computer? I just want to try it so that if ever when the time comes that I encounter a major problem with my OS, I could just easily reinstall
 windows 8. Do I have to wait for a major problem to occur before I get to know how to reset my laptop? The last OS I have used was XP and it worked great for me because I could just reformat my computer when I have problems with my softwares. I thought it
 was simpler for windows 8, apparently, I was mistaken.

            I'm sorry but as far as I know, unless you have upgraded from 7 to 8 using the upgrade assistant, there is no way you can reset your computer without any installation material.

    <title>Surface Laptop 2 booting to bitlocker recovery every single time. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 booting to bitlocker recovery every single time.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hey everyone. I am having an extremely frustrating time dealing with my new Surface Laptop 2.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>This problem started today when I woke up. I had shut down the machine prior to going to sleep, and when I woke up, it asked for the Bitlocker recovery key. Didn't think much of it, just shrugged and dismissed it as a bug.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Now the problem is, every time I open my laptop after pressing the power button instead of closing the lid, it asks for the key. I have tried going into the UEFI settings, where I realized for some reason, TPM was not enabled, which was worrying. I couldn't
 enable it. I also tried to disable secure boot, but it still wanted the key.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>What can I do here to fix this? I'm not happy about this at all. Other than this, I love the laptop, but this is a major compromise.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey Greg - here is the screenshot I took from the console. It looks like something has happened to my TPM chip. I have tried again today to go into the UEFI and enable it... not possible. It flashes an error message and tells me to restart and try again,
 which I've done about 100 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have done a clean installation of windows, it yields no different results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>para denunciar a un perfil tienes que entrar a su perfil y luego entre las ultimas opciones de abajo hay una que dice "presentar queja" o algo asi, tiene el dibujito de un martillo; ahi te daran opciones donde te pediran que selecciones tu razon de queja

<p>Pues mira no puedo decirte que soy un maestro en el tema pero a mi se me a dañado cerca de 3 perfiles, y pues &nbsp;me ha pasado por diferentes razones, porque cuando estaba jugando un gracioso le apreto el boton de power mientras salvaba &nbsp;pues se daño el perfil
 y mi punto de salvado no solo de ese juego (forza 2), tambien poniendolo en una memoria y &nbsp;mueves mucho el cable de eternet para los graciosos que les encanta salirse de las partidas con ese truco, y tambien si lo tienens en una memoria usb y esta esta dañada
 ya sea porque nunca la despegas del xbox o otra razon, se te puede primero dañar el perfil y si sigues con esa memoria sin darte cuenta puede borrarte todo, perfil puntos de salvado todo, y te aparecera solo como dañado con un icono amarrillo y no podras recuperarlo.
 Bueno estas son 3 de las cosas que personalmente e visto por mi mismo, no se si haya alguna mas.</p>
<p>y pues recuperar u perfil si esta dañado no te queda de otra. Saludos</p>

<p>^ Esos son algunas de las razones por las cuales se daña el perfil, también casi al finalizar la recuperación de GT si el internet está dando problemas, te puede pasar eso.</p>
<p>Cuando te suceda el daño del perfil, ve al Boton Guía &gt; Configuración&gt; Configuración del sistema &gt; Memoria &gt; (seleccionas tu disco duro) &gt; Perfiles &gt; (seleccionas el perfil dañado) &gt; Borrar (Borrar únicamente el perfil).</p>
<p>Después vuelves a recuperar tu gamertag.</p>

    <title>Lose email and browsing capabilities after connecting to VPN -- using - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lose email and browsing capabilities after connecting to VPN -- using Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I seem to be having a similar problem to several others but cannot seem to resolve it.<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 Home Premium on a Dell Inspiron 1764.&nbsp; My wireless connection works great until I connect via the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client.&nbsp; Then I lose the ability for sending/receiving email and connecting to the internet.&nbsp; But my VPN connection works.&nbsp;
 If I disable my VPN connection, then connecting to the internet/email capabilities work.<br />
<br />
I saw several threads that provide the information to <span>
disable "Use default gateway on remote network".</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Network</strong> icon on the system tray.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click
<strong>VPN</strong> <strong>Connection</strong> and click <strong>Properties</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Switch to
<strong>Networking</strong> tab. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Highlight
<strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong> and click <strong>Properties</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>Use default gateway on remote network</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong> to check the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>But when I get to step 5 there is NO check box for the 'Use default gateway on remote network'.&nbsp; Instead, Under Advanced settings,&nbsp;
 it lists:</span></p>
<p><span>IP Addresses:</span></p>
<p><span>IP Address|Subnet mask (with an option to Add,Edit,Remove)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Default Gateways:</span></p>
<p><span>Default Gateway|Subnet mask (with an option to Add,Edit,Remove)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Automatic Metric checkbox (which is checked)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is no information listed on that tab other than what I show above and I am not sure of what to do so that I can have access
 to both the VPN and internet at the same time.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

            A subnet mask of 192.168.40? Are you sure?<br />
<br />
There is a tick box for the default gateway under the VPN setup options.<br />

<h2>            Windows giving multiple files the same sequence number</h2>
                    I have a directory with 150 jpeg files. In the past I would highlight them, Right click and choose Rename. I would enter say 'Disney 2015' and press enter and I would get Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (2), Disney 2015 (3) etc... up to Disney 2015 (150).
 Now after I upgraded to Windows 10, I get multiple files with the same sequence number such as Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (2) and so on. I'm not sure how its even handling the same name but its annoying because even if I
 sort by date prior to renaming, the matching sequence number isn't next to the other one...&nbsp;&nbsp; Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (1), Disney 2015 (2), Disney 2015 (1), etc..

<p>-&gt; This sounds wrong. In Windows, when you mark a file, right-click it and select
<em>Rename</em> then nothing at all happens when typing the same name. I suspect you installed some extra software that provides this functionality.</p>

I just chose only a few in this snapshot but whats weird is that I do this all the time and have for years. I never had this issue before loading Windows 10. I sorted based on date/time when I renamed the files, but as you see its not like they renamed the
 files in a row, the first (1) and the second (1) are hours apart of each other. These were all chosen at teh same time and the first highlighted I right clicked and chose Rename, 'Disney World - Aug 30 2015' and I got duplicates and in some cases 3 of the
 same name.<br />

<p>1. Click the Start globe, then type cmd.exe in the Search box and press Enter.<br />
2. Type this command <strong>exactly </strong>and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir&nbsp;&nbsp; /on&nbsp; "%UserProfile%\xxx\yyy\zzz"&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; "%UserProfile%\Desktop\Pics.txt"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (replace xxx\yyy\zzz with the <strong>correct name of the pictures folder</strong>)</p>
<p>3. Open the desktop file Pics.txt.</p>
<p>4. Mark a few "duplicate" lines, copy them with Ctrl+C then paste them into your reply.</p>
