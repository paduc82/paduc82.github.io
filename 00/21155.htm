<h2>            Play SCORM files from OneNote</h2>
                    Is it possible to launch a SCORM file that is stored in OneNote? Typically we launch it from a browser, and the eLearning course plays, but when we launch from OneNote, the browser opens, with a "File Not Found" erro.

<p>Hi Caponigri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Shareable Content Object Reference Model (<strong>SCORM</strong>) file is a collection of standards and specifications for web-based electronic educational technology (also called e-learning). Based on our findings, the file requires communication between
 the server containing the file and also uses JavaScript to have the content execute correctly. We recommend that you contact the support team of the e-learning site that you got the SCORM file from to verify what is the complete list requirements needed when
 storing, uploading and running the module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>If you have additional questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Numbering large numbers of exhibits and cross-referencing them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wrong_time  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numbering large numbers of exhibits and cross-referencing them &#40;without using captions&#41;</h2>
                    Legal documents sometimes reference dozens of exhibits, and I'd like to autonumber/autoletter them with the ability to cross-reference them later on.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Searching around revealed that you can use captions, but the problem is our exhibits are not actually in the document itself, but are typically separate PDFs.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently, the problems that tend to arise are:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Last-minute changes create&nbsp;anomalous numbering. &nbsp;For example, I might realize that I want to add another exhibit between 8 and 9. &nbsp;Typically, we'd just use the next available exhibit number, even if it's out-of-order. &nbsp;E.g.:&nbsp;&nbsp;"At his deposition, Mr.
 Smith said he was guilty. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>Smith Deposition (Exhibit 8). &nbsp;<u>Also, Ms. Cohen said he wasn't at work. &nbsp;<i>See&nbsp;</i>Cohen Deposition&nbsp;(Exhibit 30).</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Mrs. Jones said she saw him do it. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Jones Deposition (Exhibit 9)." &nbsp;Deleting an
 exhibit entirely is even more problematic, for obvious reasons.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) Any change to an exhibit number requires manually going through the document and updating all references to that exhibit.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ideally, I want to be able to accomplish the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"At his deposition, Mr. Smith said he was guilty. &nbsp;<i>See </i>Smith Deposition (Exhibit 8). &nbsp;Also, Mrs. Jones said she saw him do it. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Jones Deposition (Exhibit 9)." &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Later in the document:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Again, Mr. Smith admitted he was guilty. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Smith Deposition (Exhibit 8). &nbsp;Dr. Black also said Mr. Smith's fingerprints were at the scene. &nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Black Deposition (Exhibit 10)." &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Still later in the document:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"There is substantial evidence of Mr. Smith's guilt. &nbsp;<i>See, e.g.&nbsp;</i>Black Deposition (Exhibit 10);
<i>see</i>&nbsp;<i>also</i>&nbsp;Jones Deposition (Exhibit 9).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want all the exhibit numbers in the above example to be fields that update automatically depending on the order in which the document is first discussed. &nbsp;For example, if I decided that I wanted to add the Cohen Deposition before the Jones Deposition,
 I want the Cohen Deposition to be Exhibit 9, the Jones Deposition to be automatically updated to Exhibit 10, the Black Deposition to Exhibit 11, etc. &nbsp;Further, I want
<i>all </i>references to the Jones and Black Depositions to be automatically changed to refer to Exhibits 10 and 11 respectively.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Less ideal, but still very useful, would be if I could create a list of references, and assign them exhibit numbers. &nbsp;For example, if I have 50 exhibits, I'd create 50 references, and manually assign them exhibit numbers. &nbsp;I tried tinkering with the bibliography
 feature in Word to accomplish this, but failed miserably. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            From your description I would suggest that you may be creating a cross-reference (a) to the Caption and (b) using the "only label and number" option. If you use "Entire Caption" you may see the whole thing.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The thing to bear in mind is that when you create a cross-reference, Word actually creates a hidden bookmark that "covers" the text (including the SEQ field) that it is going to use, then inserts a REF field that uses that bookmark. If you alter the text
 in/around the SEQ field, the position of the bookmark can change in unhelpful ways and updating the REF field can reflect that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think the idea "Mr. Andrew" had in the other conversation was to create your own bookmark names, in which case you need to make the Cross-reference to the Bookmark you created, not the Caption.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can avoid the problem with Word using special formatting for captions by inserting the SEQ field "by hand", e.g.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>press ctrl-F9 to insert a pair of the special field code braces { }</div>
<div>type "SEQ Exhibit \*Arabic" (without the quotes) between the braces, so you see</div>
<div>{ SEQ Exhibit \*Arabic }</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use Alt-F9 to show/hide the code, and select &amp; press F9 to update the result.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can save the code as an Autotext for easier insertion.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Something I wasn't quite sure about in this case was whether the Exhibit numbers can be "fixed" before you complete your document, i.e. so that you can no longer rely on SEQ to provide the correct numbers.</div>

            The main thing to remember with sequence fields is that they don't update automatically if you make changes to the order of the document. A macro will help with that - see the example macro at
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would be inclined to make the construction into a formatted autocorrect entry e.g. change #ex to (Exhibit { SEQ Exhibit }) where&nbsp; { SEQ Exhibit } is the SEQ field. Then use the macro to update the numbers (and any REF fields).<br />

<h2>            Why is Excel prompting me to save when no changes have been made</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have read similar posts about this problem from many years back and can't seem to find a proper answer. Microsoft can not be this apathetic towards its consumers. I have the problem where I have to save when no changes have been made ....(=today() is the
 problem formula). The solutions I have found was to set the formulas to manual calc which defeats the purpose of using excel or bypass the save prompt with a macro which defeats the purpose of the save prompt. Is there a solution to this or is excel just terrible
 to have this ongoing problem for YEARS?</p>

            Thank you for your response. So, in other words, you are stating that if I want a spreadsheet not do calculations, I can avoid this or if I want to not use the "save" prompt, everything works fine. You are starting to sound like Steve Jobs when he said
 not to hold the Apple phones a certain way as to not get bad reception. I want my spreadsheets to do calcs and I want the "save" prompt to work as it was intended to do.&nbsp; Two very basic tasks that excel should be able to do. The problem is real.

            The 'problem' is that if you perform a calculation, the content of the sheet does change to reflect the changed value and so the prompt is inevitable. It is difficult to understand how you want to make changes to the worksheet and for the program to know
 that you didn't really want to retain those changes. That's why you get the prompt, so you can tell the program whether you want to retain the change or not.<br />

<p>Thank you for your response. I understand what is going on. My point is&nbsp; the change is automatic....not a physical change I induce. That is like saying, when I start Excel, it uses different bits on my computer to open the window or if I minimize or&nbsp; maximize
 the window, it should prompt a save. This is nonsense. What is next? Is microsoft going to prompt everyone for a change because the moon has changed phases. That is my point, they are prompting a save when as save is not required. I can lose the feature of
 automatic calcs or I can lose the feature of the save prompt because their software can't do both. Two very basic features that should be able to work together but, Microsoft is too lazy to fix. I like both of the features very much WORKING TOGTHER CORRECTLY.&nbsp;</p>

                    <div style="color: rgba(96, 125, 139, 1)">
<div>
<p>One thing I really miss in MS Planner is the fact that you can assign people to tasks but there is no distinguishing between "responsible" and "follow".<br />
I would prefer to have the option to make one person responsible for a task and everybody who is interested in the task can follow (in order to get updates).</p>
<p>Are there any plans to add this?</p>
<p>From my experience it is always good to have one person assigned as responsible.&nbsp;<span>How are you handling this?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I managed to unfollow the site with the android&nbsp; SharePoint app.</p>
<p>For another site with the same problem, I could unfollow by clicking the star on the site in the "common/recent sites" instead of in the the list of followed sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that this issue is of very low priority for me now, and I doubt I'll have the time to check more things.</p>

</p><p>&gt; 2.&nbsp; If you click on the site, what will happen?<br />
I get a "403 FORBIDDEN" page.<br />
<br />
&gt; 3.&nbsp; Do other users in your organization encounter the same problem?<br />
These were private test sites, so I don't know.<br />
<br />
&gt; 4.&nbsp; Does this happen to other sites?<br />
It happened with one other test site as well after this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&gt; 1.&nbsp; Please capture a screenshot of the error message and "</span><span>The site is also listed among the ones I visit often, and is returned in search results".</span></p>
<p><span>Since I have now managed to unfollow the site using my phone, I can't get a screenshot of the error.</span></p>
<p>I am including a screenshot of showing the common/recent/visited sites. For some reason SharePoint is now in Swedish (while Outlook and the Office 365 home page are in English) with no way to change language that I can find, though it was in English when
 I used it at work today, so I'll explain what is what in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Screenshot showing <span>"</span></strong><span><strong>The site [...] is returned in search results"</strong></span></p>

    <title>save the reply in the same folder - not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcraw998  say:</h3>
<h2>            save the reply in the same folder - not working</h2>
                    Under Outlook 2013 - Options | Mail | Save Messages - I have the box checked which says "when replying to a message that is not in the Inbox, save the reply in the same folder". Not only does the message reply not get saved in the same folder, it does
 not even get saved anywhere. This option worked great in Outlook 2007 and 2010. Not sure why it's not working in 2013.

            Okay, although the solution does not make total sense to me, I fixed it myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "Save&nbsp;messages" section, in order for "When replying to a message that is not in the Inbox, save the reply in the same&nbsp;folder" to actually work,&nbsp; you have to check
 BOTH "When replying to a message that is not in the Inbox, save the reply in the same&nbsp;folder" AND "Save copies of messages in the Sent Items folder". &nbsp;Seems like the latter should not need to be checked. Also, thanks Eric for "Before you send the email, click
 the Options tab in the Ribbon and click the "Save Sent Item To" button in the "More Options" group - is "Use Default Folder" checked?" - now, nothing is checked under that setting.

    <title>SSRS scroll down parameter list is not clickable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haipeng hu  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSRS scroll down parameter list is not clickable</h2>
                    <p>We have an SSRS report on SSRS2016 that has a parameter with multiple choice. as the pic shown. The scroll button is not clickable only in IE ( I tried firefox, chrome or even windows edge works well except IE). Once I click the scroll button, the dropdown
 list will be closed. I can use my mouse scroll to scroll up and down but not the scroll button I circled in the pic. Any one know why this happens and is this a compatibility issue of IE and SSRS 2016?

<p>Not working. Even I scaled up to 200%, Still once I click the scroll button or trying to drag the scroll button, the dropdown list will be disappeared. We also tried on SSRS2012, when IE running on compatibility model, it works well but in non-compatibility
 model, it has the same problem. </p>
<p>PS: the drop down list will be disappear when I click the scroll button I circled, not any item or the check box.

    <title>Windows 10 Preview Theme Pack and Transparency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratedg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Preview Theme Pack and Transparency</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys, I think Microsoft needs to add a better theme mechanism to windows 10 to make it more personal, and to make transparency and aero a native windows feature that is turned on or off by the user and not the Operating system. Like this theme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transparency is treated as a native feature that can be turned on with any app, and is up to the user to fully personalize their PC.</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87f69b01-fdbb-4ed8-bfef-68b3dd8ff45e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>With Even more opaque transparency like</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/419dd293-63b9-45aa-b8f8-da7a115dcf6d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Like this&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since aero and transparency would be a native feature, it can be used on any windows explorer window as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8f56c8c-77ac-4abb-b17e-05c71add7e86" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next build can have this and microsoft can add this feature on the os making it very customizable and way better than right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks a whole lot better if it's a native, fully customizable feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook Mac 2011 update 14.4.3 emails keep downloading from Yahoo POP using imac OSX 10.9.3</h2>
                    <p>HELP,</p>
<p>We download to our imac the latest version of Outlook Mac 2011 update 14.4.3&nbsp; and it started downloading all our old emails that are already in our inbox and we went to ATT/Yahoo mail and moved 40K plus emails to folder that we believe is offline but only
 reduced amount to 13K. This is killing the ability to work on recent emails and taking so long. Does anyone know how to fix this problem. We have searched for hours to find an option on Outlook and cannot find it, very frustrating to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Our PC is running&nbsp; OSX 10.9.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>

            <p>Hello Arshad,</p>
<p>we tried rebuilding the identity and that did not work, &nbsp;the moment we started Outlook it started to downloading from ATT server 13,000 plus old emails already in our Outlook data base. We depend on Outlook for a living and this is very frustrating. Why
 is there not a simple option to not allow Outlook to upload old emails, doesn't it know how to read that the dates are old or in its own data base. Just does not make sense with so many brilliant computer programmers at Microsoft they have not resolved this
 problem. What are other option to remove outlook an start from scratch loading emails from ATT server for days we have 44,000 emails at the server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>we appreciate you trying to help.</p>
<p>

            This happens if there are any send receive issues, also in a new identity it is not possible for outlook to know if it has already been downloaded to a different system. Best option is to create a new folder online and move old emails to the other folder.

            <p>Two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of account (POP, IMAP or Exchange)?</li><li>How many messages are in your Inbox?</li></ol>
<p>I’m going to assume you’re using either IMAP or Exchange and that most messages are in your Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Inbox is synchronized more frequently than any other folder in your account. Outlook must not only routinely check for new mail but also keep its index of messages updated. When Outlook doesn’t have time to complete its update to the index before it
 checks for more messages, you’ll see a performance problem. Messages won’t download in a timely manner or maybe not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can access your account via web browser and move most messages to another mail folder outside the Inbox then performance should improve after syncing with Outlook. This will probably take quite a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hello William and Arshad,&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your help on this matter.</p>
<p>We use ATT Mail powered by Yahoo and it is a POP3 protocol with SSL required, and inbound POP server port 995 and outbound server port 465.</p>
<p>The Yahoo email page has option to creat folders but cannot confirm if they work offline, tried to get the answer but could not so we moved all 50K plus emails from inbox and Send to a created folder named Mike Folder. We left only emails from June 30, 2014
 to present approx. 300. Our old MSN account we could create off server folders but at ATT/Yahoo we are not sure if working off server because we restarted Outlook (after moving our PC side emails to &nbsp;offline achieve folders and leaving only 2014 emails in
 inbox and send approx 20,000 emails) and it started downloading approx 3,000 plus emails so we stopped by going to offline mode.</p>
<p>When we stopped it had downloaded 24 emails so we knew they would be duplicates. We started looking for them and found many duplicates. So again more work we started trying to delete duplicated that lead us to Office.com and found a script file and downloaded
 it. That did not work right and ended up in a folder under the identity folders and found something curious. The new identity folder had a list of sub folders approx. 10 and the Main Identity folder had approx. 5 and no Messages folder. To file the email script
 tool. FYI we never used the New Identity because it was a start from scratch approach so we defaulted back to the Main Identity to perform the start of Outlook after reorganizing server emails and PC Outlook emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Summary:</p>
<p>Based on your responses it sounds like we need to go with a New Identity and start from scratch, specially after finding the old Main Identity with less sub folders including the Messages folder ( that finding was very concerning to me). Are we correct in
 out assumptions here? Additionally would not have to deal with duplicated right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MikeB</p>

            <p>If you're using POP then only the Inbox will download into Outlook. You should be able to access your Yahoo mail via browser, create a mail folder there and move all messages to prevent them from downloading to Outlook. You can leave only those messages
 you want to sync to Outlook in the Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After moving those messages I suggest you delete the Yahoo account from Outlook, empty the Inbox under On My Computer and then add the account again. This will start copying the messages from the server into Outlook. The nature of POP is to download only
 mail messages from the server and delete them from the server after a specified time. It doesn't sync messages and it doesn't sync folders.</p>

            <p>Hello Talking Moose,</p>
<p>Well we thought all was good but late last night we finished setting up the new identity and started Outlook. Outlook started to downloaded 3,300 plus emails from the Yahoo server. While it downloaded we did other tasks, once completed it looked fine so
 we cleaned up some old mail and started working on other tasks. About an hour later we notice Outlook started to download more messages and was not stopping when it got to 27 we said here we go again and stopped the syn. This morning hoping it was a dream
 we concuded it was not but the mightmare started again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our opinion is that this has something to do with the latest update 14.4.3 &nbsp;we downloaded a few days ago and nothing to do with Outlook's operational functions. This is Microsoft downfall, always messes up software with it famous updates. How can we go back
 to original Mac 2011 Outlook? How do we clean the mess it left behind?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not Happy Camper!</p>

<h2>            Outlook license requirements for In-Place Archive through Exchange Online Archiving</h2>
                    
<p>I have the below link which mentions Outlook 201<strong>3</strong> through open licensing can be used to view In-Place Archive through&nbsp;Exchange Online Archiving, but is this possible using Outlook 201<strong>6</strong> via open licensing?
 The link mentions it is okay using Outlook 2016 retail box but only mentions up to version 2013</p>

<h3> needfixin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delivery status notification &#40;failure&#41; on outgoing messages</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly, last week and this week, I am getting the error "delivery status notification (failure) on outdoing emails that I send to&nbsp;valid email addresses.&nbsp; No matter how many times I try, I get the failure notice.&nbsp; I have emailed to these addresses before.&nbsp;
 Please note, this is not happening with all emails, just a select few so some are getting through and some are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a Hotmail conversion to Outlook.com.&nbsp; I have a primary account and a secondary account which I have "linked" so that my secondary emails now come into my primary account.&nbsp; I also have the option of of using my primary or secondary email address in the
 "from" title.&nbsp; I have noticed that these failures are happening when I try to use my secondary email address in the "from" area to reply to an email or to create an email&nbsp;from my primary account.&nbsp; As a test, after I could not reply to an email in my primary
 account using my secondary "from" address, I logged into my secondary account and replied.&nbsp; Surprisingly, the email went through with no failure.&nbsp; So, I am wondering if the failure notices I am receiving are somehow caused by my "linked" accounts.&nbsp; Any and
 all help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 and legacy 2013 or earlier products - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thredder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 and legacy 2013 or earlier products</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure most are aware that Office 2016 inexplicably removes other products that have nothing to do with Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, I had Visio Pro 2013.&nbsp; The product was activated and was receiving automatic updates and all was working well.&nbsp; I used it daily
 and never had an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then go to install Office 2016 (Home Use Product that I purchased through my employer)&nbsp;and it informs me that my existing Visio 2013 product will be removed (why?!?!?) and that I will be unable to reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; This struck me as alarming and odd so I contact
 customer support online.&nbsp; The first representative verified that Visio would, in fact, be removed.&nbsp; At that point I simply wanted to stop the Office 2016 installation because I needed Visio even if it meant I stayed with Office 2013 (again, why would one affect
 the other?&nbsp; Office does not include Visio so it should have nothing at all to do with it.).&nbsp; But she mentioned that if I could get the product ID then I would get upgraded from Visio 2013 to Visio 2016.&nbsp; So I looked through the files/folders and within Visio
 itself under the Account section I saw a product ID.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted customer support again and provided that product ID.&nbsp; The gentleman (different representative) indicated that the product id was an older one and that I didn't need it.&nbsp; Once I installed Office 2016 my Visio would be installed with Office 2016
 once I entered my product key.&nbsp; That sounded odd, so I questioned him on it...several times.&nbsp; He assured me that I would regain access to Visio when all was said and done.&nbsp; So I trusted him and elected to continue with the installation.&nbsp; He was wrong.&nbsp; It
 removed Visio completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted customer support yet again (now going on 4 hours at this point) and provided the case # and after review and listening to me,, the representative assured me that I would regain access to my Visio.&nbsp; I must have done something wrong.&nbsp; Fair enough...that
 is certainly possible.&nbsp; So he offered to remote into my computer and install it and activate with Visio.&nbsp;&nbsp; He uninstalled the existing Office 2016 and reinstalled... with the exact same results.&nbsp; No Visio.&nbsp;&nbsp; This seemed to puzzle him and he gave me another
 phone number to try (he indicated he was just part of installation support..I would need Technical Support, apparently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the number he gave me and described the problem I was having and furnished the two case numbers I had received.&nbsp; He put me on hold for some time, came back and informed me that my Office 2016 was Home Use Product and did not include Visio.&nbsp; Well,
 I knew that.&nbsp; I simply wanted my Visio 2013 back/functional again.&nbsp;&nbsp; At which point he needed a product id ... and away we went again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep in mind that my Visio was initially from 2010 (I believe) and was upgraded/updated to Visio 2013 automatically.&nbsp; I don't remember ever having a CD or DVD but if I did I long since lost it.&nbsp; That, absolutely, is my fault and I take full responsibility
 for that.&nbsp; But my objection stems from the fact that I took an action based on information received from Microsoft employees or representatives that removed a fully functional tool that I used on a daily basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; And afterward, there was really no accountability
 or an effort to correct the situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did call to register a complaint...and the representative was very nice and patient (at this point I had been on the phone with various representatives for the better part of 6 hours).&nbsp; He did provide a physical address for me to send a written complaint
 as he was unable to assist me unless/until I had a Visio 2013 product id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my advise to all potential Office 2016 installers.&nbsp; Be careful.&nbsp; Realize that you WILL lose access to your legacy product, despite assurances to the contrary by customer support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just boggles my mind.&nbsp; Visio is not included with Office 2016 or Office 365.&nbsp; Why should it remove previous Visio installations?&nbsp; They should have NOTHING at all to do with one another.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, if I want to include a Visio 2013 diagram in my Word 2016
 document, I could see a notice popping up to inform me that I would need to purchase Visio upgrade or something.&nbsp; But to just simply remove it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a stunning decision on Microsoft's part in my opinion.</p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Regarding the mobile Outlook, please help us confirm which mobile you are using.(Android / iPhone / iPad )</p>
<p>If you mean the Outlook Web App (OWA) on a mobile device, I'd like to share an article for you:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-Web-App-options-on-a-mobile-device-eea5e255-54ef-4319-ad9b-98764c925a03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App options on a mobile device</a></p>
<p>If you mean the Outlook for IOS or Outlook for Android, there is no document about the exact timeline of the feature release.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>Depending on how many users you have and if its feasible you may want to look at a third party provider such as Exclaimer. We use these guys and have many users with many different signatures - you can break it by company / dept / user. These get added to
 O365 email on the way out and from Mobile devices also in full HTML Format. </p>
<p>Might be worth a look.</p>

            <p>1 year later and still no timeline on HTML signatures for Outlook app for iOS. Your answer is to tell us to use the Outlook web app instead of the "full-featured" email app, huh? I hope all of you on the Outlook for iOS team are ashamed of yourselves. It's
 been years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HTML signatures do work, but you have to paste a chunk of HTML-formatted signature text. For anyone looking how to get an HTML signature on Outlook app on iOS, here's how. &nbsp;I tried it on iOS 10.3.2 and Outlook 2.25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old "shake-to-undo" trick that works for the native Mail app in IOS does not work. &nbsp;I almost fractured my wrist trying that with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Paste formatted signature in the left box of http://wordtohtml.net.&nbsp; You can compose your signature in Word.</p>
<p>2. Select any&nbsp; tags you want removed from the checkboxes below the left box and click on the “Cleanup my HTML” button.</p>
<p>3. Copy the html generated in the right window.</p>
<p>4. Send an email to yourself with the only the html signature in the body of your email.&nbsp; Remove any signatures that are already there.</p>
<p>5. Open the email in Outlook app on your iOS device.&nbsp; Copy the HTML signature.</p>
<p>6. Go to Settings (gear icon) in Outlook app and then to the signatures section.</p>
<p>7. Paste the HTML signature there.</p>
<p>8. Send test email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use any HTML editor to format your signature. &nbsp;My steps above are for those who do not have such tools.</p>
