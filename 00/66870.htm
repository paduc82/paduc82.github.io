<h2>            windows update won&#39;t save personal settings</h2>
                    <p>I was asked to install a windows update.&nbsp; Now windows will not remember any of my personal settings.&nbsp; Every time I start up the computer, the settings go back to default.&nbsp; The back ground goes back to the windows graphic.&nbsp; The taskbar does not retain the
 icons I pinned to it but returns them to the ones Microsoft installed.&nbsp; My default browser goes back to Edge.&nbsp; All my Chrome sign in information has to be reentered.&nbsp; Personal files are returned to where Windows thinks they belong and not where I place them.&nbsp;
 How do I make Windows remember my personal settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like a Feature Update was installed. This tends to happen when new versions of Windows 10 are installed. Its an issue that many users are not happy with. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there isn't a definitive. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

            Hi Peter, that update may have corrupted your Windows activation . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation
<br />
<br />Is Windows 10 showing as activated on that settings page?

<h3> chrisjohnryan  say:</h3>
<h2>            error message&#58; &#34;Windows cant add printer. The local print spooler service is not running. Please restart the spoiler or restart the machine&#34; </h2>
                    hello, <br />
having upgraded to windows 7 home premium 64 bit from vista home premium 64 bit, i expected to be able to plug my EPSON Stylus D68 printer into my laptop and have it installed straight away. however when i tried to do this installation constantly failed.&nbsp; I
 therefore went to the manual add printer option within the devices and printers menu. however i was met with this message error message: "Windows cant add printer. The local print spooler service is not running. Please restart the spoiler or restart the machine",
 after checking existing forums on the issue i attempted to restart it from the services option. however the option to restart was blanked out and when i simply tried to start i was then met with another error message: "windows could not start the spooler service
 on the on local computer, error 1053: the service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion". additionally when i click on properties for the spooler in the description it says failed to read description. error code:1813. This is
 all very frustrating for someone who simply wants to add a printer to his laptop. can someone please help? because i am all out of ideas.<br />
thanks in advance,<br />
Chris.

            <p><span>Hi,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are aware that a set of users are reporting a slow or seemingly-stuck upgrade experience when attempting to upgrade to Windows 10 or update between versions of Windows 10. The upgrade process usually takes 90 minutes or less to complete, but there
 is a very small subset of PCs, usually older or slower devices, where the upgrade process can take longer than typical. This situation is not related to a specific upgrade tool and has been shown to happen with Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant, Media Creation
 Tool, USB media, and ISO media.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In these cases, even if the progress percentage appears stuck, the upgrade is still running. An error message should be displayed in case of actual failure. Cancelling and trying alternate methods is unlikely to improve the experience and will reset
 any upgrade progress made.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recommend the user wait until the upgrade completes before taking further action. Users can keep working as normal while the upgrade is in progress. A delay of one day would be highly unusual, but we recommend that users wait that long for the upgrade
 complete or to confirm there is an issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>At that time, users should reach out to Microsoft Support or visit a Microsoft Store location so we can look into issues with the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Unable to uninstall or install Microsoft LifeCam Cinema - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianpalmerxbwh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to uninstall or install Microsoft LifeCam Cinema</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 Upgrade and then rolled back to Window 7 as my sound would not work. I now have a problem with my Microsoft LifeCam Cinema. The shortcut icon was no longer on my desktop, and I could not find the programme anywhere when
 I searched. I tried to reinstall in using the original disk only to be told that a newer version was already loaded and that I had to uninstall this first. I have tried everything to try to uninstall it using the methods shown on here including going into
 safe mode, but I still can't seem to get rid of whatever is left of this programme. I am really getting frustrated now as my Lifecam is my link to America where I am frequently online using Skype. I am thinking of just buying another non microsoft camera and
 starting from scratch. I am open to all suggestions before I buy the new camera. Please help as I feel that this is a Microsoft fault. Had I not upgraded to Windows 10 my camera would still be working.

            As a last resort you could search for all the bits and pieces and delete them&gt;Open C Drive&gt;in the search box at the top right hand side type: LifeCam&gt;this will bring up anything to do&nbsp;with LifeCam&gt;be very careful. Note any other words that may help in
 the search&gt;right click on one of the results and choose&gt;open file location&gt;then you can delete it bit by bit. PS: you may also need to use CCleaner to delete any left over registry&nbsp;keys. (PS I know what people say about registry cleaners but I have been using
 CCleaner for years with no problem, although I always take up the choice to backup changes. Never had to use the backup).&nbsp; It is up to you whether or not you take up this suggestion. I have used it before to get rid of&nbsp;un-wanted software&nbsp;with no problems.

            <p>Hi! Ron and thanks for the info. Unfortunately even this didn't work. I'm at a loss as to what to do now. Whenever I put the installation disk in I get this message" A later version of Lifecam software is already installed. To reinstall lifecam software,
 you must first uninstall the lifecam software from your computer". </p>
<p>My problem now is that I can't find any software on my PC. This is definitely a microsoft problem as it was working fine before I downloaded and then uninstalled Windows 10. I'm hoping that someone can help. I even thought that perhaps the installation disk
 might have had an uninstall programme, but nothing seems to work. This is really frustrating as I use my Webcam to link to the USA all the time and now it doesn't work!</p>

            Hi Daniel,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I have bad news for you, but Apple does not host older versions of Skype. The annoying reality is, you would need to get a newer iPad that can run Skype.

            I was doing some research on this. Years ago, the app store use the keep older versions, but it seems like they have ended that policy for the sake security.

<h2>            Laptop freezes on black screen</h2>
                    I have an Asus f555uj laptop which froze on me last night. I held down the start button til it went off which usually restarts, but it has only come back as a black screen. I have read other posts about restore discs etc but i have no way of doing that.
 The nearest computer shop is half hr away, please help.

            Thanks so much Patricia, however once I turn the laptop on, it actually doesn't go to the main screen, it's just black with a kind-of light behind it, nor is there any windows logo, the f keys don't seem to work either.

<p>When the PC fails to start several times, the system automatically brings up the
<strong>advanced startup options</strong> so you can start troubleshooting, but if that does not happen, you will need a recovery disc/system repair disc in order to bring up the advanced startup options. Computers that came pre-installed with Windows will
 usually have one, if there's none, you may create one by having an empty disc or USB and download the Windows 10 ISO
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. You may refer to the steps under
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the recovery media, connect the USB/insert the disc into your computer, and then restart. The PC will automatically boot from the recovery media. If it doesn't, you will have you change the PC's boot order in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have accessed the Advanced Startup Options, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>C</strong><strong>ommand Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Enter the following commands:<br />
<em><strong>bootrec /fixMBR</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>bootrec /fixBoot</strong></em><br />

<p>Thanks so much everyone, but I haven't no recovery disc, we've moved several times... plus there was no recovery option on startup, only blank screen. I did end up having to take my laptop to the computer shop &amp; pay $130 to get it fixed, apparently windows
 had fragments of startup all over the place &amp; was having trouble getting it together, so the guy managed to do a big clean up &amp; sort stuff out &amp; now it seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>Cheers for trying to help, will come back if I have any other issues.</p>

<p>It is not safe to have system without passwords. However, you may try the suggestions. And for any admin task from a non-admin account password is prompted by default. I would
 suggest you to remove the password, if you don’t want to prompt for password when you sign in after restarting the computer follow the steps in below to remove password:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button , clicking <b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>
User Accounts and Family Safety</b> (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking
<b>User Accounts</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>remove password</b> and click
<b>ok</b>.</p>

            Hi Cheri, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I'd recommend booting into Safe Mode to see if your mouse cursor works there. Here are instructions for booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also see if another mouse plugged into your PC will work, which can help narrow down the problem.
<br />
<br />Please let me know what happens, and I'll provide further steps for you!       
        </p>

            That's good that the external mouse works, since you'll be able to reinstall the touchpad drivers. Here are the steps to follow:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your touchpad in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go!

<h2>            801540A9 Strikes Again</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to configure my cloud so I could transfer copies of game data because I was going to get the Xbox one. &nbsp;Sadly, it all began with an error saying Xbox cloud isn't for everyone. I called up customer support and they said to go to system items and delete the cloud storage console copy. I told them there was no such item on my 360. They told me to delete just my profile and&nbsp;turn it off and on again. I did that then I was told to download the profile when a lovely error 801540A9 appeared and the signal to my phone was lost. I looked it up online and I've done everything but remove the hard drive. Please i just put $25 dollars on the account, it's been so frustrating</p>

<h2>            do we still need to update password for task scheduler in windows&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;would like to confirm if we still need to update passwords in task scheduler in case we change the password of a user account / service account? I tried it on a scheduled job running in a domain account and changed the password of the AD account.
 Still, the job ran successfully without updating the task scheduled job.&nbsp;

<p>hi christopher,</p>
<p>generally, to embed a video in sharepoint online, we can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. open the sharepoint site you want to embed a video, click <b>page</b> &gt; <b>
edit</b> in ribbon.</p>
<p>2. click <b>insert</b> &gt; <b>video and audio</b> &gt; <b>embed</b> as the following shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=54c3cc7c-f9b5-4f01-b34e-6e99cee21dfe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d54c3cc7c-f9b5-4f01-b34e-6e99cee21dfe" /></a></p>
<p>3. paste the code you copied from vimeo in the embed window, and click insert.</p>
<p>4. go to <strong>format text</strong> &gt; <strong>save</strong>.</p>
<p>5. then you can see the video in the sharepoint site as below shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0ac2bce2-41ab-462d-a8c0-cb3b49bcff81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0ac2bce2-41ab-462d-a8c0-cb3b49bcff81" /></a></p>
<p>if the above does not fits your situation, could you provide the following information to clarify the situation?</p>
<p>1. the detailed steps (including the screenshots and the buttons you have clicked during the process.) you performed to embed video in sharepoint online.</p>
<p>2. a screenshot regarding “fullscreen option is being deleted upon save”.</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, please click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select the
<b>insert/edit media</b> icon.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>spike</p>

<p>No screen shot is needed - he's provided the code that's left after the Msft text editor filters have stripped out anything they don't like. We've found the best option is to upload a raw mp4 file, use the SP embed tool which includes a player with a full
 screen option and wrap it in a container to ensure responsiveness. </p>

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>We can follow the steps Spike provided to embed a video on a SharePoint Online page, and we can full screen the video&nbsp;via the HTML5 player.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t meet your requirements, could you provide the information requested by Spike?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hey Spike! Thank you for your response. It is AN answer but not THE answer I'm looking for. That was the workaround we found. However we have over 1,000 videos varying from 0.5 – 6GB each. This solution is not efficient and (I have a feeling) it will slow
 down the loading of sites within our sharepoint. Copying and pasting an embed code without Sharepoint purposely deleting the code is the answer I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Due to the bi-annual version updates on Win10 old (and not so old) forum topics are more likely to mislead,</p>
<p>or prove inaccurate, than with pre Win10 Windows versions, because, yes they are removing a lot of customisation
</p>
<p>options with these updates. Each version update is leading more toward users having to do things the
</p>
<p>way Big Brother MS thinks best. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, you can lodge your complaint/request/suggestions through&nbsp; Feedback
</p>
<p>( <em>Make Windows Better</em> at the bottom of the<em> Display</em> options is one location).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 1703 update the only options are to use the method suggested by John Sarc. While this does not have
</p>
<p>a full bold option you can make text a little bit darker and bolder.</p>
<p>Also, while you can no longer increase only the text size, you can still make everything larger in&nbsp;
<em>Display&gt;Custom Scaling. </em></p>
<p>The only other option I am aware of atm is the <em>Magnifier</em> in <em>Ease of Access</em>. Again, you enlarge the whole screen,</p>
<p>not just the text.</p>
<p><em>.</em></p>

<p>Hi there is not much we can do about this issue....yea I know...you can only change the screen size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have it @125 or 135%</p>
<p>If you go into Control Panel'&nbsp; and 'Fonts'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can increase the thickness of the text a bit....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choose the bold and follow thru with the best version you feel you like.</p>

    <title>When making calls to conference lines it is often impossible to enter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack_mcfarland  say:</h3>
<h2>            When making calls to conference lines it is often impossible to enter the pass code.</h2>
                    After the conference number is entered and the call placed (no issues with this process) then once connected we are required to enter the pass code.&nbsp; When the numeric pad is brought up to enter the pass code and a number is selected with the mouse it often
 does not send a tone when clicked.&nbsp; Sometimes it does and sometimes it does not.&nbsp; So in a string of 7 numbers they don't all send and the code is not accepted.&nbsp; Is there a setting of some kind that would fix this issue? &nbsp;

How would he know? I check my email often. I can assure you that you cant run a business by checking your email once every 271 days.&nbsp; Now I can receive nor send emails.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now that we have cleared up this confusion about the account being inactive, how do we recover all and i do mean
<b>ALL</b>, of the missing emails and folders? Ive been reading post after post after post from people who are in my same situation. It would appear that Windows Live/ Hotmail has been "hacked" and we, the end users are being blamed for making a "critical PEBKAC"
 error. What are they doing to resolve this problem and HOW DO I GET MY EMAIL BACK?

            Hello <span>why did they dissapear</span>,<br />
<br />
We're very sorry for the inconvenience that this issue has caused you. Please be informed that
<span>
your <strong><span>messages</span></strong> will be lost or deleted when you do not access your account at least once for
<strong><span>120 consecutive days</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Free Windows Live Hotmail accounts</span></strong> become inactive if you don't sign in for more than<strong><span> 270 days</span></strong> or within the
<strong><span>first 10 days after signing up</span></strong> for an account. After an account becomes inactive, all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent back to the sender as undeliverable.
 Your account name is still reserved. However, if the account stays inactive for an additional 90 days, the account name may be permanently deleted. If you don't use your Windows Live ID for 365 days, your Windows Live ID may be permanently deleted.</span><br />
<br />
Also, I investigated the bounced message that you've provided and it seems&nbsp;that there's a DNS error. For further investigation, please try to send a test email using your Hotmail account to see the exact error code or error message.<br />
<br />
Again, we're sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks!<br />

    <title>Cortana uses my computer&#39;s memory, even though it&#39;s turned - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana uses my computer&#39;s memory, even though it&#39;s turned off. Why&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I turn on my laptop computer, (every time) it halts and starts and halts and starts. This makes typing an email or office document extremely irritating. I know that my "problem" is Cortana. I have turned off this application, but, when I run the
 task manager, I see that Cortana is actively using my computer's resources - sometimes using 85% of the memory. I then tell task manager to end that task. It does, but in 10 seconds, here comes Cortana again, using more memory. I end task again and it pops
 up again. It usually takes 4 or 5 trys to actually get it to stop. </p>
<p>How can I get this dang app to STOP?</p>
