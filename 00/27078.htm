<h2>            All Office apps look &#34;old&#34; after Update</h2>
                    <p>After an update (to Insider build 17120) all my office apps look and feel old and make poor use of space.</p>
<p>Here is word as an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a0aabe6-7f67-4b90-8df7-a871f7c6caa7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a0aabe6-7f67-4b90-8df7-a871f7c6caa7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>(regular at the bottom, weird new at the top)</p>
<p>Does anybody have a fix for this? Scaling of the loading window seems off as well, but that´s not an issue - it may be an indicator for the problem!</p>
<p>In general, the UI is larger and wastes space</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            Looks like another "improvement" from MS. 
<br />
<br />Improving it for 7" smartphone touchscreens, ruining it for those of us with 42" 4K monitors.
<br />
<br />Other than doing the "retrograde upgrade" workaround that Neftali suggested (that is only temporary) I don't think there is any user option to "fix" it. You are eventually going to have to implement the newest version, and the problem will be back.  
<br />
<br />Frankly, I don't expect MS to fix it.  Back more than a year ago, MS "improved" the buttons on the QAT the same way, made them "spaced out" / "phat!". People screamed about it, so after a long time, MS backed down a little, but not all the way back to what it was originally. 
<br />
<br />MS has a corporate "vision" (blind in one eye and severly myopic in the other ... &lt;grin&gt; ) that focuses on:
<br />.  *  "cloud" computing" (OneDrive)
<br />.  *  "Software As A Service", SaaS ( 365 pay-forever "danegeld" subscriptions
<br />.  *  write code once, run everywhere - Smartphone to SuperComputer, Windows/Linux/Mac etc ...
<br />
<br />These things are great fro MS's bottom line, but they require "compromises" that almost always take away existing functionality to allow for the "lowest common denominator" to rule.
<br />
<br />You should report this to MS using the "Feedback" process. Designate it as a bug an include the screen cap you provided (just copy, and enhance upon, your original posting here). And post a link to it back here so other "satisfied MS customers" can vote to support it and add their comments too.

<p><strong>There is no problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you noted, build 16176 is an <strong>evaluation</strong> copy.&nbsp; All <strong>
evaluation</strong> copies of Windows 10 have had expiration dates since the beginning of the Insider program.&nbsp; The only thing that activation means is that your copy will run.&nbsp; Builds expire in part as a reason for beta testers to keep their software up to
 date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is, keep your Insider copy up to date, or when the expiration date passes your computer will no longer boot.&nbsp; If that's not to your liking, the only thing you can do at this point is a clean install of the public build that just went out.&nbsp; You
 will lose everything on your system in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Seriously, do people even read the warning labels on Insider builds anymore?)</p>

            We do read it. <br />
But let me inform you about "us" :&nbsp; Version installed is 16176. One version after that messed seriously witj usage. Mouse had no right click. I was advised by MS then to revert to the previous version that worked. Which is 16176. (.rs_prerelease 170410- 1642)
 . <br />
This one now threw a notice to me that it will expire.<br />
So I do what clever people like you say i should know and what I do know - I check for a new update to install.<br />
But guess what? There IS NO new update. <br />
Hence the question..... <br />
Are you a bit more informed about us stupid people now? <br />
Thank you <br />

            We've had 2 Insider builds since 16176 - 16179 &amp; 16184. Which one did you try and install unsuccessfully? When you roll back a flag is set so as not to try the failed build again, but rather wait for the next one. If you rolled back from 16179, 16184 should
 be offered now.

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Dunno if you got the e-mail that I answered on after this reaction from you was emailed to me.<br />
If also says this:&nbsp; The one I went back from must have been the one just after 16176&nbsp; 170410- 1642 because it (in the referred to period here) was only an install and a revert back in a days time.<br />
Anyway, when i want to roll back now I get an notice that I cannot go back anywhere - the files that enables that was removed.<br />
What may be a complication is that just after I saw that the update took my right click away, I reset the insider setting from fast to slow.<br />
I just reset it to fast in the hope I will then actually get an update and that it will be one that skips the one that was a bad one from me.</p>

<p>I just saw this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, drop the attitude.&nbsp; No one called anybody "stupid" except for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, Insiders are supposed to know their way around things, and you're also expected to keep up with changes to the program.&nbsp;
<strong>The change from a 30-day rollback grace period to 10 days was announced multiple times.</strong>&nbsp; If you missed that, when by now you should have known that for a while, then that's just too bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, rolling back isn't the only option.&nbsp; If Windows doesn't find an update, you can always run the Update troubleshooter (which does help sometimes), or you can also download an ISO of the next build (if available).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, I am a bit more informed about you--the things you could've done which you obviously didn't do before you came here and started complaining.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 won&#39;t import or export mail or contacts after windows update</h2>
                    <p>Been looking all over the internet for this but I cannot find the same problem.&nbsp; About half a year ago after one of the larger Windows updates, I lost the ability to export mail or import contacts using the import/export function.&nbsp; The options are there,
 but clicking on them does nothing.&nbsp; Other functions listed under 'advanced' like 'Import rss feeds' seem to work, these two that I need do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the problem that many have that the option is greyed out due to language selections, etc.&nbsp; In my case, the functions look available but just don't do anything when clicked.</p>

<h3> jollyworker  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office 365 Web Versions vs Office 2016 Desktop Versions</h2>
                    <p>Greetings All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any comprehensive breakdown of what features are missing between Office 365 Web Apps and Office 2016 Desktop Apps? I am considering the switch to Office 365 Business Essentials for the company I work for but I need to understand the complete difference
 in what is and what is not possible in the Online App that is possible in Office 2016 Desktop App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been provided several feature lists of the online web version of Outlook, Excel and Word but they do not explain what is missing from the desktop version. I am not familiar with every single feature in the software and I would like to see a side by
 side comparison of the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
Colin</p>

</p><p>In my opinion, for the regular power user, it is still required to use MS-Office on a desktop. The online apps have less features, and beyond that these are also a matter of concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Performance</p>
<p>2. Off-line access, what happens when the internet line is bad or down</p>

            Hi Foster,
<br />You will need to create folders for each address then create a rule for each address that looks for the email address in the message header and move it to that folder.

            Dear FosterCooper,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Although you are using different aliases, this is the same Microsoft Account, that is why all messages are going to the inbox. If you want to have separate folders, you can create those folders for each alias and create rules that will move incoming emails to the specific folder <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/use-in...</a>

<h2>            N70 Memory card</h2>
                    Hi Everybody!,<br />
My friend has an N70 and he wants to buy a bigger memory card for it, But he doesn't know which type, and neither do i.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me what the difference between the dual voltage thingy and normal and whether it will support it.<br />
<br />
Oh, I've forgot the name of the card aswell i think it's a dvr mmc or something if someone could kindly tell me what the name of the type is.<br />
<br />
Thank you :)

                    <span>Hello<br />
                    <span>Hello<br />
I have a jornada 568 (so ppc2002) with a Vista laptop.<br />
I just learn that ActiveSync is not anymore maintain and that we should now use mobile device center which does not handle ppc2002.<br />
But it is write in the user documentation :<br />
</span><span>"Connect over USB and serial, use desktop pass-through using the PC’s internet connection, and file browse."<br />
By this I understand that we should be able to continue having access to internet using PC connection.<br />
<br />
Is anyone has succeed to surf on internet using suc a config (ppc2002 and Vista) and if yes is there anything special to do, because on my side I didn't succeed.<br />
<br />
Thanks advance<br />
Regards<br />
Antoine<br />

<p>I have not tried this so it is only a guess but the Internet pass through works in conjunction with WMDC so if I were to guess, your 2002 device is not going to work since it is not supported under WMDC.</p>

<br />
<br />
I mean today, from Vista, I see my pda file under the explorer.<br />
So what is the meaning of "pass-through using PC's internet connection" ?<br />
I was expecting that I can still browse using pocket IE<br />
<br />

            Hi,
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You are right. WMDC will not let you sync your WM2002 device, but you should be able to browse and use Desktop passthrough to access the internet.</span></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For the moment I still not succeed to connect my pda (to go on internet)</p>
<p>I have used Regedit to create the new word.</p>
<p>But I'm still not able to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that you use "connect without setting up your device", where did you select it ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Under the PDA, if yes, where this menu is located</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Under Vista ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Under the Mobile device center, if yes which version are you using ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have find only one menu concerning Connection and there is nothing about "connect without setting up your device"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Kindly</p>

<p>I would agree Linley that you can do that with devices later than 2002.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I believe that if you tried it with&nbsp;a 2002&nbsp;device you would not be able to get to that screen with the option of connect to setup a partnership or connect without.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an older device here with me but unfortunately do not have the cable (an old iPAQ).&nbsp; I'll try to remember to check it when I get back home.</p>

<p>When you connect a device and the pC recognizes the device and loads the appropriate drivers, WMDC will open and yu wil have the choice to setup a partnership OR connect without setting up the device.&nbsp; My belief is that since you have a 2002
 device that you will NOT get that opening screen so you will not be able to pick that option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will test it when I get home since I do not have the correct cable where I am now ( I have an old iPAQ here that I use to play games).</p>

<h2>            Word automatically sets font to italics</h2>
                    <p>original title: Italics!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime I open a document in Word, everything automatically changes into italics, it seems the Font Style for the normal formats are in italics and only the titles in normal text.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>You don't even have the option to change the normal font styles back into &nbsp;a regular style with the italics, its very annoying changing everything back into regular style text! :(</div>
<div>And also, everytime I start a new paragraph/line, it automatically goes to italics! Arrgghh so annoying!</div>

            <p>You need to modify the font for the Normal style. How you do this may depend on the version of Word you have, so please edit your question to change the "Applies to" to the correct version of Office.<br />
<br />
The easiest way in all versions, however, is to press Ctrl+D to open the Font dialog, change the font to the desired one, and click Default or Set As Default in the bottom left corner. You'll get a subsequent dialog asking (depending on version) whether you
 want to update the Normal template or whether you want this to be the default font for just this document or all new documents.</p>

                    I have windows lumia 820 phone. Yesterday I installed windows phone 8.1 preview. But to my surprise I have not received Cortana update. I leave in India. I want to mentioned one thing is that, speech recognition service is started after long press of search
 button. But I am sure it is not cortana. Also there is no cortana app or button available to pin it on start screen. What to do?<br />

            <p>Hello tejaskulkarni,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cortana is only available in the states at the moment. However, Cortana is available to you through the back door.</p>
<p>Firstly, go into setting and change your language etc to United States..</p>
<p>Once you have changed these settings your phone should ask you that an "update is required"</p>
<p>This basically means that the new region and language on your phone has been downloaded and the phone needs to restart. The process usually takes around 5 minutes...</p>
<p>Once done, Cortana is available to you; however, features are limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>
<p>Windows phone user </p>

                    <p>Has anyone else seen this issue with the new Insider release Build 16232.rs_prerelease.170624-1334?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Plex media server starts and works just fine but after a while (a day or two) it just stops and gives me a "cannot contact server" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the icon in my system tray but when I click on it the icon disappears and I have to restart it and everything is fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I travel every week and watch my home server from my hotel room (via FireTV) and am not home to constantly restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have installed the latest release of Plex Media Server 1.7.5.4035-313f93718</p>

                    <p>I'm trying to get Skype for Business to run on my iPad so that I can use **** more easily until it is released for MacBooks. I have it running on my iPhone (6S) but for whatever reason when I try to sign in **** is stuck in : "Skype for Business is signing
 in" and the loading animation just circles and circles, with the cancel sign-in button. Plus everyone once in a while a screen bumps up with cancel, but then it disappears super fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the same authentication I would use on a pc, or my iPhone. Also what's the deal with having a category called Mobile Devices and only having MS related devices in the Devices dropdown? HORRIBLE User Experience!</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6300</h2>
                    
<p>Good evening everybody. In the first place i would like to announce that im the most dissapointed human living someone about Nokia. Had my Nokia 6300 for over 6 years. At time my little phone startet to be slow and like depressed so i tought that i will
 do a software update. So i downloaded Nokia Suite and followed the instructions. Well it started to install, it sad that 15 mins are remaining. It sad this for like 6 hours and in 6 hours it gave me an error. Now my phone doesnt want to start or even to beep
 or even to make a small light beep with those little blue lights. Im really really angry and dissapointed. Why do Nokia upload a software that is not even working correctly? Like I can throw my phone in the junk now cause i tryed to do anything which i could
 find on the internet. What can i do now? Should i go to report or?&nbsp;</p>

            try removing the battery for 5 minutes, reinsert it and see if the device will start.<br />
if not, the phone must be sent to a Nokia Care centre for repair.<br />
<br />
i should inform you that i had that phone for about two years, the software update procedure never bricked my phone.<br />
it's just an unfortunate moment.

<h2>            How do I add someone to the safe senders list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Online instructions say to open an email from sender you want to add to the safe senders list, and to then click on the "Home" tab.&nbsp; I don't even see a "Home" tab in Outlook.&nbsp; I'm also not sure which version of Outlook Hotmail converted to, 2010 or 2013.&nbsp;
 Help! </p>
