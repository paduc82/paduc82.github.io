<h2>            Problem with adding attachments in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 with Outlook 2016.&nbsp; When I click on Browse PC to add an attachment, the system freezes and I have to End Task.&nbsp; Also, when I try to save an attachment that I received, I also cannot get to my PC file window.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this
 problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been adding files this way for years, until Outlook 2016.&nbsp; (Note that I can drag and drop, but Browse PC should work.)&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Leslie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome and thank you for post your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Mention the type of email account configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or Exchange Server Account)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following steps and check if it helps. Start Outlook in safe mode following&nbsp;steps mentioned below and then try sending emails:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: There is space between Outlook and /.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works&nbsp;in&nbsp;safe&nbsp;mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please post to us if you need any further information with Office.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Why do you use a registry cleaner. You don't need one or did you use<br />
it to repair your permissions?<br />

            <p>Xbox Live is not available in the countries that you have mentioned. Which means, you may not be able to sign in to Xbox.com. These errors could be because of that.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are or where you got the download or what you've done, so if the above didn't help, let's just start from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE which we are testing). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate,
 or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we don't know how much of what installed is good or possibly corrupted (or what that malware may have done even if it was removed), we need to first uninstall and then re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>&nbsp;or
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a>.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Given you said you had problems with uninstalling, pay particular attention to the manual methods here if it still doesn't work and be sure
 to follow the steps exactly and precisely in order and that should do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem.

            How did you "install" Office?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
There are a couple of possible problems and solutions.&nbsp; One is where a trial version of office (often factory installed) interferes with the activation of a purchased and installed by the user copy of Office.
<br />
<br />
So, did you buy a download or CD version and actually install it on your computer?&nbsp; If you did, use the following tip to as a guide to Programs and Features, check to see if you have a free trial installed. It will probably be called "Office 2010 Single Image",
 but not just "Microsoft Office 2010" (that is something else, don't uninstall it). If you do have a trial, follow the instructions to uninstall it.&nbsp; After you uninstall, Repair the 2010 version you installed. Then activate the installed copy one more time.<br />

</span>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The other possible problem is that Windows is not giving you the required "Windows Access Rights" to save the activation information in the Windows Registry.&nbsp;

<p><span>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</span></p>
<p>In Windows 7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</p>
<p>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</p>
<p>The general process is :</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close all of the office apps</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start one of the Office apps using any one of the following “run as admin” techniques</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Activate office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close the app</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start it normally, confirm the message has “gone away”</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the message is gone, reboot the computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start the office app again to confirm that the message really is gone for good (was saved in the registry)</p>
<p><b>What you need to do is "runas admin":</b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the start menu and find the program icon you want to start</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;Shift&gt; &lt;Right Click&gt; on it</li><li>Select “Run as …”</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>If that doesn’t work try this: </b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the start menu, right click on the shortcut for any Office app, select “RunAs Admin”<br />
If runas does not appear, right click and drag the shortcut to the desktop </p>
<ul>
<li>create a shortcut on the desktop. </li><li>Right click on the desktop shortcut,</li><li>&nbsp;runas admin should be there.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Activate the application/office: </b>

One way...</p>
<p>If you can download and install the free add-in Morefunc.xll from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.download.com/Morefunc/3000-2077_4-10423159.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.download.com/Morefunc/3000-2077_4-10423159.html</a></p>
<p>Then, you can use this array formula** entered on Sheet1 in cell B1:</p>
<p>=SUBSTITUTE(MCONCAT(IF(Sheet2!A1:A9=A1,", "&amp;Sheet2!B1:B9,"")),", ","",1)</p>
<p>** array formulas need to be entered using the key combination of CTRL,SHIFT,ENTER (not just ENTER). Hold down both the CTRL key and the SHIFT key then hit ENTER.</p>
<p>Copy down as needed</p>
<p>Note that the concatenated string is limited to no more than 255 characters.</p>

<h2>            Preview pane slows Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a few cases in users end machines (running Win 7 64bit and Office Pro 2010 32 bit) that when enablng Preview pane, Outlook becomes slow. each change of email can take up to 10secs. When turning it off, all good.</p>
<p>The only (bad) solution is to rebuilt the machine (OS and Office)</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance</p>

Thank you for replying. <br />
<br />
Let's try the following methods and verify the result:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
Start Outlook in safe mode following steps mentioned below and check if you're able to&nbsp;configure automatic accept/decline meeting request feature.
<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>Outlook /safe </strong><br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between Outlook and '/'<br />
<br />
If Outlook works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong><strong><br />
</strong><br />
If issue still persists, create a new profile and check if it works as expected.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile:<br />

            <p>dear </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have configured 2 email accounts within outlook 2013/office 2013 ( Office 2013 is locally installed on my new PC):</p>
<p>- 1 IMAP account</p>
<p>- 1 account based on EAS (exchange active service)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I have done this is that EAS/IMAP does not support....(all functions below were although possible in outlook 2010...;(( )</p>
<p>a) moving of email from different email account to outlook email. (example moving yahoo-mail to outlook folder). -&gt; not possible with EAS outlook, so i had to set up an EAS account and an IMAP account for the same email-address...</p>
<p>b) flagging mails with a date to follow up not possible any more.... -&gt; not possible with IMAP/EAS-outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 functions I heavily used ..so I am not amused with the so called improvement of 2013.
</p>
<p>Moving towards EAS sure is more accurate and there are propably numerous (programming) reasons why this is done. But I do not understand. To me&nbsp;, &nbsp;it is very strange that an upgrade to a higher version of office from 2010 to 2013 &nbsp;REDUCES the numbers of
 functionalities.</p>

            I am having the same issue. &nbsp;All 3 automatic accept/reject options are grayed out and not functional. I also am using windows 8.1/office 2013. &nbsp; It would seem as though one of the add-ins needs to be added, or was there advanced installation option to
 activate this functionality? &nbsp;to have to remove the add-ins one at a time and restart is not an efficient troubleshooting options. &nbsp;What add-ins if any are the likely cause? &nbsp;The add-ins I have active are: &nbsp;lync meeting, macafee, MS Sharepoint, MS VBA. Please

<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t display as HTML</h2>
                    Since Outlook 2016 updated last night (currently version 1906), e-mails display only as plain text and not as html.&nbsp; This is true for both new e-mails and old ones that previously displayed correctly.&nbsp; I have checked every Outlook setting that relates
 to html and plain text and they are all correct.&nbsp; How do I fix this or get back to a workable version of Outlook?

            Hi DCC,
<br />This is a "known issue" and microsoft is investigating. It apparently only affects POP accounts. You can roll back to an older version. 
<br />

When I open Word for Mac 2011, it opens only as half a screen. I want it to open as a full screen, and there is NO OPEN FOR FULL SCREEN BUTTON ANYWHERE. It is never a choice as far as I can see in any pull down list. &nbsp;I'm not interested in read or write mode.
 I want the whole program to open bigger. &nbsp;It seems I should be able to do with as a normal option without doing updates to other versions -- I didn't want to upgrade to Lion or whatever that was recently -- I heard there were glitches in that....Help?

            You can force the window's size of any document (window sizes are determined by the last window-resizing, within certain minimum values), but not its zoom level, as this is saved in each document. For further clarification, see my October 14th post

            There is no 'setting' to dictate the opening size of a document window.<br />
<br />
The window size is determined by what size the window was when changes were last made, saved &amp; closed. In order to do otherwise it would be necessary to use a macro or Apple Script. Here's one option:<br />

In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of

You will need to re-start Word after installing the add-in.</span></p>

The add-in contains code that will replace the faulty "Update Labels" utility.</span></p>

 can still send us new feedback."&nbsp; (<a href="https://twitter.com/rhrmn/status/616348035308744704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">see screenshot</a>) I have been in the Windows Insider program since it began and have never before seen this error.&nbsp; Is there something wrong
 with the Windows Feedback app on my PC?&nbsp; Is Microsoft working on an issue related to the Windows Feedback app which is preventing me from searching feedback and upvoting feedback?&nbsp; Any help from Microsoft would be appreciated.

<p>Outlook for Mac differs from Outlook for Windows, and the schedule view is not a feature in Outlook for Mac. I suggest you to vote via this link for feedback:

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac - can&#39;t uncheck &#34;highlight the regions I can edit&#34; of a document prepared on Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.3</p>
<p>My word version is 16.12 (I upgraded today - version 180410)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of my work I get documents prepared in a Windows environment, which I need to edit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions I get say to do the following:</p>
<p><span>Press "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 204, 1)">Review</span><span>"</span><span>
 → </span><span>"</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 204, 1)">Restrict Editing</span><span>"
</span><span>→ </span><span>Uncheck "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 204, 1)">Highlight the regions I can edit</span><span>"</span></p>
<p>However, I can't find "Restrict Editing" on the review menu, so I can't uncheck "highlight the regions I can edit" button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I somehow get back this menu item? Or is there another way to achieve this on my mac?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I do not know that there is such a command available on the Mac. I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.
<br />
<br />Many people like this because they can see where they can type. The shading does not print or show up in converted pdfs. 
<br />
<br />I guess you could ask the person who created it to turn that off if you want.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>Thanks, but actually I really do want to get rid of the highlighting, it is quite annoying to me. Its a new thing that started after I ran the last update of word. I think it happened in the upgrade from 15 to 16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further answers from someone familiar with mac will be greatly appreciated</p>

            Some users have reported problems with version 16.9 and higher of Office. Office for the Mac has undergone dramatic changes in Office 2016/365. Developers are trying hard to make the Mac and Windows versions have the same or equivalent features. They are making real progress. However, fixing one thing sometimes breaks others.
<br />
<br />You can use the User Feedback feature to let them know if they've broken something. There may be a fix coming soon. I’d suggest checking for updates - it may take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />Here is the link about progress on Word:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac-mso_mac2016/word-for-mac-2016-wont-open/828eb03c-ce40-4839-a601-cce785db2004">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I suggest using a previous version or update until it is fixed.
<br />
<br />To do that, you’ll need to uninstall the current version, download the old version, and install it.
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:

            I am sorry that you found this less than helpful. All I can do is tell you what I know and try to give you resources. I know that an answer from someone who currently is using a Mac would be more satisfying. i cannot force someone else to respond, nor do I know that they would tell you anything different. I do know that more than ten others have reviewed this answer and felt it was the best that anyone could tell you.

<h2>            Access code for creating a hotmail account in outlook.</h2>
                    <p>I have a friend, Yon Kane;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to help him set up a hotmail account. &nbsp;We get to the bottom of the set up page, and it asks for an access code. &nbsp;I assume outlook is sending this code to his phone, because every time i try to submit the account, it says it needs an access
 code, and a new message appears on his phone messages. &nbsp;It gives a couple of numbers, then sounds like it says "switch", then a couple of more numbers, then "hyphen" or something, then more numbers. &nbsp;I have no idea what keyboard symbol equals "switch". &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Can i enter my email as alternate email address and have the access code sent to mine?</p>
<p>Why in **** do they make it nearly impossible to get an email account????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the "picture" with the numbers and letters you're supposed to re type in the box - nearly impossible to tell if they're upper case or lower case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>there has never existed a "youtube app" (ie an official one) as google refuses to make one and also refuses to have Microsoft make one for them (believe me, they did make one and google forced Microsoft to remove it).</p>
<p>there are loads of third party apps that are probably much better than anything that google would ever make for windows phones.</p>

 think I may have disconnected the device prematurely as I misread the statement to disconnect and reconnect power as disconnect and reconnect device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device seems to be connecting properly to the display dock. But no video. I assume that I can somehow do a manual firmware update on this item. There is just really no information related to this on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>UPDATE**</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went out and bought another Display Dock. The issue is the same with this one. Monitor(s) do not recognize the phone. I have tried hooking it up in various ways. PC recognizes the device fine when I plug it in. Display Dock recognizes the device, light
 goes white, but monitor does not. I have reset the phone with the desktop app and have just reset the phone by itself each multiple times today. No progress. I may be forced to give up on this. What a shame.</p>

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/42278f3d-9ec3-4a3b-89f0-db3125831e07" title="Joshua Spooner">
Joshua Spooner</a>. Did you reset your phone by following the steps here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA141447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA141447</a>? Since the issue happened after installing an update, you may try recovering your phone's software by using the Windows Device Recovery Tool. See here how:

            <p>Hey Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why you recommend a device (phone) reset when the problem is with the display dock?&nbsp; The update that affected the display device was a Microsoft Dock firmware update, why would the phone need to be reset?&nbsp; Is it because a new display dock would
 also not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not saying your advice is wrong, but why would a firmware update to a peripheral cause problems with the phone?&nbsp; I ask because I'm running developer preview (slow ring) on my 950XL and my display dock isn't working.

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you resolve this anomaly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just plugged my Lumia 950 XL into my HD-500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It functioned fine previously; this time it on-screen identifies a problem. I thought I would look for an update for either the HD-500 and/or 950 XL. (I came across your challenge during my search).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read during my search to use the "Gadgets" App to find updates. Did this. It never did anything noticeable. I see no associated Version number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the primary screen displays a corner-marked screen instructing me to move a non-obvious cursor around and what to do with two fingers. Otherwise non-responsive on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In essence, not functioning as before. No idea really how to update Gadgets (not for my Device?!?!), how to update HD-500, how to update Continuum, etc. No functional, straight forward, accurate update instructions specific to the HD-500 found in the likely,
 common Customer access locations on the Microsoft web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering Microsoft's recent declaration it will no longer support Windows 10 mobile, my epiphany is I no longer trust Microsoft as it has lost it's integrity in my opinion. Not sure if this now coincidentally&nbsp; impacts the HD-500 by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that point, I thought perhaps you might have some helpful knowledge you might feel fine sharing with me. If so, I sincerely appreciate if you choose to assist me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(zero technically competent knowledgeable responses or assistance for far too long from Microsoft non-'Tech Support', sorry to say)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much. Enjoy your day. Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robert Findler&nbsp;</p>

<p>And does this dock work with the Surface Go USB-C? Because as far as i have been able to check most of Continuum Lumia 950 functions work identically in the Surface Go, including the wireless Miracast-style and the direct cable connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if someone knows, I would be specially interesting about whether the HDMI connection work.</p>

            I to wished to use this with Samsung dex, but have just discovered that you cant update the firmware without the phone. I have tried plugging this in to my surface pro but cannot update it either this way I am using a Samsung s9+ and am so disappointed.

<p>My HD500 never worked, not even once. My 950XL started to malfunction so I switched to a Samsung Note 8.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Rob Independent Advisor, I am here to help you to solve your issue.
<br />Thank you for contacting the community It is a pleasure for us to help you out.
<br />-
<br />What’s happen if you user search box(Cortana).
<br />Try Search parameter filename:* followed by any special character searches for that character in file names. For example searching for filename:*&amp; finds all files with an ampersand (&amp;) in filename, search filename:*_ finds all files with an underscore in file name, search filename:*, finds all files with a comma in file name.
<br />-
<br />I hope this helps, 
<br />Please let me know if you have further questions.
<br />Remember, your feedback will be very welcome.
<br />Regards,

<h2>            Excel file  grown from 3 to 31mb</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I have an excel file that was once a manageable 3mb which has grown to 31mb, slowing down the opening &amp; saving procedure to an intolerable level.</p>
<p>I can think of no reason why this has happened, unless I have inadvertently copied formats to an entire sheet by mistake. Is there any way to isolate a sheet that may be abnormally large due to this happening.
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Select all of the columns to the right of the data and then select&nbsp;Clear (In the Editing block far&nbsp;right of Home ribbon) then select Clear All. Don't just right click and select clear; need to Clear All. Also don't use Delete columns because this does not
 necessarily clear everything; particularly formatting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Select all of the rows below your data&nbsp;and repeat the clear all as above and then save the document.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tip: To select all columns to right of data click on&nbsp;a column Id to the right of your data and the hold Ctrl and Shift keys and press right arrow. To select all rows below data click on a row below your data and hold the Ctrl and Shift keys and press down
 arrow.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the above does not work then select all of the actual data on each of your worksheets and copy and paste to a new workbook. Do not use worksheet copy&nbsp;like when you right click the worksheet tab name and select Move or Copy because this will simply copy

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to access the Options screen due to the missing more mail settings on your Internet Explorer 10 browser. I'll do my best to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For starters, I need you to make sure </span>
<span><font color="#000000">that your browser is free from any cluttered temporary internet files that may have caused the error to occur. To do this,
</font></span></font><span><font><font color="#000000">press <b>CTRL </b>+ <b>Shift
</b>+ <b>Del </b>and then delete the <strong>Browsing histories</strong>, <strong>
Cookies</strong>, <strong>Temporary internet files</strong> and <strong>Download history</strong>.<strong>
</strong></font></font></span><span><font color="#000000"><font>If you’re on IE10 app/tile on a Windows 8 computer, hover your mouse to the right side of the screen to display the Charm bar and then click Settings. Select
<b>Internet Options</b> and then click <b>Delete</b> under <b>Delete browsing History</b>.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the optimization did not work, we need additional details to determine the possible cause of your issue. Please answer the following:</p>
<span>
<ul>
<li>Does the same issue happen when you access the account on other computers or other browsers?</li><li>Does the same issue happen to other accounts when accessed on the computer you initially had this issue with</li></ul>
</span>
<p>Aside from the questions above, please give us a screenshot of what your Outlook.com page with the Gear icon's dropdown options displayed. I created a private message tab where I posted instructions on how you can capture and upload the screenshot.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For now, if you want to access the Options screen of your Microsoft account, go to your
<strong>Junk</strong> folder, scroll down the page and click the link for <strong>
Blocked senders list</strong> there. Once redirected to the Blocked senders list page, click the
<strong>Options</strong> button or link on the blocked senders list&nbsp;path shown on top of the page.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your cooperation and prompt reply will be highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank You.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Click on the cog wheel. Click on "Options." Find the category Preventing junk email, and click on the "Safe and Blocked Senders" choice. On the screen that comes up next you can choose which list you would like to examine.

            on gear cog there is an "options" click on that and it will bring you to page where you can see blocked email option. That clear cache suggestion was nonsense...robots with robotic answers

            So what happened to the Blocked Senders List during the latest upgrade to the MSN Premium software? We depended on this tool. What gives Microsoft?

            <p>Windows 10, MSN. </p>
<p>I still can't find my Blocked Senders list to change it.</p>
<p>"Gear / cog / wheel <strong>top right hand side"</strong> </p>
<p>There is no gear wheel up at the top right on my mail page. I simply can't find one; what actual page in MSN is it on?</p>
<p>Where is the "More mail settings"? Is this reply for a previous version of Windows that actually&nbsp;had a gear wheel?</p>
<p />
