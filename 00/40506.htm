            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 there is a &nbsp;mode that makes your default printer the last printer you used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you try turning &nbsp;<strong>let Windows manage your default printer</strong> off and check if you are still facing the issue. &nbsp;To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<p><span><strong>1.</strong></span> Open&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> and click/tap on the
<strong>Devices</strong> icon.<br />
<span><strong>2.</strong></span> Click/tap on <strong>Printers &amp; scanners</strong> on the left side, and turn off
<strong>Let Windows manage my default printer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Acer PC won&#39;t boot from USB</h2>
                    <p>I attempted to install another operating system onto another partition on my second PC. I've done all the steps correctly, after asking a question from another post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit F12 and chose to boot from USB, it just showed a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead to disable secure boot, but the option wasn't there. It wasn't anywhere. I noticed at the top it stated the BIOS was called "CMOS Setup Utility - Copyright (C) 1985-2010". It wasn't the same as the other devices I've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also changed the boot configuration, to boot from USB first. That also didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought the USB drive wasn't configured properly (it happened before on another PC). I reinstalled the ISO file into the USB using Rufus and ejected it properly. Still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions to this problem? Or will I not be able to add another operating system? Is there a way to secure boot anyway?</p>

<h2>            Very distorted sound from Bluetooth headset on windows 10.</h2>
                    Hello, I have an issue with my computer that i cannot figure out how to fix. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones I use to listen to music from my laptop. For a long while after purchasing them they have worked perfectly on my devices. (two cell phones,
 tablet, and laptop). While they still work perfectly on all other devices, they have had an issue lately on my laptop. when connected and listening to music they will be working fine, but then i either may click a different song manually or it may just goto
 a new song after the current one ends and upon switching song the sound becomes very distorted, crackley and terrible sounding. sort of like a blown speaker would sound is all i can think of to properly describe it. when it happens, if i hit pause wait maybe
 3-5 seconds then unpause it will be playing clear again, until it randomly decides to mess up again. Mind you, my galaxy s8 and note 9 connect and play music perfectly for hours with no problem. it is only my laptop that has a pr

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps.
<br />1. Move away from other sources of wireless signal - you could be experiencing interference.
<br />2. Keep less distance between source and speaker
<br />3. Check if any other signal source nearby such as mobile phone or other bluetooth device which causes noise. 
<br />4. Try addressing these issues and it may work just fine. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>I am having the EXACT same problem. It started happening RIGHT after I upgraded to version 1809. I've tried all the same tired suggestions about reinstalling drivers and running the troubleshooter, disabling Enhancements etc and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My speakers are fine but when I use my Bluetooth headphones I have the issue. I can be watching a YouTube video and if I skip ahead (or back) the sound gets totally distorted. I can only recover by stopping the video, waiting about 5 secs and starting it
 again. Same with music. It will play fine until I click on the next song and whamo, distortion. Hello MS, it's version 1809! It was all fine with 1803. Help us!</p>

            Yes! I as well have done all the suggested troubleshooting, driver update searches, uninstall and reinstall drivers, downloaded different media player, uninstall and reinstall devices, everything possible along with hours of research online to still have
 no fix. It is something with that update because after updating is when the problem started. It also caused another problem that my hotspot from my computer will not stay on even when connected to another device. I have changed all settings possible and turned
 off all power saving options and it still keeps automatically turning off and so disconnecting and disrupting internet connection to the connected device. Which I made a different thread for with no help for that either. Does Microsoft not care about its users?
 Also my headphones which cost over 100$ are not messed up, every other device I can possibly connect them to causes no problem at all. It's just my laptop. Which I have noticed too that if it doesnt get very distorted sometimes it

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got (maybe?) and issue with Charging my Surface book 2 thru a inverter i got in my truck. As soon as i plug it in the Power brick starts Buzzing, so not sure i dare continue charging till i get some more info about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think the issue is that the Inverter is a ''Modified Sin Wave'' not a ''pure sin wave''</p>
<p>Other wise its a Dometic model: PP2004</p>
<p>24v - 230v 2000W at 50Hz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know if its safe?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Reve.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this before or after upgrade to Version 1803?
<br />
<br />If before I'd try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting Explorer by Right clicking Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />Check also File Explorer, right click This PC, then Properties, then Advanced System Settings, then Performance Settings that all boxes are checked to test if that helps.
<br />
<br />IIf nothing else helps you can also roll back the Version 1803 Update at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery, or from Repair Mode accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately reinstalling Windows 10 did not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got the HP Pavilion desk top and when I open the jpg in Photo then go out of the folder and back in the thumbnail appears. If I restart my computer the thumbnail returns to the Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I download a new pic from the internet, it stays a thumbnail and does not turn into an Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 95% of my 500 gb of pix are icons, with odd ones here and there showing up as thumbnails, permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something went wrong when I copied the old files from a back up drive to this brand new and updated Win10 hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am still on warranty, I will try and call HP and see if they can help. I will get them to check my drivers since they will have a better idea what is the most recent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One solution is to empty the thumbnail cache in CMD and if that doesn't work do some tinkering in the Registry. I really don't want to try this without a second opinion. Your thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, Reve</p>

<p>I just wanted to follow up with how I solved this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure my One Drive wasn't uploading files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I created new folders, for example, Documentsx in the Downloads folder because that folder displayed thumbnails. Then I copy - paste the content back to the user profile. Now I can see thumbnails. I moved all my data first to new folders in Downloads
 and then moved them back under the user profile and it was fine. It means I have more folders, but at least the icon problem has disappeared. Is it perfect - no, and I hope Microsoft comes up with a fix. In the mean time this reorganization of data shows all
 my thumbnails and that is what I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Greg for your help.</p>

    <title>Certificate of Authenticity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pug2980  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certificate of Authenticity</h2>
                    
<p>It is my understanding that the Certificate of Authenticity (The seal across the edge of a new game) should always be present when buying a game from a reputable retailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently ordered a game online from a large well known retailer and received a game with this seal missing. &nbsp;I have contact them and they have tried to assurane me that this is New and not preowned stock, and whilst I may choose to believe them, this seems
 to negate the purpose of having this seal if one of our largest stores is selling new stock without them.</p>
<p>One suggested reason was that this stock may have initially been stock in store and therefore may have been used as a display case. &nbsp;The shop had therefore removed the game and put it in a safe box... the game may then have returned to the warehouse if they
 had too much stock and has then been used to fulfill oneline orders.</p>
<p>This just doesnt seem right though. &nbsp;Surely this seal is there to provide evidence to the end user that this product is new and has not been tampered with in any way... removing this before it reaches the end customer makes this system pointless.</p>
<p>Has anyone else ever bought a new game and had the seal missing? &nbsp;Am I overeacting to this?</p>
<p>The game received works perfectly fine, in this case, but the issue I have here is how ok the store was about this having been removed.</p>

<p>This in fairness is a first from them, which I why I was suprised that they didn't seem to think there was an issue with this being removed.</p>
<p>I am wondering if there is anything "Officially" wrong with them doing this and whether it should be raised somewhere. &nbsp;This is afterall the only guarantee an end user has that this has come from a valid supplier.</p>

<p>I have had this issue a few times from online retailers, and in one case it was quite obvious that the game was second hand, regardless of what they said.</p>
<p>I know brick and mortar stores do the same, if you buy a brand new release from Game you will get a sealed one, anything other then that will be fished out from under the counter and stuck in the box, i think overall its a very shady area. For me, if they
 remove the seal, take it out the box and place the game and manual in one of those little bags and stick it under the counter, its not a brand new game

<p>Happens all the time in stores like Asda where they have numerous empty display cases, you buy from a store you get a reciept your consumer rights are protected. &nbsp;Cant see an issue myself.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a Canon Pixma IP4000 and over the couple of months I've found that I keep getting the following error message when I try printing: "Document printing cannot be executed because the paper output tray is closed. Open the paper output tray. Printing
 will restart."</p>
<p>The paper output tray is always open and the only way I can print emails/documents is by continually closing and opening the output tray.</p>
<p>Has anyone else come across this problem and have a solution for it ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Steve</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Print From Microsoft Picture Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> musicmafia77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Print From Microsoft Picture Manager</h2>
                    Normally works fine. We had a power outage and ever since it's not printing. I can print PDF's, Word docs, e-mails, etc just fine. The only files that won't print are my jpeg files that I view in MSPM. Normally I just click the print icon or File&gt;Print
 and bam, but now a screen comes up that says "how do you want to print your pictures?" and acts like it is stuck searching for the preview pic which never displays. I have my printer selected. None of the other buttons work. Normally I do not see this screen
 at all. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! MM

Just wondering...can you print your photos if <br />
you view them in Windows Photo Viewer?<br />

At least we know the printer works.<br />
<br />
Did you try detect and repair in Picture Manager?<br />
(go to...Help / Detect and Repair)<br />
<br />
Did you try System Restore?<br />
<br />
Have you tried installing the most recent driver for your printer?</p>

============================<br />
Since the printer works with other programs...<br />
it must be a software issue and it seems that<br />
you have tried everything so I have no idea <br />
what the fix is.<br />
<br />
Just wondering why System Restore is not <br />
an option?

FWIW...System Restore does not affect personal files, such <br />
as e-mail, documents, or photos. This info was copied from<br />
the following Microsoft article...see the section..."What files<br />
are changed during a system restore?"<br />

<p>======================================<br />
It won't affect an existing program but if you create a System <br />
Restore point and install a new&nbsp;program or update. When you <br />
revert to that system restore point the program or update&nbsp;is <br />
gone.<br />
<br />
This is why it is important to create a System Restore point <br />
before installing software or updates...if the new software<br />
causes issues...reverting to the the system restore point will <br />
clear it up.</p>

<h2>            Read Surface 3 LTE Text messages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I've got the Surface 3 LTE and have service through T-Mobile. I got a notification this morning that said "1511 It's great that you joined T-Mobile..." and clicking on it took me to the Surface App.&nbsp;The Surface app doesn't look like it knows anything
 about it. Is there no other app that can read text messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I noticed the other day, the app asked if I wanted to send and receive text messages. The app's live tile also shows a little "1" in the corner since I got the text message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone see this before? And know how to get text messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi, thanks for the help. But unfortunately I am unable to do the steps given as my laptop never reaches the sign-in page meaning I can't access the desktop. When I turn it on it says 'preparing automatic repair' then goes black, and doesn't change.

<p><span>Hi
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=ronrod60&amp;referrer=http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/5bfe87ec-8e19-4cc1-ad70-4be8030c086c&amp;rh=98tzw29VpEMbj/Jhn6IDARV0j3qchd50zS5lKHiZU5A%3d&amp;sp=forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Was it working fine as you expected earlier?</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any changes in your computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>Which version of Internet Explorer you are using?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try resetting Internet Explorer to default settings.</span></p>
<p><span>You can do it by visiting the below link and click on Fix it button/follow the troubleshooting steps provided in it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The below steps may help you resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click on Internet Explorer(IE) shortcut icon and select
<strong><span>properties</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Now select the
<strong><span>Maximized </span></strong>option<strong><span>
</span></strong>for the <strong><span>Run
</span></strong>box<strong><span>.</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Now click on OK button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thereafter, any time you click the IE icon, IE will open in full screen mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Programs like Internet Explorer will open to the same size and placement as they were when they were closed.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you want Internet Explorer to open full-size when you start it up, you must first start IE, and then maximize the window. Now click File, and then Close. Now restart
 IE, and it should start up in a full-sized window. If half of the window is off the screen when you start a program, bring the window to the location you want and then click File and then Close and it will re-open in this position the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Changing the size of windows that appear when you click on an Internet link takes a few more steps.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open Internet Explorer. Now open another instance of Internet Explorer so that you have two running at the same time. In the second one, right-click a link and select
 “Open In New Window”. If the new window does not start in full screen, simply resize the window by dragging the edges out to the sides of the screen. Do not use the max button.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Close the first window by selecting File, then Close. Now close the window you just made full size. But close it by holding down the Control key and selecting File,
 then Close. Do not release the Control key until the window is closed. </span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now close the last Internet Explorer window. If you do this right, the settings will stick. You may or may not have to reboot, depending on your operating system.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you use the Quick Launch Toolbar to open Internet Explorer, then you can right click on the
 IE icon in the toolbar, select Properties and then change Run-&gt;Normal Window to Run-&gt;Maximized. Thereafter, any time you click the IE quick-launch icon, IE will open full screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards:</span></p>

<p>Hi Arkham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may have been some corruptions that occurred, hence, the issue. Allow us to verify some details so we can properly isolate the concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried updating the driver of another component in your computer and checking if the same issue exists?</li></ul>
<p>For initial troubleshooting, kindly download the graphic's driver from your manufacturer website and use it in doing the update. You may do that by clicking on this

                    The games won't suddenly launch after weeks of using Windows 8.1. The games were previously running in the past weeks and suddenly it stopped launching. Programs like UnityWeb won't even work. The compatibility method won't even work. Now I am stuck at
 flash games online. Is there any way to make them work again without reformatting?

            <p>This game isn't a Microsoft game. This game is The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, not the remastered one. I tried running this as an administrator, but it didn't work. I tried to uninstall and install it again, change the compatibility settings, installed new
 driver, but the said methods didn't work. When I tried to launch the game, the dialogue box pops up saying Skyrim has stopped working. This issue is not only with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but ALL of the games in my computer, including Roblox and Text Twist
 2. The issue also applies in playing a video, in which I found out earlier this day.</p>

    <title>Alice&#58; Madness Returns Disc issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alice&#58; Madness Returns Disc issue</h2>
                    
<p>I'm wondering has this happened to anyone yet. I installed the game(360) and yet the disc is still spinning, I un-installed and re-installed and it still happens. And by the way, as of right no there is no main thread for this game. Nice game(s) so far :)

<p>@DJOracle - I'm running on a slim and along with installing my games I also clear my cache always (because of games like fallout 3/NV), but - nope doesn't work. I also posted a thread similar on ea's forums (developer spicy horse doesn't seem to have a proper
 forum as far as I can tell)&nbsp; in the hopes of getting this issue more noticed &amp; fixed - I hope this gets fixed soon :/</p>

<p>Same problem here. &nbsp;The disc stops spinning as the game boots up like it's supposed to, but then it starts again at the Spicy Horse logo.</p>
<p>I've heard people have gotten around it by playing music from a flash drive or streaming from their PC while launching the game, or by launching the game without being logged into a profile, but neither worked for me.</p>

<p>Same here - installed Alice to the HDD but the disc keeps on spinning anyway during gameplay. I always install my Xbox 360 games to the HDD and can't abide playing games that diminish my console's disc-drive's lifespan for no good reason. Kindly sort it
 out, EA. Not going to be happy playing this game until it's corrected.</p>

<h2>            Purchased support1 services from, Plimus,Galaxynewtechnology---Valid sources&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp; I was called by an Indian man ( In Brooklyn) and he proceeded to tell me that my system was Infected and I turned over control&nbsp; to&nbsp; him, He then proceeded to<br />
Control my system for a few hours and with me watching, he corrected all the problems, I have received many notifications from Microsoft over the years, he told me that all the things he removed were as a result of those notifications. He then turned me over
 to a technician who did some more, work.&nbsp; He then returned with the new that the service would cost&nbsp; $199.99 for one year, his firm was JMK Technologies Inc., later I received an Invoice from Plimus for $199.99, Paid, and another from, Galaxynewtechnology.&nbsp;
 All i'm interested in is, was i screwed or did i get good value, everthing is working well, thankfully.&nbsp; Paul H.<br />

            Its a well known scam mate, you need to be worried that may have stolen personal details from your computer. Also you need to get a refund from plimus. They call me once a week claiming to work for microsoft, its complete nonsense..........please get a
 refund and stop these clowns from robbing your money.<br />
