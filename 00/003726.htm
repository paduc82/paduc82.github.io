<h2>            Email account has been blocked due to too many log in attempts</h2>
                    <p>Hi wondering if anyone can help with this, I've had to create a new email account just to be able to log in and ask anyone anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email is synced to my PC with windows 8, I have to sign to hotmail in to access my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is my account had unusual activity on my account for the last 6 months or so, my recent activity has flagged up unusual activity such as;<br />
</p>
<p>Security challange - China (3am my time)</p>
<p>Security challange - China (4am my time)</p>
<p>Successful log in - London (4:15am my time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering I'm asleep in the middle of the night and live in the North west of England I thought I best change my password and set up this two step verification thingie. (I'd thought of closing my account and changing my email but it was all synced up with
 my PC as well as lots of other accounts)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I get a code text to my phone anytime I want to sign in, annoying but should be secure. Although I still find that somehow I was still getting the same activity from abroad, which is strange considering my phone hasn't left the country. To be double
 sure I back up and wipe my computer, factory reset my phone etc to ensure I had nothing fishy attached on my end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is since I've reset my password about 20 times in the last few months, I've genuinely forgotten my password and typed it in incorrectly a few times before deciding I need to go through password recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed password recovery, well, a few times actually.. Change password sucessfully, go to sign in, incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally a message appears saying your email account has been blocked due to too many log in attempts.. Ok. well how do I unblock it? The only option is to change your password. Which I do for possibly the 30th time, but this is an infinite loop of no matter
 how many times I change my password, receive a unique code to my mobile, my account is still blocked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my account unblocked? The main issue is that I cannot access my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would really appreciate any help</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change password in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Disclaimer: I have already posted this question in Office forum, but since I removed Office 2016 X64&nbsp;and installed insider build and I still have this issue, I'm posting this question here too. I hope I'm not breaking any rules. I'm running Office X64 Slovenian
 version 16.0.6868.2060 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago I decided to change my password for my @Outlook.com accounts. All has gone well meaning that I can access and use services like Outlook.com, OneDrive, Mail, Calendar modern apps,&nbsp;etc., with exception of Outlook X64 program (strange enough
 Word, Excel, OneNote work fine). The problem is I can't change the password in Outlook 2016 X64. When attempting to insert new password, Outlook 2016 won't accept text, except for the first character. Please see attached screenshot.</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;How was Outlook.com email account setup</span><span>? Is it POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync or Microsoft Exchange Server email account?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is exchange account then you will not get the option to change the password. So, you need to remove and re-add the email account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is IMAP/POP/EAS account then you need to Go to <strong>File&gt;Account settings&gt;Account settings&gt;</strong> Double click on the email account and it will prompt you for the page to change the password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to change the password, Open notepad type the password then copy and paste&nbsp;it&nbsp;and check if it help.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Hope it helps. Try the suggestions and let me know the status of the issue for further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>N8 Bluetooth and Parrot SK4000 can&#39;t answer incoming calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klauspedersen  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 Bluetooth and Parrot SK4000 can&#39;t answer incoming calls</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having the Parrot SK4000&nbsp; (one month old) and a Nokia N8.<br />
The N8 is updated with the latest software from February 2011 and the Parrot SK4000 got firmware 1.15 - also newest firmware.</p>
<p>The N8 and SK4000 are able to connect (pairing) but when I receive incoming calls, it is impossible to establish the conversation.<br />
The phone and the SK4000 continues to ring when pressing the answer call button. Sometimes the SK4000 tells me "who do you want to call?" while the phone rings and pressing the call answer button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I turn auto-answer on (wireless car kit menu on N8), it is possible to answer incoming calls, but 5 seconds after the call has ended, the headset will disconnect from the phone.</p>
<p>If I try the same thing on my old Nokia N97, everything works fine.</p>
<p>It also works fine on HTC phones.</p>
<p>Who has to solve this problem -&nbsp;Nokia or Parrot?</p>
<p>What to expect - will the problem ever be solved?</p>
<p>It is a little bit annoying if I have to switch phone every time I want to use the Parrot SK4000 (motorbike) headset ...</p>

<p>Hi KalusPedersen,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your first post and welcome to the Nokia discussion forums.<br />
<br />
On looking at the Parrot website the Nokia N8 isn't one of the tested and compatible phones which is probably why you are experiencing your current issues. So basically the Parrot SK4000 isn't compatible with your phone model.<br />
<br />
If you click on the link below you can check this for your self:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.parrot.com/uk/support/onlinehelpguides/parrot-sk4000/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.parrot.com/uk/support/onlinehelpguides/parrot-sk4000/compatibility</a><br />
<br />
But the N97 is listed hence why it works fine. <br />
<br />
I would recommend you contact Parrot directly on this issue as its a 3rd party manufactured car kit we can't offer any support on the car kit itself.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies the issue for you.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Unresponsive &#8211; Now Only Works in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>I searched various MS forums for this exact issue, but couldn't find it. So I'm posting this here.&nbsp; If this exact issue has been dealt with in another post, please feel free to point me to it.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Issue</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>a) "Outlook Unresponsive"</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>When I open Outlook, the interface becomes unresponsive, but no "Not responding" messages at the top.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>To be more precise, when I click on any menu item, ribbon function, quick access icon, folder, etc., a short beep is emitted, but nothing else happens. I can't close the app, not even by right-clicking the Outlook icon in
 the taskbar. I have to close it with Task Manager. I tried using my keyboard instead of the mouse, but same thing. Except a few times, I got the message: "We are unable to connect right now. Please check your network and try again later." After acknowledging
 the message, Outlook returned to its unresponsive state. It appears that it can no longer access the Internet to download messages. The other strange thing was that the Quick Access bar was somehow above the ribbon, instead of below where I had placed it.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>Outlook had been working perfectly until this problem started a few days ago (2019-06-02).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>b) "Works Fine in Safe Mode"</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>A post in one of the forums suggested to try launching Outlook in Safe Mode. I did that and it worked fine. No error messages, I can send and receive email normally. Some features are restricted (e.g. Quick Access bar), but
 at least I can function.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Microsoft Office Version</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>* Office 365 Home (subscription)</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>Windows Version</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>* Windows 10 Home (Version 1803, Build 17134.765)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Attempted Fixes</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>a) Manually updated to latest version of Office from the Accounts section in an Office app. Re-launched Outlook, but no changes, same unresponsive state.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>b) While in Safe Mode, I disabled all Add-ins as recommended in other posts. I then restarted the app, but there were no changes, same unresponsive state. Had to close Outlook from Task Manager and re-launch in safe mode.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>c) Another suggestion was to use the "Office Repair Utility" from Task Manager. I ran the Quick Repair option first (unsuccessful), followed by the Online Repair option (still unsuccessful).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><span>d) In another Office forum, it was suggested to use the "SCANPST.EXE" Inbox Repair tool. Unfortunately, that utility wasn't on my system, and I wasn't able to find a download source anywhere on MS sites. According to the
 relevant MS site (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ocmsassetID=HA010354964&amp;ctt=1&amp;CorrelationId=6101d12c-79fe-4a26-944e-751ba11a627e&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253?ocmsassetID=HA010354964&amp;ctt=1&amp;CorrelationId=6101d12c-79fe-4a26-944e-751ba11a627e&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>),
 the "SCANPST.EXE" should be located in the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16" directory on my system, but it isn't and it's nowhere else on my PC.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">
</p><p><span>I simply don't understand why it suddenly stopped working without warning. At least Safe Mode works, but I'd like to have my whole setup back.</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas?</span></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Julien</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your query:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;OL, File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins&gt; Manage Com Add-ins&gt;Go</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;What is shown, whether active or not?</p>
<p>I just had a look and all seven Add-ins are disabled. Mind you, that's probably because I'm in Safe Mode. Like I said above, Outlook is unresponsive if I try to start it normally, so I can't access the Add-ins where starting it normally or in administrator
 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<span>PS scanpst.exe is installed during the Office/Outlook install, you were looking in the wrong place, or your search
</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;was not showing hidden files</span></p>
<p>Apparently, it was supposed to be in the "<span>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16" directory. It wasn't there and there were no hidden files in that directory.</span></p>
<p><span>So, in which directory should I look then?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for trying!</span></p>

            Hi Julien
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />
<br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />You already did a lot of troubleshooting :-).
<br />
<br />Two other options you may explore :
<br />1) rebuild your Outlook profile in case there are some sync issues causing this behaviour : <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-your-outlook-email-connection-by-repairing-your-profile-4d5febf6-7623-486b-9a9f-d5cfc4264af3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-yo...</a>
<br />2) uninstall, restart your computer and install again.
<br />
<br />If the recommended process does not work, for more technical help/questions, I would recommend to to reach out to Microsoft Tech Forums: 
<br />- <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/</a> (there is a community dedicated to the most important products)
<br />- <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Maggie

<p><span>Hi Maggie,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span>When looking into another problem, I accidentally got Outlook to work properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Essentially, I noticed that other Microsoft apps (Excel &amp; Word) could not connect the Internet, as indicated by the error message when navigating to File
</span><span><span>à</span></span><span> Account. On a hunch, I turned off my VPN, just to see if that would have an effect. And it did. So I then restarted Outlook normally and it worked
 like a charm, no issues.</span></p>
<p><span>However, this leaves a number of unanswered questions and issues to be investigated.</span></p>
<p><span>1) Why would the Outlook interface freeze if it couldn't connect to the Internet when started normally? Wouldn't it simply give an error message?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Why could Outlook connect to the Internet in Safe Mode with the VPN on?</span></p>
<p><span>3) I've been using this VPN for quite a while with the same configuration. Something obviously changed somewhere a few days back, but what? Only Microsoft apps were affected (as far as I can tell).</span></p>
<p><span>I'll work on these three before posting another question in the MS forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, the original Outlook issue posted above can be considered closed.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers.</span></p>
<p><span>Julien</span></p>

    <title>Why do contact photos not appear on the email header, but they do - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> millerksu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do contact photos not appear on the email header, but they do appear for the contact item and in the people pane&#63;</h2>
                    Using Outlook 2010, contact photos for those people in my personal contacts folder are not all showing on the e-mail header.&nbsp; Photos do show up on their contact card, as well as on the People Pane at the bottom of the message.&nbsp; However, the photo no longer
 shows on the message header as it did in the past.&nbsp; Some photos still show, just not all.&nbsp; So far the only variable in common I have found is that all users who are part of our Office365/Lync environment are missing photos on the header.&nbsp; Those contacts not
 on Office365/Lync are still showing on the header.

<h2>            2018 Surface Pro Compatibility with Dish AnyWhere</h2>
                    I just purchased a surface pro this month. My Dish Anywhere App doesn't seem to work properly like it did on my mac or other devices. When I click on a channel to watch, the screen pops up as if it's going to stream. The timer shows its running/streaming
 however the screen is black. I've ran it on Google, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge. None seem to work. Anyone know how to resolve this issue? Thanks.&nbsp;

            Same thing happens to me using a Surface book.&nbsp; It started right after the updates installed on 9/12 and 9/13.&nbsp; Must be tied to them but I can't get the updates to uninstall.&nbsp; Must be some new driver.&nbsp; Help!

<h2>            Update to outlook 2013 selected wrong time zone for appointments</h2>
                    When I updated to Outlook 2013 from Outlook 2010 I was asked what time zone or something for my appointments to be set to.&nbsp;
<br />
I have a mixture of accepted and created appointments in different zones.&nbsp; <br />
Since my zone is central time zone that is what I selected.&nbsp; This changed the accepted appointments from different time zones to central time zone as well.<br />
Can I re-run this tool to correct this?&nbsp; If so how?&nbsp; <br />
If not what can I do? The time zones on the accepted appointments are grayed out and will not let me change them.&nbsp;
<br />
I am afraid I will miss a meeting without the proper time zone applied.&nbsp; Please advise.<br />

            <p>Hi Wellmeier,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you with the appointments issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time zone which has already been accepted for the appointments cannot be changed. The time needs to be manually updated for existing appointments.</p>
<p>The new appointment will have the correct time zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure to check if DST settings is checked within Outlook and for System time.</p>
<p>Since you are unable to change the time zone for the appointment, are these appointments
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may click Time Zones in
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Event</span> tab for appointment, go to
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the suggestions provided are helpful. If you need further assistance, reply and I will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Outlook app on Android used 430 MB of data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cobbman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook app on Android used 430 MB of data</h2>
                    <p>A day after returning from overseas I was surprised to get a notification to tell me that I'd used up my month's data. I thought I'd used 70 MB. When I checked my data usage I found that the Outlook app had used 430 MB in the background. My normal usage
 is not anything like that and I didn't send or receive anything unusually large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I trust the app not to use up my data without warning? I can't disable background updates because it's linked to the Google Play Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it's linked to the Google Play Store, I wondered if it had updated a number of apps unexpectedly, but I have that set to update only when on wifi so it wasn't that. Besides I'd been on wifi all day apart from about 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Arthur,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you cannot highlight selected texts in Word 2016 for Mac. I would like to suggest you check the following:<br />
1. Restart your mac and open the Word application to check if the issue occurs.<br />
2. Create a new document and check if the issue occurs.<br />
3. Perform a clean startup (safe mode) to determine whether background programs are interfering with Word 2016 for Mac.<br />
<br />
Besides, please provide the information below so we can better understand your situation and help you.<br />
1. Does the issue occur to other Office applications, such as Excel or OneNote 2016 for Mac?<br />
2. The version of Office you are using: Word&gt; About Word.<br />
3. Version of the operating system for your mac.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>From the description it could be the memory card failing. Also keep the SD memory card inserted in the phone all the time, do not use it in a PC or in other devices.</p>
<p>You could try to format the SD card&nbsp;in the phone and start over?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the formatting fails to restore normal functionality and you decide to purchase another memory card, please get a reputable brand from a reputable retailer. With its 4GB mass memory the Lumia 530 depends on a flawless SDHC memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>go to:</p>

<p>then right click anywhere and go to properties.</p>
<p>in the properties windows it will have the read only button checked. uncheck that and click apply. have it change it to all subfolders.</p>
<p>then in the properties window click on the Security tab. then click edit user permissions. a new window will pop up click add. in the next windows type "all application packages".</p>
<p>then save, exit and reboot.</p>
<p>this worked for.</p>

            <p>files in there do not seem to have RO attribute, but folders do, but removing it for them does not seem to work - it still appears to be in there after removal. But it is shown like "applied to some files", not to the folder. Also my system does not recognize&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"all
 application packages" entity and thus does not add it to security permissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">either way... proper way to fix this should be done via a patch or fixit application made by MS.</span></p>

    <title>Flashing form controls and activeX controls &#40;pictures too&#41; on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> academic guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flashing form controls and activeX controls &#40;pictures too&#41; on a worksheet in Excel 2010, 64 bit.</h2>
                    
<p>We use an Excel journal entry template to upload accounting information to PeopleSoft.&nbsp; The template uses form controls to complete the validation and upload functions and to perform some mundane housekeeping functions.&nbsp; We have used this template, with
 minor modifications for seven years.&nbsp; We have kept the workbook in compatability mode format as campus users use Excel 2003, 2007 and 2010.&nbsp; The problem we are experiencing is that when 2010 users with a 64 bit machine, print the worksheet, the controls begin
 to flash on and off. The controls remain, and will work, but the flashing is very disturbing.&nbsp; This can only be stopped by closing and reopening the workbook.&nbsp; This problem also exhibits itself with inserted pictures (a logo), but this existed in 2007 and
 was cured by just eliminating the logo.</p>
<p>Why do form controls (and inserted pictures) flash in 2010, with a 64 bit machine, after performing a print operation?&nbsp; How can this be fixed?</p>

I'm having the exact same problem. My workbook contains 10 activeX controls (8 buttons and 2 textfields), and it start to flash when I come back from a print preview.<br />
I tried to raise the GDIProcessHandleQuota from x2710 (10 000) to x4E20 (20 000), but it doesn't change anything.<br />
<br />
Are you sure this problem is related to the quota of controls in the workbook ?<br />

            I did some tests :<br />
&nbsp;- I commented every single line of my vba code<br />
&nbsp;- I ask for the print preview through the excel menu<br />
It is still flashing<br />
<br />
I noticed though that this problem only encounters when I use the "freeze panes" feature. Is it the same for you ?<br />

            Ok I finally found the issue. In my case, here are the exact conditions that cause the controls to flash :<br />
<ol>
<li>Using Excel 2010 (mine is a 32bit version)</li><li>Having Freezed Panes</li><li>Having "floating objects" (ActiveX controls, shapes, etc...) over the Freezed Pane</li><li>Having the "Print_area" name defined for one (or more) entire row/column.</li><li>Starting a Print Preview or a Print.</li></ol>
My solution was : creating the "Print_area" name juste before the print preview, and deleting it just after that.<br />

            Thanks Yoskopolite; In the VBA I set the print area so it's reset during each execution of the macros and the blinking has gone away.<br />

            I think you can also fix the flicker by deselecting the 'Show page breaks' checkbox (Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Display options for this worksheet&gt;Show page breaks).<br />
<br />
I have found that if i have a picture on a worksheet with frozen panes (with the picture in the always showing area), and a print area is set, then the flickering issue always happens.<br />
<br />

<h3> bob zor  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Office 2010 thinks it&#39;s a trial version on a reinstall, even though it is not</h2>
                    I am upgrading my computer and have Office Hone and Student 2010. It was purchased with 3 licenses, and has worked fne for me on my first install on my old XP system. Now I am upgrading to a new Win7 box and when I install Office 2010 it accepts the product
 key just fine, but then in the help area says it is a trial versio &nbsp;with 29 days left. It most certainly is not a trial version as I have the DVD and product key right in front of me. One side effect of this is that I cannot obtain a phone activation phone
 number no any other actual support. I'm not buying another copy, when I have multiple licenses left.

            I agree with Placouk, it is almost certain your new computer came with a factory installed trial of Office 2010. That trial WILL also almost certainly interfere with your activation of your purchased copy.&nbsp; Go into "Programs and Features" and look for
 something like "Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image" (the one normally factory intstalled because it contains all 3 trial editions in a single install).&nbsp; If you find it uninstall it. Then REPAIR your installed copy before trying to activate it again.&nbsp; You can
 ignore Office Starter for now, it shouldn't affect your activation.<br />

<p>If none of the other fixes work, do a phone activation. Do not enter anything until the phone system offers you the option to talk to a live service rep. Explain the problem to them. You are transferring the installation from a “dead”
 computer, or you are getting an invalid product key and would like to know the exact reason</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong><strong>:</strong> When I save a word document, the title on the saved document is displayed as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; <strong>Garden Work Chapter one</strong>. <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">(The title is one line)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is save it so the title reads:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Garden </strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">(first line)</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter One.</strong><strong>docx </strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">(second Line)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please Note: That this is just for the saved file name</strong> &amp; has nothing to do with the actual formatted text inside the document<strong>.</strong></p>

            Hi  Lance,
<br />
<br />Sorry that is not possible, Windows does not allow a hard return in a file name. 
<br />
<br />A hard return in the background is \r and the backslash character in Windows is used to denote a move to another folder . . .

            I think your underlying question is about file management. If you're writing a book and want all the chapters to stay together, you need to create a new Garden folder in your Documents folder and then save the chapter files in that folder. The path to
 your Chapter One file will then be something like C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Documents\Garden\Chapter One.docx.

<h2>            is it possible to create multiple calendar profiles to keep from sync&#39;ing personal appointments to exchange work server&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I really am not sure where else to go with this, I have spent too many hours trying to figure this out on my own.</p>
<p>My employer uses a "cbeyond" hosted microsoft exchange server, the idea was to allow appointments to be scheduled in the field, field reps to be able to coordinate with each other all while making our calendars centralized in the office for planning, inventory
 management etc....</p>
<p>Our group did not go with a universal mobile phone package, so there are android, blackberry, iphone's etc. in the mix, and THEN THE one that I chose a HTC HD2 running winmo 6.5 is causing the most issues....</p>
<p>-it seems that ALL appointments that are entered into the winmo device are sync'd with work exchange server, so when I entered personal appointments they all began showing up at the offices central outlook calendar etc. etc.</p>
<p>IS THERE A WAY TO CREATE multiple calendars? or to categorize appointments differently upon entry to dis-allow them from sync'ing with exchange server??????????</p>
<p>I also have an I-phone which has that exact functionality, but I sought out a win mo device due to fact that you could not accept appointments invites from other reps in the field........THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF
 FORWARDS.....ANY HELP MUCH APPRECIATED</p>

<p>Unfortunate, You can only sync one specific calendar on with your active sync on the Windows Phone 6.5. Not even multiple calendars on one exchange account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Windows Phone 7 will allow you sync from multiple exchange accounts like (corporate, Live and google exchange)</p>
