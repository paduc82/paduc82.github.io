<h2>            is it safe to delete temporary files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>a game on MSN games was freezing the screen. The solution I got was to delete &amp; reinstall Java, delete cookies, temp internet files.&nbsp; Will I loose any important data if I delete the temporary files?</p>

            <p>Temporary files as they are are temporary and can be safely deleted. Of course when deleting cookies from websites that you visit often that keep your login info/password then you would have to input them again.</p>
<p>The only time that it is not recommended to delete temp files is when you are installing a program and if that program still need to reboot to finish the installation.</p>
<p>It is unusual for anyone to&nbsp;save their important data in the temp folders since temp folders are always emptied when the user run CCleaner or any temp files cleaner.</p>

<h2>            Remove KB982670 from Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As many others I had issues with updating Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (KB982670).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the cleanup tool, run it, disable windows update service, start windows installer service and successfully installed the standalone&nbsp;Microsoft .NET Framework 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was solved, however, the Windows Update still show&nbsp;Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile (KB982670) as an update and if I am hitting to update it, its still stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also when I click on "Check for updates" it taking always and never finishing the process. I guess is because&nbsp;KB982670 is still there and cannot be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how can I tell to windows update that this update was already installed and can be skipped?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Surface Book Touch Pad Tap Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banditob1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Touch Pad Tap Problem</h2>
                    <p>I am a touch pad tapper in that I like to just tap with my finger quickly on the pad rather than push it down to click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since getting my Surface Book last week, I've been having a lot of trouble with tapping and here is what is happening.&nbsp; It appears that I can tap maybe 3-4 times in a row and then tapping simply quits and no amount of just tapping with one finger will do
 anything.&nbsp; If I then try and click on the pad, the appropriate action is taken and once again I can tap a few times before it quits working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed this behavior in several apps now, including Control Panel, Edge, Explorer, and Notepad.&nbsp; I have confirmed that all drivers are updated and correctly loaded, but still see this problem regularly.&nbsp; At first, I thought it was just me not tapping
 firmly enough or something like that, but after experimenting with it, it appears to be a Touch Pad or driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice that anyone might have on how to solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on&nbsp;a Surface Book with&nbsp;Core i7, 512GB SSD, and 16GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the latest suggestions. &nbsp;I did manage to fix the Hello camera by uninstalling it and deleting the drivers and then reinstalling from the downloaded drivers. &nbsp; I just have to wonder, though, what will get broken with the next update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try disabling Fast Start to see if that will allow the computer to sleep or InstantGo or whatever it is. &nbsp;Currently, it seems to just power itself off when it enters this state as it reboots when I try to power up the next time and it has closed all
 of my apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent another couple of hours with Support again today on the Touchpad, but we got nowhere and the driver changes they did just broke the Hello camera again. &nbsp;They're now suggesting that I return the computer to where I purchased it from for an exchange
 as it is so new. &nbsp;That means more hours of updates and reinstalling software and configuring things the way I want them to be. &nbsp;I don't really feel like it's going to be worth the trouble, so if it does go back, it'll be for a refund not an exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be so glum, but while I do enjoy troubleshooting and solving computer problems, I need this one to just work.</p>

<p>Can't you "potentially" get an exotic? RNG for drops &amp; all?</p>
<p>I did play a little on a silver account and ran into a couple of randoms on patrol. Wasn't anywhere near far enough in the game to expect an exotic so I can't speak for those.</p>

<h2>            Printer in start menu problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>HP printer failed.<br />
Deleted details. (Not uninstalled.)<br />
Installed new Canon printer.<br />
(Which runs OK)</p>
<p>Now, at switch on, get a window that says unable to run:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program files\HP\HPphotosmart5520 series\Bin\HPstatusBL.DLL</p>
<p>and I can't get rid of it!</p>
<p>Re-installed the HP printer (a few times) and uninstalled it, to no avail!</p>
<p>How can I stop this happening, please?</p>

            Hi Zohaib
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There is no defined time frame from Microsoft for this. But you will keep losing features over a period of time, Hence, you should buy a license soon.
<br />
<br />Having said that as per my experience, you can arrange a license within a month without much impact.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<br />Using Windows without a license is not according to the terms and conditions of EULA. However, if you have an unactivated copy, You would not be able to personalize it according to your needs forever. It isn't a matter of days.

<p>I did it and to be honest im a bit of a technophobe, so all i did was go through all the onscreen prompts for revert to factory settings.
</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;was allready pre-installed and as such has reloaded. the problem that i am now having is that it says that The Microsoft home and student 2007&nbsp;is a 60 day trial edition and as such i need to enter my product key to&nbsp;validate?</p>
<p>There&nbsp;is a sticker on the underside of the laptop with a 25 character product key, however when i type this in (numerous times)&nbsp;I get the message that the key is invalid.</p>
<p>The sticker itself has the title Windows 7 Home Prem OA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Kodu Game Lab crashing under non-admin user accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guy chonel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kodu Game Lab crashing under non-admin user accounts</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
We are trying to deploy Kodu Game Lab to my school, computer meeting the system requirements. Have made sure .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft XNA are also installed!
<br />
Logging on to the workstation as myself (admin user) will run the game happily however when logging on as Students user the game crashes something like "Kodu game lab has stopped working....etc...."&nbsp;
<br />
Some of the students have been reported to be using Kodu but crashed after about 10min that's as far as they can get.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, teachers account (which as more elavated rights) can also run Kodu but the purpose is for students to use the app.<br />
<br />
Also tried to install Kodu on a network share where existing shared apps are installed and student can use but the same thing happens for Kodu it crashes when run as student accounts.<br />
To be honest it would be good to have it running off the workstation locally. we are using some HP 6000 Pro AiO and HP dc7900 small form factor workstations Running Windows 7 and up to date with MS updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<h2>            Keyboard malfunction &#40;inbuilt keyboard&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Hi everyone!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'll try to put this simple as possible. After some hours rest, I turned on my MSI PS42 8rb Prestige (Windows 10 - Version 1803 - Build 17134.858) and the keyboard stopped to work properly; some keys don't work as supposed to do. It's not a matter of keyboard
 language. For example, the number keys are working on this way:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Key -&gt; "What's doing"</div>
<div>1 -&gt; (open help)</div>
<div>2 -&gt; type: &lt;82</div>
<div>3 -&gt; type: 93</div>
<div>4 -&gt; type: 04</div>
<div>5 -&gt; type: 5 in a text box (if there is one in the current window)</div>
<div>6 -&gt; type: i6</div>
<div>7 -&gt; type: k7</div>
<div>8 -&gt; type: &lt;82</div>
<div>9 -&gt; type: 93</div>
<div>0 -&gt; type: 04</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional info:&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. The only unusual thigh that I did after turn off my laptop was that I used a laptop cleaning spray and clean all key board with it and a towel.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. I already verified the drivers, restarted the laptop, verified that there are not dust or something like that on the keyboard (I didn’t dissemble the keyboard).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>3. Until now, the only solution I have found, an external keyboard.</p>
<p>4. I did a factory reset but the keyboard is still not working.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>5. If I try a test like (http://keyboardchecker.com/), pressing number 2 key, three keys are highlighted.</p>
<p>

            Hi Daniel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything possible for keyboard problems.  If you need help with any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If this began within the recent past,  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />Another thing that might help as it solves many problems is to Upgrade to the latest version by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi Greg!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you so much for your time and suggestions. However, I still have the same problem. Following the results of all your suggestions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Keyboard Troubleshooter: After execution, anything to fix, neither error or warning message.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- System restore: I did a factory reset, so system restore does not make any change.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Updates checking: As I did factory reset, there were nothing to review.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Keyboard driver: I have already tried it. I did it again, but nothing change. (update, uninstall, re-install)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Safe mode: The keyboard works bad in safe mode too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Repair mode: Apparently everything works fine because the repair mode did not find anything to fix.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Laptop manufacturer: I am waiting for the answer. However, I am starting the exams period, so I cannot be without laptop (at least now I can use an external keyboard)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Lenovo's bulletin: Maybe it is the wrong link because is related with webcam.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Remap keyboard keys:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I tried this option, but I could not solve the problem. The interesting thing here is the following: When I
 was trying to remap the keys with SharpKeys software, if I used the "Type Key" function, the software recognized the correct key. However, I mapped the number 2 key to 'A'. After that, every time that I press number 2 key, it will type '&lt;8a' instead of '&lt;82'.
 So, could I say that this is not a hardware problem? What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- BIOS: An update is needed. After updating it, the problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Checklist: All looks fine, for example, sfc /scannow: Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Windows update from 1803 to 1903: Now, windows is updated but the keyboard is not working properly&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestion? I'll really apreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
<br />If the PC is still under warranty I'd get them to replace the keyboard.
<br />
<br />If not research keyboard replacement on the model.  It may be easy, or it may require too much disassembly to make it worth your time or worth a shop's time without a big bill.  If you get lucky as I have a few times, you can get a new keyboard and a video online for our model PC how to swap it in.  If you need help researching this just let me know.

            Yes it is a scam, these pop-up in a browser attempting to con the user into calling the number listed, once the call is answered the user is asked to open event viewer &amp; told the errors are indications of a virus/malware infection, then the spiel is given where money is asked for to clean the ‘infection’, if paid these scammers usually install malware &amp; then call you back after a day or two to ask how things are, when you mention the malware they say they can clean it for more money. And the scam goes on.
<br />Note that Microsoft will not cold call anyone, any pop-up saying that you have malware &amp; to call a number is a scam. Just close the browser or webpage &amp; clear out the cookies, cache &amp; history to remove the pop-up, or close the browser via take manager.

<br />
Trying to troubleshoot a friend's computer problem.&nbsp; It's a Dell Dimension 8400 with Windows XP Pro SP 3, Avast A/V, Malwarebytes and was recently cleaned and updated.&nbsp; He hadn't started the computer for a week and when he did it went into the black Safe Mode
 screen.&nbsp; Restarted and it went into Safe Mode screen again and again.&nbsp; He said then when it's on the Safe Mode screen he can't make any choices....&nbsp; Safe Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, Last Good Configuration, etc.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; After asking questions
 I found out that the last time he used his computer he pulled in his jump drive after using it on his girl friend's computer which was infected with Trojans.&nbsp; I'm guessing that he infected his own computer but why so severely.&nbsp; I cleaned up his girl friend's
 computer and it works fine now.&nbsp; I would have thought that Avast would have caught whatever was on the jump drive when he plugged it into the USB port.&nbsp; Right??&nbsp; I'm now thinking that it might possibly be a Boot Sector virus or corruption. &nbsp; Was going to suggest
 that he go into the Bios and change the boot order to CD-rom drive and then try using a Bootable CD with a ISO image.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think? &nbsp;&nbsp; Can this bootable CD be made on another computer with Windows XP Home?&nbsp; Any suggestions will be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</span><br />
<br />
P.S. Forgot to mention that he can't find the Windows Install CDs from Dell.&nbsp; :-(<br />

            Your post is confusing! It sounds like he <u><b>can</b></u> enter Safe Mode since you said:
<div><br />
<div>"<span style="font-weight: bold">it went into the black Safe Mode screen."</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>But since you later said that "he can't make any choices," I think you are referring to the Advanced Options Boot Menu:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/assets/images/sm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/assets/images/sm.jpg</a>

<div>Or are you referring to a similar menu that looks like this:</div>

I sent him those screen shots... thanks Daavee... and asked he which one comes up and if he was using the arrow keys to make choices.&nbsp; Here's his answer:
<br />
<br />
</span>"I am using the arrow keys, and I get the second (bottom) of the 2 screens you showed me. Have tried all the options, still will not boot."<br />

            See if this is helpful:<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

            Okay, we are talking about this screen:
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fuploads.askapache.com%2f2007%2f08%2fboot-menu-1.jpg" /> </div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>So, this is merely a menu and he is NOT entering Safe Mode since you stated that he said:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"<span>Have tried all the options, still will not boot."</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>If the Microsoft Standalone System Sweeper does not fix this problem, he will need to use another bootable CD that has the Windows XP Recovery Console (RC) on it. This may be found on any Windows XP installation CD. If he does not have access to an XP
 installation CD, then there are instructions available to download the files necessary to build a special bootable CD that ONLY has the RC on it. Post back if you need further guidance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A final thought:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Depending on how much damage has been done, sometimes it is just easier and quicker to "flatten and rebuild" -- which means to wipe the hard drive and lay down a fresh, Clean Install of Windows XP. I usually advise against this since it is a hassle to
 bring it back to a fully patched state and then re-install all the programs. Then again, there are situations where a Clean Install is the best option.</div>

            I would like to echo what Jose said. The screen shot I earlier posted is what your friend is reporting he is seeing. That menu is useless! It is imperative that he tap the F8 key several times after turning the PC on so that he gets the CORRECT menu, the
 Advanced Options menu:
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fbertk.mvps.org%2fassets%2fimages%2fsm.jpg" /> </div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>By all means, follow Jose's directions. This way you can disable the automatic reboot and hopefully be able to give us the BSOD information.</div>

<p>I looked for settings and I have noticed that the only way to turn that feature off is to turn off Cortana and then turn off web results.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However instead of doing what your doing now you can leave it on and when you search for something just click "My Stuff" and it will search for your stuff not the web.</p>

<p>Ok that's wired I know on my computer I can disable it; I think something is corrupt I would call Microsoft Tech Support and have them take remote desktop control&nbsp;and see what they can do.</p>
<p>But real quick is this what your taskbar looks like after&nbsp;shutting off the search box which has the messages? it should.</p>

<p>That's by right clicking on the taskbar and selecting Cortana and then selecting hidden</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</div>
<div><br />
Unfortunately, this is feature by design which can't be altered. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The only thing you can do is disable Cortana if you want so.</div>
<div>I request you to use the Windows Feedback app to send your thoughts directly to the team building Windows.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Although Cortana can be "turned off" using this methodology... it still "runs" upon startup, in the background (check your task manager) after restart... Therefore: since the original question / issue in this post was - how to DISABLE Cortana - please answer
 the question asked and explain how do you DISABLE ("truly" disable) Cortana from running at all ? As I for one; don't need a resource hog that is not used in any capacity, running on my system. I'm sure there are numerous others that want Cortana DISABLED
 and not merely "turned off" !</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately to my knowledge the only way to disable Cortana is to turn it off I have no idea if you can fully disable the service or process.
</span></p>
<p><span>However I don't think that the&nbsp;process will cause any slowdowns on PC do to it not being used however depending on your system&nbsp;I don't know.

<h2>            New &#42;Used&#42; MSI AMD 790fx-GD70 Help</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi, Posted some stuff about this topic two days ago. Purchased all my upgrades, running off of Windows Home Premium for now but might upgrade to ultimate just to check it out maybe.</p>
<p>Problem: New *used* Mobo- MSI 790fx-gd70 with 4gbs of ram, Crossfirex with Radeon hd 5770, and 5750, Same HDD, and Phenom II X4 965 BE.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since I bought the MoBo used and people tell me that I have to do a "clean install" of Windows 7 for best results, I was wondering how I actually do it since, for my understanding the MoBo I'm buying doesn't have any of the drivers from MSI. Both MoBos
 *old and new* have the same Chip set series, One being the 770t-USB3 and the other with the 790fx, Was wondering If I Can use the Gigabyte Driver Utility CD for the MSI one? Since they are the same Chip set, and if they're are any BIOS settings configs that
 I have to do that are essential other than OC settings? - Thanks again, for any help.</li></ul>

<p>You can get any drivers you need and a copy of the manual at <a href="http://eu.msi.com/index.php?func=proddesc&amp;maincat_no=1&amp;prod_no=1740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://eu.msi.com/index.php?func=proddesc&amp;maincat_no=1&amp;prod_no=1740</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure the BIOS version supports your Phenom X4 965 BE - you might need to install (temporarily) an older AMD processor if the BIOS version it has is too old. Also check that none of the available BIOS&nbsp;updates are required to support your hardware.</p>
<p>There is a good chance the "new" motherboard will boot with your old disk, but the only way to find out is to try it and see.</p>
