<h2>            Code to Update URL in Word Document Image Placeholder</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a dynamic URL inside a picture placeholder so that every time an image is saved over with a new image, the document will refresh and show the new image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this even possible? Is there code that I can use?</p>

<p>Within Word, the best you can do is to insert an INCLUDEPICTURE field containing the file path or URL of the image. Whenever the field is updated, it will display the current content of the named file. However, the field (or the document it's in) doesn't
 have any way to know when the content of the file changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use a macro in the document (if saved as a .docm file) or in its template to update the field(s) whenever the document is reopened. If you only want a specific field to be updated, insert a bookmark around the field; in the ThisDocument module of
 the file, add a macro like this (with the actual bookmark name in the quotes):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Document_Open()</p>
<div><br />
<p>
</p><p>If you want to update all the fields in the document (including ones that aren't INCLUDEPICTURE fields), you don't need a bookmark, and you can use this code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Document_Open()</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to get really geeky, there are utilities known as "file watchers" or "folder watchers" that can do things when a file or folder changes; for example&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/fwutilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/fwutilities/</a>.
 You may be able to create some way to send a signal to Word to tell it to update the fields. I don't think that can be done in Visual Basic for Applications (the macro language); you would probably have to use Visual Studio to create a COM add-in.</p>

<p>Hmm...I like that idea. And I figured I would have to elevate this to Visual Studio because I won't get what I want OOTB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the INCLUDEPICTURE field, but I can't quite get what I want. I have to actually select an image and it's static. I want to make the URL dynamic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Word document is a template in a standard SharePoint document library. The images are in a standard SharePoint asset library. The URL for the image is constant, but the name of the image will change. The SQL script that the analysts write will name the
 .png file with the Company and Topic, so the name of each image will be unique: Company_Topic.png. I need to populate "Company" and Topic" dynamically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found <a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/word/38722-word-fields-relative-paths-external-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this post</a>, which seems close, but not quite. This seems to tell me how to make the URL dynamic with a static file name. I need a static URL and a dynamic file name. I have a Company field and a Topic field in my document library, which my users will populate
 when they create a form using the template by selecting from choice drop down fields. In InfoPath, I can write this formula in my picture placeholder and get a dynamic image using the populated fields:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>concat("https://Domain/SiteCollection/Site/AssetLibrary/", Company, "_", Topic, ".png")</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can't seem to figure out how or if I can use this in Word. It doesn't work in the picture placeholder and when I try following the instructions in the link above, I get a syntax error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I want one document library with one template that my users can utilize to create as many forms for as many companies and topics that they want that will update the image based on the Company/Topic combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible? If not, then the alternative is to create one library for each topic and have one template for each library with the URL hard coded. Barf.</p>

<p>In Word VBA, there is no concat function; instead, use the &amp; operator between strings and/or string variables to build up the URL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to adapt the following by extracting the Company and Topic values from the document library and building the URL like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">strURL =&nbsp;<span>"https://Domain/SiteCollection/Site/AssetLibrary/" &amp; Company &amp; "_" &amp; Topic &amp; ".png"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have access to a SharePoint site from here, but this works in Word to update the URL in an INCLUDEPICTURE field from manual inputs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Sub ChangePic()</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; Set fld = ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("thePic").Range.Fields(1)</p>

<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; strCode = strCode &amp; strFolder &amp; "/" &amp; strFile</p>

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Not the content controls, no. If you open a document created in Windows Word 2007 or 2010, ou will see that only one or two aspects of these controls work at all on Mac Word 2011.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
There are at least three types of control you can put on the surface of a Word document in the WIndows versions 2007 and 2010 of Word:
<div>&nbsp;a. Content Controls (the default type, in the Windows version)</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. What used to be called "Online Forms Controls", which are the first type of control listed in as Legacy Forms controls</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. ActiveX Controls</div>
<div><br />
<div>(although you can use .NET/VSTO to put .NET Windows Forms controls on a document surface, AFAIK they have to be hosted in an ActiveX control.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The developer tab in Mac Word 2011 can only work with type (b). ActiveX controls are not supported at all on Mac.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Sway is a public site that can be accessed via the browser, an iOS app, or a Windows 10 app.&nbsp; We don't have any documents with the specific data you request, but using Sway would be similar to using any other typical web service.&nbsp; The Windows 10 app communicates

            Skype for Windows 10 does not provide any option to filter active contacts that are online. 
<br />
<br />Neither does Skype 8 or 7, but Skype 7 lets you see how in your contacts list is online more clearly, so you might want to go back to that version.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,  then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Hi Emilaaay, my name is Max and I'm a Microsoft independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Skype for Windows 10, version 12.X, currently doesn’t offer the function of filtering contacts. But this function is available on version 8.X, (Microsoft Skype for Desktop). You can download and install Skype, version 8.X from here: <a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.28.0.41.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />However, a new 8.X version offers a limited filtering option because it shows only contacts with the active status (in green). If the contact is away (in yellow), this version will not reflect this status.
<br />You can also reinstall Skype, version 7.X (Skype for Windows Desktop) from here: <a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0...</a>
<br />Good news is this version will not be retired in the near future.

    <title>Word 2010 Multilevel List - numbers lose formatting synchronization to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlznine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 Multilevel List - numbers lose formatting synchronization to Heading Styles</h2>
                    <p>Law Firms use Styles heavily - especially Heading Styles linked to a multilevel list.&nbsp; It's great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a Multilevel list is setup and linked to a Heading&nbsp;Style, when I modify the format of&nbsp;Heading 1 it will also change the number's style to bold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if at any time I&nbsp;right-click on the paragraph number and&nbsp;choose Adjust List Indent and change the Number Font, to&nbsp;Bold (or unBold), it no longer seems to be linked to the Heading Style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to re-link the formatting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and this is just curiosity, Word seems to copy ALL formatting EXCEPT Underline.&nbsp; That actually is practical and customary in Legal Documents, but it's odd that Microsoft knew to do that.&nbsp; What if I wanted to modify Heading 1 to be underlined and INCLUDE
 the number.&nbsp; Typically, I'd have to change the Number Font to underline.&nbsp; Then we're back to it not being linked to the Heading style's formatting - when it comes to underline.</p>

            Once you have explicitly changed the formatting (font, size, italics, etc.) of the number, you lose the "connection" to the underlying style, as you have noticed. As far as I know, the only fix is to recreate the numbering in another document and then
 copy the affected paragraph styles using the Organizer dialog box.

            &nbsp;You should make the changes via the Define New Multi-Level List facility as each modification amounts to a "new" Multi-Level List being created, which is not "another" list, but a replacement for the existing one.

<div>I dont quite understand why something this CRITICAL to the success of the WP is being left in the hands of AT&amp;T to take as long as they want to roll out, and trust me, they seem to have a timetable that would put most businesses out of business. &nbsp;It's
 one of the reasons I am leaving Android. &nbsp;It takes way Way WAY too long to get updates through Samsung and AT&amp;T. &nbsp;It took 9 months after Android 2.2 was rolled out to get receive an update for my phone. &nbsp;I still don't have Android 2.3</div>

            Thanks for contributing! Just because it is critical for you does not mean it is critical for all smartphone users and potential WP buyers.. I suspect that&nbsp;a majority does not even know what VVM is.&nbsp;However, I agree, VVM is not used/supported by enough
 carriers. At least VVM support for WP7.5 is coming to AT&amp;T (if it hasn't already).

<h2>            iOS &#39;Mail, Contacts, Calendar&#39; configures for &#34;Outlook.com&#34; but logon fails afterwards</h2>
                    
<p>About 1 week ago my iPhone 6 stopped connecting and syncing my contacts and calendar from the "Outlook.com" account.&nbsp; It has worked successfully since I last changed my password 10 months previously.&nbsp; I used to have a Windows Phone (previous employer) so
 I kept using the Contacts and Calendar that was setup previously when I received the iPhone 5s and then later iPhone 6.&nbsp; This allowed my contacts to remain device agnostic and it worked great for me!&nbsp; &nbsp;I've worked in IT as&nbsp;a System Engineer for many years
 so I did a little troubleshooting but everything failed.&nbsp; The bad password prompt continues to pop up when the Calendar or Contacts attempts to sync but NOT when I setup the account (which passes with green check boxes).</p>
<p>What I tried in hopes of resolving this:<br />
- Under "Settings" and "Mail, Contacts, Calendars" I deleted the profile and recreated it.&nbsp; It sets up correctly using the "Outlook.com" settings.&nbsp; After a successful setup (ID and PW are validated) it fails upon the Contacts sync, Calendar Sync, or mail sync.<br />
- Updated to the latest iOS 9.1 (I was one rev behind), started test over and same bad results.<br />
- I changed my Live.com password and started over again.&nbsp; Deleted the profile and recreated.&nbsp; Same failed results.<br />
- I changed my Live.com over to 2-factor authentication.&nbsp; I used the generated "App Password" and recreated the profile (many times).&nbsp; Same results.&nbsp; Tried new app password and it still failed.<br />
- I turned off 2-factor authentication and started test over again.&nbsp;Same failed results.<br />
- Tried on a wireless network (not cellular).&nbsp; Same results.<br />
- Tried on an iPhone 5s on a different cellular provider.&nbsp; Same bad results.<br />
- Tried the setup on a 3rd iPhone 5s that has no active cellular provider on a different wireless network.&nbsp; Same bad results.<br />
- Changed my password again to a simpler password.&nbsp; Recreated profile.&nbsp; Same bad results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What works?<br />
- The MS Outlook application works from the iPhone 6.&nbsp; <br />
- Logging in to "Outlook.com" via Safari on the iPhone 6.<br />
- This verified I know the password and that I am typing it correctly.<br />
<br />
I would really enjoy good support from MS on this one.&nbsp;</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />

10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

            <p>No that did not help. Is not that the alarm does not work. It's just that when it comes on. You can barely hear it. I have checked all of the volume controls and that's not it. All other sounds are normal. I have even tried other alarm apps. Also it seems
 to be stuck on the same alarm tune. When I change it back to default. The same alarm tune stays the same.</p>

 cant hear it. </p>

 SOMEONE PLEASE!!!! from Microsoft has actually looked at the numerous people who are stinking upset about not being able to have up to date virus and malware protection for their ****' Windows 10 machine.</p>

            <p>Dear StSteve11,</p>
<p>From your question I can understand that you have problems updating your windows defender. But it is still unclear that if you are facing problems with updating windows to windows anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not update to Anniversary update please do so as this will resolve many of your problems.</p>
<p>Anniversary update has:</p>
<p>Version: 1607</p>
<p>OS Build: 14393</p>
<p>TO check goto Settings&gt;System&gt;About</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have less numbers means you are not up to date.</p>
<p>To update to anniversary update do not depend on in built Windows Update as this may cause some problems.</p>
<p>Instead Update it through another Microsoft alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Download small tool from Microsoft's website</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client</a></p>
<p>Press Get anniversary update and this will download a small tool for you around 5.5 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step: 2 Once downloaded open it. This will check your system if it is compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: Donwload it fully and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:- This will require around 2-3 GB download data. Requires 20 GB free space in OS drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start updating from morning as this will take time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask anything.</p>

<p>When you release the mouse button, Excel will ask you to assign a macro. Accept the proposed name or specify a new one, then click New.</p>
<p>Make it look like this:</p>

<p>Switch back to Excel.</p>
<p>You can change the caption of the button. Then click outside it.</p>
<p>You can now try the button. If you want to edit it later on, right-click it.</p>

<h2>            Zoom in notes field of outlook contacts</h2>
                    <p>Help - I tried to paste a graphic into the notes field in one of my contacts, (which I have done many times before), and it has zoomed my notes field out so much that all the text is all but invisible</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Home &amp; Business 2010, and tried the repair facility in the control panel / programs, but that didn't help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all the notes I have written are still there, but so tiny, they all appear in the top left cm of the notes field</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to reset that ??</p>

<p>I have Win 7 v6.1 (SP1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution - I had earlier tried the zoom function and clicked 200% &nbsp;but it didn't do anything. I also tried zooming with the mouse, that didn't do anything either</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried again making the zoom 100% and the window reset to normal size.</p>

            Not all Service Points can do that so try another one. There is no way you can do it yourself without invalidating your warranty and it is against forum rules for us to discuss anything that will invalidate your warranty.

            If you're in a part of the world where Dutch is not an official language then it is not a fault in the phone if it doesn't support Dutch. It IS a user comfort thing.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you're in a part of the world where Dutch IS an official language and you were sold a phone that does not support Dutch, then you were sold a grey import. You should have a chat with the retailer.

            <p>I've only had time to skim through your query, so apologies if I've missed the point, but I believe you're trying to count items within date ranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case, you need to enter the v_count?=.... line(s) as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p>v_Count1=v_Count1+1</p>
<p>
</p><p>etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you simply want to increase the value of v_Count1 by 1 each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note - you have v_Count2 repeated in both the second and third IF statements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

            I believe that ByhamC has spotted the general problem - but I also noticed that in the last section where presumably you would want to be updating v_Count3, you are still updating v_Count2.&nbsp; Copy and paste will get you every time :).

<p>Hi Tejas. Here is how i hide my personal photos from gallery&nbsp; <strong>without 3rd party apps</strong>.</p>
<p>Open ZIP App. Just goto Menu-Apps-Office- Zip. Now browse n select the photos u want to hide - add to new archive and delete the selected original photos. It's Done</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can view those pics by opening the zip archive from Zip app. Add a standby shortcut. :-)</p>

<p>zipping is one solution i am already using it frnds..even it has option to lock files. But the case is we can easily see name of files files which are zipped even we lock them . this doesnt give complete folder lock option.</p>
<p>Well I installed media safe in between somehow..But in that while importing any image or video it is showing error saying that 'unable to execute file for security reasons'. Does anybody have ans for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or can anyone suggest me other software which can be used to hide or lock personal files/folders..</p>

<p>Hotmail seems to work fine in Mozila and IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your suggestion I tried to report the issue to Google. Then I accidentally clicked on Help &gt; About Google Chrome option and it's automatically running a system update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-launching the browser, the Hotmail - Outlook Mail (Preview) version seems to be back to normal now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all good now.</p>
<p>

<h3> kathyh.626  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 - spell checking issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Office 365 version 1711 Build 8730.2175 using Canadian English setting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spell check works fine in all applications except Outlook.&nbsp; this is what happens when random words are typed in outlook, Most English words are marked as errors but the French poisson isn't.&nbsp; If I use an exclamation point it automatically puts a space between
 the word and the mark. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/384b58b6-82f6-4711-95ca-7da08ffe46d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/384b58b6-82f6-4711-95ca-7da08ffe46d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Writing Style is set to Grammaire with NO other options available in the dropdown box. The "Settings" button only has French setting options.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the WORD application, the Writing Style option is set to Grammar &amp; More (with Grammar as an option in the dropdown box).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to change in Outlook to make it recognize and use English spelling and grammar? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mobile 6.5 Locking the phone. HTC Touch Tilt 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffsrealm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mobile 6.5 Locking the phone. HTC Touch Tilt 2</h2>
                    The only way I have found to lock the phone is hit the Windows Logo Key then find the lock button on the screen at the bottom. There is a setting under Settings &gt; Personal &gt; Buttons&nbsp; then the "End Key" tab and then Automatically Execute the Selected Action
 is the option, and the selection option under that is lock the phone. <br />
<br />
I have pushed every single button on that phone and none of them lock it. There is no "End button" identified in the manual, the help I have found on the web on technet says the end button is the power button. However that still doesn't lock the phone.<br />
<br />
Anyone with any ideas on simplifying locking the phone. Older windows mobile you had to hit the bar, button, thing in the center of the screen a little akward but doable. now with a multi button aproach it is a lot more difficult. It would be nice if the end
 button thing worked. Anyone with any ideas?&nbsp;

            Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
On the HTC Touch2 the locking is done via a press-and-hold of the "End-key", which is slightly different from just a press of the "End-key".
<br />
<br />
Could you also provide some more information on what additional software you have installed and what type of device, language and ROM you are rocking ??<br />
