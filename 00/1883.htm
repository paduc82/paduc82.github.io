<h2>            Update Preview Build 10074 to Windows 10 non-preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Pro technical preview build 10074 and would like to update it to the non-technical preview build version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows update panel under Updates &amp; Security&nbsp;I receive this message after clicking search for updates: There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for
 information, this may help - (0x80240008).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had Windows 7 Home premium on my device, but changed it to the Preview version of 10 after realizing it was only using one of my processors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running dual Intel quad cores&nbsp;at&nbsp;2.26 GHz (hyperthreaded) processors, if that is at all relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Like Windows 7 Home, Windows 10 Home will only use one cpu, although the number of cores does not matter. &nbsp;That has been true of all Windows since XP. &nbsp;Windows 10 Pro will utilize both cpus the same way Windows 7 Professional does. &nbsp;(By cpus I mean sockets
 on the mobo.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to utilze both cpus you need to upgrade to Pro using Add New Features in Settings. &nbsp;I believe the price is $99. &nbsp;The Insider Program and the Get Windows 10 program only upgrade you to the equivalent edition you were running before the upgrade. &nbsp;
 I.e., Home to Home, Professional (or Ultimate) to Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither program is intended as a free upgrade path from Home to Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing you need to do is to verify that your computer is permanently activated. &nbsp;Open a command prompt (right click on the Start button to find the command prompt). &nbsp;Then type&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>slmgr /xpr</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get "Permanently Activated" then you can proceed to the release build (10240) of Windows 10 Home by going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>and following the directions to create installation media. &nbsp;You can use either the upgrade or clean install paths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have installed the release version of Windows 10 Home you can do the upgrade to Pro from the Settings menu.</p>

            <p>If you never reserved Windows 10 from Windows 7 Home Premium and are running an
 by running setup.exe.&nbsp; Choose to keep Windows settings and files and do not use any product key during or after the upgrade.&nbsp; Skip past these screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you will want to eventually install the 64-bit Windows 10 Pro if you are not 64-bit yet, but if now running 32-bit, you will have to upgrade using 32-bit Pro also.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This will bring you up-to-date with the Build 10240 Pro install, licensed under the Insider Preview terms, but will show permanent activation and should also enable a clean install of Windows 10 on that device (unless Windows 10 Home was reserved for it
 at some time in the past).&nbsp; The clean install could be 64-bit if your hardware supports it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just brigs you up-to-date with Insiders who are currently&nbsp;on the Slow Ring who accepted the update to 10240 in mid-July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if activated installs of build 10240 leave the Insider Program, we have been told that the build will eventually expire, although the date for that activation expiry has not been specified.&nbsp; Once that happens, you can always upgrade to Pro, as
 has been already described.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"This is not a path to attain a license for Windows XP or Windows Vista systems. If your system upgraded from a Genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license it will remain activated, but if not, you will be required to roll back to your
 previous OS version or acquire a new Windows 10 license. If you do not roll back or acquire a new license the build will eventually expire."</p>

<p>SR.SudhirRaj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can set the rows to repeat at the top, but there is no similar setting for the bottom of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had this requirement, I would set up a separate worksheet with the appropriate top and bottom information.&nbsp; Then use formulas to pull over the data
 by passing the start row (for the data) to the formula.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I would use a macro to loop through the start rows and print the "template" sheet.&nbsp;

<p>So I have to make a lot of assumptions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Assume your data is on a sheet named "data" and the data that you want to print is in the range</p>
<p>
</p><p>A6:M1000&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 rows will fit on each page.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Assume the formatted sheet is named template and template has the start row in cell A1.&nbsp; It has the five rows at the top in cells A2:M6.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Then there are formulas in A8:M52&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In A54:M58 are your bottom rows that you want on every sheet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You have set the print area on the Template sheet to print the range A2:M58</p>
<p>
</p><p>so the macro would look like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub PrintData()</p>
<p>Dim sh as worksheet</p>
<p>Dim i as Long</p>
<p>set sh = worksheets("Template")</p>
<p>' now we loop starting at row 6 to row 1000 placing 45 rows in the </p>
<p>' template sheet on each loop (by updating cell A1)</p>
<p>for i = 6 to 1000 step 45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' the step is the number of rows to print</p>
<p>&nbsp; sh1.Range("A1").Value = i</p>
<p>&nbsp; sh1.printout</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to number pages and so forth your would need to add that to the macro.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your formula in A8 would look like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Indirect("Data!"&amp;CHAR(COLUMN()+64)&amp;$A$1+ROW(A1)-1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would then drag fill this in A8:M52</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the picture below I show the layout of the template sheet.&nbsp; In A8 to M52 I show argument to Indirect showing how the address would appear based on the number displayed in A1.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have placed this formula ="Data!"&amp;CHAR(COLUMN()+64)&amp;$A$1+ROW(A1)-1 in
 A8 and drag filled it to A8 to M52, then hidden rows 11 to 49 to make the picture smaller.

<p>SR.SudhirRaj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A macro could probably be written to get data from the form you show and copy it to another form (invoice) to fill in most of the form.&nbsp;&nbsp; You statement that your data could be in B13:H100 (or more) would indicate that this could be a multipage form/invoice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a good solution beyond writing a macro or doing it manually since you don't seem to have an underlying database.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my first answer that this is not directly supported in Excel would seem the best.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do want to pursue writing a macro, you should probably work with someone in your IT department or higher a local consultant as I believe it would be a highly interactive
 process.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>By coincidence I came across this person in your own area that is a data guru:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Preview Build 10565 VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR -solution&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just days after installing Preview Build 10565, suddenly developed&nbsp;trouble with the "VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR" and a forced system dump and response to Microsoft and system reboot. Aggravating.</p>
<p>Could not see any real changes that would cause such error, as it ONLY OCCURRED when I launched "HILL CLIMB RACER" from Fingersoft.
</p>
<p>All other installed apps seemed to work okay; but just launching this one caused the BSOD with the error and restart.</p>
<p>Checked installed updates for past few days, discovered that </p>
<p>KB 310668&nbsp;&nbsp; AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KB 3105216&nbsp; had just installed AFTER the build upgrade on 10/22/2015 -
</p>
<p>they were the newest ones and seemed to appear when my trouble began.</p>
<p>I uninstalled BOTH. I downloaded and installed the Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp; wushowhide.diagcab&nbsp;&nbsp; update from the Microsoft site&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;manually HID them to stop a reinstall after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It apparently is something in those 2 KB's that caused trouble, as my HILL CLIMB RACER works as before, with&nbsp;no trouble, no BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this will help someone else.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t to get to certain websites anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have encountered a problem with being able to get to certain websites.&nbsp; I'm using IE 10 Ver:&nbsp; 10.0.9200.16439IC.&nbsp; I am current with all MS updates, I'm using Windows Security Essentials, My OS Ver. is Windows 7 Pro x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is this:&nbsp; For Example, I type in Download.com and hit Enter and it responds with the following error:&nbsp; "This Page Cannot Be Displayed" and the suggests to check the URL, use search engine, and refresh the page in a few minutes, all of which I
 do to no avail.&nbsp; Other websites that this has happened to are myitlab.com, mail.yahoo.com (if go to Yahoo.com and click on sign-in for my email I get the same message).&nbsp; There is no specific pattern as to specific websites.&nbsp; For ex, I may be doing a search
 on a particular topic and click on a link and I get the same message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other steps I have taken: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried using other browsers, i.e., safari and firefox (current releases).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a post here with an answer from spirit ms mvp dated 9/12/2010 that looked very similar to my problem and tried&nbsp;EVERY suggestion she&nbsp;recommended and the problem still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even disabled Windows Firewall thinking that if there a configuration problem, by turning it off momentarily, I could go the websites I mentioned above.&nbsp; Alas, no such luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm at a quandary as to what the problem is.&nbsp; I'm hoping that I can be enlightened on how to remedy the very aggravating problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately you didn't link to the post you mention so I don't know what you did or didn't try but here's a few thoughts.<br />
<br />
Check your connection settings and make sure no proxy is set.<br />
Are there other computers connected your router?&nbsp; Any problems?&nbsp; What kind of connection?<br />
When you get this error on downloads.com try http://64.30.224.118&nbsp; Does that promptly open?<br />

<br />
Check your connection settings and make sure no proxy is set.<br />
Are there other computers connected your router?&nbsp; Any problems?&nbsp; What kind of connection?<br />
When you get this error on downloads.com try http://64.30.224.118&nbsp; Does that promptly open?<br />

I knew I forgot to do something (including the link).&nbsp; Ok, here is the link of the post I referred to:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/i-cant-get-to-my-favorite-website-anymore-please/7c057e89-d7f2-44b5-9213-3eb2606d6c8e">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your recommendation and tried the IP address you gave and the same thing happened, I still get the message.&nbsp; As to what is connected:&nbsp; I have two wireless laptops and a Kindle Fire&nbsp;but they don't connect very often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptops and Kindle haven't connected to the router since I started encountering the problem with my desktop. So I power both laptops and connected to the network and I was able to go to the download.com website.&nbsp; Both of the laptops are running Windows
 XP Pro with IE 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the laptops can get to the websites I have problems with it's pointing back to something on my desktop that's effecting IE 10, Firefox 18 and Safari 5.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially&nbsp;it seems to be pointing to a firewall problem, however I've disabled the firewall
 on the desktop and it still does the same thing.&nbsp; Once again, I scanned with Malewarebytes (today 2/13) and no issues were found and also checked the security essential logs and selected it to list "all detected items" and nothing was listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man, this is more confusing than an Agatha Christi Novel :).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this gives you more info.</p>

<p><br />
Try using the Developer Tools, Network Capture to see what is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; F12, Ctrl-Backtab, F5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, that IP address you were given shows me an immediate redirect to a host name.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your problem is your DNS that redirect would therefore fail and produce your original symptom.</p>

That seems incorrect to me.&nbsp; If he was able to open the site by IP but not by the URL it would indicate a DNS issue.&nbsp; If it doesn't open by IP either it would seem to indicate another issue.<br />

<p><br />
Did you try the test?&nbsp;&nbsp; See the redirect?&nbsp;&nbsp; The request will fail because of the redirect (if there is a DNS problem.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that if you find a host name which does not redirect by name and allows you to do a GET by IP address (this host, for example, even though its lookup involves aliases) that you would have proved something if the request failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we are arguing over a bad example of what we want to test and prove.</p>

Hey Robert:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the proxy settings and they are not configured.&nbsp; Just as a reminder, my laptops (connecting wirelessly have none of the issues like my desktop).&nbsp; My other browsers have the same problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also included the message that is displayed when I type in the IP address:

<h2>            Unable to safely remove the external drive</h2>
                    <p>There is this external drive attached to my system. The drive is sleeping. The disk is not spinning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to safely remove the drive, so I click on the taskbar icon to safely remove it. Disk starts spinning.... I can hear some head movements. And then voila! The disk is being used by Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You were not eve accessing it the moment before I clicked on that safely remove button! And all of a sudden I can not remove it because you started using the drive which was sleeping all long!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click again on safely remove button but no! Windows is still using the **** drive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what **** is using my drive? Is it that confidential that I should not know? Tell me the process so that I can end it! No! This feature will be added in the fall 2022 update of Windows 10... Until then, I have to use the same old **** OS, baked and served
 for 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple **** safely remove job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just plug off the **** cable. Can you use the drive now? Try to use it now!</p>

            <p>This will get you far**** As posted by MS it is BETA software and it will have issues and as Insiders we are testing such BETA software and reporting any problems and issue in a way that those issues will be looked at and improve or fixed in the newer upcoming
 builds using cursing and not reporting any details about your system shows what level you are at.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here from one of your other rantings:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Suggest that you drop out of the PREVIEW/INSIDERS program as we were all advised before downloading and installing BETA software that it may have problems. issues, glitches, deleted files, and if you
 don't want these issues don't install and seeing that you have been with the program for awhile I'm surprised by your posting, and suggest mod to look at this posting.&nbsp;</span></p>

            This has also annoyed me, not in relation to Windows 10, but Windows 7. Now, if I know I'm not writing to or reading from the device, I don't even bother with using the 'Safely remove...' icon, but just go ahead and remove it. So far I've never suffered
 the damage that I'm warned of.<br />

<p>Hi Kenny Green,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your issue, I understand only when you set full screen for your Outlook client, it becomes&nbsp;illegible. Please try to refer to following link to repair your Outlook client:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please confirm you have upgraded to latest version (File &gt; Office Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after you tried above, to check if any add-in may cause the issue, you can try to open Outlook with

    <title>Restart Page numbering with Continuous Section Break BROKEN &#40;Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aenw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restart Page numbering with Continuous Section Break BROKEN &#40;Mac 16.26&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Microsoft word since Windows 3.1 (!).&nbsp; I have successfully created probably 100s of document using multiple sections with page numbers that had different formats and restarted numbering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now using Word on a Mac and am unable to set the page numbering to start at 1 in a new section using
<span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><strong>continuous section breaks</strong></span>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to create the introductory section to use roman-numerals and start at "i" (which I can do).&nbsp; And then the body of the document, which has many chapters and appendices, to be numbered with Arabic numerals and start at "1" -- the typical set
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do not want to insert a <span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><strong>next page section break</strong></span> before the first chapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have chapter header styles defined to insert a page break before them.&nbsp; (So each chapter automatically starts on a new page.)&nbsp; Thus I just want to use a
<strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">continuous</span> section break</strong> before the first chapter but be able to set the {page} field to start at 1.&nbsp; I have been able to do it this way for years on Word for Windows.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Yes, the sections are unlinked.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Yes, I have tried this using the inserted page number (vs. an inline field).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Yes, I have specified that the numbering should start at 1 in the Page Number format dialog.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">No, none of that is working.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This just seems <strong>BROKEN</strong>. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is anyone else able to reproduce this problem?&nbsp; </p>
<p class="contentStandard">

<p>Unfortunately there is not one solution for all, a solution for the same problem may work for some, but not for all. The only option is to search this forum and select various solutions and try them out one by one.</p>
<p>Personally I have 2 PC,s on the Insider program, 1 laptop &amp;&nbsp; a desktop, both have been connected since the inception of the program, the laptop up 16125, was the most problematic of the two, but upgraded to 16215 &amp; the latest 16226 with no problems. The
 desktop has had difficulties with both, for 16215, I had to do a complete 'Reset' and now with 16226 I am currently in a continuous 'Restart' loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the updates are installed I have had very few problems and I am quiet satisfied with most of the new features being introduced, some of which I find very good and am looking forward the&nbsp; "Fall' release on my daily use PC,s, as long as MS get upgrade
 process sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am most probably a bit more optimistic about the release of the RTM than you are, I feel that MS are on the right track, anyway we can only hope.</p>

            Hi Arsian, I am an independent advisor and can help. 
<br />
<br />Under File&gt;Options you can change the application icon. When you compile into an accde, it will not allow access to design mode. You can control the menus displayed to the user so they will be unable to see the Relationships window.

<h2>            OneDrive Sync Issues</h2>
                    Hi. I have been having tons of issues trying to get my OneDrive for Business files on the browser synced onto my computer. I am running Windows 10 and have followed all of the necessary set up tutorials, and nothing is working. Right now I am getting stuck
 on syncing a new library. I copy and paste the URL from the OneDrive for Business website, then I am told that "We found multiple libraries for the site you provided. Select the one you want to sync: Form templates, Style Library." If I select either of them,
 it looks as if OneDrive is syncing something, but nothing ever syncs. Am I doing something wrong? Please help. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi Tessa,<br />
<br />
For syncing your personal OneDrive for Business library, given to "paste the URL from the OneDrive for Business website", it seems that you are using the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client. You may choose to use the new sync client of OneDrive for Business.
 It has more good features than the legacy one. To learn more, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</a>.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: We donâ€™t have to remove the legacy sync client. It can be used to sync other usersâ€™ OneDrive for Business libraries or SharePoint Online team site libraries. It can work well with the new sync client on the same computer.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as you mentioned you want to sync "a new library", is that another user's library or a SharePoint Online team site library? Please make sure the account which you sign into Office applications has Edit or higher permission in that library.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Tim</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I tried to use the new client as well before I posted this, but was getting this error:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf83647-5688-4b32-aa8e-e2a222d84f14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdf83647-5688-4b32-aa8e-e2a222d84f14" /></a></p>
<p>I couldn't figure out how to uninstall this "newer" version- my computer isn't showing that I have any programs named "OneDrive" installed at all. You said I wouldn't have to even remove the older client- what do I do in this case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your second question, I don't know the answer. I am using my OneDrive account linked to my University if that helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Tessa,<br />
<br />
Iâ€™d like to firstly explain that in SharePoint Online, we have two kinds of library: OneDrive for Business library and SharePoint Online team site library.<br />
<br />
We use OneDrive for Business library to store some personal files. We can share files with other users. Its URL is
<em><strong>https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user A name/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</strong></em>. If you want to sync your OneDrive for Business library, as Windows 10 already has the new sync client. You may find it via click the Start button&gt;All
 programs&gt;OneDrive. If you already can see a white OneDrive icon on the task bar. You may right-click it&gt;<strong>Settings&gt;Account&gt;Add Business/an account</strong>&gt;enter your work/school account to sync your OneDrive for Business library(<strong>Method 2</strong>
 in<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> the article</a> from my last
 post) .<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20cd4832-1536-4a06-97fe-065e6fca6b33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20cd4832-1536-4a06-97fe-065e6fca6b33" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The new sync client cannot sync other usersâ€™ OneDrive for Business libraries. For this requirement, we need to use the legacy one.<br />
<br />
SharePoint Online team site library are used to store files for the tenant. Users who have permission of this library can access it and edit/upload/sync files there. Its URL is<em><strong>https://domain.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx</strong></em>.
 SharePoint Online team site library can only be synced with the legacy sync client (groove.exe). If this is the â€œnew libraryâ€ you want to sync, please make sure when you access the URL with browser, you can see the sync button. And then click the legacy sync
 client icon on the task bar&gt;<strong>Sync a new library</strong>&gt;enter the URL&gt;<strong>Sync Now</strong>. To identify which sync client you are using, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.<br />
<br />
So, please compare the URL which you want to sync with URLs mentioned above, and then decide you should use the legacy sync client or the new one. Moreover, for the files in consumer OneDrive (OneDrive.live.com), we can only manually download them and then
 upload them to OneDrive for Business.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, Iâ€™d like to collect some privacy information via private message for investigation. You can find the message via the URL

<h3> af zero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel iOS Mobile App Update - SharePoint Online files shared with external email addresses</h2>
                    <p>My company has&nbsp;a SharePoint online site that can host files for people with extern/personal email addresses.</p>
<p>Using my personal email, I can log into the SharePoint site using a browser and it works fine.</p>
<p>There is an Excel file stored on this SharePoint site and I can view the file through the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I have is when I try to open up the Excel file using the Excel iOS mobile app.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I had no issues but now the app seems to be forcing a work/school login rather than a personal login so I can't access the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2nd phone that doesn't have the newest version of Excel, and it still works correctly.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if&nbsp;Wednesday's iOS Excel update removed the option to sign in with a personal account to a SharePoint online site?</p>

    <title>OneNote Class Notebook question about moving student notebooks between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leelooh  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook question about moving student notebooks between class notebooks.</h2>
                    <p>Hi! &nbsp;I have been using the class notebook add in for a semester and love it. &nbsp;I have six notebooks, one for each class period. (I teach high school.) &nbsp;Anyway, at the beginning of the new semester there were a lot of schedule changes, so many students switched
 periods. I want to be able to quickly move a student's notebook from one period to another without losing any of their content. &nbsp;I was curious if I could simply move the notebook, cut and paste, or something quick like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have found from OneNote directions is that I have to manually add and create a new blank notebook in the new period for each student, and then move one section at a time from the old notebook to the new one. &nbsp;This seems like it will take me forever
 to do this and is too long of a process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if I can just simply move one entire notebook from class to class without losing any content?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It may be possible to do this with an input mask, but I don't think I'd use an input mask for this.&nbsp; Input masks are really only good when you can constrain the input to one simple, regular format.&nbsp; I think instead I'd do two things:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restrict input into the text box to only the acceptable characters:&nbsp; {0123456789'"/ }.&nbsp; You can do this with code in the text box's KeyPress event, which will be called for each ASCII character typed in the box, and can cancel that character by setting
 the event procedure's KeyAscii argument to 0.&nbsp; Note that&nbsp;the procedure will also receive the character (e.g., tab or carriage return) that brought the focus to the text box.<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the text box's BeforeUpdate event, examine the value of the control (the user's entry) to make sure that it conforms to your allowed formats.&nbsp; You'll find the Like operator useful for this, but you may need to use more than one Like expression;&nbsp; e.g.,
 if it's "Like this" then it's good, but if not then if it's "Like that" it's good, ... , else (if it's none of the valid forms) then show a message and set the event procedure's Cancel argument to True,</li></ol>

<p>And - further to Dirk's comment - users hate input masks because they are slow and restrictive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, accept any input. If the converter function fails on an input, cancel the update and pop a messagebox that also displays examples of typical acceptable input formats.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'll qualify that a little bit, because people often forget a particular type of user.&nbsp; Data entry&nbsp;clerks *love* input masks, in a form designed for rapid data entry, because they allow them to enter data rapidly, without error, and without lifting their
 hands from the keyboard.&nbsp; Often these people are working from printed or manually-filled-out forms, and they get paid according to their throughput.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These days, this kind of data entry is much less common than it was 25 years ago, but it still exists.&nbsp; That's what input masks are good for.</p>

<p>Yes and no. For smooth operation - indeed for clerks - you most often also need
<em>a lot of code</em> to make it work as expected by the user.</p>

            Agreed.&nbsp; The critical phrase, as used in those article titles, is "with full validation".&nbsp; Input masks can (in appropriate scenarios) ensure that the entry is syntactically valid.&nbsp; It takes code to ensure that it's
<em>semantically</em> valid.

<p>Giving the problem a bit more thought, and considering you're probably going to want to&nbsp; convert the feet/inches expression into a simple number of inches, it seems to me that you may want to use what's called a regular expression for this.&nbsp; Regular expressions
 are not built into Access or VBA, but you can use them in your code by leveraging the "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions" object library -- you should be able to find some version of that library in the available references in the Tools -&gt; References
 dialog in the VB&nbsp; Editor.&nbsp; Note: if I were doing it, I'd add the library reference while I was working on the code, and then when I was done I'd change the code to use late binding and remove the reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are regular expressions for lots of different parsing problems published on the web, and I know there are some out there for this purpose.&nbsp; On the other hand, regular expressions are potentially very complex and hard to understand, so you may not want
 to get involved with them.</p>

<p>Hi James, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that cancelling or closing a Skype account will also delete its associated Microsoft account, that is why it is very important to go through the list of things you need to consider before you proceed. You may check the list and procedure
 of the detailed guide of account closure in this FAQ. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once an account has been marked for closure, there will be a <strong>60-day waiting period
</strong>before the account is completely removed from Skype's database. During this period, the account is still searchable in the directory but is considered inactive. Should you change your mind regarding the closure, you can cancel it any time
<em>(within the 60-day period)</em> by logging in to your account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need additional information. </p>
<p>

    <title>How to save a new version of a database and separate it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kc_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to save a new version of a database and separate it &#40;unlinked&#41; from previous versions</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inherited a database at work that has many previous versions saved on the network shared drive. We are using Access 2007 and want to save a new version of the database and separate it from previous versions of the the database so that changes to those
 previous versions will not affect the newest version. Yes, there is no need that anyone should do that, but just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also like to separate all of the previous databases from being linked to each other b/c it is kind of a tangled mess. I have read that to unlink the tables between databases you must delete the linked tables (in the database with the linked tables,
 of course), which will delete the link in the table and not the table itself; however, we would like for the previous databases to still have the tables in them in order to preserve them just as they are for record-keeping's sake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is V22Mgr, V23Mgr, V24Mgr, etc., up to V26Mgr, which is the current version of the database that we are working in. These, by the way, are the Back End (BE) versions of the database and are saved on the network drives X: and again on W:. I am told
 that the database was split in V22. There are also V24User, V25User, etc., versions of the database, again on the X: drive and on the W:. (Not every 'Mgr' database has a corresponding 'User' version (or Front End (FE)) version of the database.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These dbs have the original tables in them PLUS the linked versions of these tables right below them in the Mgr (BE) versions of the db and I can't remember what the User (FE) versions look like. There are some linked tables that are different from the original
 tables above. Anyway, these are all linked together in a mess. It's not just that you make a change in the V24User database that it will show up in the V24 Mgr database, but it will show up on all kinds of other databases--I'm still researching how everything
 is linked, actually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess none of this matters, I would just like to know how:</p>
<p>1) to save a new V27 that is unlinked and unaffected by the previous versions. Do I just hit Backup Database under the File menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) how can I unlink all of these databases from V26, our current database, and from each other so that in case someone does something in, say, V24, it won't reflect in V26 or in V25, or whatever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at many postings on the internet about this, but I am still confused. I would appreciate an answer as specific as possible b/c I am not sure what I am doing and am learning as I go.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for all of your help.</p>
<p />

            Taking off my database developer's hat and putting on my day job's manager's hat for a moment, from a business perspective moving the deckchairs on the Titanic is not going to achieve anything useful.&nbsp; You need to decide on the business requirements of
 the database and either create a new back end or decide which of the current files is the active operational back end which meets the business requirements.&nbsp; Remove all tables from a copy of the existing front and create links to the operational back end.&nbsp;
 Distribute copies of this front end to users.<br />
<br />
If the other 'back ends' are actually no more than back-ups then keep them in a safe location as such.&nbsp; To back-up the operational back end either use a custom back-up application (I'd be surprised if in an organisation of any size your network administrators
 have not already implemented this), or you can use a cheap and cheerful solution such as that illustrated in my BackupDemo.zip file which you'll find in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates simple means for creating either a single back-up or a set of dated back-ups of a back end from within the front end.<br />

            <p>What Ken and I are saying is you should never have gotten to this point in the first place. And we don't understand how and why you got here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let me say that if you delete a linked table you don't delete the table itself. The table will still remain in the file that was linked to. You just won't see it from the FE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, what you have done is create a huge headache for yourself by keeping multiple copies of the same tables. As Ken said earlier, the backend should only have tables and the front end should have everything else. While you might have temp tables in the
 FE for processing and performance reasons, such tables would not keep data permanently. Also, while you might have copies of your BEs for test or development purposes, there should be one and only one production BE that your FEs link to (I'm not counting backup
 copies).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I think you need to do here is determine which is your production BE. Make sure that has all your data in it. Then remove all other tables from your FE and relink to the what you have identified as production data. If you want to copy these tables
 into another file for safety you can do by exporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this has been done, redeploy the FEs linked to the production tables and change the process that has been creating all these copies.</p>

            This doesn't help anymore but sync rules always obey the latest operation which in this case was the erase all contacts from your device. So in order to have avoided that, you should have enabled the restore functionality from Ovi device settings.<br />
<br />
Unless you had a backup, they're gone.

<div>The videos are stored on the card it self but you cannot access them directly I would suggest you to use "get them all" app to download the video. Via this app you can view the video and aswell upload it to your PC over WI-FI network.</div>

<h2>            Cannot remove slide master animations</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to remove some silly animations that came with a company template but I cannot find a way to get rid of them. The title slide image and subtitle are animated for no good reason. I just want them to be displayed from the get go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to go to slide master but there are no animations shown, so I cannot remove them. I've also already tried deleting and reinserting the image and text placeholders but the regenerated ones again are animated. ???? Any more ideas I can try?</p>

    <title>Microsoft should create a Surface Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bump.frankie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft should create a Surface Phone</h2>
                    With the past few years coming and going, seemingly at an increasing rate, the consensus regarding the Surface line of devices is generally regarded as positive. It's no question that our society is embracing the 'one-service-all-devices' mentality, especially
 those of the Millenial generation such as myself. With the introduction of Windows 10, a foundation was laid paving a service that can work on a multitude of devices and bring the interconnectivity, that we have all grown so accustomed to, to the Microsoft
 community. Before Windows 10, generally, you had the 2 big players (need I really list them?) in this market really only competing with each other. You can, by now, figure out where I'm going with this - Microsoft should step back into the phone market with
 a Surface Phone. It was not that long ago when Windows Phone and the Lumia devices were out, however they are now essentially dead in the market. Just as the Lumia brand died, we see that the Surface brand is striving. To me,

            I hope a Surface Phone is built.&nbsp; Instead of trying to compete with Google and Apple, I think MS will have more success building something completely different...a device like the Microsoft Courier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            You're stuck with autocorrect. If you're in a rush don't send a text or email Save to draft and wait until you can proof read.

            <p>If you want to add your own word to the dictionary so that it doesn't autocorrect then you type the word then on the top of the keyboard it will give you different options and one with a plus sign in front of the word which you can add to the dictionary.
 If it doesn't come then just highlight the word as if you are going to copy and them you will get the word with the plus sign in front of it like +word</p>

Hope this solves your problem</p>

            <p>You can import or link directly to your Contacts list from an Access database (ACCDB or MDB). It's under External Data, More, Outlook Folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you can't update the table directly from Access unless you have the appropriate rights. One way to update the solution is to use code that can manage the Outlook folders. We offer that in our commercial Total Visual SourceBook product. It has lots of
 VBA&nbsp;code including stuff for Outlook Contacts: <a href="http://www.fmsinc.com/MicrosoftAccess/modules/code/Outlook_Automation_COutlookContacts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
