<p>Achievement language on the Xbox One appears to be derived from your IP address and where in the world it says you are. So changing console settings won't change the achievements languages.</p>
<p>This particular issue has been raised in the feedback to the Xbox team but no resolution yet. The only thing you can do right now if you must have English achievements is to VPN to a UK based IP or hold out for the update from the Xbox system team.</p>

<p>Ik heb indentiek hetzelfde voor...</p>
<p>Ik heb al eerder problemen gehad met deze ambetante settings, verscheidene games gedownload die uiteindelijk naar frans vertaald werden terwijl zo orgineel in het engels waren, geen geld terug gekregen en geen andere versie kunnen bemachtigen. Ik snap niet
 *** ze dit keer op keer op zo'n kortzichtige manier aanpakken... </p>
<p>PLEASE FIX THIS LANGUAGE ISSUE!</p>
<p>English is just fine, we are accustomed to it, all english TV series on Belgium channels are subtitled, not dubbed. French however is something totally different. I do not understand single word of it!</p>
<p>I know this is probably done out of ease, not prejudice, but this issue made me pay for unplayable (french-versioned) games before and now we have achievements, which we do not know how to unlock...</p>

<p>Btw: it's simply sad as the only and best working solution is using a VPN, no offense to Bazajaytee.</p>
<p>Such a big thing as language should not depend or be confined by something as banal as an IP address,</p>

<p>I can only speak for Xbox 360 but I think it is not different with Xbox One: VPN did not work for me as well! I live in Germany but I prefer playing games in English. And of course, I would like to see the corresponding achievements in English. So I changed
 everything. Language and Locale on the Xbox (English/UK), my (billing) adress on xbox.com (UK adress), my region on xbox.com (UK), my profile settings in my Windows Live account (again UK) and finally I used a VPN provider to give me a UK IP Adress with a
 server in London. Then I connected my Xbox to my PC with the UK IP adress using shared internet connection. I deleted my profile and recovered it on my Xbox. Achievements and menus were still in German. I even received a generic account security mail from
 Xbox support that someone tried to get online with my Xbox from UK. While connecting to Xbox live I had to verify my login data. So the console definitely had a UK IP.</p>
<p>I think the only thing that matters here is the country you indicated when you create your Xbox Live account. You can migrate your account to another country in the case of moving. But I just want to stay in Germany and see achievements in English. Funny
 thing: If you set your language to English, all future achievements are displayed in English until you have to recover your account on the console. Then everything just switches to your fixed account language and unfortunately I had to do this 2 times now...</p>

<h2>            Help i have a bsod &#34;The system encountered an uncorrectable hardware error&#34;.</h2>
                    This has been happening since i bought my hardware on 6/3/2013. I've been trying to diagnose this problem for 6 months already. it's a pain in the ****, i first thought hmm maybe it's my RAM and so i RMA'd it back to newegg and bought myself a pair of
 kingston hyperX modules and still no luck but i feel its a bit more stable :D _
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;My Computers specs:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Intel Core i7 4770k&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gigabyte G1 Sniper M5 Socket 1150 z87 motherboard&nbsp;</div>
<div>Kingston HyperX 8Gb X 2 1600 Mhz&nbsp;</div>
<div>Galaxy Geforce GTX 780 3Gb&nbsp;</div>
<div>SeasonicX 850 watt PSU&nbsp;</div>
<div>Samsung 840 PRO SSD 120Gb&nbsp;</div>
<div>Western Digital Black 1Tb HDD</div>
<div>F7 BIOS is still up to date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OS: Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I use a Noctua NH-D14 CPU cooler and it doesn't go past 50C My graphic card is also not overheating by any chance. It's around sometimes 17C. Yes, 17 C when idling on a cold day and usually on a normal day about 26-30 C Idling. Temps reaches mostly 60
 C on my Graphic cards and really never has much problems, not that i can think of.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I have been thinking that my Killer Nic E2200 was to blame this whole time so i tried updating drivers for it as i thought it was problem due to that and so i updated my drivers couples time and thought that updating my drivers my PC became less frequent
 on BSODs which it did but i don't know whether it's a coincidence or not. Just last month it didn't bsod almost 1 full month and then it bsods this sunday twice while i was watching 12 tabs of YouTube and playing battlefield 4. You guys would probably be thinking
 it's the graphic card but i don't really think so... But can you guys check out what the log says about the bsod? It's been driving me crazy since i bought my parts and I've tried couple things.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I've tried:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Updated all my drivers whenever available&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>RMA'd my Memory once before and tested my memory using memtest86 with 1 pass 0 errors though that might not be enough...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Doubt it's a heat issue as i have a great cpu cooler (Noctua NH-D14).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm kind of pointing fingers at either the graphic card, CPU, or mobo probably... Could be hdd or ssd? I don't know, i do not know what symptoms to tell whether its a storage device. Would be very happy to find out whats going on so i can return my hardware
 to where it came from and get a new hardware please ^^.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ALSO noted, once every while playing games watching youtube or just surfing online my ASUS MX239H monitor black screens for like 2 seconds. Could this indicate my graphic card is defective/Monitor...-.- Feeling like newegg sells defective merchandise but
 gots to be me to get the defective stuff. :(&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLANNING ON WATERCOOLING VERY SOON, so have to finish getting this problem solved. Yea, watercooling a gaming rig with a mATX board :(... Sad gigabyte didn't make a ATX form factor board when they first released the Z87 Socket 1150 boards around middle
 of May?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Feel free to download the .dmp file and have a look for me. I can't for the life of me find out whats going on. I try to be very technical but i guess i'm not that great with computers as i thought. I've tried using bluescreenviewer to see whats up. No
 clue always says the culprits are&nbsp;hal.dll ntoskrnl.exe and i don't know how to &nbsp;decode... Also reformatted my PC many times already. My OS is not the problem.

            I've finally resolved my problem. It's not drivers, BIOS, it was DEFINITELY hardware problem. I've been constantly trying to resolve it, i went to intel.com and talked to their support team and they went through the data within 3 days they said yep, its
 the processor. So after a week later i was contemplating on whether to send the processor or not. My 4770k, finally i decided, jeez i'm tired of these bsods so i did it and paid for UPS shipping about almost $20 and shipped from saturday and got there at friday.
 About a week and a half later i got my new 4770k and i'm happy too. nothing has ever happened again. No black screens, no blue screen of deaths, nothing. Feels great lol. I use Artic Cooling MX-4 now because the Intel processor i had before i used IC Diamond
 7g Thermal paste and i just didn't like how it smeared my processor copper shim. It's hard to wipe it off so i went with mx-4 and its doing good. It's like 2-4 Celsius higher than IC Diamond 7G. Sad :\ Oh well, at least no more probl

<h2>            Backlit Keyboard DELL NOT WORKING</h2>
                    So I updated my Laptop. I have a DELL 13 INSPIRON 5378 2 IN 1 7th Gen (Its not touch but it flips though) and after the update when I started my laptop again this black screen with the dell logo came up and a bar below it showing the firm update. So it
 got a bit slow(its not anymore) and while starting up and signing in the light just went off. Everythings working fine but I really want the light to show up back again and its not. Any help please ?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Keyboard backlight settings may have been automatically modified after the recent update. This
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/keyboard-backlight-for-dell-laptop-doesnt-work/0657f80a-5110-4b91-9005-dcbb23ae8c68">thread
</a></strong>suggests pressing the shortcut keys Fn + right cursor to turn on the keyboard backlight. If it wasn't able to resolve the issue, we suggest contacting Dell support for additional options because Dell usually has a Dell system manager for device
 configuration.<br />
<br />
If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime.

    <title>Disk Activity &#47; Polling with Windows 10 Storage Spaces Feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ottawa scott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Activity &#47; Polling with Windows 10 Storage Spaces Feature</h2>
                    <p>Greetings from &nbsp;Canada,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can answer my query concerning Storage Spaces. &nbsp;I setting up an external enclosure with 2 * 4 TB retail WD HDD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experimenting with &nbsp;the Storage Spaces feature and was able to successfully create a two way mirror of space using these two drives, similar to a RAID 1 configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed though that there seems to been frequent disk activity which is indicated by the enclosures drive lights. &nbsp;This is a regular occurrence and the activity lights often alternate between the two installed drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe there is any program per se that is causing this drive activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is does Windows Storage Spaces poll / access these shared drives as part of its process / monitoring of the drives. Perhaps this is the cause of the apparent drive activity. &nbsp;It should be noted that when I use these two drives as separate entities
 (ie like external HDD) the drive light activity does not occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback or information would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>S</p>

</p><p>To answer your question, Windows Storage Spaces poll does not access your external hard disk drives. It also doesn't affect its activties. However, to better explain this behavior of your hard disk drives, we suggest that you get in touch with the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also post this question to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft TechNet</a> as this query is best handled by their level of support and expertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further queries, feel free to post it here.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>I have Windows Storage Spaces in Windows 10, also in mirror configuration.</p>
<p>Both drives connected to motherboard SATA controller, and both are WD Reds 6Tb. Drives themselves have excellent health - no bad blocks, no pendings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage spaces is Drive (F:). Windows has no any TEMP and/or pagefile references to it. Folders aren't shared. Search indexing is also disabled for the volume.</p>
<p>The only current activity - is Windows Update (I've restored OS image from an old backup) - system disk is Drive (C:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Load on drive F is around 70-80%. It's strange. </p>
<p>The only suggestion, I have - ReFS does some checksum/chain/structure revisiting and/or rebuilding.</p>
<p>Like FreeBSD does scrubs on it's ZFS (though there, admin has to assign scheduled tasks to do this).</p>

<p>You see the following error code and message when you try to download or purchase content from Xbox Live:</p>
<p>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Status Code: 80153003</p>
<p>This may mean that the download or purchase failed.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>Solution 1: Delete old data and clear your cache</p>
<p>First, try to update your Xbox Live information by clearing your cache. You may have an older version of the item that you're trying to download or purchase on your console. Here's how:</p>
<p>Delete the Marketplace System Data. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage and then select your primary storage device.</p>
<p>Select System Items.</p>
<p>Select Content Cache and then select Delete.</p>
<p>Clear your console cache. Here's how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage or Memory.</p>
<p>Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select. The cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>When you're prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>Restart your Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>Retry your purchase or download from Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If you continue to receive this error message, there may be a problem with the offer on Xbox Live and you need to contact Xbox Support.</p>
<p>Solution 2: Delete the content and download it again</p>
<p>Delete any active downloads from the active downloads screen, delete any partially downloaded content and then try to download the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller.</p>
<p>picture</p>

<p>Now that the active downloads have been cancelled, delete any partially downloaded content. Here's how:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on the controller, then go to Settings.</p>
<p>Select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage, then select your storage device.</p>
<p>Press X on your controller for Deletion Suggestions.</p>
<p>Scroll through the suggestions and delete any content that has a yellow exclamation mark. The exclamation point indicates content that is incomplete or corrupted.</p>
<p>Now that the partially downloaded content has been deleted, try downloading the content again. Here's how:</p>
<p>Go to the Settings hub and select Account.</p>
<p>Select Download History.</p>
<p>Select the item that you were having problems downloading.</p>
<p>Select Download Again.</p>

<p>WMP doesn't have built-in support for syncing with an iPod. However, you could install one of the third-party plug-ins listed at&nbsp;<a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/Sync.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/Sync.htm</a> to add such
 support.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use iTunes, or Winamp's built-in iPod support for syncing.</p>

    <title>&#34;Reboot and Select Proper Boot device&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jord_j  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Reboot and Select Proper Boot device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>so I woke up after a night out and my laptop was on the floor, turned on but with a blank screen (back light was also on). I turned my laptop off and turned it back on, and after the Toshiba logo screen it returned to the blank screen and I haven't been
 able to boot my computer normally since. As it happened after a night out I am not sure whether it flung off my bed (probably this) or I installed an update and it messed up.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After messing around with a few things such as a) hold power for 60s to turn off then remove battery etc b) hold shift f8 etc whilst turning it on etc and c) hold delete whilst turning it on, the laptop goes to the "Reboot and Select proper Boot device"
 screen after the Toshiba logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite P750P755 running on Windows 10 which I downloaded around a few weeks ago.<br />
</p>
<p>Any solutions to the problem would be appreciated! I don't know how to check if the hard drive is broken so that could be a start?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply! I tried doing exactly what you said and the same screen came up after clicking "Start up Repair", see attached picture!

<h2>            100&#37; HDD slowing laptop to a crawl</h2>
                    Hi, I have just bought a brand new HP Laptop 8 Gig RAM, 7th gen i7 Intel, 2 TB HDD. Currently it"s not running much software &amp; that annoying 100% HDD usage has already appeared. I have already increased the virtual RAM ( should be necessary with these
 specs). This problem made me stop using my last laptop &amp; I'd figured after a year playing with Android you would have fixed this.&nbsp;

<p>When I got to the Processor power Management step I couldn't find Processor Idle.</p>
<p>All&nbsp; there was was:</p>
<p>- Processop power managment<br />
- Maximum processor frequency<br />

Plugged in 5%</p>
<p>Any suggestions before I re-enable everything?</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>while using HP Support Assistant to get you more detailed information for you, I discovered that there is a BIOS update. I'm downloading &amp; installing this &amp; ensuring that all drivers are current.</p>
<p>I will let you know if that fixes it. If it doesn't I will post what you have requested.</p>
<p>Thanks again Scott</p>

<p>Well unfortunately I'm still finding the HDD usage very high still (high 90%s usually 50%+. This is with everything still disabled. Only open programs Chrome, iTunes (playing music from HDD), task manager &amp; notepad.</p>
<p>I find that during the high HDD usage "Service Host Super-fetch" jumps up to 19-22 MB/s &amp; "Service Host Delivery Optimization/ Delivery Optimization" jumps to around 12 MB/s. These are at the top of Task Manager's Processes Display.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 No longer works through Sony A&#47;V Amp&#33;. HELP</h2>
                    
<p>Today i bought a 3 way power HDMI switch, like this one...<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmall.bfewww.com%2fbfepics%2fcyber-station%2fhdmi%2fB0613%2f4-3.jpg" /><br />
<br />
As i have 2 hdmi cables i use on my xbox 360 (1 for capturing and 1 for normal play), anyway the device appeared not to work no lights on the device and no picture on my LCD, so i unplug the device and plugged my hdmi cable coming from my Sony STR_DH800 AV
 amp back into the Xbox 360 but i still wasn't getting a picture on the LCD, then the feeling of dreed starting to come over me as i guessed that the 3 port hdmi switch might have blown something.<br />
<br />
I think i have covered all bases,<br />
<br />
Xbox &amp; HDMI cable works when plugged directly into the LCD - So not the cable or Xbox 360.<br />
My PS3 Console works on the amp - so not the amp itself<br />
My PS3 Console works on the HDMI input that the 360 was using - so not the HDMI socket on the amp<br />
<br />
I have tried 3 different hdmi cables but still no picture, im not even getting the HDMI icon appear on the amp when i select the xbox 360 input on the amp so its not even detecting a HDMI signal...BUT i have notice that if keep unplugging and plugging in the
 HDMI cable on the rear of amp the HDMI icon does eventually appear but i still dont get and sound or picture.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Have have now tried my brothers Xbox console on the Sony Amp using the same HDMI cable an HDMI input and his Xbox 360 get a display fine, so it must be my xbox, but i cant understand why the xbox works fine when i plug it straight into my LCD TV using
 the exact same HDMI but wont work when i plug it into the amp. Any ideas what could cause such an issue as because HDMI is digital i thought it either works or it doesn't there's no middle ground!?</p>

<p>Hi, it could well be a handshake issue between the console and the amp, did you try resetting your amp to its factory settings at all to try and get the handshake working again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Put the receiver in standby</p>
<p>On the receiver, hold down the standby button for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>After ‚ÄúClear All‚Äù appears on the display, ‚ÄúPress ENT‚Äù appears.</p>
<p>Press MEMORY/ENTER.</p>
<p>After ‚ÄúCLEARING‚Äù appears on the display for a while, ‚ÄúCLEARED‚Äù appears.</p>
<p>Unit is now reset</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that doesn't do anything for you then you could try resetting the display settings on your console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Power the console on with the guide button on a controller, as the console boots up press and hold Y and the right trigger until the console reboots.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi, yeah i have tried resetting my amp to factory defaults and also the video settings on the 360 but to no avail. I dont think its a problem on the amp side as the handshake seems to work fine with the PS3 console. This is a strange idea but possible something
 has become faulty with amps hdmi socket aswell at the same in the 360 HDMI socket and thus that why they no longer work with each other anymore. Its a shame i dont have another AV amp around to try out</p>

<p>Hey there Boots! I just want to point out that, just because one console works doesn't mean the other will. If the Xbox console works fine with HDMI to TV, but not with the splitter, then I would say it's the splitter's fault. As this is a 3rd party accessory,
 we don't officially support it's use here. I would recommend either trying a different splitter solution, or simply swap out cables when you need to.<br />
<br />
If you get a chance to try another splitter, please let us know how it goes. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mister Gwyther, i am no longer using this HDMI splitter hub, as soon as i noticed it was faulty and wasnt getting a display i removed it. BUT when i plugged my 360 back up to my amp i still wasnt getting a dsiplay even though i am no longer using this
 HDMI splitter hub!. So i think the HDMI splitter hub must have damaged something on either the 360 or amp HDMI socket.</p>
<p>But the plot thickens on this one, yesterday I took my 360 and HDMI cable around my mates to try it on his Yamaha amp and it totally worked fine, got a display straight away!. So now I'm really confused as I was sure it was some minor fault on the 360 but
 this would suggest its now my amp...or is it both. Is it possible some very minor fault occurred on both HDMI ports (360 &amp; amp) that now when they are paired together they can no longer work together but use them with any other device and they will be fine.
 Is this even possible!?, as at the moment it's the only plausible theory I can come up with!?</p>

<p>A bit more info on this, today i bought a 1.4 HDMI cable and plugged my 360 straight into my TV and was working fine at 720p BUT then i changed the 360 video to 1080p and i wasnt getting a display anymore...well i was but it was flicking on and off and more
 off than on. I then plugged a 1.3 HDMI cable and that was working fine in 1080p, whats different from a 1.3 to 1.4 HDMI cable that would cause this problem?</p>

            Thank you for this response. &nbsp;I had already checked the Windows compatibility site and discovered the sad fact about the adapter no longer being supported. &nbsp;However, I hadn't come across the D-Link revision and I have just downloaded this. &nbsp;It works perfectly
 ! &nbsp;Thank you so much - I was just about to buy a new adapter.

<p>I would suggest an upgrade with your ISP for a better result. What is your actual Ping, Up/Down? Go to speedtest.net and see. If you have a really high ping (lets say 250 &lt; ) then definatly get a better provider or an upgrade in service. Call the ISP and
 tell them the issue you are having. Maybe your modem is just malfunctioning. </p>
<p>This is the best I can assist you. Good luck and have a nice day!</p>

<p>Here is ther speed test.</p>
<p>I have other devices connected to this network with no problems. just the Xbox seems to be stuck on stupid :(</p>

<p>You could try toggling UPNP to enabled (or disable, apply, and re-enable and apply if it is already enabled) under advanced settings from within the Westell device administration page.</p>
<p>The error as mentioned is NAT related and independent from firewall functions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Varment</strong></em>, that's NOT the issue. He has a NAT problem where port 3074 is being blocked.<em><strong> beersykins</strong></em> is right, UPnP is a very good idea. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing connection problems, and the order and timing of the steps is important to success:<br />
1) turn off the Xbox and unplug the power supply cord from the back of the Xbox then<br />
2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).<br />
3) unplug power from the modem.<br />
4) Wait at least 5 minutes then replug the modem/gateway power.<br />
5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that light
 says it's ready, skip to step 7.<br />
6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may or may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.
<br />
7) Plug in and turn on the Xbox.&nbsp; For more background on Ports, see <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Assign a drive letter to the partition (Right click the drive in the lower pane).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will then appear in the Explorer view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also remove the drive letter D from that drive as it serves no purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to consider backing up your date to an external device and consider wiping down and starting again. If nothing else The Personals drive is full so&nbsp;reorganising the partitions (which presumably is what you were trying to do) is going to be safer
 if you know you have an external backup copy.</p>

<p>Right upon Windows loaded without any single click or further action, 3 popup/after-setup windows (all exactly the same)&nbsp;named "Hidden Start v2.1" (with certain unknown listings) appeared. And they were keeping on top of any other applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I could move them to the sides, and finally closed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though nothing further happened (so far), is that&nbsp;my computer had been hacked already???</p>

            Hello LeafPomelo, <br />
<br />
You can do a search in the registry for Hstart and see if you can find it and remove from the registry.
<br />
Go to Start search box. Type in Regedit. <br />
<br />
Click Ok if you get a User Account Control prompt. <br />
Click&nbsp;Edit on menu bar. <br />
Select Find. <br />
In the Find what box, type Hstart and click Find Next button. <br />
It will show Searching the registry. <br />
If it finds any entries, you can delete the key. <br />
The executable file is hstart.exe.<br />
<p><i><span>Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk...</span></i></p>
<p><span><br />
NTWindows is the manufacturers of the software and do have forums you can post questions about Hidden Start.

<h2>            Job Status window interface has stopped working Dell AIO printer 968</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new computer with Window 8, native.</p>
<p>Every connexion with my previous peripherals ran pretty&nbsp;well when automatically installed, except for AIO printer 968 from Dell</p>
<p>I installed a new driver from Dell, following accurately the prescriptions<br />
Scanner is OK</p>
<p>When pritnting I get this message" Job status etc."&nbsp; <br />
I have to accept two times that window search for a solution otherwise all is blocked<br />
Then it starts to print, but it prints only what is like html text and not plain text.</p>
<p>How can&nbsp;I obtain a normal printing without this message "job status etc" and with the whole text</p>

<p><span>From the issue description I understand that after upgrading to Windows 8 you are facing issues with printing using Dell AIO printer 968.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Outdated printer drivers can cause problems. Y</span><span>ou
 may refer to the computer manufacture website and try installing the latest version of printer drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows 8 drivers are not available, then you may install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>

            <p>I am having the same problem with the Dell 968 printer after upgrading to Windows 8. Installing per their windows 7 driver in compatibility mode doesn't work. After several hours of being transferred by Dell techs, I finally got a floor supervisor to tell
 me that it is a hardware conflict with windows 8 and the printer and Dell cannot and will not be providing an updated driver. He actually suggested that I replace my perfectly good working printer with another Dell printer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to know is if Microsoft will be providing a fix for this issue? I know that Windows 8 is a completely different platform than previous versions, but I am sure something could be done to allow it to use previous drivers.</p>

<p>I guess that if you change the name of the program which was at the root of the problem, it will not run and then the message will disappear.</p>
<p>The problem which remains is "what is lost when dldoJSW does not run."</p>

<h3> paulmckinley81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Watching online video causes my dpc watchdog error</h2>
                    The error only occurs when I am watching online video.&nbsp; Such as Netflix or Hulu.&nbsp; This only started happening after I installed Windows 8.&nbsp; The error never happens when I play games and I can watch any video as long as that video is not online.&nbsp; I have
 received this error before.&nbsp; After a day or so it just stops happening.&nbsp; Everything is normal and then out of the blue I begin receiving the error again.&nbsp; It's beginning to drive me a little insane because no one seems to know how to fix it.&nbsp; My notebook also
 sent the memory.dmp file and minidump file mentioned in the first post.

            Do you think it's an adobe flash error? Maybe after upgrading to windows 8, your flash plugin started malfunctioning. If you think this might be it, you could of course reinstall it.<br />

            <blockquote>The error only occurs when I am watching online video.&nbsp; Such as Netflix or Hulu.&nbsp; This only started happening after I installed Windows 8.&nbsp; The error never happens when I play games and I can watch any video as long as that
 video is not online.&nbsp; I have received this error before.&nbsp; After a day or so it just stops happening.&nbsp; Everything is normal and then out of the blue I begin receiving the error again.&nbsp; It's beginning to drive me a little insane because no one seems to know
 how to fix it.&nbsp; My notebook also sent the memory.dmp file and minidump file mentioned in the first post.

Hi Paul</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a simple explanation of what is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with streaming audio or video that uses interrupts, DPCs (Deferred Procedure Calls) are used to process the audio in each buffer as they stream in. If another DPC (from a poorly written driver or app) takes too long and another interrupt generates
 a new buffer of data, before the first one can be processed, a drop-out results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">Open File Explorer and navigate to the following folder.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">C:\Windows\Minidump.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">In the folder locate the latest .dmp file that was created when the error occurred.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">The file(s) will be in the following format.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><b><font><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><font><font color="#000000">031413-11419-01.dmp</font></font></span></span></font></b></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">The first group of numbers designates the date that the error occurred and the file was created (in this example
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">March 14, 2013</span></b>).</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">Right click the latest file and select
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Copy</span></b>. Go to the <b>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">Upload that file from the Desktop to your Skydrive or other file sharing website.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><span><span><font><font color="#000000">Post a link where we can download the file in a reply here.</font></font></span></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>We will analyze this file and try to determine which component is causing the error.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><br />
Regards</span></font></p>
