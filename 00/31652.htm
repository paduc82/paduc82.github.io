<p>Is there anywhere else we can submit general feedback? &nbsp;So far the application has been great to use compared to the old Lync client. &nbsp;However, audio notifications leave a lot to be desired. &nbsp;I use a bluetooth headset, which I'm not always wearing. &nbsp;Since
 the headset is configured as my speaker, notifications come through it only. &nbsp;I've missed quite a few calls and IMs already because of this. &nbsp;Obviously this has been seen as an issue previously - other Skype applications and Lync allow you to configure a separate
 audio device for notifications.</p>

            Hi 1justin_ncÔºå<br />
<br />
It makes sense that the voice of IM or call comes into the headset which you set up as the default audio device. In other words, it is recommended that you put on the headset for avoiding missing the IM/call.
<br />
<br />
About setting up separate audio device in Skype for Business for Mac, we have found little information. If you have more concern, you can submit feedback via

<h2>            How to disable the touch area on mouse buttons on my Laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Everytime I try to click on the touchpad button then the mouse moves because the button is a touchpad.<br />
For example: I want to click down the Copy in a menu, but when I release the button, then the mouse moves 3 cm away, it's on the Delete. That's annoying.<br />
<br />
I spent so many times solving that problem, I downloaded 2 different Synaptics Drivers but they didn't work.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">People say to disable the touch area on mouse buttons on the Laptop:</span></strong><br />
Here is a link of an example of the same problem:&nbsp;<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/229489/disable-touch-pad-for-mouse-button-region-on-new-hp-pavillion-models" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/229489/disable-touch-pad-for-mouse-button-region-...</a><br />
But the link above is for Windows 7, not for Windows 10, and my computer has Windows 10. Do you know how to solve that problem on Windows 10?<br />
Maybe my Windows just doesn't have the Synaptics Touchpad Driver.<br />
<br />
Here is a link of a Synaptic Website I didn't download yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.synaptics.com/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.synaptics.com/resources<br />
</a>In that link, I did go to&nbsp;Drivers but I couldn't find any download button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system:<br />
- Windows 10 Pro 64-bit<br />
- Acer Aspire E5-572G</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the missing tab on my Computer, there is no Device Settings with red icon on my computer:</p>

<p>Hi Manda Rajo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be a best option to contact your device manufacturer since there could be a specific driver that you may need to install in order for the the specific settings to appear. This issue is more focused on the manufacturer responsibility.</p>
<p>

    <title>Toshiba laptop not waking from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prestoncasey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba laptop not waking from sleep</h2>
                    I just got a Toshiba laptop for school, my 1st windows laptop in some time. And I notice when going from one class to another, the same class and same time of day&nbsp;in each of the 3 instances, I am not able to get it to wake from sleep. In every other occurrence
 It wakes from sleep just fine. Any&nbsp;thoughts&nbsp;as to what my be causing this? I also had the idea that disconnecting and connecting to Wi-Fi on our school's&nbsp;might cause this, and I&nbsp;am also experimenting with using hibernation instead of sleep starting today.
 Thanks in advance for your assistance.

            Hybrid Sleep is a deeper Sleep also requires waking just like Hibernation--a brief press of the power button instead of just a key press or mouse movement. Change the Power Settings in Power, Your power scheme, Change Advanced settings and make it do what
 you want.

            I have had it happen once in the last week and a half using Hibernate this time. Before I took the battery out and replaced it to resolve the issue I was able to get it to power back up by connecting the AC adapter.&nbsp;Could programs being open when I close
 the lid cause this issue. Also do you think using the power button to put it to sleep or in hibernate might work better. And finally, what is most likely causing this? This is murder on my OCD.

<h2>            Sleep mode turns off keyboard and mouse</h2>
                    I have a wired USB keyboard and a wireless USB mouse on my computer. I have set the Power Options for sleep mode under Windows 8.1 to occur after a certain amount of time. When I have returned to my computer when it is in Sleep mode after a particularly
 long period of time both the keyboard and the mouse USB ports are turned off and there is then no way I can resume from sleep mode. What do I have to do to have sleep mode work on my computer under Windows ?

            I realized just recently that Sleep is working on my computer, even if I change nothing in the default Power Management Balanced settings which I use and also accept the defaults in the Device Manager for my USB devices and USB hubs. It was my error to
 think that Sleep was not working for my computer on Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
What is hanging up on my computer is Hibernate, which the default Power Management Balanced settings | Advanced Settings has occurring after 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of inactivity ( Sleep triggers off after 30 minutes of inactivity ). When Hibernate occurs
 my keyboard and mouse shut down and the only thing which seems on is the computer itself, so pressing a key on the keyboard or clicking my mouse does nothing and I can't seem to get out of Hibernate.<br />
<br />
What is the usual way of waking up from Hibernate in Windows ?<br />
<br />
Even briefly pressing the Power Button, when in Hibernate, does nothing which I can see.
<br />
<br />
OTOH my computer, which is fairly old, does not support the ACPI S4 state, but only the S1 and S3 states. Could this be the reason why I cannot wake up from Hibernate ?

            <p><span>Hi Miguel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur if you don‚Äôt know or do not have the administrator rights of the user profile on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How many user accounts are present on the computer?</span></li><li><span>When you say ‚ÄúI cant log in as an Administrator‚Äù, are you not able to login or do you not have an administrator user profile in the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have an administrator user account on the computer, I suggest you to login or ask the user to convert your user account to administrator user account and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To give administrator permission, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Control panel</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Change account type</strong> under <strong>User accounts</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the user account from the window and click on
<strong>Change the account type</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Administrator</strong> radio button and click on <strong>Change account type</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and logout from the current user account and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have an administrator user account on the computer, b<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">oot the computer in
<strong>Safe mode</strong> and check if similar issue persists. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Reboot</span></strong><span> the PC to exit from
<strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)
</strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of not able to login into the administrator user profile on the computer in the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we
 assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<p>Hey there Miguel, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems. Other than the message "...we like to get it sorted out," is it giving you anything tips to get this resolved. It could be an error with the payment instrument.
</p>
<p>Try to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/payment-and-purchases/manage-payment-options-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Remove the Payment instrument and then add</a> it back to the account and give it another try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not work, Go ahead and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Xbox Customer Support</a> for further assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Both computers use Windows XP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases, the network drives were mapped correctly and worked fine for many months.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then, a couple of weeks ago, my work computer could no longer connect.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The message would say ‚Äúthe drive could not be mapped because no network was found.‚Äù<span>&nbsp;

</span>I contacted our university‚Äôs technical support but they are swamped and will not be able to reformat my home computer for several days.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have tried to figure something out on my own but I am not a techie.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have tried to restore the computer to an earlier date but got the message ‚ÄúYour computer cannot be restored to an earlier date.‚Äù<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also tried a safe boot.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After fiddling around a bit more, I finally found that when I tried to remap the network drives, the ip address of the server showed up in the ‚Äúbrowse‚Äù window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is, it says something like ‚Äúscience research 154.76.983.538‚Äù.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(I don‚Äôt recall that the address showed up in the ‚Äúbrowse‚Äù window before.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I selected the ip address for the folder to connect to, it worked, at least sometimes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(There are a few folders I want to connect to on the server, so I mapped to addresses such as
\\154.76.983.538\rgtd, \\154.76.983.538\dlm, and \\154.76.983.538\users\mary_smith.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried connecting this morning, the connection worked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I tried again a little later, I received the message ‚Äúthe local device name is already in use.‚Äù<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I just tried to connect again and now the connection is working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be grateful if someone here could suggest what to do or at least where to start.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Could looking in the Event Viewer provide any useful information?<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi, Im having an issue getting Open NAT with this router. I have UPnP enabled and NAT shows as open when I first boot up the console. However, I put the console in standby and try to play it the next day, NAT is shown as Moderate. Doing a full reboot of
 the console will set the NAT to open again. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I noticed that even when the NAT switches to Moderate in the system settings, COD reports it as open. I have checked the port forwarding table when NAT is displayed as Moderate and it shows 3076 and 3074 redirected to the Xbox One IP. Could this just be
 a glitch in terms of how settings is reporting the NAT and it is actually remaining open?</p>

<p>Place your Xbox One in Energy-saving Mode. The instant on feature can cause problems with your Router's NAT table.

<p>Same issue here...</p>
<p>Is this issue specific to the UPnP implementation on these ASUS routers or a more wide spread issue? I have been looking into getting another router for other reasons, and this would push me to do so if it would be a guaranteed fix for this issue.

<p>It's an issue with the Xbox One. When it wakes from sleep, it doesn't request the ports on the router to be opened again as it expects them to be already open, which they aren't.</p>

<p>When the Xbox One wakes back up it does not re-request port 3074. As others have said, COD shows an open nat and will request appropriate ports.. so this isn't really an issue other than the Xbox is giving you bad info.</p>
<p>I made a post recently about this in the update preview forum: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/wave_10_1502/f/5188/t/1906104.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I had the exact same problem with my 360 and my new AC68U after running a connection test. I followed the step by step instructions here to flash the UPnP and it worked. You have to make sure that you reboot both your modem and router each time that you
 disable and enable UPnP as well as rebooting your console with UPnP both off and on so the NAT tables can reset. Make sure to reset the console network settings to factory defaults first.</p>

<h2>            White Noise instead of Sound</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! My computer randomly started playing white noise through the speakers instead of system sounds/music/facebook notifications/etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried re-installing my drivers with no success and the speakers work on my laptop... so i dont know what it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an Asus m2n-sli motherboard if that helps...</p>

<p>What is this " White Noise"? I know it is difficult to describe a noise or sound through writing. But if I didn't understand this then how can I tell you about the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far my expectation about occasionally noise comes through a speaker due to presence of any Wireless telecommunication(even mobile phones) device existence within 5 meter radius of the speaker.&nbsp; This happens due to interaction between the telecommunication
 signal &amp; speaker magnet.</p>
<p>Please describe your problem or solution here.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the Modern UI Apps will respond to using the left/right Arrow keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use Ctrl+Alt+left/right Arrow keys.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />How did you get Windows 10 on this PC ?
<br />Preinstalled, migration from W7 or W8.1, Retail version bought ?
<br />
<br />To reactivate Windows 10,
<br />Select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation  and then select Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter can‚Äôt resolve the issue, 
<br />- if you bought your product key on a non Microsoft website, contact the seller for an exchange
<br />- else call Microsoft support to activate your Windows 10 system.

</p><p>I have done what you suggested "Select the Start button &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation and then select Troubleshoot." It's in my original post. I received error code: 0xc0000022<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 wired controller shows up as &#34;Unknown device&#34; in Device manager, and has no drivers installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Please read.</p>
<p>The gamepad used to work on my computer (Windows 7 Desktop) but doesnt respond anymore on my computer (Windows 7 Desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the gamepad actually works because i heavily tested it on a different computer (Windows 10 Laptop) on that laptop it installed istelf instantly and Responded to every input in a game, So the controller is not broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i need to install the driver manually because so i followed this video:
<a href="https://youtu.be/vivEdSPJm4c?t=190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://youtu.be/vivEdSPJm4c?t=190</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/vivEdSPJm4c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/vivEdSPJm4c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> But for me i get an error saying that the Xusb21 driver is not the appropriate driver for my "Unkown device" (xbox 360 controller) you can see in this picture what i mean</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f22e6be-71b1-4742-ac52-ba0cdc312ecc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f22e6be-71b1-4742-ac52-ba0cdc312ecc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The error windows called "V√§lj enhet" says "The specified folder does not contain any driver that is compatible with the device. If there is a driver in the specified folder, verify that the driver is for Windows for x64 based
 computers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also none of the lights around the Xbox button will light up</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont know how to progress from this point, Seems windows doesnt think i have the correct driver (Xusb21) for the controller, But i do have the correct one..</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other things i have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running CCleaner.exe on the registry, Didnt work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart my computer, Didnt work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested it on a different computer (Windows 10 Laptop) and it works on that computer but not my computer (Windows 7 Desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing ports: On some USB ports the controller wont show up in "Device manager" but on some other ports it will randomly (Not everytime) show up in "Device manager" as "Unkown device", So that doesnt work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install and re install Xbox accessories 1.2, Didnt work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried opening the properties of Xbox accessories 1.2 and set the compatability mode to Windows 7 (it is on compatability windows xp by default) and then install it, But that didnt work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Windows 7 64bit, home premium, service pack 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>right now my controller shows up as a Unkown device without any drivers (as far as i know)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be available here for questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced for any help!</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure what to do. I want to play ****! Ugh, sorry, it's frustrating as it was working perfectly fine a week ago...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can help, I'd appreciate it. I hope you fixed yours in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Killer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Have you attempted to launch the game with another profile? Also, if possible try launching the game while connected to a different network. Since Black Ops 4 is an online only game, there could be issues with the connection that may
 prevent it from launching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this goes, thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi XBF Ezra,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Das Spiel mt einem anderen Profil zu starten bringt leider keinen Erfolg. Ein anderes Netzwerk habe ich leider nicht zur Verf√ºgung, werde aber versuchen das mal bei Freunden zu testen. Wobei ich mir nicht denke das es an dem Netzwerk liegt. Es scheint ein
 problem zwischen Profile und spielsoftware zu geben. Unangemeldet l√§uft das Spiel stundenlang durch im titelbild.</p>

<p>Hey Milz thanks for keeping in touch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend (if it hasn't already been done) to uninstall and reinstall the game since this might be a licensing issue!</p>
<p>To Uninstall a game:</p>
<ol>
<li>
From <strong>
Home</strong>, select <strong>
My games &amp; apps</strong>, and then select <strong>
See all</strong>. </li><li>
When you‚Äôve highlighted something to uninstall, press the <strong>
Menu</strong> button on your controller. </li><li>
Select <strong>
Manage game &amp; add-ons</strong>, then <strong>
Uninstall all</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>To reinstall simply go to the Microsoft Store tab and redownload if it is a digital copy or insert a disc if it is a physical copy! Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!!</p>

<p>Guten Tag,</p>
<p>ich habe heute noch als letzten Versuch die Konsole mit OSU1 aktualisiert. Das Spiel st√ºrzt allerdings immernoch ab. Ich habe alle M√∂glichkeiten angewand die mir m√∂glich sind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Als letzte Konsequenz habe ich mal mein Profil auf einer fremden Xbox angemeldet und BlackOps4 herunter geladen, das Spiel l√§uft dort ohne Probleme. Ich habe direkt wieder meine Konsole eingeschaltet und das Spiel ist sofort im Intro abgest√ºrzt. Ich kann
 also sicher davon ausgehen das, dass Problem an meiner Konsole zu suchen ist.</p>
<p>Was kann ich tun? Konsole einschicken? Gibt es Gew√§hrleistung? Gru√ü</p>

<p>Hi Killer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out and keeping us updated! We appreciate all your efforts to resolve this. Regarding your question about setting up the console for a repair, we do have a one year warranty in the US for the console from when it is purchased. Here is
 a link on how to set up the console for a repair: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Getting your Xbox console or Kinect sensor serviced.</a> If it does not work on this page then please feel free to contact our support team at:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Us</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option to try is uninstalling Call of Duty Black Ops 4&nbsp;then&nbsp;press the Xbox Button go to System&nbsp;and restart console. Once the console boots up,&nbsp;install a small demo game from the Microsoft store. When the demo is installed, reinstall Call of Duty
 Black Ops 4. Test out the game and let us know if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps :)&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let us know if this helped</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            what does it mean if ram percentage exceeds 50&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    I use a program which notifies me about the usage of the RAM and it exceeds over 50% usually. The CPU exceeds 50% usually as well and the computer is usually slow. The processor &nbsp;this Acer T180-ED360A &nbsp;runs is AMD 64 Athlon x2. The capacity of the ram
 is 1GB and the hard drives capacity is 250 GB. I opened up this 4 year old computer and it's dusty; is it important to clean the fan? Can you please explain how?

            <p><span>Hi JJJanu,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which program are you using to check the RAM usage?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Run the fixit available in the link below and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Windows system performance problems on slow Windows computers

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can try performing a clean boot and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>After the trouble shooting steps please refer to clean boot link to put the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the following link to download <span>&nbsp;</span>the Microsoft Safety Scanner and perform a full scan on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: When you perform the scan, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup of important data before performing the scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. </span></p>
