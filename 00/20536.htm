<p>Sargedan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the timeframe in which this change happens ? Otherwise I would try to perform a hard-reset, just set-up exchange or IMAP e-mail, and see if it happens again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore think about which third party applications you installed, before you have experiences this issue.</p>

            Some email administrators do require a new password at preset intervals. Are you also running your email from your PC and do you experience the same behavior there? I too am running a&nbsp;Samung Jack. For my Outlook email running on&nbsp;Exchange, my administrator
 requires a new password reset periodically and repeating old passwords is not allowed.&nbsp;For&nbsp;my&nbsp;Hotmail&nbsp;email I am able to repeat old passwords but do have to periodically re-enter the password on my Jack.&nbsp;

<h2>            Moving linked Excel files</h2>
                    <p>I am creating linked files for budget preparation.&nbsp; I have a file for each fund (160).&nbsp; These funds belong to one of seven divisions.&nbsp; So I have seven division files that have formulas that add cells from each of the fund files within that divison.&nbsp; All
 the division files flow into another file for the entire organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done this on my hard drive, but now need to move them to a network drive.&nbsp; How can maintain the links when moving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, all files are encrypted.</p>

<p>But the most reliable way is to open all the files, and then save&nbsp;each of them to the network (Creating copies, effectively), saving the one with the links last. Then close them all except the one with the links, resave it, and close it. Then open the last
 one to check the links, and when you are certain everything worked, you can delete the originals.</p>

    <title>&#34;Outlook is not installed&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john calcote  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Outlook is not installed&#34;</h2>
                    I've&nbsp;just installed Windows Vista Ultimate on my new Lenovo W500 laptop. I don't really&nbsp;know why everyone complains about Vista - I love it. Except when&nbsp;things&nbsp;don't work right, which isn't often. But the problem is that Vista is so new that there aren't
 many answers out there on the&nbsp;net yet.<br />
<br />
After a clean install of Vista 32-bit, I installed Office Professional Plus 2007 and then Windows Mobile Device&nbsp;Center.&nbsp;I plugged in my Motorola Q Global (9h) and waited while Vista installed drivers for it. After a while, it showed up in WMDC.
<br />
<br />
When I selected "setup your device", the "Contacts",&nbsp;"Calendar", "EMail", and "Tasks" options were all greyed out, with the text, "Outlook has not been installed." beneath each option. Since I had previously installed Outlook 2007, I don't think that's&nbsp;really
 the&nbsp;problem.<br />
<br />
The first time I opened&nbsp;Outlook,&nbsp;it immediately crashed. The second time I tried it, I got a dialog box that told me that the mobile device service had caused the crash. I disabled it. Thus, I assumed that WMDC was not seeing Outlook because that Outlook add-in
 had been disabled.<br />
<br />
So I set about finding out why it caused a crash. Some thread in some forum somewhere mentioned that Apple iTunes add-ins had caused problems. Well, I did install iTunes, so I disabled the two (2!) iTunes Outlook add-ins and reenabled the mobile device service
 add-in. This time Outlook didn't crash, so&nbsp;I assumed I was back in business. <br />
<br />
No such luck. As far as WMDC is concerned, Outlook still does not exist on my laptop!<br />
<br />
I've tried all the profile management techniques already discussed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/459e592a-8087-4a59-9322-ded24539a12a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/459e592a-8087-4a59-9322-ded24539a12a</a>.
 None of these tips had any effect. <br />
<br />
I've also tried repairing Office 2007. Again, no such luck. I've tried reinstalling both Office 2007 and WMDC. Still no luck.<br />
<br />
Judging by the shear number of questions about this particular issue that have yet to be answered, I'm guessing that MS is in the dark on this issue also. Can anyone tell me anything else I can try?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            Linley,<br />
<br />
I hate to say this (because I still think this is a general problem with WMDC and Outlook), but I no longer need to solve the problem.
<br />
<br />
In messing around with regsvr32.exe, I managed to hose my entire laptop - it would come up in safe mode, but when brought up in normal mode, windows would continually blue-screen and restart.
<br />
<br />
Since this was a newly configured system with very little data, it didn't really bother me, except for the time spent reinstalling Vista and Office.
<br />
<br />
Regardless, I was able to get WMDC to (finally!) recognize that Outlook was indeed installed. Here's what I had on my system:<br />
<br />
1. Vista SP1<br />
2. Just enough drivers to clean up Device Manager - most of them installed from DM. Those that wouldn't install that way, via their own installers.<br />
3. Office Pro Plus 2007<br />
4. Windows Update Critical, Recommended and a few optional updates.<br />
5. I opened Outlook and ran through the startup process.<br />
6. I plugged in the phone and allowed drivers to self-install.<br />
7. WMDC 6.1<br />
<br />
Finally, at this point, when I clicked on Setup in WMDC it showed the outlook options as being available and checked by default.<br />
<br />
Thanks for working with me. I really hope others will continue to ask for help on this issue.<br />

<h2>            Downgrading Nokia 5230 firmware&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded and installed the latest 20.0.005 update for my Nokia 5230, and it offered nothing in the way of performance gains and new features, but instead slowed the device down and removed the ability to skip through more than 4 songs per use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to downgrade from 20.0.005 to good old 12.X.XXX?</p>

<p>It isn't possible to roll back firmware updates. I would suggest you try the *#7370# reset which I would recommend doing after firmware updates. Remember to backup your data.</p>

<p>For some reason, all of a sudden I am seeing a box pop up while using my Outlook 2003 that says "Could not complete the operation. One or more parameter values are not valid".</p>
<p>Often, I see that it has popped up when&nbsp;I come back after&nbsp;I have been away from the computer</p>
<p>I don't know what I might have changed in my settings that may have caused this to happen. When I have this site's window open over the top of Outlook and the box, if I click the Reminders link down below beside the START button, it pops up that little error
 box along with the Reminders box.</p>
<p>When I see this box, I just click the OK button (the only button) and Outlook seems to run just fine.</p>
<p>I have noticed that it pops up that same box twice in a row when it pops it.</p>

<h2>            Mouse Pointer keeps disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus windows 10 which I purchased last fall. Today the mouse pointer on the screen froze and&nbsp;did a &nbsp;disappearing act. I looked for fixes and even uninstalled&nbsp;the auto touch pad and reinstalled it. The pointer came back&nbsp;after a reboot&nbsp;only to disappear
 again. Anything other ideas to try in resolving this issue?</p>

&nbsp; </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That happens with some Touch pads.&nbsp; They appear too much to the OS as Touch support, so the mouse pointer is unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a Ctrl- key you can turn on a Mouse Properties Accessibility option called Mouse Sonar and use a press of a Ctrl- key
 to let you know where the mouse pointer is.&nbsp; If you have a real keyboard or at least some emulation of a real Numeric keypad you could use Mousekeys to act as a real mouse to move the pointer and let it show that way.&nbsp; Otherwise get a real mouse and just use
 your Touch pad for Touch things such as scrolling and semantic zoom (if your Touchpad supports that).</p>

<p>Hi, sorry for the delay - I forgot that I posted this problem here and probably did not&nbsp;ask for an email notification when someone answers.&nbsp; Just went to an EE shop again [today] to complain [again].&nbsp; Different staff but&nbsp;they also had never heard of this
 problem&nbsp;before.&nbsp; They did say that the email accounts are set up on the Nokia server, so check there - so I am.&nbsp; In answer to your point, NO, no SIM change, just didn't check the emails for a couple of weeks using my phone and - **bleep**!&nbsp;&nbsp;the email accounts
 disappeared!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other clues?&nbsp; Does Nokia have a login area where settings for email accounts on mobiles may be altered?&nbsp; etc.???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DB</p>

            <p>First, Continuum would work best with apps that make the best out of all possible screen real estate. The Office apps are a great example of this.
</p>
<p>A recommendation is that it would be great to be able to plug an Xbox One controller to the display dock would great for games such as Asphalt 8.</p>
<p>If I could use any on my phone with continuum not available today it would be the various Photo editing apps as it would be extremely helpful to edit the great Photos that Windows Phones provide on a larger screen.</p>
<p>If I could use app that I have one my laptop/PC it would be obviously all the apps I can run on PC/laptop like full Photoshop or Office it would be great to carry around a phone with the power of a full PC in a phone instead on luging a big heavy equivalent
 all around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting us share our thoughts and hoping to see improvements in the future.</p>

            <p>Gaming is a strong suit for continuum, as much as productivity. Having the ability to stream my Xbox to my phone or to my Continuum docked experience, would be great. Continuum would also be good for turning the device into a micro-console, with Xbox features
 carrying through, such as playing a game and snapping (a less resource intensive) app like Messaging to the side (or Skype or friends list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making all Windows 10 Mobile devices into a portable (handheld) Xbox, a micro-console version of an Xbox (probably powerful enough for classic Xbox games), and a dockable, streaming Xbox thin-client, would all be killer features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as a productivity feature, I use a lot of Visual Studio. If I can have a light-weight coding environment with light compilation on device or large compilation on a build server, that would also be cool. If not, VPN + RDP.</p>

            Continuum would be greatest if I had the ability to use win32 apps. Wouldn't it be great to be able to launch&nbsp;an .exe file from your phone on your big screen TV?

            Hi, thanks for the prompt reply.&nbsp; I did a copy &amp; paste so everything which is in italics has been copied exactly as it was in the second e-mail which is identical to the first e-mail except for the different e-mail address.&nbsp; It takes me to the following
 web address&nbsp; <a href="http://cyberguy.web.tr/xxxxxxxxxxxaccount-update-date.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://cyberguy.web.tr/xxxxxxxxxxxaccount-update-date.html</a>&nbsp; and the screen is the outlook log in screen.&nbsp; I didn't log in or anything at that screen although I did this morning.&nbsp; After that, I went and immediately changed my password.&nbsp; I have previously
 set up two linked e-mail accounts and my mobile so I get a notification if someone has changed the password and security details.&nbsp; The only notification I've had today is the one from this morning when I changed the password.&nbsp; Hope all of that information
 helps.&nbsp; I'm not very computer knowledgable.&nbsp; Oh, I don't know about the status bar thing you've asked about.&nbsp; Many thanks.

            Hi, many thanks for the prompt reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did click on the link this morning and I did try to log in as it took me to an outlook log in screen.&nbsp; I didn't actually get anywhere because I got an error saying there were connection problems.&nbsp;
 I did, however, immediately, change the password.&nbsp; I have, unfortunately, clicked on it again.&nbsp; Should I go in and change the password again?&nbsp; I've got the security set for two other e-mail addresses and also my mobile number and the only notification I've
 had today is when I changed the password.&nbsp; Many thanks.

            First, Microsoft won't ever send you a message requesting your credentials. &nbsp;Second, the links in any message from Microsoft will always point to a Microsoft domain. &nbsp;You can simply hover the pointer over the link to show the link destination without clicking
 it.

            <p>Finally someone found the solution without any extra addins.</p>
<p>http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/7205-mail-merge-wont-email.html</p>
<p>You have to change the key in the local machine registry (you need administrative rights for this).</p>
<p>I quote:</p>
<p>"I had this problem and solved it by changing <em><strong>HKLM</strong>\Software\Clients\Mail - Default</em> to be "Microsoft Outlook" instead of "Windows Mail".
<br />
<br />
Even though <em><strong>HKCU</strong>\Software\Clients\Mail</em> - Default said "Microsoft Outlook", I could not email mail merged documents as HTML unless I changed the
<strong>HKLM</strong> key."</p>
<p>..instead of "every other mail program".</p>
<p>Why can't Microsoft fix this ?!? Or why does it behave like this ? It should ask the user key not the machine key!</p>
<p>I had the same problem with Outlook 2013/Word 2013 32bit SP1.</p>

                    Hello:&nbsp; I recently received a laptop with windows 7 for Christmas.&nbsp; Please bear with me as I am pretty much computer illiterate!!&nbsp; My problem is that when I go to certain websites I am unable to see images on those sites (including my own business swebsite&nbsp;
 well as&nbsp;&nbsp; By images I dont mean photos that have been uploaded but rather certain graphics etc. which are part of the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with these websites on my desk top (Windows XP) but only on the laptop with 7.&nbsp; I am sure its just something simple
 that I have turned on or off, but I really cannot figure it out!!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks if you can help!!!&nbsp; And I apologize if its something simple I have overlooked..as I said, I don't have much computer experience!!!&nbsp;

            Fit to page&nbsp;not supported directly. Have you checked the Printer options? Because Outlook 2007 and 2010 use Word's print engine for everything, it would need to come from the printer options.

            I must have a device that supports the language. If your device doesn't have support for devnagari then you won't be able to unless you can find a third party that has created an add on for the language.&nbsp;

            You've asked this in the Microsoft Access forum, which is a forum devoted to the database product. You will get better suggestions asking this in the Outlook forum, or perhaps the general Office forum.

            Repairing and re-installing rarely fixes problems with Word because the Word program files are rarely the problem. Before attempting any correction always address the problems created by the crash - especially in Word 2003, which does not clean up after
 itself. See <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</a> then

<h2>            Help with fixing Word to normal sized page look</h2>
                    <p>When I open Word, is opened with the actual page as half of the possible screen in the Word window. I've clicked and changed views a few times, and it fixed, but now it won't. I've tried opening several saved documents as well as new documents and they all
 end up looking like this. Is there any way to fix it? It is very hard to read, edit or type documents with this view.

<h2>            Print to OneNote 2016, but I have OneNote 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the Microsoft Office 2013 suite (on Windows 10), but recently opted to try try Microsoft Office 365 since I need to use Visio.&nbsp; I downloaded the software, since the online version didn't meet my needs, and it seems to have messed up some of my
 settings, unfortunately.&nbsp; I had a great system of printing powerpoints to OneNote (I'm a student), but now that no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps incorrectly, I think that the problem stems from this: in powerpoint, when I try to print, it says "Print to OneNote 2016", but I'm running OneNote 2013.&nbsp; I admittedly don't remember what the print dialogue was from before, so I can't say if this
 has changed since I installed the Visio trial.&nbsp; If I try to insert a printout from OneNote (2013) directly, I get an error message that "The Send to OneNote print driver was not installed properly" and to try repairing it through the Apps and Features function
 (which I tried, to no avail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found support for this issue elsewhere, neither on this forum or others, so I apologize if this problem has already been trouble-shooted (trouble-shot?).&nbsp; I guess I'm looking for a OneNote 2013 printer driver?&nbsp; Or maybe not, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open the powerpoint in PowerPoint 2013, and try to print/send to OneNote 2013, but this isn't an option - only Send to OneNote 2016 is available.&nbsp; I encounter the same issue when trying to 'send to OneNote' from Word 2013 and Excel 2013.&nbsp; I don't even
 have OneNote 2016 on my computer: just the OneNote for Windows 10 app, and OneNote 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Visio from the Microsoft website.&nbsp; I started the online trial (30 days) for Office 365, and then installed the Visio software through the account I made for that.&nbsp; I'm not sure how better to describe what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not - I suspect this is the answer that I'm looking for though!&nbsp; How do I update the Office suite and printer driver?&nbsp; I couldn't find a printer driver for OneNote 2013 online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!</p>

<p>Sounds like a typical result from installing different Office versions.</p>
<p>I assume your <strong>Send to OneNote 2013</strong> is missing from <strong>Devices and Printers
</strong>in <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>What helps typically is a <strong>Repair </strong>of the older installation, in your case
<strong>Office 2013</strong>, starting from <strong>Programs and Features </strong>
in <strong>Control Panel.</strong></p>

    <title>Nokia Asha 201 Downloading Themes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roguecroce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Asha 201 Downloading Themes</h2>
                    
<p>The Nokia Asha 200/201 are relatively new phones. Their software is quite slow &amp; I've found that the my Asha 201 is prone to java error messages when it runs out of memory. One of the main problems which, I have come across of the past fortnight or so, is
 that most of the themes available are not really for the Asha 201. Yes, they may actually have been designed for the Symbian S40 320x240 version 5/6, but the actual size of the themes is far to large &amp; the themes to complex for the Asha to handle. The theme
 may install OK and it may even look great, but try surfing the WAP or using the media player and you will find that your phone can't cope because it has run out memory. One of the first issues you will notice is that your media player will no longer load due
 to lack of memory. Another issue is that after a brief period of surfing you with lose connection and receive an java error message. Please, take my advice &amp; leave those themes alone. Even on the ovi.store website, most the themes that may work with a Symbian
 S40 OS are far to large for the Asha 201. For a theme to work it most not be larger than 290mb. But, even them I've found most will not allow the media player to load.</p>

Hi Tuku,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums.<br />
<br />
I can confirm the Asha 201 isn't a dual Sim device. You can find out more about the Asha 201 from the below:<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha201/</a><br />
<br />
If you are looking for a dual Sim phone the Asha 200 is such a device. You can find out more on the below link:<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha200/</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
Regards<br />

<p>This is a sidenote, but I must point out that the device is based on Series 40 which has nothing to to do with Symbian, so first thing would be to check that you have been themes that are actually optimized for correct device.&nbsp; There is a fairly limited
 amount of free memory in Asha 200/Asha 201, so themes that are too large may be indeed problematic. If you downloaded the themes from Nokia Store and they were marked as being compatible for Asha 200/201, then especially it would be a good idea to send feedback
 about the problems to the author of the theme (and/or to Nokia Store support).</p>

    <title>N82 Lock Code error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slc87  say:</h3>
<h2>            N82 Lock Code error</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has had trouble with the N82 lock code. I know the original was 12345 and I was using that for a few weeks and yesterday decided to change it. Now despite multiple tries it will not let me in. I appreciate that I may have entered the
 wrong code when I changed it but surely to enter it twice incorrectly during the change process is unlikely.<br />
<br />
I know my best bet is probably to try a nokia care centre but I wanted to see if:<br />
1) anyone else had experienced this and;<br />
2) if there is anything I can try at home before having to pay to have it done by nokia?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a second question too. Is there any way to get the contacts name in the message inbox to read first name, second name instead of vice versa?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            If the new code you changed your security code to is longer than 5 characters, try using the first 5.

    <title>Reply to All Keyboard Shortcut - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reply to All Keyboard Shortcut</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
‚åò(Command) + Shift + R used to allow me to reply to all. Now, it only works with the first email I open after starting Outlook. After that, no dice. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Btw, it's strange that this shortcut, and many others, is not in any of the drop-down menus of outlook. I learned them here: http://www.groovypost.com/howto/microsoft/mac-outlook-2011-keyboard-shortcuts-cheat-sheet/<br />
<br />

<ul class="message-user-info-affiliations-list">

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            That's the correct keyboard command for Reply All. You'll find it
    under the <b>Message</b> menu.<br />
    <br />
    When you first launch Outlook verify that you see the command and
    then reply to everyone on a message. When this stops working check
    the menu again. Is the command still there? If not then I suspect
    you may have a Service that's usurping it. You can look for those in
    <b>Apple</b> menu --&gt; <i>System Preferences...</i> --&gt; <b>Keyboard</b>
    --&gt; <b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b> tab --&gt; <i>Services</i>.<br />
    <br />
    Hope this helps!<br />
