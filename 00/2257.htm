<h2>            Sharepoint Online profile photos not syncing with outlook, delve, skype etc</h2>
                    <p>Hello, we are having a problem with sharepoint not syncing profile pics from the rest of the office365 services.&nbsp; When a user adds or updates their office 365 pic through outlook.com it syncs across skype, delve and other office365 services except sharepoint
 online.&nbsp; I have waited over 3 days for the sync to happen, as I've read it could take up to 72 hours, but nothing has updated.&nbsp; I have gone into the sharepoint admin page and set a user's "picture exchange sync state" to 1.&nbsp; I even tried setting it to 0 first,
 saved and went back in to set it to 1.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rob</p>

<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this issue. Based on your description, you can see the picture in Delve, Skype and other Office 365 service. And you upload the picture in Outlook,
 it will sync to SharePoint Online eventually. If you already waited for 72 hours and still can‚Äôt see picture in SharePoint, we suggest you try to upload this picture again and see the result.

<p>To be clear this is happening with all users.&nbsp; I have tried this with multiple users and waited 72 hours.&nbsp; You want me to try this again and wait another 72 hours to see if works even though nothing has changed?&nbsp; Are there any other suggestions in the meantime?</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience the issue causes. Ivy has transferred the thread to me, and I have checked all the conversation history between you and Ivy carefully. I‚Äôm glad to help you, and I will keep following the thread for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this case, you mentioned that you changed the photo from outlook.com, so, I assume you have the Exchange Online license assigned. If so, refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Information-about-profile-picture-synchronization-in-Office-365-20594d76-d054-4af4-a660-401133e3d48a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Information about profile picture synchronization in Office 365</a>, generally, SharePoint Online user photo is synced from Exchange Online if the user has Exchange Online license. And the maximum sync time is 24 hours. As you have waited for more than 72 hours,
 it seems the user profile photo synchronization is stuck when SharePoint Online wants to update photo from Exchange Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the sync stuck issue, changing user photo directly from SharePoint Online user profile properties may get rid of the stuck issue sometimes. To try this, you can follow the steps below to change for one user account first to see the result.
</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Go to SharePoint admin center &gt; Classic features &gt; User Profiles and click open &gt; People &gt;
<strong>Manage User Profiles</strong> (Or you can directly go to this page via the URL:

https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/TenantProfileAdmin/ProfMngr.aspx</a>. Please change ‚Äúcontoso‚Äù to your own domain name.)</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In ‚ÄúFind profiles‚Äù, type your own account alias and click ‚Äúfind‚Äù &gt; select the account name in the list and click the drop down arrow icon &gt; edit my profile<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5008e7a-a507-4584-9811-ae1e51cd0fe5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5008e7a-a507-4584-9811-ae1e51cd0fe5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Check your ‚ÄúPicture‚Äù property,<span> is it showing the correct photo? Whether it shows the correct photo or not, click ‚Äúchange your photo‚Äù and follow the rest steps to re-upload the photo. Then wait for no
 more than 24 hours to see the result.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ad11f66-cc52-4e7b-bf89-93b032e87bd9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ad11f66-cc52-4e7b-bf89-93b032e87bd9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps above works, as an admin, you can follow the steps below to let all your end users change by themselves directly in user properties.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Go to SharePoint admin center &gt; Classic features &gt; User Profiles and click open &gt; People &gt;

<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the Property Name called ‚ÄúPicture‚Äù &gt; edit &gt; tick the option ‚ÄúAllow users to edit values for this property‚Äù and ‚Äúshow in the profile properties section of the user‚Äôs profile page‚Äù and ‚Äúshow on the edit

</p><p>
</p><p>After settings above, all end users can do the steps below to refresh property:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after you tried the ways above, there must be something handled from the back end from server side. In this scenario, we would like to suggest you create a support ticket via Office 365 Admin center &gt; support. Although we really want
 to help you to fix the issue till the end, only that support team has the escalate channel for such issue needing a fix from back end from server side. We appreciate your understanding if you have to do that for this case, but this is the most efficient way
 to fix this sync stuck issue for your tenant. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can post back any updates, we will keep following this thread for you. </p>

            Hi Rena, I'm very familiar with this procedure.&nbsp; So when I change the photo under the user profile, I can see the photo updated in sharepoint immediately.&nbsp; However it never syncs with the outlook photo.&nbsp; I used a stock company logo as the photo and uploaded
 it to the user profile in the sharepoint admin page.&nbsp; It showed up immediately in sharepoint under the user's profile, however, it's not syncing.&nbsp; I had the user change their photo on outlook.com and waited a few days.&nbsp; The update made it to other office365
 services such as delve, skype and outlook, but would not overwrite the sharepoint stock photo that I uploaded.

            Msft has never been very good at anything involving the internet - it's simply not in their dna. In order for the sync process to be effective, Msft has to run a FULL CRAWL which they never do unless you request it via a service request. So I'd try that.<br />

<p><span>Hi Rob,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I‚Äôm sorry for the late response as my holidays. Thanks for your updated information and I‚Äôm appreciate your patience to wait for my reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your descriptions, it seems the user photos can show up if you change directly via SharePoint user properties. If so, at least, we find this workaround to make it work before the user photo sync issue
 fixed. </span></p>
<p><span>Now the root cause is the sync process from Exchange to SharePoint. As there‚Äôs nothing the admin can control to refresh or fix the sync process, there must be something to be checked from back end. I really
 want to help you till the end, however, in this scenario, I would suggest you seek help from Office 365 Admin Center &gt; Support to create a service ticket, as only that support team has the escalation channel for such case that needed to check from back end.
 And this is the most efficient way to handle the case you have. To save your time, I make the summary for you below, you can use this SOAP to report the issue to them:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>S: (Subjective)</span></p>
<p><span>==========</span></p>
<p>
<span>SharePoint Online can‚Äôt sync user profile photo from Exchange.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>O: (Objective) [Environment]</span></p>
<p><span>===================
</span></p>
<p><span>The issue affects all users in the whole tenant.</span></p>
<p><span>The users have Exchange Online license.</span></p>
<p><span>Tenant domain information: XXXX.COM</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A: (Assessment)</span></p>
<p><span>===================
</span></p>
<p><span>Change the user photo directly from SharePoint Online user property can make the photo show up in SharePoint Online immediately. However, changing photo from
 Delve/Outlook Online can‚Äôt sync the photo to SharePoint Online to take effect. </span>
</p>
<p>
 And the maximum sync time is 24 hours. As we have waited for more than 72 hours, it seems the user profile photo synchronization is stuck when SharePoint Online wants to update photo from Exchange Online.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>P(Plan)</span></p>
<p><span>====================</span></p>
<p><span>Please help to check from the back end from the server side for deep investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can post back any time if you meet any problems when you contact them and I will keep monitoring this thread for you.</span></p>

    <title>Reversing ctrl&#43;scroll wheel in Office for Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> new daddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reversing ctrl&#43;scroll wheel in Office for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One weird feature of Word 2016 that really drives me nuts me is the way ctrl + mouse scroll zooms in or out.<br />
<br />
I have turned off scroll direction:natural under System Preferences-Mouse, because I use a mouse with a wheel and it feels more natural that way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, ctrl + wheel scroll up in Word 2016 zooms out, and ctrl + wheel scroll down zooms in. This is exactly the reverse of the mouse behavior in Word for Windows, and feels very counter-intuitive.&nbsp; What's even more weird is that ctrl + wheel scroll
 behaves as it's supposed to in the Document Map pane.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this that WON'T affect the rest of OS X? i.e., a Office-wide fix rather than a system-wide fix? (Because Ctrl+scroll zooms in/out as expected in some other applications, such as Firefox, I do not want to make a system-wide change.)</p>

            <p>This is clearly a bug in Word. &nbsp;Word's scroll-zooming direction is the opposite of other Office 2016 products, and all apps on OSX for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With natural scrolling enabled in System Preferences, ctrl+scroll up zooms out in PowerPoint, but zooms in in Word. &nbsp;With natural scrolling disabled, ctrl+scroll up zooms in in PowerPoint and out in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe PowerPoint's interpretation of natural scrolling is correct and consistent with all other apps. &nbsp;Word is inverted.</p>

            <p>I have been using Office 2016 for Mac since the first free preview. I have hit that smiley button to report this infuriating problem no fewer than twelve separate times. As far as I can tell, these complaints have vanished into the ether because nothing
 has been done so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the ctrl+scroll zooming is also backwards in Excel in the latest release (and it has been for some time). SO, PowerPoint gets it right, but Word and Excel get it wrong. It sure would be nice to have some consistency.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>files in&nbsp; X:\Management Team\Team Trackers\test\team BT.xlsx, team GB.xlsx etc + zREPORT.xlsm</p>
<p>
</p><p>so , the code runs through up to 'workbooks.open (myfile)'&nbsp;and returns 1004 runtime error - "sorry we couldn't find team bt.xlsx. is it possible it was moved..etc"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a little confused as it clearly has found the file to return myfile in the error ?</p>

<h2>            Outlook email account setup</h2>
                    Earlier in the year I changed my Office 365 subscription from personal to business. It was recommended to simply stop paying the personal sub. There appears to be more than one microsoft account setup and they sometimes conflict. Both subscriptions want
 to install separate office suites. For example I've just changed computers and was able to setup two business email accounts under the business 365 outlook app. I cannot, however, set up my personal email account. It's just a normal Telus imap account which
 I can only access through my ipad at present. Any suggestions?&nbsp;

            Hi Phil,<br />
<br />
When using Mail Merge feature, it automatically sends the emails to each recipient by design. This means that we cannot able to save them directly to your drafts folder. As a workaround, you can set your Outlook in Work Offline first so that it will disconnect
 to the Outlook server. With this action, the emails you're going to send using mail merge will stay in the Outbox folder. From there, you can move them to your Drafts folder. To enable Work Offline in your Outlook app, just go to
<strong>Send/Receive</strong> tab and choose <strong>Work Offline</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an image of 14986, so I thought I would see what happened when upgrading to 15031 from a ISO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This image started out as Win 7 Pro, then upgraded to Win 10 14393 Anniversary, then to 14986, so it is somewhat different than your's most likely...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first try made it through the 2nd restart... the one after it updates the first 30%...</p>
<p>The next thing I knew it was doing a Scan and Repair of drive C:\...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started over, and allowed the build 14986 to install some Windows Updates, one of which was something Windows NEXT... sorry I didn't write down the kb number...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking this update has something to do with the UUP updating that started with the 15*** builds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... it completed successfully although I was having some doubts as to whether it would along the way... There was quite a long delay during some of the restarts, as though it might hang...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting this on it now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've experienced what you describe with almost all of the 15*** builds when trying to upgrade the same Win 7 image I originally started with in this case...</p>

<h2>            win32&#47;vawtrak</h2>
                    Hi my pc started&nbsp;running slow and then would not allow me to&nbsp;run my AVG antivirus the message was this program is blocked by group&nbsp;policy. As this is a stand alone pc and I was the administrator there was no group policy that was a puzzle as I was not
 able to sort this.&nbsp;I uninstalled AVG and used Microsoft essentials, now when I run the anti virus I get an alert &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviour;WIN32/Vawtrak ,gen!D .&nbsp; &nbsp;I click to remove it and am prompted to restart my pc which I do and this happens every time I run the scan.
 How do I remove this threat as I don't want to use my pc much until I remove it as it is&nbsp;quite a bad threat. If you can help that will be great thanks.

                    Earlier there was a Setting option in my Start Menu. But few days after Threshold 2 update (Build 10586) it got disappear. It's may be due to installation of some third-party application (Not sure about it)<br />

</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When did this problem start?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's may be due to installation of some third-party application (Not sure about it)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What third party application did you install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has difficulty running third party antivirus applications and it's not recommended.&nbsp; Windows Defender, the built in antivirus/spyware program, runs great&nbsp;in Windows 10.&nbsp; It costs nothing.&nbsp; It updates definitions regularly and scans the system
 on a schedule.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I supplement with the free version of Malwarebytes and run a scan with that program once a week or so to check for PUPs and PUMs.&nbsp; I'll provide the link here in case you would like to try it.&nbsp;
<strong>Untick</strong> the option to <strong>enable the free trial of Malwarebytes Premium</strong> at the end of the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you previously had "security suites" installed or any McAfee or Symantec products and if you did not uninstall them properly, they can leave files behind that can corrupt the operating system.&nbsp; Look over the information on ESET.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.eset.com/kb146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.eset.com/kb146/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your third party program is a registry cleaning application, the use of those are also not recommended.&nbsp; Some reading material for you about using registry cleaners.</p>

            <p>This about method from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft TechNet forum didn't work for me.<br />
<br />
The inbuilt Windows Defender is good, but it detects False Positive also, so I am using Kaspersky Total Security 2016 and I am sure that the problem is not due to Kaspersky. I have been using it from a very long time.<br />
<br />
It's may be due to the third part software "Phoenix (Cracked version)", which I had installed just before the issue arise.<br />
<br />
And one more thing. Just before it there was a "Low Memory" error (very frequently I am getting it on Win 10) and halted, screen blank. Even I was not able to reboot. So I had to forcefully turn the system off by disconnecting the power. So this might be a
 reason also.<br />
<br />
I am able to open the settings from</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Action Center by clicking on the Notifications icon in the system tray.There a tile with the name "All Settings". But when it open there is no
 icon on Taskbar for it. I can minimize it, but as it is missing from taskbar, I can restore it. See the image bellow, there is no icon for the running "Setting" program on the Taskbar.</span></p>

            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kaspersky&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Actually among all products of Kaspersky, only Kaspersky Total Security 2016 is compatible with Win 10. After a clean installation of Win 10 I have installed Kaspersky Total Security 2016. There was no previous version of Kaspersky installed in my system, so
 I didn't have to uninstall KTS 2015. (In fact I had never used KTS 2015. In Win 8.1 I was using Kaspersky Pure 3.0, which is almost same as KTS)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Low Memory&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am using Kaspersky products from last 6 years I fully trust Kaspersky but I agree all Kaspersky products use a lot of system resources and slow down the system as compare to other anti-malware. But I had never got 'Low Memory' warning on the earlier
 versions of Windows with those Kaspersky products.<br />
<br />
Now Google Chrome is also utilizing a lot of memory and acting as a RAM Killer. So I had tries increasing the Paging File Size of the system to 8 GB. But still the Committed memory issue is still present. After a reboot I am getting about 5-7 GB of free space
 on the system drive and my system is running normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Phoenix(Cracked)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Phoenix is a software used for Flash Nokia Device and clean installation of the OS into it. It comes with some system software like Nokia USB driver &amp; some other driver. It's not a freeware. I have used the cracked version. And usually crack sometimes misbehave
 with system behavior. And as it contains come system software (Drivers), I think installation of Phoenix may be a reason of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System File Checker and DISM&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I didn't find any error from&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System File Checker and DISM. Everything is showing normal and healthy.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
However the issue is regarding the Setting option on the Start Menu. And I thing I could be solve by editing some Registry. But I don't have any solution yet.</p>

</p><p>Windows 10 is still a big change from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Some programs that ran well on 8.1 will not run well on Windows 10.&nbsp; There's a lot more security built in to Windows 10 for Microsoft's business customers.&nbsp; This operating system is not being developed

<h2>            SharePoint Online page crash - Adding a People Web Part - not responding due to a long-running script</h2>
                    <p>In IE 11 or Chrome, when I attempt to add a People Web Part to a modern SharePoint Online page, the page hangs and a dialog appears at the bottom of the screen with :
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can add other web parts issue-free.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested to add people web part to a site page in different browsers, following are the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Affected browser: Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>I can see the same error message you mentioned:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/246e91c8-9acc-4b1c-a349-2312790ce78f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/246e91c8-9acc-4b1c-a349-2312790ce78f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal browsers: Edge, Chrome, Firefox.</p>
<p>I can add the people web part in Chrome correctly, the same as Edge and Firefox.</p>
<p>You can try Edge and Firefox to see the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update your Chrome to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<p><span>Hi Anthony,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your post. Gloria has transferred this thread to me. We have tested and we can confirm the issue can be reproduced with IE browser. For such issue, we have also contacted with more resource. It is said that there must be something needed
 a fix from the back end. In this scenario, we would suggest you create a service ticket via Office 365 Admin Center &gt; Support. We also would like to help you, however, the support team there has the correct escalate channel for such SharePoint issue. And this
 is also the most efficient way to help you on this case. </span></p>
<p>It seems the issue only affect creating or editing the people web part. <span>
It should not be affected to use the people web part after publishing the page. </span>
Before the issue fixed, you can create or edit it via other browsers as a workaround. Then use it with IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your understanding,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>

<h2>            Change a button color if true in Access</h2>
                    I have a main switch board in Access with buttons to take me to a form for information about that client. I'm trying to have the button change to bold text or a different color if the form has data do i don't have to open the form to find out. I'm assuming
 a code but have tried several and am not succeeding.

<p>Hi Christopher,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for your query in our forum. Per your description, you want to change the profile name and let it displays correctly in Forms like this scenario below.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd75e994-99e0-46f0-8a27-5fd3c84ec00e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd75e994-99e0-46f0-8a27-5fd3c84ec00e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If this is your requirement, you will go to portal.office.com-&gt;personalinfo page after you click your profile name in Forms. But the permission of editing name and email address required that you need to be an
<strong>Office 365 global admin</strong>. And if you are a user role, you will see Why can‚Äôt I edit button under the photo.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15f6d4a3-c6a2-4208-b245-a47777ad258d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15f6d4a3-c6a2-4208-b245-a47777ad258d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Please contact your IT department and admin to change this name. This change is for all the Office 365 applications not just Forms. If you are a global admin, and it might take up to 24 hours for this change to take effect across all services after you change
 the name. For your reference,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/add-users/change-a-user-name-and-email-address?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change a user name and email address in Office 365</a>&nbsp;has more information
 about it.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If not this case, can you provide the details about this so that we can provide better suggestion for you. Can you provide the screenshot about where you want to change name with?&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
<div>Appreciated for your understanding.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<div>Ivy</div>

<h3> michelleclark1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t share Outlook 2016 calendar with anyone</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm using Outlook 2016 Professional Plus on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>When trying to share my calendar within Outlook, I get the error message 'Error while preparing to send sharing message'. I have gone to the online Outlook version (</span>https://outlook.live.com/calendar)<span>,
 and have shared my calendar with my work Exchange email address (and alternatively also tried another Gmail address) from there, but when I receive the email on the other end, I see the following within the email:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'd like to share my calendar with you&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>My Name (email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) would like to share an Outlook calendar with you.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>You'll be able to view, edit, and delete events on this calendar.&nbsp;</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>BUTTON: Accept and View Calendar</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But when I click on the button, all it does is take me to a page that says:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>:-(</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Something went wrong</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>We can't get that information right now. Please try again later.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>X-ClientId: CC5626647D3F49078962B07B5408BD45</strong></p>
<p><strong>X-FEServer BL0PR02CA0009</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:3/13/2019 10:00:18 PM</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Fewer details...</strong><br />
<strong>Refresh the page&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read thread after thread on this, and have attempted a repair, which ended up uninstalling Office completely. I reinstalled my Office 2016 Professional Plus. I have also confirmed Calendar Permissions and there is no one listed except for Default. When&nbsp;<span>I
 click on the 'Add' box, it only shows me an Offline Global Address Book for my email (which is empty), and nothing else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I have also changed the details option within the share message to Availability Only, as well as, each of the other options, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't any of the proposed "fixes" work? Are there any other fixes that aren't listed anywhere else?</p>

            Hi Michelle,
<br />Try accepting the share in Outlook on the web. That should always work. 
<br />
<br />Which version and build of Outlook are you using? See File, Office Account for the information.

<p>Diane - I'm using Version 1902 (Build 11328.20146 Click-to-Run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I click on the button from my Exchange Outlook, it shows me that error message with the :(, and when I click to refresh the page, it just takes me back to online mail. From online mail, when I click on the button, it then creates
 another button that simply says "Accept", and when I click on that, nothing happens. I've tried this process numerous times, and have repeated it after restarting my laptop. Again, nothing works.</p>

<h2>            Public Calendar - how to make it show just my information</h2>
                    <p>I just moved 2 people to Windows 10 using Outlook 2010 at work on a network domain. &nbsp;We have a calendar in our public folders that is updated with work related activities. &nbsp;When we view it in the public folder list it only shows that persons workload like
 we need it to. &nbsp; But - both people wanted to add it to the favorites so we right clicked- &nbsp;add to favorites and it shows up but lists everyone's work not just their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we move to favorites and still only see just that person's workload and no one else?</p>
<p>

<p>The permissions where setup okay.&nbsp; We found issue - after the permissions is set and they added to favorites they need to go to view - manage&nbsp; view - then choose themselves to filter everyone off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quirk in Outlook though, sometimes you have to click back to mail then calendar for it to reflect the change.&nbsp;

<h2>            VBA to Calculate Difference Between Two Cells</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to get a formula to works as follows.&nbsp; Calculate the difference between two cells using VBA.&nbsp; Sometimes the value in Cell E90 is higher, and sometimes the value in C90 is higher so the results needs to be a positive or a negative number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my vba, I am using the following...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strPercent1 = Format(.Range("E90").Value / .Range("C90").Value, "##.##%")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strComment = "Same month Year Over Year, Net Sales Change " &amp; strPercent1 &amp; "."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call AddComment(.Range("C90"), strComment)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regular excel, the formula would be (C90/M90-1)*100</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change that first line to be work the same as a regular excel formula...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>

    <title>Scrolling In Publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernie_z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrolling In Publisher 2010</h2>
                    I noticed that Publisher 2010 won't scroll away from the cursor. This means that if your cursor is positioned at the top of a page and you want to scroll to the bottom, you can't use the scroll bar. Instead you must move the cursor to the bottom in order
 to see the bottom or change the view size so you can see the whole page. This is a major inconvenience. Is there a fix for this behavior?<br />

I am curious. Is this an option to doing a 'repair' like we used to do with older versions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>It happens on all files. Doing a repair would seem the easier of the two solutions. I've got a rather large project in Publisher right now (hence my question in the first place) so I'm reluctant to implement any fixes until I've finished. So it may be a
 day or so before I can try these solutions out and report back. I hope that's okay. I really thank you both for your time and expertise.</p>

<p>If yes, then you may repair the complete Office suite following the steps from the link below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is occurring only with Publisher, then you may follow the steps from the previous post and check if that helps.</p>

            I tried the Microsoft Office 2010 Professional repair procedure and the problem was not resolved. In other words, when I'm in Page Width view for example and the entire page cannot be seen without vertical scrolling, it is impossible to scroll away from
 the cursor. I can cursor to a new position on the page, but I can't scroll. If the cursor is positioned at the top, as soon as I click on the scroll bar, the page flashs down, then quickly jumps back to the top where the cursor is. I hope I'm explaining this
 problem adequately. I've Googled this behaviour and there are other reports of the same problem.

            This issue occurs only in Publisher and I'm intending to try Mr. Balakrishna's solution today. Many thanks again.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I tried Mr. Balakrishna's recommendation of changing Publisher's configuration to make it not available; then rebooting; then changing Publisher's configuration to run all from computer; then rebooting again.</p>
<p>I realize the rebooting was unnecessary but I did it anyway to sort of rinse things clean.</p>
<p>It did not fix the problem. Scroll away and Publisher jumps back to the cursor position automatically and instantly. Again this is a huge annoyance when working on a large page or document because you can't just scroll away and review something, you need
 to move the cursor to the new position in order to bring it into view regardless of whether you wish to edit in the new position. I didn't mention it, but this only happens within a page, any page, and not when I use the navigation window to move to a completely
 different page. Also, it occurs with any document that is viewed at a magnification that is larger than the vertical screen.</p>
<p>If I can't remedy this problem I may need to go back to Publisher 2007. </p>
<p>Please accept my sincere thanks for all your help.</p>

<p>Are you absolutely sure this is not the default behavior of Pub 2010 and cannot be changed?</p>
<p>The work around I discovered was to click outside the document boundaries, thus removing the cursor from the document and allowing you to use the scroll bar.</p>

<p><br />
FWIW it is not the default behavior as I cannot replicate your problem. </p>
<p>Are you using a mouse? Have you checked the mouse settings? Have you updated the mouse drivers?</p>
<p>You said in an earlier post that you had googled this and found other reports? Can you provide some links to those reports? I don't doubt what you are saying but to my knowledge this issue has not been reported in this forum or the old NNTP newsgroups. What
 did you use for your search criteria?</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 browsing issues on lumia 925 32gb</h2>
                    Hi, ever since upgrading to 8.1, I have had no end of browsing issues. Its all a lot slower now, and my most commonly used sites of bbc mobile and ebay mobile no longer work. I can use ebay, but when clicking for description of something I only get a couple
 of lines then white screen. The bbc mobile site wont even work any more. It used to be spot on, then after upgrade it only had partial information. Now, it just goes straight to desktop site, even when manually entering address. Browser settings are to allow
 full information, not to restrict data usage . Any ideas anyone. Cheers. Jeff.
