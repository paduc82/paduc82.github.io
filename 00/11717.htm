 skype for desktop was reminding me for what I give up on yahoo messenger, because of complex app, old win7 like app which could come with bloatware (Skype click to call), and does not fit in sandboxing system. I will be using Skype on my phone, but I don't
 know if this would redirect me to an alternative messaging system which would do just fine on pc and phone too. I don't know why metro Skype is gone, but looking a little in the future when all apps are going for metro version, and the old ones would eventually
 be eradicated, it's a seriously stupid move of letting go of metro Skype.</span>

            <p>Yes, it is horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were promised that when Skype moved from providing a Universal full app and Win32 full program to a new win32 version, that the update to the Win32 program would be better for touch whilst retaining what was good in the older desktop program. The latest
 version has failed on both counts - It is not touch friendly and it is&nbsp;worse as desktop app than the version it just replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose to not have Skype on all the time but since the win32 downgrade, I cannot turn it off the way I could with both the older desktop version and the no longer available Universal version.</p>

            <p>Maybe use web skype (https://web.skype.com)</p>
<p>It is still in Beta but works a lot better on Windows 10 than the desktop app. And you will need to use IE and install the plugin, instead of Edge.</p>

            <p>The thing that gets me is the use on a tablet. The Skype message window is not keyboard aware. Which means you can't see what you are typing, select a word to change, etc. I have to use it, but it is really a pain. I know they are preparing something new,
 but they should have kept the old functioning till it was ready. Really unpleasant to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try thee web version. Perhaps the UI is better on a tablet since edge is keyboard aware.</p>

<h2>            Default language turning back to US English</h2>
                    I use word through my university (based in London) - however whenever I try to change the spell check language to UK english it automatically changes back to US english whenever I click in the body of my document. Is there a way to stop this from happening?

            Changing the default only applies to new documents. For an existing document, you may have to select all the text and then set the language for the selection (make the change in the dialog box in your screen shot and click OK rather than Default). In addition,
 change the language for the Normal style.

<h2>            Outlook for Home and Student 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I had 2003 Microsoft Office first on my computer.&nbsp; A couple years ago I added 2007 Home and Student.&nbsp; A couple months ago I was cleaning out old software and deleted Outlook 2003, thinking I had 2007 with Home and Student, which of course I was saddenly
 mistaken.&nbsp; Now I don't have Outlook and didn't keep my original rececipts or access code for 2003.</p>
<p>Is there any recourse where I can get my original 2003 Outlook or do I have to purchase 2007 Outlook for my Office Home and Student.&nbsp; If so what is my most cost effective answer to getting Outlook back up and running with my 2007 Home Office and Student?</p>

<h2>            Exchange ActiveSync Impact &#47; Limits &#47; Performance</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling to find out details on the performance impact of adding new devices on our Exchange environment via Activesync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking at deploying 200+ devices, all using ActiveSync and I need to be able to predict the additional resource that those will put onto our CAS/Exchange environment. Do such stats exists? i.e. overhead added per activesync-enabled device? Appreciate
 the numbers are pretty low but still need to report on potential issues if we create additional load which our servers can't take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found information about the monitors we can configure in perfmon to monitor, but ideally I need to be able to give the best estimate of additional load/performance impact before we deploy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tech info on EAS load,performance greatly received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I'm a member of windows 10 insider preview program. In past my windows crashed and I fully uninstalled it. I'm still recieving emails from Gabe about new versions and it looks good, so now I want to continue trying windows. But, because my mac have no windows
 by it self I just cant upgrade windows 7 or 8 to windows insider version like wrote in other posts here. So can I have an .iso file of windows 10 insider preview or am I late with it?</p>

<h3> johnpublic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007&#58; &#40;most&#41; incoming messages do not show up in my Inbox</h2>
                    When I use the built in "test account settings" button in outlook, it sends a test message to me, and then when I do a "Send and Receive", the test message shows up correctly in my inbox as expected. &nbsp;At this point you might think that everything is working
 well... but <b><u>no other</u></b> messages arrive in my inbox. &nbsp;(E.g., if I create a gmail account, and send myself messaged from it, they do not show up in my inbox in outlook).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Comcast as my ISP and email provider, and when I look on their online email (web based), all the messages I am expecting to see (messages from myself, the messages I sent from gmail, messages to me from my contacts, And the&nbsp;"Microsoft Office
 Outlook Test Message"s&nbsp;from Outlook's test button) are all there, but <b><u>only</u></b> the test messages actually make it to my inbox in Outlook. &nbsp;(For testing purposes, I have outlook set to leave messages on the server, so that I can still manage to get
 my mail if when outlook fails).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things I have already tried (which do not work):</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Verifying all my outlook settings with Comcast.</li><li>Disabling all "Rules" in outlook (There was only the default one which removes categories from incoming mail, but I've disabled it..)</li><li>Removing and then recreating my account from scratch in outlook.</li><li>Removing and then creating a new fresh Outlook.pst file from the Mail Control Panel.</li><li>Removing the .../AppData/Local/Microsoft/Outlook directory completely and putting a fresh Outlook.pst in it.</li><li>Uninstalling and then reinstalling the outlook portion of my "Office 2007 enterprise edition" installation. &nbsp;(I would rather not completely uninstall and reinstall office because the installation disks which came with the computer have been misplaced, and
 I do not want to have to go and buy another copy of office).</li><li>Temporarily disabling (and even uninstalling) all my Antivirus and Malware protection (Though I did re-install it when this failed to make a difference).</li><li>Disabling all my Outlook "Add-Ins".</li><li>Creating a new user profile in the OS (I'm Using Vista btw..), and trying outlook from there.</li><li>Enabling logging in outlook. &nbsp;(The logs DO show the messages showing up on the server in the POP logs, and I can see that outlook has retrieved them (RETR for the new messages, etc.. &nbsp;What it actually does with the messages after downloading them remains
 a mystery though..).</li><li>Installing a different client (thunderbird) and using the same settings that I use in outlook. &nbsp;Where everything works
<b><u>fine</u></b> in thunderbird. &nbsp;I get all the messages including the test messages delivered normally without issues.</li><li>Shaking my fist ineffectually at the computer and muttering empty threats.</li></ol>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things that <b><i>might</i></b> work, but I would really rather not resort to:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Switch to using Thunderbird. &nbsp;(I am used to, and prefer, Outlook).</li><li>Use the Comcast ad-ridden ugly web interface. &nbsp;(Thunderbird is a better option than this monstrosity).</li><li>Buying a new copy of office (2007 or 2010 or whatever...) so that I can uninstall office completely and reinstall it. &nbsp;I've already bought one copy which came with the machine.. I do not feel like I should buy a new copy just to fix a bug.</li><li>Format and reinstall the OS, all my Apps, Data, etc.. (This is just silly... and would be a huge waste of money since the install disks that came with the machine have been misplaced, and would need to be re-purchased).</li><li>Disconnect from humanity and no longer use email at all.</li></ol>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>Any ideas? &nbsp;I am really at a loss here.</div>

<h2>            Printing Borderless in Microsoft Publisher using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have been printing borderless using my HP Office jet 7612 printer for around 1 year on a windows 7.1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10, and in the advance print options, borderless printing is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this using Office 2007 and 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how I now access the borderless option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Print Notes Pages as PDF with searchable slide content</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I start this question as a follow up to this post:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-powerpoint/how-reduce-size-of-ppt-2010-notes-pages-pdfs/c8929ec1-0a97-4d70-8b27-de63bb5d8cfe<br />
<br />
I have exactly the same problem as described in the post:<br />
If I create a PDF from my presentation as notes pages the slide thumbnail on the notes page is rendered as an image. My problem with this is not so much the file size but the fact that the text on the slide is not searchable in the resulting PDF.<br />
<br />
I tried the VBA code from here: http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00974_PowerPoint_2007-_Slide_image_in_notes_pages_is_low-rez_-_jaggy.htm.<br />
But I found that my slides are only searchable in the PDF if they are text only or if the images on the slide are eps or other Vector based formats.<br />
As my presentations have an company logo on the master slide (resulting in a bitmap on every single page), none of the slides in the PDF is searchable.<br />
<br />
Steve Rindsberg suggested this might be a problem of effects being used on the text, e.g. transparent shadows or similar, but I didn't use any effects at all.<br />
@Steve: You said you didn't see the problem with slides (text+images) being rendered as images. Did you use a bitmap graphic for this? And how did you create the PDF? I found that if I use my Adobe PDF printer the slide is rendered as a very bad quality image.
 But if I use the PowerPoint included "Create PDF/XPS" function the slides are always searchable, no matter if there is an image on the slide or not.<br />
Any help on this would be highly appreciated. Thanks.<br />
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            As promised here is the final VBA Code.<br />
I additionally created a user form (PrintOptionsForm) with the following elements:<br />
- A drop-down list from which the user can select any of the installed printers. (PrinterList)<br />
- A textfield for specifying how many copies should be printed (NumberCopies)<br />
- Option Buttons yes and no to define whether hidden slides should be printed as well<br />
- A checkbox to state whether the path to where the PDFs are stored should be opened in Windows Explorer (CheckboxPDF)<br />
- And a button to start printing and the PDF generation (PrintClick)<br />
<br />
Another user form (StatusMessage) shows a status message that the presentation is currently prepared for the pdf conversion. This is opened, once the pdf creation starts.<br />
<br />
I did not write all of the stuff on my own but used many snippets I found on the Internet and adapted them to suit my needs. In this code I also implemented the slide substitution mechanism from Steve with minor changes.<br />

                    <p>Dear team,</p>

    <title>How To Add A Excel Form&#47;Table With Data From Another Sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macuseronline  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Add A Excel Form&#47;Table With Data From Another Sheet</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook with 3 sheets: Invoice, Customers and Sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Invoice sheet is populated by a menu list that is taken from the Customers sheet. Once all the order information is entered, all the Invoice data is then copied to a new row on the Sales sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is add a button to the Invoice sheet that will open a form or table containing all the rows from the Sales sheet that match the currently viewed customer - basically a sales history so we can see all the prior orders without having
 to change sheet views from Invoice to Sales and then have to filter the Sales sheet to only show that customer's orders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can think of doing this is to use VBA to open a new window, set it to the Sales sheet and do a filter for the customer, but I would prefer something more elegant, something that would just pop up, and also, I don't need all the columns that
 are in the Sales sheet (i.e, all the contact info which I already have on the Invoice), but only a select number of columns that are relevant to the sales themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone can help me with this, it would be great. I would think something like this should be built into Excel, sort of a mini-query form that could auto-populate from another sheet, using a particular criterion, such as date or name.</p>

            I have looked at that briefly, but it doesn't give me the ability to show a form or window that I can call from another sheet that would have the data I need based on the variable of the currently viewed customer. Any ideas on how to do this?

            <p>Well, I've made some progress with this issue, but am stuck once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems fairly simple to display the data in a userform as such:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;ListBox1.ColumnCount = 4<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;ListBox1.ColumnWidths = "100;100;100;100"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;ListBox1.List = Sheets("Report").Range("A3:D10").Value</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume by fiddling with the range, I can even choose the columns to display....</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, I need only a subset of this data, so the actual range will vary for each customer and each time I show the form. I somehow need to get the range of the filtered list and then pass it to the form before displaying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could filter the sheet, copy the results to a temp book, display that temp data on the form, then close the temp book without saving it... but that is quite a bit of work to get this done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, anyone? Thanks.</p>
<p />

    <title>Row height doesn&#39;t follow data while sorting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonking80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Row height doesn&#39;t follow data while sorting</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel sheet that was created in Excel 2007, but now when I sort it in Excel 2010 the row height doesn't move with the data.&nbsp; For example if the row height in row 1 was 20 (due to text wrapping - autosized), when it gets sorted and the data is shifted
 to, say, row 5, row 1 stays at a height of 20 and row 5 keeps whatever height it had, even though row 5 should autosize to a height of 20.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Content to online mode missing from home screen</h2>
                    
<p>Normally on the N97 'home screen' there should be an option to set "content to online mode" or "offline mode". However, after updating the firmwareon my N97 to v11, this option has disappeared. I tried reinstalling the firmware, and it's still missing. Does
 anyone have any idea what happened, and how I can fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. I discovered that only having RSS feeds on the homescreen did not allow me to change the online mode. By adding the facebook widget (which requires a constant connection) it then allowed me to set cotent to online mode.

<h2>            PowerPoint 2011 SlideShow Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a new&nbsp;latest&nbsp;model Mac Mini (Intel Core I5 2.5 GHz, 4GB Ram, Intel HD4000) with Mountain Lion 10.8.2 with Office 2011 (everything is updated).</p>
<p>I'm using a PowerPoint slideshow to play a show that is displayed on a 42" TV.</p>
<p>The Mac Mini connects to the TV by using an HDMI cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I have to turn off the TV while the slideshow is still running.</p>
<p>The next morning when I turn on the TV (slideshow is still running), the PowerPoint slideshow will crash giving me a long error report.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not too sure if this is a Microsoft Office issue or a Macintosh issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error report is too long to post in this thread for some reason.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this issue?</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Jim,
<div><br />
<div>I've figured it out, it appears that it isn't a PowerPoint issue.</div>
<div>Even after updating to the latest version of PowerPoint, the crash still occurred.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I brought in a Mac Mini with Lion with same hardware / software configuration and that seems to have stopped the error from occurring.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So in the end, it seems like a mountain lion issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Daniel</div>

<p>Yes, the <strong>powercfg</strong> command has to be run within Windows if you do successfully boot into it.&nbsp; Did you try booting to install media and then just cancelling, by clicking on the X on the first screen of setup and letting it restart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try editing the BCD to remove references to Resume.&nbsp; There is a new Fast Ring build 17115 today which fixes the fast startup bug, if that is what you are seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you got a Command Prompt.&nbsp; You could also try running <strong>sfc /scannow /OFFBOOTDIR:C:\ /OFFWINDIR:C:\Windows</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the previous version login, did you ever use a Local Windows account that was not your outlook password? or a blank password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the Resume references in the BCD can be done this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdedit /enum resume</strong><br />

<h3> r. mark dilillo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cisco VPN Client on Windows 10 TP 9926</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this issue.&nbsp; When I try to install Cisco VPN Client v5.0.07.0290 onto my Win10 TP 9926 machine all hell breaks loose.&nbsp; The network adapters completely break and I lose complete access to any network.&nbsp; Additionally,
 the computer hangs up upon reboot or shut down (stuck on the "Windows is shutting down" screen), and then the computer will NOT BOOT anymore.&nbsp; I get the typical Windows load screen and then it quickly (too quickly it feels like) goes to a black screen where
 nothing will load no matter how long I wait.&nbsp; The mouse is hidden until movement and then quickly hides itself again when I stop moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely a problem for me on Win10 right now, but I'm trying to circumvent by using a VM with Win7 for VPN access.&nbsp; Hopefully this works.&nbsp; Anyone else experience similar issues?</p>

            Yup, same here on 9926. &nbsp;Also Virtual Box. &nbsp;I am thinking that this is an issue with any software that tries to install any type of virtual network adapter drivers....

            <p>A further update to my previous port this morning. We are using VPN client version 5.0.07.0440 and I had this black screen issue on my Surface Pro 3 even after a vanilla build of Windows 10 TP 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tried this again this morning to install the VPN client on a Hyper-V virtual machine of the same build and the machine boots fine after installing the VPN client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try installing the TP 9926 on a different machine and report back later today</p>

            <p>I've found a few ways to get it installed without dealing with the black screen boot issue, but it still won't work.&nbsp; There is a Citrix DNE update that you can install which will help the CIsco IPSEC client install.&nbsp; Then regedit the thing similar to the
 registry hack you need to do in order to get it to work on Win8, and you can install and run in compatibility mode as administrator...and it will install without a problem and run.&nbsp; However, it will not connect and still does not work.&nbsp; It gets stuck on the
 last phase of connecting.</p>

            I hope they get it fixed there have to be no "small hacks" or registry edits to get it to work, if I have to do that kind of thing to make their product work like it should then to me it doesn't work.&nbsp; I aint mad, and I know this is just a tech preview
 that is a work in progress but I am loving Win10 in general and want it complete ;P

<h2>            Unable to send email with resized images&#59; Office 2016, windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Just got&nbsp;a new PC with Windows 10 and Office 2016.&nbsp; When I try to send a message in Outlook with image attachments after checking "resize images" I get "access denied" message.&nbsp; If I try to save the message I get a message that it cannot be saved because
 I do not &nbsp;"have permissions to change some or all of the items in this folder."&nbsp; I am then asked if I want to save in the default folder for the item.&nbsp; If I say yes, I again get "access denied."&nbsp; What is going on?&nbsp; I am the only user/owner on the computer.&nbsp;
 I can send the same images if I do not re-size.</p>

<p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>According to the description, it might be related to the folder permission in Windows 10. To narrow down the cause, I want to know:<br />
1. Are you the administrator of the computer?<br />
2. Are you able to paste the images to another folder on your PC?<br />
3. If you insert a image located in a different hard drive, for example, the D drive, will the issue occur?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry</p>

<p>Yes, I am the admin/only user. &nbsp;I can freely move the images. &nbsp;I get the same error if I attach a photo from the CD drive/disk.</p>
<p>I checked various permissions and it looks as though I have full control over all folders.</p>

<p>hi ruth,</p>
<p>let’s try the following steps to troubleshoot this issue.<br />
1. run outlook as administrator. <br />
hold shift while right clicking on the outlook icon from the menu that pops-up &gt; choose run as administrator.<br />
2. if you do not resize the image and just add it as an attachment or paste it in one email, does the issue persist?<br />
3. if you create a folder on the desktop, copy the same image file and paste it to the new desktop folder, then attach it again from the new folder, does it work?</p>
<p>if all above you tried with no luck, i’d like to confirm more details about the scenario.<br />
1. how did you get the error, when you resize the image and add it as an attachment?<br />
2. about the <strong>resize</strong> behavior, do you mean that when you add the image as an attach file and click file, then you choose the option as below?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f802ab41-1da3-453b-ba42-2c7d42592f5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df802ab41-1da3-453b-ba42-2c7d42592f5a" /></a></p>
<p><br />
<br />
or you just resize the image in the paint app and add it as an attachment?</p>
<p>3. does the issue only occur on some image file? how about other files like .txt, .doc, etc.?<br />
4. please capture a screenshot about the image file properties-security and error message.</p>

<p>As I noted earlier, the problem only occurs when I attach an image and select "resize images" on the file tab. It does not matter where the image comes from - any file or even a CD. &nbsp;I can send full size images and all other types of documents with no problems.
 &nbsp;Same issue when I run as admin. &nbsp;If I resize images in Windows file explorer and "send to mail recipient" there is no issue. &nbsp;It is purely an Outlook issue with the "resize" function. &nbsp;On the screen capture you asked about, all &nbsp;of the permissions are checked
 yes, including full control, just as in your example, on all my files, including those where the images are stored, and each individual image. &nbsp;The error message, as I stated earlier, when I try to send after selecting "resize" is "access denied" with no explanation.</p>
<p>BTW, I have also posted this in the Office 2016 forum. &nbsp;I misposted here as I do not have Office 365.</p>

            <div>What happens when you try to change the font color?</div>
<div>Do you get any error message?</div>
<div>Does the issue occur with a particular Word document or all the Word documents?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open Word in safe mode and check if it works fine:</div>
<div><span>Click on Start&lt; All Programs&lt; Accessories&lt; Run&lt; Type ‘winword /safe’ (without quotes) and click on Ok
</span></div>
<div><span>Note: There should be a space between 'winword' and '/'</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are able to work with Word without any problem then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below:</div>
<div><span>Step1: Click the Office Icon and Click Word Options.</span></div>
<div><span>Step2: In the left hand side of the word Options dialog box, click Add-Ins.</span></div>
<div><span>Step3: Under ‘Manage’ Click the COM Add-ins</span></div>
<div><span>Step4: Uncheck all the Add-Ins listed under COM Add-ins.</span></div>
<div>Step5: Click close and restart Word</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Also change the default printer to XPS writer and check if it helps.

    <title>Outlook 2010 change from POP to IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 change from POP to IMAP</h2>
                    <p>1. I use Outlook 2010 for my Gmail using POP but I want to change from POP to IMAP. I can change to IMAP in the Gmail options page, but If I delete my Outlook POP account then set it up as IMAP, does Outlook save my old PST file and creat a new one for the
 IMAP account. I do not want to lose any of my e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Also I assume that the Outlook IMAP account will only download when synchronised just the e-mails that exist on the Gmail IMAP account server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Am I correct in saying that only messages can be copied between PST files NOT folders?</p>

<p>I only have ONE user name. Please provide a link to the other post so I may read it. Maybe another user copied my question to enable them to get a response in their e-mail. I just searched every post for IMAP and counld not find another post with my user
 name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on my Q2 and Q3?</p>
