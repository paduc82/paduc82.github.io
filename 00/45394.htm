<h2>            Family Safety Time Limits Across Multiple Computers</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been reading this forum to find an answer to my problem but still unable to do so. So I am posing this question in hope that my problem will be resolved, or at least my questions answered:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have 2 computers running Windows 8 - one is a PC with Windows 8 Pro and the second is a laptop with Windows 8 (not Pro). My son logs in to the PC and the time limits and curfews are working properly. As I have just bought the laptop, I created a new
 account for him. However when he logs on (after logging off the PC), his time limit is restarted i.e. he gets to have a whole hour even after his time limit (of 1 hour) has expired on the PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My first question:</div>
<div>(1) Is the time limit on the family settings applicable to a total of his time spent on multiple computers? I.e. if I set 1 hour, he can spend a maximum of 1 hour on either computer and NOT 1 hour on the PC and another hour on the notebook. I was unable
 to glean an answer from any of the forum posts. So will appreciate clarity on this matter so that I can determine if the computers are behaving correctly. My assumption (from a pure parental user point of view) is that it should be a TOTAL of the time spent
 on both computers. Otherwise, if I allow him to access more computers, he gets even more time. On top of that, he is using the PC most of the time. So he only uses the notebook when I need to use the PC. I personally think that this is a valid use case, and
 that asking me to set a 50/50 split between both computers is not realistic.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note the following:</div>
<div>- My son is accessing both computers using his Live account.</div>
<div>- I have enabled syncing of information by trusting the devices as per instruction when I added his account to the computers. I have tried creating accounts using 2 methods - one is to create it by adding as a Microsoft account, and another method was
 to create a local account first and then changing it to a Microsoft account.</div>
<div>- I have tried all the various methods mentioned in the forum, ranging from re-creating the accounts to removing the 'corrupted data' from the program data directory to undo the family settings and redoing the family settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second question:</div>
<div>(2) Is the Family Safety service supposed to be running? I see it as manual and not running. Description says "his service is a stub for Windows Parental Control functionality that existed in Vista. It is provided for backward compatibility only."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Third question:</div>
<div>(3) Is it normal that the wpcmon.exe is terminated and no longer running when the child (monitored by Family Safety) is logged on? My son has told me several occasions and I just saw it myself just now that when he was logged on to the notebook, there
 is no family safety icon running in the tray. I checked and the wpcmon.exe is not running... This has happened several times.</div>

            <p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you have multiple questions regarding Family Safety. I will be providing assistance on your inquiries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your first question, Family Safety imposes the total amount of usable minutes per computer. This means that multiple computers will each have its own usable minutes. Using another computer will not affect the time limit of the other computer. This is
 working as designed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you want to add this feature, you can create a separate thread within this
</span><a href="http://feedback.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0000ff">link</font></span></b></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
 and give your feedback or feature requests. Microsoft will review the threads within the link for future reference.</span></p>
<p>As for the second question, Family Safety should be running and the settings should be set to automatic. Other settings might cause Family Safety to not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your third question, the wpcmon.exe should always be running as this is the one that monitors the account. If it is not running, then there might be a problem with the configuration of the Family Safety settings. Please verify if the issue happened before
 or after reconfiguring the accounts. Also, since you've mentioned that it happened on several occasions, please specify how frequent this issue happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll await for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            Regarding your response to my 2nd question - "<i>As for the second question, Family Safety should be running and the settings should be set to automatic. Other settings might cause Family Safety to not work properly.</i>"
<div>For all my notebooks and PCs, the service is turned off by default. So is it necessary to change it from Manual to Automatic? Leaving it as Manual has not created any issue with me in terms of tracking my son's time usage and curfew...</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the third question:</div>
<div>"<i>Please verify if the issue happened before or after reconfiguring the accounts.</i>"</div>
<div>[Chris] After re-configuring, I have not head the issue yet since it was just a few days...</div>
<div><br />
<div>"s<i>ince you've mentioned that it happened on several occasions, please specify how frequent this issue happens.</i>"</div>
<div>[Chris] This issue is only intermittent, maybe once or twice a month. Not a showstopper but just wanted to check if there has been similar reported cases. I tried killing the process when I logged in to my son's account but it does not allow it even though
 it is running using my son's user id. So the possibility of him killing the process is not there...</div>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for waiting. Our support specialist said that it is possible that there might be a problem with the Family Safety component and the reconfiguration of the account might have resolved it. For now, we cannot trace what exactly causes the issue. If
 in case the issue happens again, we request you to contact us again so we can further assist you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the settings for the Family Safety service, please note that we recommend setting it to "Automatic" if you are experiencing problems with the Family Safety, but leaving it to "Manual" should still let Family Safety work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you still need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Cortana and microphone button</h2>
                    I have an ASUS UX303U laptop running Windows 10. &nbsp;I can press the microphone button on Cortana's search bar and it works through the speech and answers my query. &nbsp;The next time I press the microphone button it snaps to the speech recognition for about
 .3 seconds and then brings up tips, the weather in my area, local new etc. &nbsp;I've shut my machine down and restarted and the results are always the same; the first time functions flawlessly and then I have to type my questions in.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for sharing your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Have tried using&nbsp;different headset, does the issue persist ?</div>
<div>
<p>-&nbsp;Have you&nbsp;made any changes to the&nbsp;PC prior to this issue? </p>
<div>- Have&nbsp;you installed all pending updates on the PC ?</div>
<div>- In which user account&nbsp;are you&nbsp;facing this issue ?</div>
<p>
</p><p>Sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;PC and login to the Admin account or the Microsoft account&nbsp;to test if that helps with this issue.</p>
<p>Also, Install any pending Windows updates on the&nbsp;PC to check if that helps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You may also disable cortana, restart the&nbsp;PC and enable cortana to check if that helps.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click on the <strong>Cortana</strong> <strong>box</strong> in the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> or Open Start and click on Cortana</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. In the left top corner <strong>click</strong> <strong>
on</strong> the<strong> Three stripes icon.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Then click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Settings.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Now <strong><span>turn</span></strong>&nbsp;on to <strong>
<span>off.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Cortana should now be disabled on your system, you can enable it at any moment again by simply repeating the steps and instead of turning it off you will turn it on at step 4.</span></p>

            Hi NeilSinclair1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />On the login screen, click on Sign in Options and click on Dial Pad. This should allow you to login with PIN.
<br />
<br />If not, let me know. Also let me know whether you were using a Microsoft account or local account whose password you can't remember.

</p><p>Thanks for replying. There is nothing saying Sign In Options. I am on the screen that appears when you first turn on your computer. It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Neil Sinclair" Then there is a box for password, that normally says PIN. Then there are 4 symbols in the bottom right corner. Keyboard type, Internet Access, Ease Of Access, and Power.</p>

</p><p>I'm not sure if its for&nbsp;<span>Microsoft account or local account. I just know it is to access the computer.</span></p>

<br />
<br />If you have security info on your account, Microsoft will send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave to Microsoft. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE USING LOCAL ACCOUNT

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<h2>            Creating a Recovery&#47;Repair boot USB Drive, MS Directions, shortcoming</h2>
                    <p>Hello: I found this link to achieve what I want, but there is a flaw.&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The directions progress fine up to the point of opening and beginning the create the USB drive.&nbsp; The direction says enter create a recovery drive. The window opens with the title Recovery Drive, and sub title Create a recovery drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All is well thus far, but the next step is to "make sure the Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive check box is checked."&nbsp; Well, my check box won't accept the check mark.&nbsp; It is sort of grayed out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I mention all of the sequence progressed fine until that point, which includes checking to see if an img was already on my machine and it wasn't.&nbsp; It also directed how to make a folder and create the img and get it in there, which worked out fine.&nbsp; I
 could even confirm that it made it and put it where it is supposed to be. It is still there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So how do I get that check mark to be accepted in the Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your help .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Clarence</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just a bit further, mine is an up'd to windows 8.1 from windows 8.&nbsp; I want to make sure that if and when I do a recovery, I recover to windows 8.1 instead of having to go back to my windows 8 disk and the windows 8.1 download from the store once more.&nbsp; Seems
 very cumbersome and I want to avoid that.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            Have had the same problem with my Toshiba lap top also upgraded it from windows 7 to 8 then 8.1.Did make the recovery image as explained in this link http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive then did this with the .WIM file
 inside the RefreshImage folder on the c: drive.
<div>1 locate the .WIM file&nbsp;</div>
<div>2 Right-click on this file and select Copy from the pop-up menu.</div>
<div>3 Use File Explorer to navigate to the C: drive on your PC. &nbsp;Create a new folder inside the root folder of your C: drive named C:\Win81-Recovery</div>
<div>4 Use File Explorer to navigate into the new C:\Win81-Recovery folder.</div>
<div>5 Right-click inside the folder window and select Paste from the pop-up menu to copy the .WIM file from the RefreshImage folder to this new folder location Rename the WIM file Rename it to INSTALL.wim. (or rename the Refreshimage folder to Win81-Recovery
 and just rename the Wim file in it to save time and space)</div>
<div>&nbsp;6 Right-click on the Start button tip and select Command Prompt (Admin) to open a new elevated Command Prompt window.&nbsp;</div>
<div>7 Inside the Command Prompt window, run the following command line to register the copied INSTALL.WIM file as the Recovery Image on your PC: REAGENTC /SetOSImage /Path C:\Win81-Recovery\INSTALL.WIM /Index 1 . &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;The recovery partition checkbox in Recovery should now be available .</div>
<div>HOPE THIS HELPS &nbsp;here is the post i got the tip from just changed were I got the .WIM file from and renamed it.http://blogs.technet.com/b/keithmayer/archive/2013/11/06/windows-8-1-unable-to-quot-copy-recovery-partition-quot-when-building-recovery-drive.aspx</div>

            <p>When you set a Refresh Image as an install.wim and are then able to copy it to a flash drive, even if that works, it would not seem to be something you would want to do, since that image is there to RESET the system, not REFRESH the system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can create an image of your current OS partition and use it for an install.wim file and place it in a Recovery partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not tried using your procedure to set such an image without doing it from an actual recovery partition,&nbsp;&nbsp;but I suppose
 I should try since you feel it is a possibility.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>"The recimg.exe command line tool lets you configure a custom recovery image<br />
for Windows to use when you refresh your PC. When you create a custom<br />
recovery image, it will contain the desktop apps you've installed, and the<br />
Windows system files in their current state. <strong>Recovery images do not contain<br />
your documents, personal settings, user profiles, or apps from Windows Store,<br />
because that information is preserved at the time you refresh your PC.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>When you create a custom recovery image, recimg will store it in the<br />
specified directory, and set it as the active recovery image. If a custom<br />
recovery image is set as the active recovery image, Windows will use it when<br />
you refresh your PC. You can use the /setcurrent and /deregister options to<br />
select which recovery image Windows will use. All recovery images have the<br />
filename CustomRefresh.wim. If no CustomRefresh.wim file is found in the<br />
active recovery image directory, Windows will fall back to the default image<br />
(or to installation media) when you refresh your PC.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note that you cannot reset your PC using a custom recovery image. Custom<br />
recovery images can only be used to refresh your PC."</strong></em></p>

    <title>Hibernation not working after Windows updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyfuchikami  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hibernation not working after Windows updates</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a problem from time to time with my Dell XPS 8930 that has the Optane memory (probably not the cause). After updating Windows, I sometimes find that when I hibernate the computer, the next time I turn it on, it's as if it had shut down rather
 than hibernate because it takes as long to boot as if it were a cold boot and none of the apps are running that I had open when I hibernated. At that point my only option is to put the computer to sleep as I can't wait a few minutes each time for it to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would notice that there's another Windows 10 update a few days later so when I did that update, now hibernation works as designed.&nbsp; Of course, later on when there's yet another Windows 10 update and I install it, sometimes hibernation doesn't
 work again.&nbsp; Then, later when there's yet another update that I install, hibernation works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that the subsequent updates are addressing the non-working hibernation function which is why the update comes so soon after a big update? When I first experienced the problem, I contacted Dell but it was a waste of time because all of the things
 they wanted to do was what I had already checked.&nbsp; I guess they thought I was a newbie who knew nothing about computers. (I suspect most of the "support" people at Dell just have a book with various symptoms and they just follow what it says and aren't really
 that knowledgeable.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've come to the point that when there's a "cumulative" update for Win10 and it screws up my hibernation, then I'll just wait until the next update which usually fixes the problem. Until then, I just put the computer to sleep (which isn't bad because
 the power supply fan doesn't run anyway unlike the older PCs that didn't have smart power supplies).&nbsp; Any comments on this issue is appreciated.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. #4 doesn't apply (desktop PC) and #3 has been set by me long ago as I want to be able to enter Setup, boot options, etc. if I need to. My power settings have hibernation enabled and the few times it doesn't appear on the power menu
 when I turn it off I merely use the command powercfg /h on prior to powering down. Step 1 was done when I had Dell on the line and it found nothing wrong. I kind of suspect that periodically a Windows update (especially the large, major ones) is what affects
 my PC as most of the quick smaller updates, many that don't require reboots don't seem to cause this issue. I've kind of learned to live with it and when it happens, I just know the next update will revert it back to the way it should function. None of the
 steps would probably result in anything because hibernation is working properly right now. I'll probably visit those suggestions to make sure those settings haven't been altered when the issue arises again after an update. It's too bad they can't leave well
 enough alone.&nbsp; Even my Firefox browser changes some of my settings when it updates to a newer version.&nbsp; I always have to change my default search engine from Google to the one I prefer each time I get an update. I wonder if they have a "deal" with Google.&nbsp;
 I would think an update could be done in a way to retain all of my settings that I had made with the version that's being replaced.<br />

<h2>            transferring passport backup from old computer to windows10</h2>
                    I have a passport with files backed up on it from my old computer running windows 7. When I plug this into my new dell computer running windows 10 I cannot access the files. I can find the file with my old PC name on it but the sub files or folders are
 just a string of letters and numbers so I can't tell what they are. I wanted of course my photos and documents etc. I cannot install my passport on the new
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">computer</span> because it wants to delete everything. I have tried sharing, looking into restore from another place, etc.&nbsp;

                    <p><span>Hi, my Realtek HD Audio uninstalled by itself and now I can't re-install it. I've tried many solutions like install the driver from my manufacturer website ( Gigabyte
 ) and even tried solutions offered by people online but nothing seems to work. Is there any chance you guys know how the fix to my problem? Providing links to install RealTek would be useless since ive tried so many and so far none worked? Please help someone,

            Thanks for your reply, my Windows version is 1809 and the thing is that theres no RealTek in my device manager and even in control pannel, even when i try downloading it back, nothing shows up. Ive tried installing it using the “install legacy software”
 but i got the BlueScreenOfDeath and was forced to reset my PC. Even after resetting it, windows didnt try to download it.Do you think updating my BIOS will help? Thanks

            Hi, I sent my PC to a repair shop hopefully they’ll fix and no everything was working fine in device manager no yellow triangles or anything. The only problem was that realtek was missing from “sound”. Also I received a blue screen because I tried installing
 “RealTek HD Audio” from legacy softwares via device manager. The error that caused the BlueScreen is “RTKVHD64.sys”.

 RealTek is now working but before it used to say RealTek HD Audio and now it says RealTek(R) Audio, is it the same thing or an older version? Also before when I used to start my PC, I had a start up screen saying American blabla before booting into windows
 but now I have this screen “Gigabyte insist ultra durable”? Is it ok? Did I downgrade or something? Thanks everyone! (Btw this is not my screen but its exactly what im now getting)</span></p>

 it. I also disabled the onboard audio.</p>

            <p>No actual idea what was wrong, to be honest, but I finally got it working after 9 tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What fixed it was me resetting my BIOS. If that didn't work, I was going to pull the CMOS battery and try again. It wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, reset BIOS. What a silly issue. Some setting in my BIOS was causing Windows 10 to not fucntion on upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboard is an Asus P7P55D-E - Microsoft techs, I recommend looking at my error log. It's an issue with some BIOS setting.</p>

<h2>            charged but no play button</h2>
                    On the video app in RT Surface, when I purchase a TV episode, after the confirm button, I get a message saying, 'Could not complete transaction. Please try again later'. My credit card gets charged, the video app shows a 'Buy episode' button. If I try
 again, I get charged again. Sometimes it goes through, sometimes not. Each time it fails, I still get charged, and I still do not have the ability to 'play', the episode.

            <p>Just got thru with xbox support. In these cases, looks like the failed transactions are being reversed. I was able to try again and the transaction went through. The agent confirmed the final charge was for one episode only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be nice to see some sort of message that you are not being billed more than once. It is also disconcerting to see an email that you have been billed for an episode, but you are unable to 'play' that episode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hi Deborah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ll be glad to help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you few questions to get better clarity on this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to send and receive email using Windows Live Mail?</li><li>What happens when you send a test email?</li><li>Were there any changes made prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Disable your antivirus program and try to do send and receive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persist proceed with method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Repair Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Take a backup of the email before making any changes to Windows Live Mail.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you take the backup follow the steps below to repair Windows Live Mail.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap </span><span><span><strong>Search</strong></span></span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Enter </span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span> in the search box, and then tap
</span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span>.</span></li><li>Click on <strong><span>Programs and Features</span></strong></li><li>Search for <strong><span>Windows Live Essentials 2012 </span></strong>and <strong>
<span>right</span></strong> click it.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Uninstall/Change</span></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Repair all Windows Live programs</span></strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to be&nbsp;completed and&nbsp;click <strong><span>restart now</span></strong>.</li><li>After restarting your computer run Windows Live Mail and check if the issue still occur.</li></ol>

<h2>            Office 2007 Freezes on Start up</h2>
                    I'm running a Windows XP Home SP3<br />
<br />
With 2GB of ram<br />
<br />
A 320 GB hard dive<br />
<br />
And a nvidia 6200 Video Card<br />
<br />
<br />
My Probelm is when I start Word up since the last boot up.&nbsp; The Word windows will Freez for about 20 minutes then it will work.&nbsp; I can't close the process in Windows Task Manager when it is locked up.&nbsp; I can still work with other programs when Word is freezed.<br />
<br />
If I try to close Word by clicking the red X button it SOMETIMES give me a message that word is not responding&nbsp;and would I like to end now.&nbsp; I click yes and IF IT ENDS I can start up word and it will freez for 5 seconds and then it will word fine as Long as
 I do not restart my computer.&nbsp; But If I do restart my computer then it will start this process all over.<br />
<br />
Sorry for my spelling,<br />

            Do you have any anti-virus program that has an Office plug-in enabled? If so, disable them to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Try starting Word using the /a switch. This will stop any add-ins from being loaded. If this solves your error problem, you know it's an add-in causing the trouble.
<br />
<br />
Click Start | Run and then In the Run dialog box, type winword.exe /a (with a space between .exe and the /a)
<br />
<br />
You can also try to unregister and re-register word by entering the following into the same RUN prompt. You may need to change the path to reflect the true location of Winword.exe This will re-write some registry values that may have been corrupted.<br />
<br />
Click START | RUN and type the following commands one by one.<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /unregserver"<br />
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /regserver"

<p>Hello Brian1964,</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here and download the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility</a> and see if Java shows up with this utility. You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed
 by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over.<br />
<br />
Once you have removed the installation files, go to <a href="http://www.Java.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.Java.com</a>&nbsp;and download the most current version of Java and try again to install it.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't help, then reply back with any error message and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

</p><p>I suspect that there might be some problem with Windows Update components, which is causing the issue. If your computer is having problems finding and installing operating system updates, try using the

 network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly. </p>
