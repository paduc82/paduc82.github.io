<h2>            Nokia Lumia 620 App store not available error  805a01f4</h2>
                    I have been receiving this error message on my&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 8.1 windows phone for the past week: "Service Not Available. The store isn't available at the moment. Please check again later. This error code may be helpful:&nbsp;805a01f4" I have been in touch with&nbsp;
 Caledoes the app provide and they have advised it's a Microsoft issue. I have checked the forums and note that this is and has been an ongoing issue with Microsoft. Is there a solution to this problem and if so where can I find it. Many thanks in advance.

            <p>OK, so I would probably suggest that you use the contact us feature and have a live chat with a representative. They should be able to help you out with that (it really is not something we (as moderators) can not deal with in the forums.</p>

<h3> laurie o  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I install IE9 64-bit over IE9 32-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to install IE 64-bit. I've uninstalled IE 32-bit only through windows updates (64-bit wasn't installed previously), and downloaded the 64-bit installer. However, as I install, the intallation reports that it has failed, and directs me to a troubleshooter
 page, which doesn't help. So I Google it, and find this: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/windowsupdate00003715-error-not-able-to-install-ie/10084565-1a51-4ab2-8105-ac57979bc68a">

<p>When I look at the help page, there's a second option saying that I cannot install IE9 on battery power - yet I'm plugged in to the mains (but it is a laptop I'm using)...</p>
<p>Specs: Dell XPS 14 with Microsoft Signature, nVidia Mobile graphics, i5 first gen processor.</p>

<p>Did you install IE9 via Windows Update or did IE9 come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it?</p>
<p>=================================</p>
<p>If it's a Win7 64-bit computer, you have two versions of Internet Explorer: IE 32-bit (the default) and IE 64-bit (cannot be the default). Shortcuts to both should be listed in your Start menu.</p>
<p>The executable for IE 32-bit is located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</p>
<p>The executable for IE 64-bit is located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</p>

            <p>Thanks, I know what the difference between x64vand x86 systems. I have 64-bit. Unfortunately, MS decided I only needed 32-bit IE pre-installed when I got it. Now, however I'd like IE9 64-bit. And it's not the 64-bit browser that I want, but the 64-bit tools
 that IE also installs (not that I have any add-ons for JIT to utilise anyway).</p>
<p>The problem is that trying to install IE9 again (both 32 and 64 bit) through Windows Update fails and gives me a help search: "WindowsUpdate_0000C355" "WindowsUpdate_dt000" (yes, I've googled that as well - this occurs for any BITS-related update failure).
 It seems more of a MS tech question, but I have a feeling it's more isolated to my specs.</p>
<p>Another thing, I've tried installing it with the option to stop programs and also to restart afterwards. Both fail.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Win7 64-bit computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (already) installed? See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Which version of the Windows operating system am I running?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</a>
</p>
<p>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite
<em>and when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6a. Is <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9</strong> (still) listed in <strong>
Start | Control Panel | Programs and Features | View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)?</p>
<p>6b. Did you <em>uninstall</em> <strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9</strong>&nbsp;via
<strong>View installed updates</strong> or via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs and Features | Turn Windows features on or off</strong> ?</p>
<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>8. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2586448, KB2567053; KB2570947, KB2616676 &amp; KB2567680</p>
<p>IN RE the "I cannot install IE9 on battery power" issue:</p>
<p>9. Do you store the battery in its bay even when you're not running on battery power?</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;Do you connect to the mains using the power-cord/charger hardware that came with your Dell computer when you bought it
<em>AND</em> is the power-cord plugged into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_strip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power strip</a>?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>=&gt; If you installed IE9 via Windows Update, you would have IE9 32-bit &amp; IE9 64-bit installed. If you attempted to install the Win7 32-bit version of IE9 manually, it would not have installed.</p>
<p>=&gt; You cannot "overinstall" IE9 not can you (literally)&nbsp;uninstall IE8.</p>

            <p>1. I recieved it on the 18 May 2011. Purchased it about 6 weeks beforehand</p>
<p>2. The computer is always kept up-to-date, so yes, Win7 SP1 is installed</p>
<p>3. Microsoft Security Essentials. No third-party security software</p>
<p>4. A Norton free scanner was installed,&nbsp;but all it did was scan, and not act - I couldn't find it on the web again</p>
<p>5. I didn't get any free-trial security software with the laptop pre-installed</p>
<p>6a. No, that's where I went to uninstall IE9</p>
<p>6b. See 6a. (via installed updates)</p>
<p>7. No third party browsers were ever installed</p>
<p>8. Yep</p>
<p>9. Yes, the battery and power was plugged in during the install attempt</p>
<p>10. I was using the original charger, but plugged directly into the wall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; I could not find IE9 64-bit anywhere - not in the registry (not that I'd know where to look), nor in the Program Files (not Program Files (x86)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* This is still not resolved, but somehow I was allowed to install IE9 with no problems a few hours after posting the previous post. This is odd, as there was no change in cirumstance or environment between attempts, no processes or services stopped or started
 between attempts, no updates installed between attempts. I'm no expert, but I'm having a guess that some background process I was unaware of was doing something that was preventing the install of IE9.</p>
<p>Either that or my computer is temperamental. I prefer the latter.</p>

<p>COMMENTS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>I've tried to install [IE9] 64-bit. I've uninstalled [IE9] 32-bit only through windows updates (64-bit wasn't installed previously)...</blockquote>
<p><br />
If you'd installed IE9 via Windows Update, you would have installed the Win7 64-bit version which included IE9 32-bit
<em>and</em> IE9 64-bit by default.&nbsp;When you then uninstalled IE9, both IE9 32-bit
<em>and</em> IE9 64-bit would have been uninstalled &amp; IE8 32-bit <em>and</em> IE8 64-bit would have been restored automatically.</p>
<p>If you couldn't find a shortcut to IE9 64-bit in your Start menu after you first installed IE9, chances are you (or&nbsp;someone else with Administrative privileges or using your User Account)&nbsp;removed access to IE9 64-bit (i.e., turned-off IE9 64-bit via
<strong>Programs and Features | Turn Windows features on and off</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Reposting for IE9...</em></p>
<p>The executable for IE9 32-bit&nbsp;should be&nbsp;located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\<strong>Program Files (x86)</strong>\Internet Explorer\<strong>iexplore.exe</strong></p>
<p>The executable for IE9 64-bit&nbsp;should be&nbsp;located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\<strong>Program Files</strong>\Internet Explorer\<strong>iexplore.exe</strong></p>
<p>Shortcuts to both should be listed in your Start menu.</p>

<h2>            N900 rebooting and boot mode not working... NEED HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I need some help with my N900.<br />
<br />
First I have installed the Nitdroid N11 and play with it a bit but I had some reboot problem but nothing wrong on the Maemo OS.<br />
<br />
After installing the new Nitdroid N12 as stated in the forum, I have loaded into the N12 and play a bit with it. But the N900 were still rebooting every so often (may be every 10 min) into Nitdroid UMay aka N12. Because I didn't install the new kernel which
 is nitdroid-kernel-2.6.28-07_rc3_armel.deb I have decided to do it and see if it will change anything. So after installing it it didn't change anything.<br />
<br />
So I decided to reboot into Maemo but the boot option did not work anymore.<br />
I have the N900 restarting every 50 sec, the orange light always on and the Nokia logo showing up but the phone doesn't get to the boot option.<br />
I have try to load into boot mode but it doesn't work. I am not even sure if it is charging at all.<br />
<br />
Did someone had the same problem? Can anybody help me?<br />
<br />
Cheers</p>

<div>For anyone having the same problem.</div>
<div>I have found a solution. It seems like it was a battery problem.</div>
<div>This is I have done:</div>
<div>I have connected the N900 battery in parallel with an other cellphone battery by connecting the + to the + and the - to the - (here it was the Samsung SGH-F480); while the other cellphone was plugged to its charger and while the N900 was plugged to the
 USB.</div>
<div>Why have I done this? Because the other battery wasn't working well even when I was trying just to connect it to my N900 with a couple wire. Basically it was difficult to maintain the wires while working on the N900 since it is not it's original battery</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>With that in place I was able to enter the rescue initrd boot mode (<a href="http://wiki.meego.com/ARM/N900/Using_Rescue_Initrd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wiki.meego.com/ARM/N900/Using_Rescue_Initrd</a>) and later flash the phone as usual.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Effectively it seems to me that the battery was not charging at all because the voltage was to low. Now it is charging normally</div>
<div>So CASE CLOSE</div>

                    <p><span>I know this has asked been asked before, but it is very irritating.</span></p>

<p><span>I just had to reset my Lumia 950.</span></p>

<p><span>Everything went smoothly apart from that under my phone number it now says “Unknown”. There’s no option to edit or add it.</span></p>

<p><span>So, I followed the instructions from “How to find your phone number in Windows 10 Mobile”, but my number is nowhere displayed.</span></p>

</span></p>

<p><span>1.Through the Phone settings (There’s no option to edit or add it)</span></p>

<p><span>2.Through the About settings (there is no “More info” option)</span></p>

<p><span>3.Through the Network &amp; wireless settings (It now says “Mobile &amp; Sim, not Cellular &amp; Sim and there’s no phone number displayed under Sim info)</span></p>

<p><span>I can make calls and send text etc.</span></p>

<p><span><span>How can I get my phone to display my phone number?<span>&nbsp;

<p>I have the same issue with Lumia 640.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I found on other forum.Maybe it can be helpful.</p>
<p>I have the same problem on an Android phone. From doing some research on the web, I have found that it's a SIM card issue.<br />
On some older phone models (e.g., the T50 and some Nokias) you could write your phone number to the SIM - not as a regular phone book entry, but as a special "my number" type thing, usually found in the phone book settings or phone settings. Most modern Android
 (and presumably some iPhones) phones have completely overlooked this fundamental feature, and have no way of allowing you to write your own number on the SIM (again - I'm not saying as a phone book entry, but as a special entry just for this purpose).<br />
Most Telstra SIM cards do not come with the phone number programmed on the SIM - even though the packaging of new products will have a sticker stating the SIM serial Number and service (phone) number.</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
1) Remove SIM<br />
2) Insert into old handset that allows you to write your own number in the phone or contacts settings<br />
3) Write your number to the SIM through the special "my number" option found in the settings or contacts (again - this is not the same as just making a phone book entry for yourself saved to the SIM )<br />
4) Replace the SIM into your new handset.<br />
5) Voila! You should now see your number displayed instead of "unknown".</p>
<p>Yes, it's a pain in the neck.<br />
Yes, it's a major oversight by the handset manufacturers.<br />
But unless Telstra starts selling SIM's with the service (phone) number pre written to the SIM, or the manufacturers fix the oversight, it's the only solution I'm aware of...</p>

            &nbsp;The most handy solution for me was just to make a contact of myself in my phone contact book with my number, addresses etc. Syncing with a cloud and I always have it.

<h2>            Edge and Cortana not working on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    Since last update 10.0.14393.576 (delivered on tuesday 13th December), Edge (and Cortana connected with Edge) are not working on my Lumia 950 XL using Windows 10 Mobile. Edge won't open. Soft reset did not work and I don't want to reinitialize with hard
 reset. Is Microsoft going to deliver a patch or a clean update, either way of Edge or windows mobile 10, to resolve that problem ? PS: I am located in France so excuse my English.

<p>

</p><p>If the issue stemmed from the latest Windows version, you can opt to use the previous version using the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT). Just back up your files before doing so as it would delete all of the files on your phone.</p>

Hi Billy, I'm still experiencing the problem. I don't want to reinitialize either way with hard reset or with WDRT which will have the same consequences. I hope that Microsoft will deliver a patch or a clean update, either way of Edge or Windows 10 Mobile,
 to resolve that problem. I'm using Monument Browser to kind of replace Edge, but I can't choose to set Monument Browser up by default because the setup is in Edge itself ! so when I use a link in Cortana, in a mail or in any other app, it won't open the page
 because&nbsp;the smartphone is trying to open it with Edge! I hope that Microsoft will react quickly because I'm obviously not the only one to experience problems with that bad update as&nbsp;I can see on several forums and websites ! PS: I am located in France so excuse
 my English.

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished my 30 days Microsoft office trial, and on the top of each microsoft office product I open, there's a red banner that says "Unlicensed product" but I can still use it and type.</p>
<p>Is this okay and safe?</p>

            <p>Safe? Yes. But as I understand it, even if you can type, you should not be able to save or print these changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you noted, what you are seeing is Office in it's "disabled" or trial expired state.&nbsp; The intent is that you cannot use Office in this state, it will not cause any harm to your computer or your files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can leave it in this state, buy a product key and "activate" it to get full function back or uninstall it and replace it with one of the free alternatives to Office.</p>

<h2>            xxxxxxx.com was already added to a different Office 365 tenant xxxxxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com.</h2>
                    <p>Hello - I am unable to proceed during my Office 365 set up when I was asked to verify domain ownership via TXT records.&nbsp;&nbsp; I updated the O365-provided TXT record&nbsp;via my registrar, but when I return to the VERIFY step, I get the same message and of course,
 a new TXT value, which I update on the registrar website.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I removed the&nbsp;xxxxxxx.com domain from within O365 setup and start over again</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I've taken are within the O365 setup:&nbsp; I enter the xxxxxxxx.com domain, I'm provided with a new TXT value, I update the value in the registrar, wait a few minutes, then try to verify again.&nbsp; But I get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, you have problem with verifying domain in Office 365 portal. Form the error message, this issue may occur if the domain exists in another Office 365 organization. I would like to suggest you check if you previously
 verified the domain in Office 365, you must first remove the domain from its current location. The domain can only exist in one location in Office 365. For more details:

                    I have been getting this message when I try to access some videos on YouTube and other sites. What is this? The computer is new and has a lot of space. The only think I have done differently recent is that I delete "computer Registry, or some type of fixing
 tool that some how got installed on my desktop and would always run this performance and them tell me that I had to buy their product. After checking that they were a another party from Addobe or Flash, I deleted it. What should I do?

<h3> merrymaids  say:</h3>
<h2>            we&#39;re sorry, but we could not start your office installation. Another installation is in progress. Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>Starting back in May of 2014 I started receiving an error msg. that basically stated my spell check was no longer working. So I followed the link to download spell check, didn't work. Finally I got in touch with someone via the online chat function, they
 took over my computer and uninstalled MS office (University/Student), then reinstalled and it worked perfectly. About three weeks later the same thing happened, so I did the same thing, got in touch with the help desk and then uninstalled and reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well yesterday (7/14/14) the same thing happened, my spell checker decided not to work, so I (just like they did) uninstalled MS Office (my warranty ran out and MS help desk refused to help me), shut down, restarted, ran a virus scan and ran fix it. I went
 to install MS Office and it continues to say, "we're sorry, but we could not start your office installation. Another installation is in progress. Please try again later.". There is not anything installing on my PC, so I guess I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why can't I download and install like before, why is this error msg. coming up?</p>
<p>2) Why does my spell check keep uninstalling on it's own? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p><span><span>Just to mention the few most important:</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App

<br />Go to Privacy - Camera
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your Camera' is turned on and make sure Skype is also set to On

            1. Windows Key+I &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure that Let apps use my camera hardware is ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype 
<br />
<br />2. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work - Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here

    <title>Some animations lost when making video from PPT 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some animations lost when making video from PPT 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very simple 2 slide PPT with audio on top, all recorded in PPT. When I run the slide deck in power point the 2 slides sequence correctly the the 10 lines of text in the second slide are shown sequentially as intended 2 seconds apart with the audio
 synced perfectly.</p>
<p>When I choose to "save as" or "export" to create am MPEG 4 or WMV file (selecting to use the timings already in the PPT) the result is that the audio and the video runs fine until I get to the 4th line of text on the 2nd slide.</p>
<p>At this&nbsp;point, the remaining 6 slides all appear at once on the slide and not in the sequence when&nbsp;I run it as a PPT.</p>
<p>To be clear, when I run it as a PPT slideshow, it executes perfectly. When I save it&nbsp;as MPEG I am selecting to use the recorded timings.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>File is pretty small: 2 slides, 2MB PPT, video runs for 36 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Ian</p>

            <p>Hi Girish,</p>
<p>Tried replying to you before but I guess something went wrong. Anyhow I tried the process, disabling the HW acceleration&nbsp;as you describe above&nbsp;but unfortunately it did not solve the problem - same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is a pptx file - I have since tried saving it in as many other formants as I could but this did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried reducing the deck to only 1 slide in case this the what power point can "handle". that did not work either. Am open to new ideas/suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>I have gone through the process of enabling Content Advisor. I have listed websites I want to block using the 'never' button. However, it only blocks links to the websites. For example, if I block youtube, I can't access a youtube link from google but I
 can just type 'youtube.com' in the address bar directly and access it that way. For other websites, some blocking occurs (I can't access the discussions on reddit, but I can still get to the main page by typing it in the address bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the 'restricted sites' method in the security settings, which doesn't block websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution here? Firefox and Chrome both have easy solutions, but I can't uninstall IE due to some university&nbsp;webpages I need which are&nbsp;only compatible with IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: My intention is to block these sites from IE. I still want to access these sites in other browsers, as I have add-ons that only block the sites for certain time intervals.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response. I will be glad to assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which browser is set to default in your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Content Advisor feature works best in allowing or blocking websites only when Internet Explorer is set to default browser. I suggest you set Internet Explorer as default browser and use the Content Advisor tool to block websites and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information on Content Advisor, please refer the following Windows Help article links.</p>

<br />
The first time I went through an made a safe senders list.&nbsp; Within 10 days important emails from supposedly safe senders were going to junk again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last time there were two items in there that made me furious.&nbsp; One from my doctor and one from my bank.</p>

            <p>hi kevin,</p>
<p>it’s not feasible to achieve that because dg (distribution group) is used to distribute emails to every member in it. about this point, we appreciate your understanding and welcome you to submit feedback to the related team via the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar</a></p>
<p>customers’ feedback is the best way to improve our products and services all the time.</p>
<p>in addition, if acceptable, here is a workaround for your reference:</p>
<p>1. login to owa (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>) with your account.</p>
<p>2. click the gear-&gt;<strong>mail</strong>-&gt;<strong>inbox and sweep rule</strong> and then create an inbox rule like the picture shows below (sent to the dg and receive from yourself):</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3bf598ad-277a-4745-9cda-4243b17389e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3bf598ad-277a-4745-9cda-4243b17389e2" /></a></p>
<p>you can also choose the <strong>mark the message as read</strong> option in the
<strong>do all of the following</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: if you choose the <strong>delete the message </strong>option, messages will go to your
<strong>Deleted Items</strong> folder directly and marked as unread. if you choose the
<strong>mark the message as read </strong>option, messages will go to your <strong>
Inbox</strong> folder and marked as read.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which company website are you facing issues with?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Were you able to access the website before without any issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the section “Show or hide the Internet Explorer toolbars” in the following link.
</span></p>
<p><span>Customize the Internet Explorer toolbars</span><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Customize-the-Internet-Explorer-toolbars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Customize-the-Internet-Explorer-toolbars</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can hit the “Alt” Key on the keyboard to pull-up menu bar.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the toolbar keeps disappearing, you may press F11 key on the keyboard.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps to turn off the pop-up blocker and check if the pop-up appears correctly -</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Tools button, and then click Pop-up Blocker.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Now turn off Pop-up Blocker, click Turn off Pop-up Blocker.</span></p>

                    <p>I have 950XL build 10.0.14965.1001, the physical camera button used to work fine - I pressed it and the camera app showed up even the screen was locked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since from some builds back it no longer worked this way, after I pressed the&nbsp;camera button I still have to unlock the screen manually before I can use my camera app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is the point to have a physical button? There is a soft button on lock screen already.</p>

<h2>            prevent users from moving or copying a workbook</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am looking for a macro to prevent users on a PC from moving or copying an excel workbook to a different location, I need the workbook to stay in the location of shared drive T:/users/MN/documents.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>Well, it's probably rather unfriendly to shut down Excel as a whole - besides, they might have other workbooks open with quite a bit of work involved in them.</p>
<p>So let's look at it like this:</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp; If ThisWorkbook.Path &lt;&gt; "T:/users/MN/documents" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "You may not open the workbook from this location."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Close<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>That one just shuts down the one file, not Excel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of course, as I mentioned before, if they simply don't allow macros to be enabled, then they can use it from anywhere as much as they want to.</p>
