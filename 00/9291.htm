<h2>            Microsoft states no workaround for current GSOD</h2>
                    <p>FYI - From Microsoft posted in the Windows blog:<br />
"We are investigating certain situations in which PCs might bugcheck (GSOD) during the installation of new builds (15002+) causing the PC to rollback to the previous build."<br />
"ADDED 1/13: During the installation of this build, Insiders may experience a storport.sys bugcheck (GSOD) causing them to rollback to the previous build.
<strong>There</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>currently</strong> <strong>no</strong>
<strong>workaround"</strong>. </p>
Applies to 15002 and 15007 and maybe future builds!

    <title>Activation issue with Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donlocke1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation issue with Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 365 personal version in January of this year and had no problems until a few days ago when it told me that it was unlicensed and would quit functioning in a few days. Well that happened yesterday, i can no longer do anything with any of
 my files. When I try to activate it it says there is some issue with the server, try again in a few minutes. I have kept trying and still nothing. I have tried repairing it, removing and reinstalling it and I even tried to upgrade it and purchased the Home
 edition and still nothing.</p>
<p>I need this for work as all my documents and forms are in excel and word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been working on this for hours and hours now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps...I am working on a ship now off the coast of Ghana and the internet service is sat based and shows my location as Norway</p>

            Hello  DonLocke1
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />First you need to verify if the license is really active, or if you need to pay the subscription again because it has expired, for this
<br />If you have an Office click to run (that is, it is activated with a login in Offfice using user and password): access: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-out-when-your-office-365-subscription-expires-2eb89f06-bd1c-4f57-9269-f1cbab894341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/find-o...</a>   to check if your license is currently active.
<br />
<br />Once you have verified that you do not need to renew the service, open any of the Office products (Word, Excel, Outlook etc) and go to:
<br />File \ Office Account
<br />In the panel on the right, you will see the option to activate the license in yellow.
<br />
<br />Try activating from there with the product key (if it is MSI) or with username and password (if it is click to run)
<br />
<br />In case that the activation of an error continues it will be necessary to pause the antivirus and also perform a cleaning of the registry keys with the following steps:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove product key
<br />1. Locate the one in the path where the "ospp.vbs" file is located, usually it is:
<br />1. C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Microsoft Office \ Office16
<br />2. &lt;C: \ Program Files \ Microsoft Office \ Office16&gt;
<br />2. Open a command console by specifying with CLIK RIGHT "Run as Administrator" and execute the command cd &lt;C: \ Program Files \ Microsoft Office \ Office16&gt; (or C: \ Program Files (x86) \ Microsoft Office \ Office16 depending on the path where the "ospp.vbs" file is located).
<br />3. Execute the following command in the console: cscript ospp.vbs / dstatus
<br />4. * Take note of the results of "product key", these would be 5 uppercase characters, for example 2PK9C
<br />5. Execute the following command in the console: cscript ospp.vbs / unpkey: 2PK9C
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Edit the record to delete cached credentials. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />1. Click Start &gt;&gt; Run, type regedit, and then click OK.
<br />2. In the Registry Editor, locate the following registry subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Office \ 16.0 \ Common \ Identity \ Identities
<br />3. Remove all keys listed within this record.
<br />
<br />Restart the system and try the activation again.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the problem was solved with these steps.

<h2>            N97 music player take 3 mins to refresh playlist</h2>
                    hello guys, i jus want to know if other people are also experiencing my problems. i'm not going to touch every no97 music player issues. i'll tell you one at a time. well here it goes, when i've about 400 songs in the music player and i decide to delete
 one in the list, the list(playlist) takes 3 mins to refresh. this is eally annoying.

<p>Seems pretty normal to me, refresh will search the phone for any new music, and 32gig plus a memory card can take a while. But why did you need to refresh just because you removed one song ? I have over 2500 tracks on my phone, takes a few seconds for music
 to open up but other than that it works fine (all music has album art )</p>
<p>What other problems do you have ?</p>

<p>Thank you Carman58 for your reply. There's misunderstanding here though, but I think It's my fault ( I didn't make myself clear).</p>
<p>Okay, When I wrote above about "refreshing", I didn't mean the refresh like when you add new songs from mass memory or memory card to the playlist. From experience, it's too good to be true for N97 to take only 3 mins to add new songs to the playlist:).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, let me go straight to what&nbsp;I meant.&nbsp; When I delete a song from the playlist, the playlist disappears while&nbsp;a lil box showing the percentage of deletion pops up. After 100% deletion, the lil box disappears while the playlist remains blank(disappears).
 After 3 or more mins, the playlist comes back to life and I can now play around with it. It has been that way since OS ver12... Ver20 the same. However, when&nbsp;I have only 25 or so songs in my playlist and&nbsp;I decide to&nbsp;delete one, the playlist takes a few seconds
 to list my songs again&nbsp;just as n95 does. The same thing happen to n95 playlist when you insert a 16 gb memory card containing about 4000 songs! So&nbsp;I&nbsp;reasoned that&nbsp;the N97 RAM and processor can't handle my huge library.(???.) Just as an aside(irrelevant though),
 I've 24 mp4s about 1hr and 300MB each in average.</p>

            It might have something to do with your 4000 musicfiles nad big mp4's... I don't know if this helps, but I discovered that i got a slower musicapp with music stored in folders inside of folders and so on.&nbsp; I had an issue with setting ringtone to. - I went
 in the menu of the phone where i could change ringtone. I wanted to set one of my 1000 songs as ringtone, but inside the settingsapp it said that I only had like 500 songs. My musicplayer told me I had my 1000. When I put all my musicfilse in one folder (without
 any underfolders), I could go back to ringtonesettings and i showed me 1000 songs. You could try to play a little with this, and see if it makes it faster. But, you have a lot of files as you said, so you got to expect it to use&nbsp;a few seconds extra...:)

<p>Thanks Fender77,</p>
<p>I guess you're right(huge files = problem). There's some evidence that it's a memory problem: when you click on application, phone setup ,personalisation,then type the name of your phone, then ringing tone( select songs, then all songs and here the error
 appears: 'Memory full. Close some applications and try again'). This is because 4000 songs is just too much for n97 to handle or list.</p>
<p>The big question tho is, why on earth did nokia put 32gb onboard with lil hardware support?</p>
<p>I'm really disappointed. I paid A$1000 for this phone just&nbsp;to see the whole thing turns into a nightmare. there are trillions of issues with this phone.I don't even know where to begin...just dissappointed.</p>

            have you tried to put all your files in just one folder? But, it might be softwarebugs, and it might be related to the low amount of ram and slow cpu.

<p>Hi, all my music is drag and dropped into the Music folder on E, I drag a full album folder into this (normally including a jpg image of album cover) if I want to delete a song, find it quicker to find the track in ' All songs' rather than in 'Album', also
 tend to edit stuff on computer via usb connection rather than on phone (though use both methods, as well as file manager on handset). I have about 8gig free on E and don't have any issues with media playback (over 60 music vids and full length movies on E
 in Video folder ) If phone is 'laggy' try a hard reset, but if you can cope leave it as it involves a good bit of time in 're-building' your phone !</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

    <title>Word can&#39;t compress my pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> passakornkongrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word can&#39;t compress my pictures</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Word Student 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a short document that contains only text and 13 pictures. They are all .png files. I copied them from various sources and resized them to be much smaller in the word doc. Now they are all roughly thumbnail size so that I can fit a bunch on the
 same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I saved the file, it was huge -- 62MB. I tried compressing the pictures using the feature in word's Picture Format ribbon, but it did nothing. The file is still 62MB. I tried compressing the images one by one. Nothing changed. The file is still 62MB.
 I even tried compressing to 96 dpi -- nothing changes. It seems like this feature simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. If not, I'd suggest flagging this as a bug to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Re-sizing the images in the Word document will not reduce the size of the image file.&nbsp; What you could do is in resize them in another Word document to the required size and then use a screen capture program such as Snagit from www.techsmith.com to take
 a screen capture of the image and then insert that screen capture into the Word document.

<p>If you have logged into your account on a different phone since you last logged into the 520, then it could have affected the licence that came preinstalled on the 520, in whcih case you would need to contact the Nokia India Care line for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have more than one Nokia account, you might want to check if you ar using the correct one.</p>

            The <em>'Insert Columns'</em> option on the Design ribbon creates an empty new column to the left of the currently selected column in the design grid.&nbsp; If the selected column is to the right of the last column in the grid therefore, nothing will happen.&nbsp;
 It would normally be used to insert an empty column either at the extreme left or between two existing columns in the query, so that an expression can be inserted to return a computed or constant value in the result table.<br />
<br />
To insert a column (field) from one of the tables in the query, this would normally be done by dragging the column from the table onto the design grid at the desired position, or by double-clicking the column name in the table to insert the column to the right
 of any existing columns in the design grid.&nbsp; Any misplaced column can easily be moved to a new position by dragging and dropping the column with the mouse.<br />

Yes. &nbsp;I am aware I can also add columns in those ways. &nbsp;What concerns me specifically is that for some reason the "Insert Columns" feature does nothing when I click on it. &nbsp;As I mentioned, it worked before. &nbsp;

<p>Turns out it wasn't the Skype app afterall.&nbsp; I had mistakenly thought it was because I looked at the icon that pops up during the shutdown process.&nbsp; It says "This app is preventing shutdown".&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn't say what app it is.&nbsp; So, I went to File Manager and
 looked for the icon.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I found out today that that particular icon is on many background processes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know which on is the culprit.&nbsp; &nbsp;I took a screen shot of one of the background processes to show you what the icon looks like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your second suggestion, on the last step, there isn't a 'contacts' option.&nbsp; The only option is 'choose automatically'.&nbsp; This didn't fix my issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Outlook profile might be damaged or corrupted. <span>
Create a new profile in Outlook and set it as default. To know how to create a new profile for Outlook, refer to the link below:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</font></a></p>
<p>Once Outlook profile is created, open the old data file and try the steps suggested in the previous reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open the old data file, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Outlook &gt; Click on File &gt; Open &gt; Open Outlook data &gt; Select the data file &gt; Click on Open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm still getting outlook data file errors when moving emails to folders.&nbsp; My pst file is 1.9GB and is 97-2002 format.&nbsp; Am I at the maximum size?&nbsp; How to I convert this to the new format which supports larger size?</p>

                    <p>the latest update 17063 will download and install just fine, but will not allow me to run edge, the only way I can use edge is to go to google and type www.outlook.com to allow edge to work, every time I try to use edge in build 17063, as soon as I click
 on the edge icon it will start to work but then shuts down immediately, I rolled back to 17046 3 times after I installed 17063 on my computer, is there any way I can uninstall edge then reinstall it by itself?</p>

<b>NEVER</b> received anything at my alternate account! EVER!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bypassed the code item and the notation stated I have 2 more days before the code is required!&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens after those 2 days pass?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I be permanently locked out of hotmail??&nbsp; Just
 this morning it took 3 tries to even get logged on for a quick e-mail check!!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am on an APPLE Mac, using Firefox, with NO viruses or other issues, cookies allowed, cache/history cleared every 2-3 days regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY am I unable to get the codes at my alternate e-mail (Yahoo acct.)?&nbsp;&nbsp; SAME issue occurs using Safari.&nbsp; ALL Mac items
 are current with latest updates.<br />
I have notified ALL contacts to use my YAHOO acct. for e-mail until further notice.&nbsp;
<u><b>IF</b></u> I end up being locked out of hotmail, I will have to stay with Yahoo for primary e-mail and try to find a different free e-mail host for my alternate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had hotmail for DECADES!!&nbsp;&nbsp; This new OUTLOOK stuff is worthless and I have had NON-STOP

            I spent 6 plus hours on this issue and had my paid support tech team look at this.&nbsp; My conclusion is it is a problem Microsoft invented to rid itself of non-paying accounts.&nbsp; I contacted my states Attorney General.&nbsp; When that was reported to Microsoft
 my problem went away as mysteriously as it began.&nbsp; This is a greed issue, not a computer issue.

            <p>I have been working with the GSOD issue since trying to download 15002 on Monday. I have checked all drivers in Device Manager line by line, reset, refreshed, started fresh with a new copy of Windows etc, etc, and have tried every method listed in this forum
 to resolve this issue. HP 15-af131dx Windows Home 64 bit, 4gb ram by 500gb AMD A6 5200 APU with Radeon HD Graphics 2.0 GHz. Now sitting on 14393.693 RP. Issue started after refreshing 14986 and then trying to download 15002. I even tried some of the Microsoft
 basic drivers as recommended. I will post to feedback shortly.</p>
<p>Now I see hope in the horizon as Dona posted the following in the release notes for 15007:</p>
<p>"We are investigating certain situations in which PCs might bugcheck (GSOD) during the installation of new builds (15002+) causing the PC to rollback to the previous build".</p>
<p>Hope to be back soon,</p>
<p>JOHN</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Lots of feedback and up votes on this issue in the Hub.</p>

<h2>            Office purchased at Bestbuy return</h2>
                    A few days ago, I purchased a new HP laptop and Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student. The sales associate failed to inform me that Office already came installed on my new computer. When trying to return it, I was told that it is out of their hands and to email
 Microsoft. Basically I have a brand new unscratched activation code for Office and I want to return it for a full refund.&nbsp;

<br />The sales associate failed to inform me that Office already came installed on my new computer.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello ABPuchalski
<br />
<br />Just to confirm one thing, virtually every new computer comes with a 30 day trial version of Office so is this in reference to an explicit licensed version of Office provided by HP as part of the laptop purchase?
<br />
<br />In any case, unfortunately, your issue is with BestBuy who should be refunding the purchase of Office H&amp;S if the software has been unopened and the key card not scratched off given that this only occurred a few days ago.       
        </p>

<p>MS won't help.&nbsp; They already have been paid when BB bought the Office license wholesale, end of story as far as MS is concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back and talk to the store manager. I have seen a couple of reports where the BB "service desk" didn't help, the BB store manager did. The sales associate should have known the computer "came with", it is normally part of the sales info for the model.&nbsp;
 Did you open the Office package at all?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Office already came installed on my new computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But does it include a license for Office? As Karl mentioned, all computers include a trial version for Office 365 subscription. Once the trial ends, you will need a license if you want to continue using Office.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note that you will not need to uninstall/reinstall to change the license. When you redeem the key and sign in, Office will reconfigure the license as needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Also note that the preinstalled trial will include Outlook software but Home &amp; Student does not include Outlook.&nbsp;</p>

            Well after looking into it a little further, it doesn't seem to be a trial version of 365. It has the option to purchase it though. I still have access to Word, Excel and others. Maybe I'm just ignorant but I don't see anything that states a time limit
 either. As far as I can tell, I believe it is just a basic version of Office.&nbsp;

<p>Have you opened and used any of the apps yet? When you first open an app, it should tell you if its a trial. File, Account in any office program should also say if its a trial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There have been some computers that "come with" a full Office 365 Personal license (yes, for 1 year only).&nbsp; The way it works is there is a tile/icon in the start menu. The user clicks on it, is prompted for an email account to activate the license on. In
 the background the tile submits the product key to MS to complete the activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AB, in any Office application go to File menu &gt; Account command. Look on right side of "backstage" pane under the Office logo to find out what license you have.&nbsp; Tell us what it is.

<h2>            Zune software won&#39;t run on xp</h2>
                    I have all the updates and recently bought a Nokia Lumia 800 which for some bizzare reason forces me to use zune software to access my phone, i ave no trouble downloading Zune software but halfway through installation it jumps from about %40 to %88 and
 i get the "a problem has occured, send error report" message, i have the new service pack so i dont know what it could be, any help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>I have had the same issues with Zune since I aquired my Lumia 800 (iphone wannabe)&nbsp;after some atempts to get answer from this forum I was informed that xp is old and requires some deep mods.</p>
<p>the volenteers on this site don't have a real solution to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;basically to penny pinch instead of writing a new connectivity/sync software they decided to use zune which has always been problematic (search the web)

            I've been running the Zune desktop software on both of my XP sp3 computers for some time now and continue to use and work with my XP computers and Zune with no problems whatsoever.&nbsp; The Zune software works on XP computers that have been upgraded to service
 pack 3.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=10767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> If you're not running service pack 3 on your computer, then you'll need to upgrade your computer to SP3.</a><br />
<br />
With one of my XP computers, I had a problem getting the Zune software to run after I got it installed to the computer, but the problem was fixed after I installed the
<span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft .NET Framework v2.0 redistributable</span></a> to the computer.&nbsp; I downloaded the file from the link
 above to the computer's desktop.&nbsp; Then I disabled my antivirus software, clicked the file and it installed to the computer.&nbsp; After that I was able to open up the Zune software (no repair or reinstall of the software was necessary).&nbsp; The computer had other,
 more recent versions of the .NET Framework software installed to it, but it needed v2.0 for Zune to work.</span><br />
<br />
Installing the Zune application to a compatible computer (one that is running XP sp3 or a more recent windows OS) really doesn't have anything to do with what windows phone you are using.
<br />
<br />
You could also download the<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"> </span>

</span>Zune installation package</a> and then see if you can install to your computer<br />
<br />
PS: I don't consider any windows phone 7 to be an "iphone wannabe."&nbsp; If you want an iphone, just go get an iphone.....it's really no big deal.<br />

            <p>Prof Julie </p>
<p>Thank you for your reply I have had trouble getting zune to work for months now and came to the point where I'm irritated not all of us are computer geeks (not stero typing just frustrated) and have given up even trying
</p>
<p>i have been on microsoft answers several times and not found a solution for getting the zune to launch
</p>
<p>I have have upgraded to SP3 and loaded NET Framework v2.0 and fixes, disabled my antivirus software&nbsp;that I have adivsed to do to no avail still without zune working.
</p>
<p>If you can help, then please help me&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;not a computer geek and would like zune to work so I can at least update the phone also it would be nice if the forum advisers would&nbsp; persevere and stay and see it through I have had 1 adviser on this forum just give&nbsp;1
 possible solution then not heard from them again. </p>
<p>would really like to get my zune to work .</p>
<p>To your P.S the Nokia windows phone is a dissapointment I have been a avid Nokia user and was assured that the Nokia Lumia 800 windows phone was the phone to have only to find that my&nbsp;older Nokia 5800 can do more, syncronising calendars,&nbsp;editing word docs,
 navigation etc trouble free I have a old PDA that out does the windows phone in some operations it was really frustrating seeing my freinds with iphones doing the same&nbsp;funtions seamlessly,unfortunately I'm tied in with a long contract so not an easy change
 but after seeing how the iphone performs the equivilent tasks I'm tempted to take the loss and get the iphone.

            wd4u4me, you haven't mentioned any errors you are getting. We can't help if we don't know what's going on. Without it, the only thing I can say is go to
<a href="http://update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update</a> and make sure you have all the Important updates installed.<br />
<br />
Further more, the Zune software can run on XP, it doesn't require "deep mods" that you mentioned in your first reply.

                    Just updated to 8.1 which found it to be amazing but with one major FLAW, i can no longer text to anyone, not even myself. Why? Is anyone experiencing anything similar in particular or found a source that can fix this issue? I mean what's the point of
 having a phone when you're missing 1 out of the 2 components that make it a necessity for our daily routines.&nbsp;

<h2>            Word for Mac - Options for Opening Documents</h2>
                    <p>Searched forum topics but this issue is not covered. &nbsp;Using Word for Mac 15.33 on macOS Sierra 10.12.4. &nbsp;When opening a Word document, File|Open, File|Open Recent, double clicking the file in Finder, the document opens in a reduced size window and I get
 an audible alert but I'm not sure what Word is alerting. &nbsp;Each time I open a document I need to resize it to full screen so my weary eyes can read the content, menus, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other version of Word I have used on Mac and Windows opens documents in full screen mode. &nbsp;How can I do this in Word for Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>First off, your installation of Office 2016 is behind on updates Version 15.36 is current. Before troubleshooting any issues it would be best to use
<strong>Help&gt; Check for Updates</strong> in order to bring the software up to date. That, alone may resolve the issue. Restart your Mac after updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may find that this occurs only when opening existing documents in Word 2016 for the first time. Nuisance that it is, once you've reset the window the document should reopen at that adjusted size, especially if any changes are saved to the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alert may be due to a Preference setting... Have a look at <strong>Word&gt; Preferences - General</strong> to see if the box is checked for
<em><strong>Play sounds for events...</strong></em> - if so, clear the check.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Bob but issues remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word for Mac updated to 15.36, macOS Sierra updated to 10.12.6. &nbsp;No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the issue applies to all Word documents -- existing, newly created, created by others on their machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to pursue next.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions Tina. &nbsp;First, in reply to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;</span><span>Resize the document window, click save and close it. Then reopen the document, check if it shows the size as it last closed.</span></p>
<p><span>As note before, newly created documents, resized, still open in a reduced size window.</span></p>
<p>2.Does the issue happen to a specific document or all documents?</p>
<p>Again, all Word documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Create a new Word document and check if the issue happens.</p>
<p>One more time, issue still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.Does the issue happen to other Office applications? (Excel/PowerPoint)</p>
<p>No. &nbsp;Excel and Powerpoint files open in full-sized application windows. &nbsp;The issue only applies to Word documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the referenced thread, interestingly, when I changed display resolution from 'Default for Display' to 'Scaled | Larger Text', all Word documents open in full 'Print Layout' document window. &nbsp;However, when I reverted resolution back
 to the default, the issue reappeared. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight as to why this is so? &nbsp;Once I reboot in Safe Mode, what would I look to investigate? &nbsp;Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid Tina is not a user of Microsoft Word, else she would have known the answer to your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open Microsoft Word to a new document, a default template called Normal.dotm opens. The state in which the Normal file was saved is what you see when you open Word. If it was saved small, it opens small. If you saved it with a particular font applied,
 then all new documents have that font when they open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Word to construct a brand new Normal template using all of Word's default settings, all you have to do is Quit Word, then delete or rename your current Normal template. Because of Apple policy, the Normal template in Word 2016 is in a very obscure
 directory, which is hidden by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first step is to unhide the hidden Library folder:</p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdgdWYyrbVAhXCbz4KHbU-B0AQFghaMAs&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macobserver.com%2Ftips%2Fquick-tip%2Fshow-library-folder-mac-sierra%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1J2YTOQkRGfz4kwBS6se1NN9H2A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>How
 to Show the User Library Folder in macOS Sierra - The Mac ...</strong></span></a>
<p>
</p><p>Then, navigate to this incredibly bizarre location dictated by Apple:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a1a2393-a4f5-4af1-aa47-417ff511a1d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a1a2393-a4f5-4af1-aa47-417ff511a1d9" height="20" width="683" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a customized Normal template, simply configure an empty Word document with the settings you want and save it as a template. After you quit Word, rename your saved template as Normal.dotm and put it into the prescribed location. The next time
 you open Word, what you saved is what you get.</p>
