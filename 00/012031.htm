<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 Preview not updating</h2>
                    <p>In the last several updates (currently using 15.37) the preview window doesn't update as I scroll through my inbox. &nbsp;If I close Outlook (not quitting it, just clicking on the red button) and re-open, it will work again -- for a while. &nbsp;Anyone else note this
 and anyone have a fix?</p>

<p>Hi Sandy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested in 15.37 and found that it works fine. So, it should not be an update issue. For your situation, it might be a cache issue as it will work for a while if you re-open the client. As a result, you may try the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Right click the Inbox folder&gt; properties&gt; clear the cahce.</p>
<p>2. Re-move the account and re-configure it back to Outlook for Mac. Note: Backup all the data before doing this for the security reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely, you can try on another Mac machine with the same version of Outlook if it is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any sports accessoires available for the lumia phones? For example something that holds my phone when running? Or something to integrate it with my heart rate monitor?</p>

<p>Welcome to Nokia Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for a Nokia branded armband, none. However, there are third-party accessories available particularly the Shocksock Reflective Sports Armband. These can be found on online retail shops like on eBay UK or Amazon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>I have had this problem all day. sometimes i can open folders but not the emails in the folders. i cannot save drafts or send emails, but this is intermittent. occasionally emails send OK and it receives OK most of the time. I continually have the above
 message but it won't go away when i click 'close' - well it goes away for a second but immediately reappears. all other sites are working fine, so it is not my internet connection. i have tired firefox, chrome and IE and cleared the caches and reset each of
 these browsers. i have signed out and signed back in, i have restarted my computer several times and reset my modem/router. Nothing helps, but it is frustrating as i have important emails to send out today. i initially moved to using outlook.com as there were
 so many issues with WLM and Outlook 365 in Windows 8/8.1, but it is turning out to be just as unreliable. If someone could just tell us what is going on and what is being done to fix it, that might add some small comfort.</p>

            Same, most of the day without email, and that annoying green tick on your outlook status page. Here's a thought, after you fix outlook, fix the status page, add a fake apology an ETA, anything to suggest something is being done. And please feel free NOT
 to debit my account this month for the inconvenience.<br />

            <p>Hi. I too am having this problem. I have tried on multiple browsers, on multiple pc, and with different internet connections. I have run back to back tests with other outlook/hotmail accounts and found that the issue is isolated to my email address, and
 most likely the other individuals complaining in this thread. Therefore, the issue is not with a browser, not with an ISP, but with the Outlook server, or perhaps with the migration from hotmail to outlook.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I don't think it's hotmail related as I never had a hotmail account. i use outlook for my ISP provided email account and gmail. anyway, it seems to be working OK this morning whatever the issue was.</p>

            I did not seem to be able to remove mine (I don't know what it is,&nbsp;I have no media to share and it just objected if I clicked on it) - when I clicked 'remove' (or whatever it was - its not available now), nothing happened.&nbsp; Then I thought about the bug
 I just posted&nbsp;re changed view settings not working until all explorer windows were closed - so I did that, and on re-opening explorer the annoying unusable 'thing' had gone.

<p>
</p><p>I have the following formula in a&nbsp;Table&nbsp;Row called "Total Hours" IIf(IsNull([End Time]),Null,IIf([End Time]-[Start Time]&gt;5.5,[End Time]-[Start Time]-0.5,[End Time]-[Start Time]))&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the "Week Total" column is manually input but I would like to add a formula that adds the Previous Row [Total Hours} to the Current row [Total Hours] based on the input date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried some variation of the following formula by trying to refer to the previous [ID] field but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>IIf(IsNull([Week Begin]),Null,IIf([Work Date]&lt;[Week Begin]+7,[Week Total]+[Week Total](PREVIOUS ROW to add to this),Null))&nbsp; THIS FORMULA NOT EXACTLY AS I HAVE USED BUT SHOWN TO HELP UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE ALREADY TRIED, THANK YOU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>First, it is not good design to store a calculated value. Total hours and Week Total should be calculated in a query not stored in your table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if your week always begins on a Monday, you don't need to store the Week Begin date as that can be calculated also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would use 2 queries. The first to calculate&nbsp;Daily Totals, the second Weekly Totals</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT EmployeeID, WorkDate, StartTime, EndTime, Lunch, EndTime-StartTime-Lunch As DailyHours</p>
<p>FROM table</p>
<p>WHERE WorkDate BETWEEN WeekBegin AND WeekBegin+7;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can use A Group BY query based on that query</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT EmployeeID, Sum(DailyHours) As WeeklyHours</p>
<p>FROM qryDailyHours</p>
<p>GROUP BY EmployeeID;</p>

            <p>Why not use the date/time data type for the times?&nbsp; This data type is implemented in Access as a 64 bit floating point number as a duration in days, so there is no reason whatsoever for not using it for time durations of less than 24 hours.&nbsp; Data entry of
 the times is then more intuitive as times can be entered as hours:minutes rather than having to express the minutes as a decimal fraction of an hour.&nbsp; Your expression would then be:<br />
<br />
EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0)<br />
<br />
You can see how it works by entering some literal values in the debug (aka 'immediate') window:<br />
<br />
StartTime = #05:00#<br />
EndTime = #12:30#<br />
? Format(EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0),"hh:nn")<br />
07:00<br />
StartTime = #14:00#<br />
EndTime = NULL<br />
? IsNull(EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0))<br />
True</p>
<p>
</p><p>To compute the cumulative weekly total hours per day sum the total daily hours for the week up to and including the current day.&nbsp; A date/time value summed in this way cannot be formatted as "hh:nn" of course as for values of 24 hours or more the result would
 be the remaining hours less the number of complete days.&nbsp; However it can be done by using the TimeElapsed function from TimeArithmetic.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates the use of a number of functions for doing arithmetic on date/time values.&nbsp; Again you can see how it works in the debug window by multiplying the result of the expression used above by 4 to give a value over 24 hours::<br />
<br />
StartTime = #05:00#<br />
EndTime = #12:30#<br />
<br />
If we multiply the 7 hours returned above by 4 this returns 28 hours of course, but if we use normal time formatting on this we incorrectly get:<br />
<br />
? Format((EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0))*4,"hh:nn")<br />
04:00<br />
<br />
Whereas my TimeElapsed function returns the correct value:<br />
<br />
? TimeElapsed((EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0))*4,"nn")<br />
28:00<br />
<br />
A query to compute the total hours per day and the cumulative weekly total at each day would be along these lines, in which TimeLog is the name of the table:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.*,<br />
Format(EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0),"hh:nn")
<br />
AS TotalHours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT TimeElapsed(SUM(EndTime - StartTime - IIf(EndTime - StartTime &gt; #5:30#,#00.30#,0)),"nn")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM TimeLog As T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.WeekBegin = T1.WeekBegin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND T2.Workdate &lt;= T1.WorkDate)<br />
AS WeekTotal<br />
FROM TimeLog As T1<br />
ORDER BY WorkDate;<br />
<br />
If you continue with the use of a number data type for the times then the query would be the same of course, but the times in the query would be expressed as numbers in which the minutes are expressed as decimal fractions of an hour, and you would not need
 to call the TimeElapsed function to return the value as hh:nn.<br />
<br />
If you want the query to return an updatable result table then you'd need to call the VBA DSum function rather than a subquery.&nbsp; The Balances demo in my same OneDrive folder has examples of this, but using currency data rather than times.<br />
<br />
Note that in the above I've removed the spaces from your column names.&nbsp; Spaces and other special characters should be avoided in object names.&nbsp; Use CamelCase or represent a space by an underscore character like_this.&nbsp; If you do use spaces the table and column
 names must be wrapped in square brackets in the query [like this].<br />

    <title>Sorting bug in Excel - mismatch of data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piotr72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting bug in Excel - mismatch of data</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Excel as a kind of database. Column A is "name", in B "day" in C "status", next columns are some more data about person/project etc. Since column Q where I'm adding latest/current news/updates referring to "name". So it depends on "name" how long
 is each record (I mean line) some only till Q or AA but there are some much longer till BO. Sometimes I have to sort my sheet. And I was surprised as many times I noticed some mismatch in my historical data (I mean updates which I'm adding starting from Q).
 Finally today after more deep analyze and some test I noticed that when I sort by any of columns A-P it's sorted correctly but only till column AJ. All data since AK are not sorted. So it means that person which is on beginning on line 9 and have data till
 BA and after sorting this person is in line 20, but on line 20 you can see his data only in column A-AJ and his data from AK stays still in line 10 so it means in such situation it's attached than to other "name" who previously was for example on line 1.</p>
<p>I now it's a bit complicated but I hope I explained it correctly :-)</p>
<p>FYI - I'm using latest version of software on Mac and Office.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"after a few <em>days</em>"? That very well could be the source of the problem. Allowing any program to run 24/7 often will encourage transitory glitches to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of what Apple, Microsoft, or other system developers may lead you to believe, IMHO, programs need to be Quit [at least once] on a daily basis &amp; the computer - Mac, PC, whatever - should be restarted
<em>at least</em> weekly. If, in reality, the software &amp; hardware worked as flawlessly as it does in their conceptualization, perhaps
<em>sleep</em>, <em>hybernate</em>, etc. would be sufficient... there also would be no need for backing up, redundant drives, or uninterruptible power supplies :-)</p>

            Even though you have a filtered list, Excel will get "confused" if there are blank columns or rows. When you click on Sort, make very sure that the entire range is highlighted. What is happening is that you are not noticing that Excel may eliminate one
 or more columns from your range before sorting. The sure way to prevent this and insure that all your data is sorted properly is to manually select the entire range, and then sort.<br />

    <title>KMS host - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> somnath.banerjee  say:</h3>
<h2>            KMS host</h2>
                    I want to move existing KMS Host from one server to another server. A huge number of Office instances are already activated in my organisation through existing KMS host. What will be the risk if I move the host to new server?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have used ospp.vbs at Office folder to locate existing KMS server as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>1. Install: Setup.exe</div>
<div>2. SetKMS: cscript "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs" /sethst:ServerName</div>
<div>3. Activate: cscript "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office14\ospp.vbs" /act</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We cannot change this process. My question is, if we change the Server name and run above mentioned steps again in all systems, what will be the impact and risks?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance :-)</div>

            Thai Baht symbol is not part of the currency list in Excel. However, same can be inserted from Symbol list.
<br />
<br />Go to Apple &gt; System Preferences &gt; Keyboard and check the option Show Keyboard and Character viewers &gt; Next, click the “Input Sources” button and check “Show Input menu in menu bar”. You should now see a flag in the menu bar &gt; Click on the flag to bring down the menu and select “Show Character Viewer” &gt; On the left pane of the Character viewer, select “Currency Symbol”. (Source - <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/type-euro-sign-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/type-euro-sign-mac/</a>)
<br />
<br />Now, here you will find Baht symbol. 
<br />
<br />But insertion this symbol would mean that you will be able to use your number of that cell where you inserted as this symbol is a unicode. The purpose of using Baht symbol would be for display purpose.
<br />
<br />To get Baht symbol in currency list, you should demand this feature request.

</p><p>It's available in Accounting category as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It simply is not included in the "short list" on the Ribbon because it isn't among the most prominently used currencies in the world.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you are considering to be the "standard list" but if you have a look at my reply to E for Excel you'll see that the Baht symbol is readily available from the
<strong>Format&gt; Cells</strong> dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to use it frequently there are several ways to make it more convenient, one of the simplest being to create a
<em>Cell Style</em>. Once the Style is created it easily can be applied by selecting it from the Cell Styles Gallery on the Home tab of the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to record a macro that applies it &amp; assign a keyboard shortcut to the macro.</p>

<p>I'm afraid it isn't clear what portion of my reply you're referring to by this. The screen shot expressly illustrates that the Baht symbol is available. Exactly where are you looking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another shot of the Thai listing in the Accounting category:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76496736-b793-42c8-9361-5a328989ae18?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76496736-b793-42c8-9361-5a328989ae18?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The listing of formats is something that is not dependent on type of Mac... Although it
<em>may</em> vary based on the build of the Office 2016 installation. However, I've also verified that it is available in Excel 2011, so I would expect it to be included in all builds of 2016 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From <strong>Excel&gt; About Microsoft Excel</strong>, what is indicated as the present
<strong>Version</strong> &amp; <strong>License</strong> type? It should be Version 16.10 or later. Also, what is the UI language of your Office installation?</p>

<h2>            How to unregister Office 2007 to sell on eBay</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Due to recently undertaking a Office365 enterprise subscription incl. Office Pro 2010 I now have a redundant version of Office 2007 Ultimate that I'd like to sell on eBay or similar.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd like to ensure that the product is unregistered properly so that the future recipient doesn't encounter any installation issues and I don't risk breaching any licence terms for the version I'm selling on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What necessary steps do I need to take to ensure that it is in a fit state to sell? &nbsp;The same scenario actually applies to OneNote 2010 that I've bought previously on its own and is now also redundant software due to my Office365 subscription.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks in advance,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Chris</div>
                </div>

            <p>Brian, </p>
<p>That may be for OEM products. The computer/device does not need to be transferred for retail versions..</p>
<p>Excerpt from Office 2007 Ultimate EULA:</p>
<p>"16. TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. The first user of the software may make a one-time transfer of the software, and this agreement, directly to a third party. The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device. The
 first user may not retain any copies. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The transfer must include the proof of license. If the software is an upgrade, any transfer
 must also include all prior versions of the software. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, basically the OP needs to completely uninstall and transfer the Product media and Product Key.</p>

<h2>            do not see the MRU list in &#34;move to folder&#34; outlook 2007</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked on "move to folder" button (or "copy to folder") I used to see a list of the Most Recently Used (MRU) folders. This was very useful and saved time.</p>
<p>Suddenly this disappeared. I do not see this list any more and I see only the regular folder navigation window.</p>
<p><br />
I saw an article talking about the registry I need to delete in order to clear the MRU list (deleted the registry&nbsp;<span>101f031e which is "move to folder history") but it did not help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After I re-opened outlook, and moved a note to a folder, the register appeared again - so I see it is updated with the history, but when I click on "move to folder" I STILL DO NOT SEE THE HISTORY LIST, just the regular navigation
 list</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can someone help?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have found the root cause and the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are TWO "move to folder" buttons!</p>
<p>One is in "edit" category, and the other in the "standard" category (actually both appear in the "standard")</p>
<p>
</p><p>One appears with an arrow near it. THIS button uses the MRU and shows the last folders I used. The "edit" one does not</p>

            Hi Jabbaaa,<br />
<br />
I’d like to answer your 2 questions one by one as follows:<br />
1.<span> </span>May I know if the Oath token is shared between Skype and Office client?<br />
Yes. To be more accurate, this is because Skype for Business clients connect to both Skype for Business Online and Exchange Online, tenant level modern authentication settings should match for Exchange Online and Skype for Business Online. For more information,
 you can refer to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34339.skype-for-business-online-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx</a> (the fifth paragraph of Defaulst).<br />
2.<span> </span>May I know if they all office rich client shares the same authentication token? We would like to understand which MS application will share the Authentication token (e.g. MS office) and which
 will not (e.g. Skype). Is there any document we can reference?<br />
Yes, they all office rich client shares the same authentication token. Modern authentication brings Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL)-based sign-in to Office client apps across platforms. It removes the need for Outlook to use the basic authentication
 protocol. For more information, you can refer to<a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2015/11/19/updated-office-365-modern-authentication-public-preview/
</a>(Office 2016 supports Modern Authentication by default and it needs to know more about Modern Authentication for knowing this question).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            The curtain color is set by the background color of the slide <strong>before</strong> the transition. If the background isn't actually set to a color, the curtains will be black.

<h2>            Exporting Excel invoice to pdf, dynamic hyperlinks missing</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I sincerely hope someone can help me with this issue.&nbsp;I've created an invoice in Excel, with includes a payment link to PayPal so clients may settle their invoices directly. As the invoice totals are different with each client, I specified that the payment
 link be updated using the =HYPERLINK function, updating the link with the total to be paid (in the 'sum total' cell). I wish to export these invoices as pdf files, to be emailed to my clients.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, there appears to be a bug in either Excel or the '<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=9943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Save to PDF or XPS</a>'&nbsp;add-on, which results in the hyperlinks being stripped completely from the resulting pdf, only when using
 the hyperlink function. Simple hyperlinks inserted using the usual insert-&gt;hyperlink method are preserved correctly; links created using the hyperlink function (necessary for dynamic hyperlinks), are lost.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone found a way around this? Is there any way to export pdfs from Excel that preserve hyperlinks created through hyperlink&nbsp;function? I suspect the pdf&nbsp;add-on&nbsp;is to blame, as it is simply a v1.0 product, and does not appear to have ever been updated.
 It would make my life so much easier if this worked as expected!</div>

    <title>Merging Incoming Calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmm17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging Incoming Calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Skype for Mac and have just bought a subscription for a Skype number. Can anyone tell me how to merge incoming calls that have called my Skype number?&nbsp;<br />
Answering a second incoming call just places my original call on hold and there is no obvious way to merge both calls. Can it even be done?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            How to get rid of &#34;borderless&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    My version is Word 2011. When I try to click on "US Letter" in the page layout section, it always automatically becomes "US Letter (borderless)".&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I choose "US Letter"? </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And what is the difference between US Letter and US Letter (borderless)?</div>

            <div>Pages can be defined with arbitrary sizes/non-printing areas through <i>File &gt; Page Setup &gt; Paper Size &gt; Manage Custom Sizes.&nbsp;</i>While some printers can print all the way to the edge of a page (borderless), others cannot (their print head cannot reach
 the edges of the paper, i.e., there is a non-printing area). For regular documents where text does not need to reach the edge of the page, this would not make any difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your documents are being created as "US Letter (borderless)," you need to open and edit your Normal.dotm template to change its paper size (as indicated above) and perhaps its margins as well (<i>Format &gt; Document &gt; Margins</i>).&nbsp;To do this, see my

            No idea "what gives", but since you just installed Lion, I expect you haven't done some basic OS maintenance that you should do any time system software is updated.

<h2>            Microsoft Planner - An error occured while trying to load your plans</h2>
                    <p>We have run into some issues with Microsoft Planner.&nbsp; When we go to the Planner page, it says "An error occurred while trying to load your plans."</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Conditional Access with SharePoint Online and Exchange Online / Mail.&nbsp; When conditional access is enabled, we run into this problem, even though SharePoint Online and everything else works as expected on my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; If we disable Conditional
 Access for my account, everything with Planner appears to work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go directly to one of my plans, I can see the items and create new ones, but I&nbsp;cannot add any comments, or assign a person to a task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and put a comment in on a task, it says "We're still setting up conversations for your plan or you do not have a mailbox in Office 365.&nbsp; Try posting your comment again in a few minutes."&nbsp; I do have a mailbox in Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to assign someone, the graphic keeps spinning and doesn't ever let us assign someone to the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a similar post online, and it was somehow fixed on the back end.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is a similar issue.</p>

To troubleshoot this issue, please help us clarify the following information:<br />
<br />
1. Does this issue occur to other browsers (pure browsers also)/machines/network environments?<br />
2. Do any other colleagues encounter the same issue?<br />
3. Please provide us with a related screenshot of the abnormal page.<br />
<br />
Also, we’d like to collect some related information for the investigation. To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message(PM) to collect the information. You can access the private message via the link below:<br />

            <p>Hi Msdf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received the logs, but currently we can only detected the access denied error. Please allow us some time to analyze it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In addition, since the issue should be related to the conditional access and there are many conditions we can i</span><span>nclude in a
</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-conditional-access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>conditional access policy</span></a><span>. Please share the detailed steps on how you set up it. We will try to reproduce
 the issue and compare the logs between yours and mine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the process for raising a complaint?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought the Microsoft band watch on 29 Dec 2015. Initially the watch was good and came highly recommended. However, since then I have had
 to contact Microsoft on several occasions to get a replacement, see dates below:</span></p>

<p>The band has ripped again, I contacted microsoft and they have basically told me that the watch is out of warranty and they can not do anything about it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            One Drive For Business Guest Contributor</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are using one drive for business in Office 365. Is there any possible way to have a link to a Guest Contributor with Edit/delete permissions?<br />
I have One drive configuration based on support.microsoft to let people edit but the link only lets to download/upload or create folder.I want our people to be able to work without having to login to a microsoft account.So how can i make a folder public so
 that everyone has access and permissions to it??<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>
