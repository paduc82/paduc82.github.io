<h2>            Word 2010 Building Blocks&#47;Quick Parts no longer populating text using short name</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I have a colleague who prepares a lot of Quick Parts/Autotext as she is a keyboard person, not a mouse person.&nbsp; She usually uses the short name to invoke the Quickpart/Autotext.&nbsp; It is no longer working.&nbsp; She can drill down through the quickparts
 and insert it by using the mouse, but it is apparently slowing her work productivity.&nbsp; Any idea what I should look at?<br />

            If you want macros compatible with A2007, create them in A2007, not A2010. Generally, if you create a database in A2010, you can't reasonably expect it to open in A2007. It has always been this way. A2007 database won't open in A2003 and so on.

<p>Hi Jeanette,</p>

<p>It is the same database engine, I believe, with a ton of enhancements. My experience is that everything, with the exception of macros, works OK within the constraints listed on that page.</p>
<p>What I've been doing, (a pain in the neck,) is creating the database in 2010 and then moooooving the database to a 2007 computer, editing the macros, and then mooooving the database back to my regular machine. Microsoft has not just said but blathered about
 there being a high level of compatibility between 2010 and 2007.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if I create an MDB file using 2010, I have the exact same problem. Everything is fine with the exception of the macros.</p>
<p>I appreciate your response but feel there is something deeper going on. Looking forward to finding out. IF I'm right (a big if, I know) I feel MS should either fix this problem or add it to their documentation regarding Access version compatibility.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, it is the same database engine. If you are talking about the table triggers or data macros, they only exist in A2010. There may be a high level of compatibility between 2010 and 2007. However it's just not possible to create a database in 2010 and expect
 it to open in 2007. The rule is that when you want to run a database under different versions of access, create the database in the lowest common demoninator version.</p>
<p>You say "Furthermore, if I create an MDB file using 2010, I have the exact same problem. Everything is fine with the exception of the macros."<br />
Is this a different issue from the original post, which was about opening a 2010 database in 2007?</p>

<p>The macro facility was totally redesigned for Access 2010. There IS a high degree of compatibility between 2007 and 2010. For example, VBA code works in both with no problem. But to ensure compatibility with Sharepoint, macros were redesigned and there should
 be NO compatibility at all between macros created in 2010 and any earlier version. Unless you are using Sharepoint or have need for the new macro capability in 2010, use VBA instead. Macros prior to 2010 were largely useless IMHO.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>I have seen that article too and I consider it woefully incomplete. It reads as if you can simply avoid the list at the top, and it should work in A2007. That is simply not true.&nbsp;MSFT was smart not to add a comment box to it, or I would have given them a
 piece of my mind.</p>
<p>Applications are rarely "forward compatible", and A2007 is no exception.</p>

<p>Well, compatibility-wise, it's just like A2000 and A2002/2003 --the<br />
A2000 database works in the later version, but A2002/2003 does not<br />
work in the earlier version. A2010 databases just happen to open in<br />
A2007 (though I believe they shouldn't), but with a bunch of stuff<br />
disabled (because it doesn't exist in A2007). This is an<br />
"improvemnet" in that you can do certain kinds of trivial things in<br />
A2007 with an A2010 ACCDB. <br />
That is, indeed, something no previous versions of Access allowed.</p>
<p>Whether it's useful or not (given the extreme limitations) is a<br />
different matter. I'd say it's completely useless and believe they<br />
should have made a new file format. For some reason, they chose this<br />
more complicated route. </p>

<p>There were big revisions in macros for A2007, actually, with the new<br />
embedded macros implemented for the first time. This is not as<br />
signficant as the table-level data macros and such, but it's a big<br />
difference. I also believe, if I'm not mistaken, that they<br />
introduced some form of error handling in A2007, but I don't know. I<br />
only use A2007 trivially and have never created a macro even once. </p>

<p>Hmm. I don't read it that way. The way it reads to me is:</p>
<p>Here's a list of everything that doesn't work, and most of it is<br />
INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT. Your app won't work at all (for any<br />
reasonable interpretation of "works") unless it avoids all those<br />
A2010 features. <br />
That is, the list of restrictions is quite severe, as all the new<br />
features of A2010 are not supported. <br />
Again, I don't think this is surprising, given the history of Access<br />
versions. What surprises me is that they made any attempt whatsoever<br />
to keep any level of between-version compatibility. What they<br />
implemented seems to me to offer you nothing that you wouldn't have<br />
gotten with two different file formats, A2007 (usable in both) and<br />
A2010 (usable only in A2010), since the only way you can use an<br />
ACCDB created in A2010 in A2007 is if you avoid everything that is<br />
new in A2010. </p>

<p>Hi Jeanette,</p>
<p>If you create a macro such as "autokeys" or "autoexec" (which I use a lot), or edit an existing macro, it will not work in lower versions of Access and that's what I was posting about. I don't do anything fancy -- I either run a piece of code or open a form
 and that's about it.</p>
<p>I like autoexec because if you open your first form that way, and then import everything into a new db, you don't have to go back into options to assign a startup form. Just a lazy thing I guess.</p>
<p>Autokeys, on the other hand, I really do need. I lock down my databases, (no shift bypass on open, no special keys like ctrl-g,) and when the user presses F11 they're prompted for a password. If they get the password right, I set the bypass property to allow
 shift when opening the database (etc. etc.) Also, ctrl-m in virtually all of my databases return the user to the main form. I can add a button somewhere to unlock the database (yuck), but there is no (reasonable) replacement for ctrl-m.</p>
<p>Not to get off topic, but Access crashes a lot while I'm developing. I also have to decompile my databases every two/three hours (while developing). I'm having other problems too. Autokeys, really, is my biggest concern.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and stick it through. For the record, I make the same mistake every time of buying Office shortly after its released. Add me to the "waiting for service pack 1" list. (FWIW, been using Access since version 2. Remember A95 and the introduction
 of replication? Ha! What a joke!)</p>

<p>Actually, there IS no compatibility between 2010 macros and any older version. I'm saying that its either broken or not documented, and you're saying its broken (more or less). Drove me NUTS trying to troubleshoot this damn problem.</p>
<p>I do everything in VBA. Autokeys cannot be replaced with VBA (in any reasonable way).</p>

<h2>            vocal command to call doesn&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I just upgraded to windows 10, I have a Lumia 640. Everything seems fine, but I noticed that the voice command to make phone calls doen't work anymore, and in the Netherlands we don't get Cortana either. Is it possible to solve this, somehow?</p>
<p>thank you for any advice or suggestion</p>
<p>

            <p>I managed to get Cortana by setting lenguage to English and place to UK. Now I can ask Cortana to call somebody. Still, I find this unnecessary, and most of Cortana function irrelevant or useless. Also, the search botton use to give access to a "eye" which
 would allow QR codes recognition. This function is now lost. It would be nice to be able to use vocal command without Cortana and the old search function as well.</p>

Hi Garym, thanks for the link. I still hope they allow us more flexibility in the future. I will use the feedback feature inside Cortana nterface to say what i think about these changes.

    <title>Indents in Styles keep changing in default set. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Indents in Styles keep changing in default set. </h2>
                    Why do paragraph styles, which I save as a Style set change when I open a new document?<br />
I use indented paragraph styles with a first line indent of 24 pts when using 12 pt Times New Roman type. I save the styles as a quick set when ever I change my default set.&nbsp; Yet, when I open a new document the styles acquire the hanging indents.&nbsp; Why, and
 how can I avoid this? <br />
Thanks,<br />

Did you set the modified style set as the default for the Normal template (in a blank document, click Change Styles | Set as Default)?</p>
<p>Also, note that if the styles of the style set are based on Normal, be sure to include Normal in the set too.</p>

    <title>SQL for One Resulting Record, based on holiday period - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vwp1  say:</h3>
<h2>            SQL for One Resulting Record, based on holiday period</h2>
                    <div>I'm using MS Access. &nbsp;The Access SQL statement I'm constructing is to achieve one resulting record only.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The result I seek, is in the field named <b>vrsn_code</b>. &nbsp;The code is essentially the nickname for my design instructions for my team, throughout the year.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The desired record I wish to have as a result, is that which falls into a particular date window of time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a table of several holiday decoration instructions, each in a respective memo field, and with 4 fields which determine the beginning and ending month and date (day #) for each holiday design. &nbsp;My goal is for the instructions to appear for a limited
 time prior to the holiday, and then return back to the default design, until the next holiday season (window of time). &nbsp;The beginning and ending months and dates (<b>day #</b>) is the window of time to display the code in the memo field.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not bothered with using a date field, because I do not need a year if this will be used every year....all I need is a month and date of the month. &nbsp;The desired record I wish to automatically change to the desired record, according to the "beginning"
 and "end" of each time period. &nbsp;The time period, of course, determined by the beginning month and beginning date (day#) AND the go the next holiday design (or default design) based on the computer clock.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The design is named "version" and I've got the Valentine's Day version (val), the Christmas version (xmas), etc.</div>
<div>The table named <b>vrsns</b>:</div>
<div>vrsnID</div>
<div>
<div>vrsn_chng_end_date_ &nbsp;(the begin date (day # ie 1-31) &nbsp;{Byte} &nbsp; <i>Version Change Begin "date" day #</i></div>
<div>vrsn_chng_end_mth_&nbsp;&nbsp;(the begin month (ie 1-12)&nbsp;&nbsp;{Byte} &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Version Change Begin Month</i></div>
</div>
<div>vrsn_chng_end_date_ &nbsp;(the end date (day # ie 1-31)&nbsp;&nbsp;{Byte}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Version Change End "date" day #</i></div>
<div>vrsn_chng_end_mth_&nbsp;&nbsp;(the end month (ie 1-12)&nbsp;&nbsp;{Byte}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Version Change End Month</i></div>
<div>vrsn_code&nbsp;&nbsp;{Text} (records include val, xmas, stpats, jul4,, etc.)</div>

<div>The Christmas Design should be the ONLY resulting record displayed from December 1 through December 26, and the Independence day design should be the ONLY resulting record from June 25th through July 5.</div>

<div>This is the query I have, and it's not resulting anything (null):</div>

<div>Also, I can't seem to get an IIF statement to display the default code when no record matches today's dateparts. &nbsp;Remember that the year is irrelevant because this will be every year.</div>

I think this should work subject to:<br />

1.&nbsp; No two holiday design periods overlapping.<br />
2.&nbsp; No holiday design period running into the next year, which might be the case if, for instance, the 7 or 8 January date of Christmas in some orthodox churches were used.

            I can't see any problem with the original expressions.&nbsp; You can test them in the debug window with some literal values:<br />
<br />
vrsn_chng_beg_mth_ = 9<br />
vrsn_chng_beg_date_ = 4<br />
? DATE() &gt;= DATESERIAL(YEAR(DATE()),vrsn_chng_beg_mth_,vrsn_chng_beg_date_)<br />
True<br />
vrsn_chng_end_mth_ = 9<br />
vrsn_chng_end_date_ = 5<br />
? DATE() &lt;= DATESERIAL(YEAR(DATE()),vrsn_chng_end_mth_,vrsn_chng_end_date_)<br />
True<br />
<br />
As you see they evaluate without any problem.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is much mileage in your expressions to handle a situation where the range spans the end of the calendar year.&nbsp; You can't assume that the query is only opened in the first of the years.&nbsp; While trying to define the ranges solely by month and
 day of month might at first sight seem more simple, in reality the problems to which it gives rise make it a less efficient solution in my view.&nbsp; I would recommend the you store the ranges as actual dates in a related table like this:<br />
<br />
HolidayDesignRanges<br />
....HolidayID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....StartDate<br />
....EndDate<br />
<br />
This table has two candidate keys, HolidayID/Startdate&nbsp; and HolidayID/EndDate.&nbsp; One can be used as the primary key, the other included in a unique index.<br />
<br />
It is a simple task, once you have inserted one set of dates for all the holidays over one year to roll these forward for as many years as you wish with a little bit of code, e.g. to roll the dates forward for 5 years:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For n = 1 To 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO HolidayDesignRanges(HolidayID,StartDate,Enddate) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT HolidayID, DateAdd(""yyyy"",1,MAX(StartDate)), " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DateAdd(""yyyy"",1,MAX(EndDate)) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM HolidayDesignRanges " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "GROUP BY HolidayID"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
<br />
The above code can be executed as many times as you wish to roll the rows forward by 5 years each time.<br />
<br />
It is then a simple matter to return the row from the current table where the current date falls within the range:<br />
<br />
SELECT vrsns.*<br />

An alternative solution would be to store just one year's dates in the table, and include the table and an auxiliary Counters table of sequential numbers in a query to return the Cartesian product of the two tables, adding the Counter value to the year in each
 row to return dates in sequential years.&nbsp; However, I again think this is only a superficially more economical solution; I'd still go with the table of dates over a sequence of years into the future.&nbsp; It is always going to be a small table, given that the number
 of years ahead to which it would be reasonable to project is limited.<br />

            You are right, that the year is only partially relevant, and the mechanics are easier, using a date/time field datatype. This works great...providing the Christmas design ends on or before 12/31. &nbsp;I am now challenged with a default design, which &nbsp;- as
 you remember - my result should be the codename: <b>xmas</b>, or <b>easter</b>, or<b> jul4</b>, or
<b>val</b>. &nbsp;I will simply use the code <b>dflt</b> as the default code in an IIF statement.
<div><br />
<div>The following was tried, by means of changing the clock on my computer, temporarily, and re-executing this query:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>SELECT vrsns.*</div>
<div>FROM vrsns&nbsp;</div>
<div>WHERE DATE() BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I didn't test this against the usage of anything except 2013. &nbsp;I can tell by looking at this, that only the current year will be used, as it is extracted from the current date. &nbsp;So.... this is great. &nbsp;Thank you for simplifying this for me. &nbsp;I'll still
 need to use DatePart to ignore any year which is stored.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I added BeginDate and EndDate fields to my original table (<i>rather than a new table</i>), ignoring the begin month, begin date (day#), end month, end date (day#) for this experiment. &nbsp;Full dates are easier...at first.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to play devil's advocate here, I'm going to try something new: a begin date field, and a field which contains the quantity of "days of duration" for which the design changes will be effective. &nbsp;i.e. 26 days for Christmas, starting 12/1 &nbsp;I am hoping
 I can retrieve a default design, in this way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One way I can achieve a default, is to create date ranges for all the calendar days not included in the handful of holiday ranges, which is a little old-fashioned I guess, but it'll work for now, until I can come up something better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i.e.&nbsp;</div>
<div>1/1/2013 through 1/24/2013 | dflt (default)</div>
<div>1/25/2013 through 2/15/2013 val</div>
<div>2/16/2013 through 3/1/2013 dflt (again)</div>
<div>3/2/3/17 through 3/18/2013 stpats</div>
<div>3/19/2013 through 5/15/2013 dflt (again)</div>
<div>Memorial Day range</div>
<div>default range</div>
<div>July 4th range</div>
<div>default range</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is why I tried DLookup before....</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just tried NOT BETWEEN and am drawing closer....! :)</div>

<h2>            Converting Word 2016 Doc to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a manuscript in MS Word 2016 using a an MS Word size template of 6 x 9 for a book. &nbsp;However, I keep running into problems when &nbsp;I try to convert the doc to a PDF for the printer to print. &nbsp;I use an On Demand Print company by the name of CreateSpace,
 an Amazon company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I "print to PDF" the file reverts back to the standard 8.5 x 11 but it does embed my fonts properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I "export to PDF" the file size remains constant at 6 x 9 but the fonts are not embedded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this issue?</p>

 locally, now my iPhone was deleting the inbox at 7 days.&nbsp; Changed iPhone to IMAP as well and everything is being saved on the server.

            <p>That doesn't fix the issue, the protocols OutlookCal and OutlookMail are linked to Calendar and Mail from Outlook.com and cannot be changed, therefore Cortana still looks for Outlook.com in order to manage appointments and send emails...
</p>
<p>What's the point of paying for the Professional Office Suite or acquiring a Office365 Suite if you are forced to use a free basic edition of a very limited application? I can't figure that out!</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, outlookcal and outlookmail protocols are associated to the Mail and Calendar app by default, and they can't be associated to the Outlook app.<br />
<br />
We understand that you want to make this possible to have an easy way accessing your Outlook app and the Outlook Calendar. We would really appreciate if you share this concern to us using the Windows Feedback App on your Windows 10 computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Word 2013 crashes when using equations, save as, print, and randomly crashes when it is left there</h2>
                    Word 2013 will keep crashing whenever I try to use the equations, open a document and scrolling through a little.
<br />
This problem has been persisting since I was previously using Office 2010. Tried reinstalling 2010 many times and the problem still persist. Used the FixIt to uninstall each time and I decided to upgrade it to Office 2013. However, I am able view my document
 for a longer period of time.<br />
<br />
Is there any fix to it? I have reinstalled my Office 2013 and have downloaded the compatibility pack, manually removed both 2010 and 2013. After reinstall, the problem still persists.<br />

            I have no addins besides the one that comes together with the Office 2013, the one on OneNote. I do no have Abbyy Finereader installed and neither do I have Toshiba Book Reader.
<br />
<br />
My Word 2013 doesn't crash on the launch at the splash screen but after I have successfully opened a document, and tried viewing it a little and is crash. Now whenever I tried to use the "Save As", "Print" it keeps crashing whenever I go into that menu. And
 when I tried inserting and equation, using those "radical, matrices" tool, upon clicking them, it crashes.<br />

            So, basicallly... "Do you have any other software on your computer?" What in the world CAN Office operate with? Of course I have Adobe PDF reader, and I need it and do not intend to uninstall it. I am paying for the Office software- fix it if it cannot
 run compatibly with so many other programs. This is an office issue, and users should not be expected to uninstall pretty much everything they have in order to run software that we paid for.

<p>While the issue does affect Office, it is the third party applications that are causing the issue - generally I understand because of coding issues in those applications.</p>

<p>Typically, in the Event Viewer, under Windows Logs-&gt;Application, there will be an Error entry with the application name. The text in it can provide valuable information. Assuming you clicked "Check for solutions", there should also be an entry right above
 of level Information, Source Windows Error Reporting, and this should include a Fault Bucket # and a Problem Signature in the text below. Please share this information also.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there should be something done by Microsoft, because we are not supposed to understand why Office 365 Home Premium can work well on Sony VAIO but keep crashing on Toshiba ultrabook, under the same W8 Pro platform!</p>
<p>Look like we buy a car but we spend too much of time pushing it and very little of time enjoying driving it.</p>
<p>Do something Mr SB! Thank you!</p>

            Yea, the volume adjustment can (only?) be done by the game's option menu. But it should have been done by the volume key.

            The reason why I think N-Gage games don't use the main volume keys to set the game volume is that not ALL devices that may play N-Gage games have dedicated volume keys.<br />
<br />
I think it was just to enable greater compatibility if they decide to have a phone that doesn't have volume keys but could use N-gage games.<br />
<br />
This is IMHO ;)

    <title>Waterfall chart - Microsoft Excel 2016 - Totals reset when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebij  say:</h3>
<h2>            Waterfall chart - Microsoft Excel 2016 - Totals reset when grouping&#47;ungrouping</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a single dashboard of waterfall charts but depending on what selection I make from a data validation list the waterfall charts will need to be different lengths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a couple of different methods of doing this, the latest of which is ensuring all of the data tables that drive the waterfall are the same number of rows, all the user needs to do is group/ungroup rows to get their waterfall looking the right way.
 Frustratingly however when you do this a couple of times the end total resets itself so you end up constantly having to set the total when you're flicking from one to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this or does anyone have a better method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would work but my issue is that in my example you'd have differing lengths of waterfall chart depending on whether you selected A, B or C. So if I selected A this would work if all 12 months were populated but B only has 9 months and C only has 6 months.
 I don't want to show the months which are blank hence why I'm grouping rows so I can hide/unhide datapoints depending on which dropdown I select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when I group/ungroup the rows the total resets itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ben</p>

<p>We can make the chart dynamic, but unfortunately that did not work if you have labels on the horizontal axis:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0086b75-efe9-4d6e-9478-0b34660ffd7a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0086b75-efe9-4d6e-9478-0b34660ffd7a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or no Axis label are possible. If you have labels, the chart shows all labels (they are taken only once when the chart is created).</p>

<h3> shamussftmac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 and Filtering within a Meeting Minutes Template</h2>
                    <p>I have a meeting minutes template which is somewhat basic and is laid out as below.&nbsp; However, when I filter on location, I can only see one of the&nbsp;recorded meeting minutes, and it is always the top one.&nbsp; I want to be able to filter on location and&nbsp;look at
 all the notes historically.&nbsp; Is there anyway to group a section of cells like this together?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, if I filter for 'North' I only get North with XXXXXX and Pick Up Stuff where I would like to see the entire XXXX, YYYY, and ZZZZ</p>

            <p>Hi, the only way will be to fill out down the location with the same name, then when you sort bny noth everything will show, position the mouse in the cell just below North, holding the Shift key, go down the column to the last row, then press CTRL+G, special,
 blanks, ok, then press the equal key and the up arrow, in the formula bar you will see the formula refers to the above cell, then press CTRL+ENTER</p>

<h3> lafayettegooding iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I activate or use my Telephone keypad when I&#39;m on a call &#40;See below for details&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I paid for Skype to use primarily for conference calls. When I initiate a call by my computer to the conference call number (US), it connects and ask for the
<strong>"Pin Number"</strong> (this is usually input via the same number pad which I use to make a Skype call).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Skype number pad will not work when I use my mouse or the keys on my computer.&nbsp; Usually I hear a click or some sound when numbers are hit; this doesn't happen.&nbsp; If I can't enter the '<strong>Pin Number</strong>" I can't access the
 conference call - Everything works fine from my cellphone, but not the Skype app.&nbsp; Please help - otherwise Skype is useless for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have Windows 10, and use a notebook computer, via the Web</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 625</h2>
                    Ringer on phone stopped working. Vibrate still works. Volume at maximum. Airplane mode is not on. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

<p>Got it.... found this on the internet....tried it ….and then turned off the phone and restarted it and now we have volume. Had first tried a Rogers store for support...was told the speaker was broken....Hmmmmmm.</p>

</p><p><span>Go to settings - System - Notifications &amp; actions and scroll down and tap on "phone" or"messaging" (not the on/off toggle, but the name itself)</span><br />
<span>There you will see the notification settings for the phone or messenger, depending on the one you selected. you'll see if notifications are on, show notification banner, keep private on lock screen, vibrate, and sounds.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>make sure the important one ("notifications" ) are on and everything you want it set to on. If the 1st one was OFF, then that was your issue.</span></p>

<h2>            SP2 camera error code 0xA00F4245&#40;0x80070005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to use either camera on my SP2. Checking camera privacy settings and allowing everything listed to have access has no effect, including after reboot and/or switching on/off /on globally. Checking camera device drivers gives no rollback option
 or new available drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am entirely out of ideas about this although it's a recent development and coincides with ever increasing unreliability of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please assist.</p>

<p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changes such as Windows update or installing of a new software can be a reason why the camera on your computer stopped working. However, we don't want to jump into any conclusions yet until we isolated your concern. We suggest that you check for updated
 drivers in the manufacturer's website of your device. You may also want to check for any outdated webcam driver on your computer. You may follow the steps on the first troubleshooting steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-can-not-find-or-start-the-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>

<p>I'm always amazed when I read a response that indicates that <strong>the responder hasn't bothered to read the question</strong>.</p>
<p>After about 30 years of IT basic troubleshooting first line fault finding isn't exactly new to me.</p>

<p>Have you tried checking in the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>manufacturer's website</strong></a> of your device for the latest firmware and driver? If yes, uninstall the camera driver in Device Manager. Once done uninstalling the driver, restart your computer for the driver to be installed automatically. You
 may also try use an external camera to see if the issue persist. </p>
