<p>If that doesn't help, Check / Uncheck 'Enable adavanced network functionality'.</p>

    <title>Need Help Getting Back Up after Bad Upgrade&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cubdukat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help Getting Back Up after Bad Upgrade&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I attempted to upgrade to the latest Windows Insider version (16273), but something appears to have gone wrong because I am now stuck in an endless loop where it tries to load up and the message comes up that Windows could not be installed, and that I should
 restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let that stay for a while, eventually I get a GSOD with the error "CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED," with no further explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reverting to the previous version through the repair option, but it told me I couldn't, as it did when I tried System Restore and Startup Repair.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice was that when I went into the Recovery option where it asked me to point it to where the image was, I was able to access my boot drive. What should I be looking for to provide someone with some kind of diagnosis?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, is there some way to use the command prompt to reinitiate the entire upgrade process?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I really don't want to have to reset the computer because I don't have some of the programs installed on it now, and I'm afraid that I'll lose data as well on the Data drive I have linked to the boot SSD. Not to mention that I don't hold much hope it will work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One other thing: I tried an upgrade installation with an older WI version (16251) to repair things. but it wouldn't let me do that. Would I have better luck if I downloaded the official non-WI Creator's Update and went on from there?<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be GREATLY appreciated...</p>

<h2>            Cannot install Win10 Preview 9926 from burned ISO disk</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the 9926 x64 bit ISO and burned it to a DVD to use to install the Win10 9926 to my computer. When it got to a point I got the following on the screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your computer needs to restart. Press the Power Button:</p>
<p>Error: 0x0000005D</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<p>0x000078BFBFF</p>
<p>0x000E1D3FBFF</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be 1-2 more 0's in each of the parameters listed, but, it was hard to tell as they were rather run together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what the error or parameters refer to, but, if anyone might have an idea I would truly appreciate it if they could let me know what they may refer to. The previous versions installed using the burned ISO disk just fine, so I'm curious to find
 out what is up with the 9926 that it won't install. </p>

            <p>Well...good news....I am happy to report that I was finally able to install the Windows 10 9926 build using a burned ISO disk.&nbsp; The update method would not install either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why it was giving me all the errors and other objections before, but, on my 5th iso download and burn, it installed without any errors or problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very strange that it took that many downloads and burns, using the same burner and same speed and same kind of media, to finally get it to install. But, I am happy that it is finally installed and up and running smoothly and I can continue to enjoy
 the WIn10 Preview experience.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Powerpoint on Mac not respecting transparency of files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrjhealey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint on Mac not respecting transparency of files</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bunch of powerpoint files which worked without issue until very recently. The problem I am having is that document elements which are transparent, are just appearing as grey when exported to PDF. This hasn't been an issue at all until very recently,
 and I've used these same files many, many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Mac OSX Mojave (v10.14), and am on Office/Powerpoint version 16.20 now that Mojave is installed. As far as I can tell, this issue began since this most recent MS Office update has gone in. Powerpoint is via my organisations Office 365
 subscription (which I believe makes it Office 2016?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but during my OS upgrade, I deleted a bunch of Adobe apps that I don't actively use (mostly the CS6 creative suite), and I found this thread (https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2561153) which mentions something about
 Powerpoint using Adobe's PDF engine. Is it possible I've deleted something powerpoint was using to create the correct format PDFs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix for this, or perhaps a method to roll back my powerpoint version, if the new version is the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to fix these documents ASAP.</p>

    <title>Format thousand separator and identify 4 digit year - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paper writing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Format thousand separator and identify 4 digit year</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, every one.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes I want to display 4 digits number with thousand separator in MS-Word, if I write VBA macro for this problem( Microsoft Word 2003.WinXP SP3) . using the selection.find .Text = "[0-9]{4}" to find the number. I confused about one
 trouble, this document is a long one that 4 digits number may be date(Year) such as 2008,2012. So I plan to use the MsgBox to let the user decide which number is number or date.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>so I think the process will be the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>step 1: find the 4 digits number in this document;</span></p>
<p><span>step 2: if the finding condition satisfied, then use the Msgbox to ask the user confirm the number is not a date;</span></p>
<p><span>step 3: if the number is not a date, then display this one with thousand separator;</span></p>
<p><span>step 4: find the next 4 digits number( equally go to the step 1) until the whole document finished.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The big trouble I faced was: I don’t know how to write all of them in Word-VBA.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you write them for me or give me some key hints about the frustrated thousand separator adding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks a lot. I would appreciate your help with this.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; Skype 8 causes huge CPU usage&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest Skype 8 on my new laptop with Win 10. All latest updates and drivers installed, the machine runs smoothly without any problems. The newly discovered issue is that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">as soon as I open Skype</span> the process called
<strong>Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation</strong> starts using almost 30% of CPU, which causes fan noise and the laptop gets very warm (understandably). No other program does that, I tested everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling/installing Skype with no result. I gave up and installed Skype 7 back again, which has no issues whatsoever. No CPU load or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for a fact that I'm not the only one with such a problem. I'm looking for an answer from a MS specialist about how it can be fixed or going to be fixed as pretty soon they are killing off Skype 7, but I simply can't use Skype 8 due to the above mentioned
 problem.</p>

            There might be a bug or optimizations are yet to be implemented depending on the version of Windows you are running.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

            Can you try upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10 1809 to see if the problem is resolved in that release?

<p>No, thank you. As far as I know October release is still paused by MS due to various bugs uncovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be happy to hear other suggestions as I use Skype at work and sort of have to rely on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm saved by Skype 7 which has no issues. But what am I to do when stupid MS finally kills it off?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading Windows to fix Skype 8 is kinda... well, not the advice I'm looking for.</p>

            Actually, 1809 was fixed and re-released, currently running it right now. Its a cumulative update that has been delayed for further tests. 
<br />
<br />Well, you can keep running Skype 7 until November 1st officially, but after that, its kinda up in the air.

<h2>            lumia 950 internet search continuously refreshes</h2>
                    Every time I go onto the internet on my Lumia 950 running windows 10, and go to google to search, when it comes back with the results the page just continuously refreshes and only stops if I press the X at just about the right time to stop it, (sometimes
 takes about 8 attempts to stop it) any help appreciated.

            So I just tried that on my 950XL and do not get that issue. I'm wondering if there is something different that we are doing (I rarely use Google and choose to use Bing instead). Do you get the same behavior when using Bing?

<p>My preference is Bing. IMHO it is better BUT that said when I am trying for some searches I use both. Most often Bing gives what I want but occasionally when I don't see what I want I go to Google (but rarely).</p>

<h2>            E7 &#38;quot&#59;connect USB cable to device&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 4-5 month old E7 and since past 2 days the little USB sign on the home screen is blinking continuously. It keeps giving notice "connect USB cable to device", when i connect the USB it says "unsupported USB device. Disconnect device". Thus i am not
 able to connect to Ovi suite on my PC. I also faced the following-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When i plugged it for charging it didn't detect the charger, I had to switch it off once and then the charger was detected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I searched many online forums and then tried connecting the USB to the E7 a number of times, I tried that while the phone was ON, while it was OFF, even blew in the USB port to see if there was some dust! When I connect the USB to the phone in OFF mode
 then it starts charging the phone as soon as it is switched back on. However it doesn't recognize the USB and does't get connected to Ovi Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. During the number of times that i tried connecting and disconnecting the USB, sometimes it recognized that a cable was attached and hence the blinking USB sign on homescreen stopped however the error messages keep on coming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I have tried using the options of connecting USB with Nokia Ovi Suite as default option as well as Mass Storage as the default option but without any luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me if this is a S/W problem or is it a H/W problem for which i need to go to their repair center? Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, other Nokia forums such as Europe and Australia have the same problem posted and there are many users with the same problem but no feasible solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I can not charge the phone, is there something I can do myself to fix this matter ?﻿﻿</p>

<p>Not unknown for microUSB connector to flex and become detached from motherboard upon E7 in time so can elicit various errors before ultimately failing; if you establish connectivity at any time suggest backup device whilst you can.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem. I cleaned the connectors, switched the cable and it didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I manage to fix the problem using the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. unplug the phone from all cables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. turn off the phone using 10sec on the on/off switch until it vibrates 3 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. connect usb cable to the phone and on the computer and wait until nokia turns starts to charge itself.</p>
<p>At this moment my computer detected a removable mass storage device (i had the option ovi suite selected when i turned off the phone) and I did a virus search just in case. None found though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Turn on the phone without unplugging it from usb cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone detected the ovi suite connection to the computer and the computer detected the phone also. I did a backup just in case and unplugged the phone. It froze and i had to turn it off and on again and from that moment on it works like a charm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try it..it worked for me:)</p>

<p>Hi guys. I got the same malfunction as well on my E7 today at 4AM.</p>
<p>I didn't rest untill&nbsp;I found the solution.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this will be a solution for you guys but it sure worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restored to factory settings and that's it. It's working fine now.</p>
<p>Don't forget to save everything first because the restoring to factory settings will erase everything from your contacts, calendar, notes, music, videos and photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up untill now I'm not sure if this malfunction was due to a virus or a hardware conflict.</p>
<p>I downloaded a fiew apps from the store but I also used the USB cable to download some photos. so I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your E7 keeps crashing and/or the window with the message "Please connect USB cable" keeps on appearing please be patient. Give it some time and try to access:</p>
<p>- Main Menu</p>
<p>- Settings</p>
<p>- Phone</p>
<p>- Phone Management</p>
<p>- Factory Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should all work out from there.</p>
<p>Best of luck guys.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            VBA subtract if and color cell..</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am new to VBA, I have function to sum cells with have green color, and another function to sum cell with red background color (time format).<br />
To code look like this:&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f881d342-d53e-44fa-b10f-58b983945280?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f881d342-d53e-44fa-b10f-58b983945280?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Now I would like to make function to subtract those two sum-s . Something like this:<br />
<br />
If sum of green colored cells is greater than sum of red colored cells (=) then subtract red colored cell sums from sum of green colored cells ( if green colored sum cell&gt; red colored sum cell = green colored sum cell - red colored sum cell &amp;&amp; and color that
 cell in green.<br />
<br />
Else if red colored sum cell&gt;green colored sum cell = red colored sum cell - green colored sum cell &amp;&amp;and color that cell in red.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone have idea I would like to hear :) Thanks :D</p>

                    This is an annoying but intermittent issue when I hit a duplicate button set up in MS Access 2010. It's only happened since I upgraded from 2003 to Windows 7 64-bit. Can someone take me through any steps that will fix this issue please? I'm not an expert,
 so step by step please! Thanks

            <p>Hi Melanthia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would need to locate the VBA code associated with your duplicate button. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open the form that contains the duplicate button in design view</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right-click on the duplicate button and choose properties to expose the properties window</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the Events tab</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the on-click event</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the button at the right of the on-click event. Should see a button with three periods<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>…</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the code window you should see code like the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 8, , acMenuVer70 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 2, , acMenuVer70 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 5, , acMenuVer70 </p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You would add the doevents to look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 8, , acMenuVer70 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 2, , acMenuVer70 </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doevents</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acEditMenu, 5, , acMenuVer70</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, IE 11.0.9600.19129 - login.live.com blank sign in page</h2>
                    <p>I have tried...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disabling addons (disabled most, left java and adobe pdf)</p>
<p>- Resetting Internet Explorer</p>
<p>- Removing and Readding Internet Explorer windows feature (which just removes and re-adds the icon essentially, so is pointless).</p>
<p>- Resetting drivers\etc\hosts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has had any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome on the same machine works fine.</p>
<p>On another Windows&nbsp;7 machine, IE 11.0.9600.19130 works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real issue for me, as it is a development machine and uses Visual Studio which wants to sign in, and it uses IE to do the login, and it also presents a blank login form, so I am assuming it's the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a windows update recently installed for Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp;So I uninstalled that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 9 has exactly the same issue, except that microsoft.com is also blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I re-install IE 11 and fix it so live login works?</p>

            Oh, yes, that does not matter. Just remembered you said Windows 7.
<br />
<br />The only other option for you would be to download Windows 7 SP1 install media, perform a repair upgrade, then upgrade to Internet Explorer 11 again. The repair upgrade, which would preserve your personal files, apps and settings, would reinstall Internet Explorer 8.
<br />
<br />Download Windows 7 ISO:

<h2>            6680 not charging</h2>
                    Found out a previous Nokia 6680 to use as my N95 had given up life. This model won't charge either now!!! It's hardly been used and I'd only charged it 2 or 3 times for use before I put it in the drawer for a rainy day. Do I need a new battery or take
 it for repair?

            If the battery hasn't been used for a while it's voltage may have dropped too low to start "proper" charging. Just leave the charger plugged in for at least 20 mins before you take it to a service centre. It may then start to charge correctly, you may
 see nothing on the screen but it should eventually "beep" and start up again. If you had said you had a 9500/9300 I would have said leave it on charge for a few hours before condeming it as faulty.

<h2>            OneNote WebClipper Not Load Notebooks&#47;Microsoft Account Suspended&#63;</h2>
                    When I try to use WebClipper in the Chrome browser, it shows loading Default location. However, when I hit the drop down for the default notebook, it states that I cannot clip because my Microsoft Account has been suspended. This is odd because the WebClipper
 dialog box shows that I am indeed logged into my Microsoft Account at the bottom right of the Clipper box. Also, I can readily log into my Microsoft Account as I am while this is being written. My Windows OneNote 2013 works and syncs perfectly and the Send
 to OneNote Tool in the tool box works correctly. I am running Chrome browser in Windows 8. I have removed and reinstalled the extension multiple times with no change. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be due to the configuration of the browser that you're using.&nbsp; To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've experienced the same concern when using a different browser.</li><li>If you've already tried signing in and out of your Microsoft account in the OneNote web app.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend clearing the cache and cookies of the browser that you're using. Note, performing this will remove saved passwords and user data on the browser. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I have not used a different browser since the WebClipper extension I installed is specifically for Chrome. I guess I can try a different browser with a different WebClipper extension but I am not sure how that will help this particular
 problem. As for signing in and out of WebClipper, I have done that numerous times to no avail. Also, I have repeatedly cleared browsing date, caches, etc. to the beginning of time with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, some of the codes provided when I try to clip are:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Usid: 4becdf13-cf2c-d78b-0c3d-33aff37e711b</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me know what else I should try. Thank you.</p>

<p>Using other browsers would help us determine the possible cause of the issue. We'd be able to determine if this is browser specific or true to all types of related applications that can use the software. We encourage the use of Internet Explorer or Microsoft

            OK. I installed the WebClipper extension in a newly installed version of Firefox. Everything was updated appropriately. Unfortunately, the same problem occurs as in Chrome. When I open WebClipper, everything shows correctly as if I am properly logged in.
 &nbsp;Specifically, on the bottom right of the WebClipper dialog box, it shows my name and my email address. However, for the location for files, it shows "Default Location." When I press the drop down button on the location, it states your clip cannot be saved
 because your Microsoft account has been suspended. Quite frustrating since my Microsoft account is clearly not suspended. I hope you can help! Thank you.

<p>We appreciate your response. We'd like to isolate issues with the Microsoft account. In line with this, we'd recommend that you create a new Microsoft account and use it to login to the Web Clipper add-on. To do this, you can refer to the steps posted on

            Per your request, I created a new microsoft account with a different email address and password. WebClipper works with that new account. However, when I change back to the old account, same problem.&nbsp;

    <title>MRT.EXE is asking for administrator rights. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MRT.EXE is asking for administrator rights.</h2>
                    <p>So it happened a few days ago that a pop-up is displaying when I start the computer. I have this computer for a while now (more than a year), but It never showed this program and never asked for the rights... I'm scared to grant them because I suspect something
 wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this program should be safe and is made by Microsoft, but also saw It could be a part of a virus.</p>
<br />
I made some research on the file (its in the right place)<br />
Location: C:\Windows\System32<br />
Type: .exe<br />
Description: Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool<br />
Size: 131 MB (138.020.592 B)<br />
Size on disk: 73,4 MB (77.049.856 B)<br />

Used: Saturday, 02. July 2016, 10:04:36<br />
<br />
Now I don't know is it a virus asking for admin rights or just the software detecting something?

Unfortunately there is no indicator for full battery charge neither light nor any sound alert. However the blinking charger on the battery symbol on screen stops blinking and permanently comes over the battery symbol when it is 100% charged.</p>

<h2>            Dell Venue Pro 8 - Secure Boot Violation on latest insider build 10547</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've had this 2 GB/64 GB Dell Venue Pro 8 in the Insider Program since day 1. While there always seem to be more bugs on this machine than the Surface Pro 2 (my other machine in this program), I've always been able to upgrade without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; However, this after the download and the install, the pro booted to the red dialog box: Secure Boot Violation": invalid signature detected check secure boot policy in setup. If you are curious what this screen looks like, I found one here on youtube (given
 when that came out I'm sure the root cause is different): </p>
<span>
<span>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvpvhM7pTg0. This was the very first reboot (when I rebooted from the previous insider build).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; To get the upgrade working, I turned the tablet off by holding down the power button till it went off, then I powered on and pressed the volume down button. After releasing it, it came up in the BIOS config screen. Then using the touch screen I was able
 to tap into the BOOT menu and turn off Secure Boot. At that point, the system booted and continued with the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The upgrade continued and the machine seems to have completed it fine. I'm able to use it (at least a quick test), and reboot it even from a cold boot. And the machine remains activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I then went back to the Boot menu and turned on Secure Boot. I got exactly the same error, and was forced to turn it back off to continue to use the tablet. I have checked with the dell website and I have make sure that the "BIOS" installed is the most
 recent. Other drivers all look up to date as far as I can tell as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; As far as I know, I've never done anything with this system that would change and violate something like this. Any ideas what happened? And what are the consequences of running like this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is an incompatibility with the x86 Boot Manager (bootmgfw.efi) that was included in build 10547,that as you've found will need Secure Boot to remain disabled until a fix is flighted. Thank you for reporting this and providing steps that
 has already helped another user.&nbsp;</p>
