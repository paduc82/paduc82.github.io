<h2>            OneNote keeps closing &#40;375 University&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Office 365 University and I‚Äôm having problems with OneNote. It is constantly shutting down, saying ‚ÄúMicrosoft OneNote is no longer working.‚Äù Then, after the window has closed,
 it pops up and says, ‚ÄúA problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.‚Äù With that it gives me the options of ‚Äúdebug‚Äù or ‚Äúclose program.‚Äù I always chose debug, but nothing ever
 happens. This has been going on for a couple months and it‚Äôs driving me insane. I can‚Äôt open any of my notebooks except one or sync without it shutting down. I can only use the one notebook that I simply leave open and type. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even do that
 without it shutting down. Sometimes I simply open my laptop and it shuts down without me even opening its window. None of my other Office programs are doing this, it‚Äôs just OneNote. Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,
<div>I finally got an "answer tech" who helped me figure it out. He gave me two options: Uninstalling and re-installing the entire Microsoft Office package or deleting my OneNote cache. I chose the latter.</div>
<div>I knew that either way I &nbsp;was going to lose some of my notes- by that point the crashing was so bad that I could not get the program to stay up long enough to save everything to my computer (instead of skydrive because that wasn't working). Sure enough,
 after clearing my cache (well, renamed and then cleared, as the tech instructed) I found about 7 days of notes missing. It sucks but at least the problem seems to be fixed. After that, I asked my tech if the problem could have been caused by the program trying
 to sync while not having internet; he said yes, that could potentially throw it out of wack. I had been having trouble connecting to the wifi at my college and that was about the same time as my OneNote started having its issues. So I opened the application
 up and switched the settings to "update manually." So far I haven't had any more problems, but I do have to remember to keep the window open until I get home and manually sync, and I have to get notes from those 7 days from a classmate, but, hey, I'm just
 glad the darn thing is working. :)</div>
<div>Whether you decide to uninstall/re-install or clear your cache, I highly recommend you get an answer tech to guide you so you don't mess anything up (also, I never would have found the cache without one. He even sent me a link to it). The guy who helped
 me was named Daniel if you want to try for him.</div>
<div>Here's a link to the answer techs:&nbsp;<a href="http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/msusa/en-us/answerdesk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/msusa/en-us/answerdesk</a></div>

You always can close Onenote despite unsynched changes. They only are lost by closing the notebook.
<div><br />
<div>And cleaning the cache is easier:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use <b>Start</b>, <b>Run</b> and input <b>Onenote /safeboot </b>(with a space after Onenote !). Gives you some options, one is clearing the cache).</div>

<h2>            Adobe Photoshop Elements Installation and Internet Explorer Problem</h2>
                    I received Adobe Photoshop Elements (PE) as bundled software with my Win 7 PC several years ago. The PC was subsequently upgraded to Win 10 via the Microsoft free upgrade process.&nbsp; PE continued to run under each Win 10 upgrade/update, until I had to do
 a clean install of Win 10 last week. When I try to install PE following the clean install, I receive a severe warning stating that PE needs Internet Explorer Ver 4.0 or greater to work. PE then aborts the install. I went into control panel, programs and features,
 and do not see IE as an installed program. I then used "Turn Windows features on or off" and enabled Internet Explorer 11. But I still do not see IE 11 as an installed program. Nor does PE apparently, as it will not install, even with IE 11 enabled. I thought
 about trying to install an earlier version of IE but after searching the internet that does not seem prudent. I purchased a newer version of Adobe Photoshop Elements, Version 2019, but I discovered that Adobe has droppe

MailWasher Pro</a> to see if it's of interest - a program I've been using for years which has saved me a ton of time dealing with hundreds of messages a day. Keep it running all the time in the background even with Outlook open but with all email accounts (some
 25+) set to manual send/receive. Keeping Outlook open is purely a preference - not a requirement. After I've viewed and cleaned things out at the server level that I don't want hitting my &lt;Inbox&gt;, then download what I want instead of dealing with Junk folders,

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Junk E-mail Reporting add-in</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>Is there &nbsp;a "Junk E-Mail Reporting add-in" for outlook 2016? &nbsp;I can't seem to find the "report junk" &nbsp;option anymore. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Or is it just our install where it is missing? Perhaps a recent windows update that added the feature?</p>

    <title>CSng VBA functions question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shane devenshire  say:</h3>
<h2>            CSng VBA functions question</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Excel 2010 the following code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 0.15<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b = CSng(a)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c = Round(b, 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [A1] = c</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Puts a value of </p>
<p>&nbsp; 15.0000005960464%</p>
<p>in cell A1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the code is </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 0.15<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b = a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c = Round(b, 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; [A1] = c</p>
<p>The result is </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15%</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

            <p>The Single data type only has a precision of about 7 significant digits, so beyond that, you're likely to see rounding errors.</p>
<p>If you use CDbl instead of CSng, b will be a Double, with a precision of about 15 significant digits. If you don't specify a type, you'll get a Double, hence the second example results in 0.15 exactly.</p>
<p>There is generally little reason to use variables of type Single (except perhaps if you want to create humongous arrays).</p>

            <p>I understand about the CDbl vs CSng, but it seems rather strange that the conversion of 0.15 would generate any error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then of course there is the question of why Round(b,5) should return </p>
<p>15.0000005960464 a 15 digit number, I would expect 15.00000 or 15 or 15.0000000000000?&nbsp; The spreadsheet function =ROUND(15.0000005960464 ,5) returns 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that Excel and VBA store numbers in binary format. It is not possible to represent 0.15 exactly in binary - the nearest approximation that fits into the selected data type will be used.</p>
<p>With the limited number of bits available in the Single data type, that nearest approximation is noticeably off.</p>
<p>Note that this does *not* happen if you use a = 1.5 or a = 15. Both these values can be represented
<em>exactly</em> in binary format. But .15 and .015 can't.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'm still trying to understand is the Round(15.0000005960464,5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added Round for exactly the inaccuracies you discussed, but to no avail.</p>

            <p>I suspect that you haven't declared the variables a, b and c.</p>
<p>Using the line</p>
<p>b = CSng(a)</p>
<p>forces b to be a variable of type Single, with limited precision.</p>
<p>Next, Round(b, 5) is computed <em>as a single</em>. Since 0.15 is stored in a single as 0.150000005960474 (approximately), rounding leaves it as 0.150000005960474. A value of type Single can't do better than that.</p>
<p>If you declare a, b and&nbsp;c as variables of type Double:</p>
<p>Dim a As Double, b As Double, c As Double</p>
<p>the variable b will still be 0.150000005960474, because that's the result of CSng(a), but it will be stored as a Double.</p>
<p>The last calculation Round(b, 5) will then be performed with the extra precision that a Double offers, and hence the result will be 0.15.</p>
<p>If you single step through the code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Test()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim a As Double, b As Double, c As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 0.15<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b = CSng(a)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c = Round(b, 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [A1] = c<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you will see a = 0.15, b = 0.150000005960474, and c = 0.15 (and hence cell A1 will contain 0.15).</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons for explicitly declaring variables.</p>

            <p>Shane,</p>
<p>You can only precisely store decimals/fractions that have a denominator based on a power of 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>x/(2^n)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you will see those discrepancies should go away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the immediate window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>note: 3/16 = &nbsp;0.1875 <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a = 0.1875<br />
b = csng(a)<br />
c = round(b, 5)<br />
[A1] = c<br />
? [A1] <br />
&nbsp;0.1875</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By default Internet Explorer disable running unsigned ActiveX controls. Unsigned ActiveX controls are programs that try to execute a command on your PC, like CAB install files or a ZIP file which do not have a digital signature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this is an important security measure on the Internet Explorer browser, if you are sure that the website is a trusted one then you can temporarily disable this security feature to get the website run the required ActiveX and later on re-enable
 the security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: To disable this feature:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open internet explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<strong><em>Tools ‚Äì Internet Options</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;<strong><em>Security tab ‚Äì Custom Level</em></strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under&nbsp;<strong><em>ActiveX&nbsp;</em></strong>ensure the following are set to&nbsp;
<strong>enabled</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Run ActiveX and plug-ins ‚Äì Enabled</em></span></p>
<p><span>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Download Signed ActiveX Control ‚Äì Enabled</em></span></p>
<p><span>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script ActiveX controls marked as safe for scripting ‚Äì Enabled</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the following to ‚Äú<strong>Prompt</strong>‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Download unsigned ActiveX Control ‚Äì Prompt</em></span></p>
<p><span>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Initialize and script ActiveX controls not mark as safe ‚Äì Prompt</em></span></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Please ensure that you enable this feature back once you run the ActiveX control by reverting all the changes done above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><strong>Step 2: To fix the IE security problem, try this</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p>
</strong>
<p>1. Click <strong>Start Menu</strong> and click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.
<br />
2. From <strong>Tools</strong> menu&nbsp;choose <strong>Internet Options</strong>, a dialog will appear.
<br />
3. Navigate to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and under <strong>Security</strong> uncheck:
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] Check for publisher's certificate revocation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ] Check for server certificate revocation*<br />

    <title>Too many bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seron---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too many bugs</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking to buy a new mobile and a new Nokia is my main goal, more specifically I'm looking at a 5630 or a E52. In my opinion no other brand comes even close to the combination of attractive features that Nokia offers, and doing so on several different
 models. That is, on paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even though both the 5630 and E52 are available in shops since some time, I'm reluctant to commitment. Because in reality there are severe and quite obvious bugs in these models, as can be read in this forum and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know these are complicated systems, but there's a better way to do releases, in my opinion. Test more and release later. It's not like these are subtle bugs. They are very obvious, and many people are disapPointed at Nokia and their testing department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>The pressure to get to market - a lot of which probably comes from those networks who aren't carrying the iPhone / Palm Pre / A.N.Other super-hyped new phone ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the models you're interested in have been around a few months, chances are Nokia have fixed the majority of the bugs - you just need to check that your network has the latest version of the firmware if you're buying a subsidised phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got my N95-8GB when they'd been around a good six months and, despite the fact the early N95s&nbsp;had heaps of issues,&nbsp;mine has been completely reliable (touchwood) - in fact, I didn't even bother checking for firmware updates until last month and I'm already
 eligible to upgrade ..</p>

<h3> dummie---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Mac&#47;nokia xpress music 5310</h2>
                    
<p>Recently the synchronisation between my phone Nokia Xpress Music 5310 and Mac OsX 10.4.11 fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before, I used i Sync with the plug-in advised on the Nokia support site, but now synchronisation with iCal fails and stays hanging allways on the same number of items. I tried to install the plug in on another Mac, and also there synchronisation fails...Now
 on my computer I have i Sync 2.4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone any idea why it stopped functioning? (before I really didn't have any problem with the synchronisation with iCal...) Any idea what to do about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for helping me with this!!&nbsp;</p>

<p><font>Hi, </font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Could be a possiblity that the ical is not responding to the sync command from isync.
</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Try the steps below and check if it works. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Open Isync and then go to isync preferences-Reset Sync history.</p>
<p>- Remove the device from the isync application window</p>
<p>- Go to HDD/Library/Phone plugins and drag and drop the plugin to the trash.</p>
<p>- Restart Mac and then download the plugin from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nokia.com/mac</a> and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you could also try the following steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Go to Library/Calendars/Sue.ics, now&nbsp;drag and drop the&nbsp;sue.ics file to the desktop.</p>
<p>- Now double click the sue.ics file in the desktop it will ask if&nbsp;you want to import the ics file into an existing calendar or a new calendar. Select new calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: Please make sure that you take a back up of all the calendar entries before performing the above steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully it works&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<div>Are you saying Project would not allow you to paste the VBA code from a text file into the Project VB Edit window? I've only done that a couple of times, but the only issue I've ever had is a message saying the copied text is too large to allow undo, but
 otherwise the text does get copied successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What form is the text file (e.g. Notepad, Wordpad, Word, etc.)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another approach you could use is to copy the text file to the VB Editor in sections.</div>

            Hi John,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>there are just too many statements, I guess.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I divide it into something like 8 subs it works fine.</div>
<div>The copying was OK. The sub could not be executed because the procedure was too long.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is a text file (ending .txt, ANSI)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can read line for line of this text file and save each line as a string,</div>

            Nathalie,
<div>As usual I'm a little lost. So your were able to copy the text file into the VB Editor, right? But when you tried to run the procedure (i.e. macro), you got some type of error message about something being too long?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep in mind, in the VBA context "procedure" means "macro". If you are using "procedure" to describe something else, please elaborate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What exactly do you mean by, "I can read line for line of this text file and save each line as a string"? How are you "reading" it? How are you "saving" it and to where?</div>
<div><br />
<div>An example would help.</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>yes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The error message exactly says that the "procedure"is too long (procedure is the term that is used in the error message). If I shorten the sub, it is fine. So obviously, there is a length problem with the sub.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I read the text file,with the content:</div>
<div><br />
<div>MsgBox("Hello")</div>
<div>MsgBox("World")</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I have a macro reading this file line for line and stroing each line in a string with this:</div>
<div>
<div>Do Until ....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Dim fileReader As FileSystemObject</div>
<div>Set fileReader = New FileSystemObject</div>
<div>Dim stream As TextStream</div>
<div>Set stream = fileReader.OpenTextFile("C:\Temp\dest.txt")</div>
<div>Dim stringReader As String</div>
<div>stringReader = stream.ReadLine</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>Loop</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, before the loop, i want to execute a statement of line 1, in this case ""MsgBox("Hello").</div>
<div>How can I do that. Where does the "Do Until " have to be?</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Questor,</p>
<p>We can upgrade the message size limit for larger attachments. To achieve that using PowerShell, please refer to the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use admin credentials to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>. </li><li>For single mailbox, type <i>Set-Mailbox -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -MaxSendSize 75MB -MaxReceiveSize 75MB.</i>
</li><li>For all mailboxes, type <i>Get-MailboxPlan | Set-MailboxPlan -MaxSendSize 75MB -MaxReceiveSize 75MB.</i>
</li></ol>
<p>Note: 75MB is an example. Replace it with the size you want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to find Portable application for viewing Outlook PST file&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking for a good Outlook Personal folder file (PST) viewer which I can put on an external drive without necessarily "installing" it on every system.<br />
Basically, I have my email, etc in a pst file on an external portable drive and I would like to also have a basic reader application to carry around along with it.<br />
--<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>Office 365 doesn‚Äôt have such an application for viewing Outlook PST files. In Outlook client, we‚Äôre referring to the following article to view Outlook PST files:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-381b776d-7511-45a0-953a-0935c79d24f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Open-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-381b776d-7511-45a0-953a-0935c79d24f2</a></p>

<p>Thank&nbsp;you guys for all your efforts.</p>

<p>You can't&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an attempt to read the SD the&nbsp; PC &nbsp;is requesting&nbsp; the bit-locker key... this was&nbsp;erased when you Hard Reset</p>
<p>All encrypted files are lost..forever</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You have to decrypt the microSD before .... </strong><strong>before </strong>
<strong>Hard Reset</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Encryption provides only one unique decryption &nbsp;key, this decryption &nbsp; was destroyed on hard reset,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ther re is no recovery option inbuilt in any / all phone based encryption apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Security of the encrypted data is the primary goal</strong> so if say a phone develops a fault and needed to reset there is a loss of data, you (same with BlackBerry) need to have a working phone as there is only One key which you need to access.</p>

<h2>            Exported Excel Spreadsheet from SharePoint &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exported excel workbooks from a SharePoint Document Libraries that I keep on my computer for quick reference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only in the last few months, each time I open one of the workbooks, that it tries to close out all of my documents in excel and I can only have one exported excel workbook open at a time. This isn't something that occurs each time I try to open the exported
 excel workbooks. It is hit or miss when it wants to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a document library and it contains some workbooks, when I click into the library and click "Export to Excel", it exports an ".iqy" file and when I open it, click "Enable", the workbooks are shown as file names with links in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the workbooks by clicking the links, I can open more than 2 workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not your scenario, please correct me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I need to confirm some information with you for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. What are the kinds of files in the library?</p>
<p>2. What are your detailed steps?</p>
<p>3. As you mentioned that the issue happens randomly, does it mean that each time you export to Excel in the same document library, open the same workbooks, the result will be different?</p>
<p>4. Are there any error messages when it tries to close out all or your documents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<p>Hi Gloria, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The scenario you outlined is exactly how I export the files from SharePoint and try to open.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have a combination of PDF's, Excel workbooks, and Word documents in the libraries. Primarily there are PDF's in the libraries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I already have an excel workbook open (not an exported excel&nbsp;workbook)&nbsp;and try to open an exported excel workbook, it will try and close out of excel completely and will not load the exported excel workbook. This occurs with any type of excel workbook
 I have open. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The issue will occur with any exported excel workbook I have exported from the library. I have tried with other libraries and get the same results. It seems to be more frequent&nbsp;since I updated to Version 1809.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There isn't really an error message. It will prompt me to "Save" any unsaved workbooks and then will close out of them after I save. Anything that is saved to my OneDrive or SharePoint&nbsp;will automatically close (they have the autosave turned on).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Jessica</p>

<p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested from my side again refer to the steps you provided and I still cannot reproduce the issue:</p>
<p>1. Create a document library with some Word files, PDFs and Excel files.</p>
<p>2. Export to Excel&gt; Download an .iqy file.</p>
<p>3. Open an Excel file from my local drive&gt; Then open the .iqy file&gt; Security Notice pops up&gt; Enable.</p>
<p>4. Import Date window pops up&gt; Choose "Table" and "New workbook"&gt; OK.</p>
<p>5. Click an Excel file name with link to open the file&gt; Trustworthy source notice&gt; OK.</p>
<p>6. All three Excel files are opened correctly and no files are closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested in Office 365 ProPlus Version 1809 (Build 10827.20181) Monthly Channel, please make sure that you have the latest version:</p>
<p>File tab&gt; Account&gt; Update Options&gt; Update Now.</p>

</p>
<p>Is there any simple option or I need to use [command]+[a]+[tab]*xtimes+[enter]?<br />

<p>Because blind people can't use mouse to answer the call, is this very disappointing to them.

<p>I hope that Microsoft programmers would found solution as soon as possible.</p>

</p><p>Except Classic Sype is no longer available.&nbsp; My husband is blind and needs Skype for work.&nbsp; He can not answer an incoming call.&nbsp; Sorry Microsoft but you blew it when you did not consider accessibility features before changing Skype.&nbsp; You have pretty much
 taken away a large chunk of my husband's ability to earn an income.</p>

            Hi, exactly Skype 7 is soon end of life and there is no option for physically impaired and old people who have issues navigating the mouse, but pressing button for call answering is convenient. Unbelievable how MS destroyed the Skype over the years. Stop
 "developing" the product, you are throwing away functions, while there is no visible improvement. First you stopped supporting Skype on TV sets and now you shoot in the leg also the classic Skype. Understand that majority of your customers are disabled and
 old people, while youngsters do use Viber or Messenger and if they have Skype though, then because of their grandparents! So stop making it "cool", there is no use. This ship has already sailed.

<p>Is amazing how Microsoft killed the product with 8.25.<br />
I have a lot of virtual meetings with Skype, in every virtual meeting I have the need of taking notes typing in the keyboard, but as you may know this produces noise in the conversation so I also need to mute/unmute my microphone fast in order to have a fluid
 conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a fairly simple task using global hotkeys that can mute/unmute the mic no matter in which program I have the focus, but now I have to stop typing and use the mouse to mute/unmute the mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not imagine what is blind people doing, so please, make global hotkeys available again. THEY ARE REALLY NEEDED.</p>

            My husband is not able to run his business because there is no way that he can answer a call by himself.&nbsp; You can't click on something you can't see.<br />
<br />
He was doing well until he was forced to upgrade Skype when he got a new laptop.&nbsp; At the very least, allow people to download a version of Skype prior to making these changes that did not take disabled people into consideration.

            I've noticed that Microsoft is not answering any of these requests.&nbsp; Perhaps they are just too big to care and employees can only follow the rules they are given to work with.

<h2>            controls padding in iRibbon UI</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i was wondering how to achieve the horizontal padding between controls in a customized Ribbon UI. In excel 2007 if you look at the group "font" you'll see what I mean: the two lines of controls are spaced equally withing the group.
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is not possible with a customUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have two controls (buttons) with text that you would like to present in this way, the best alternative is to use large buttons side by side, as these will take up a similar amount of space and be just as clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />You request mentions "Skype to Skype calls" - Is there a specific contact that you don't get calls from? If so, could you please check if, for some reason, that contact is blocked? <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34809/how-do-i-block-unblock-or-report-someone-in-skype-on-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34809/how-do...</a>

            Thank you for your reply. It is two contacts. One could not reach us (it made it seem as if we didn‚Äôt answer on our end) the next time she called it was fine. Almost the same for the second contact, she called and it went through, second time it did not.
 We have re logged in on the device from the password change also.&nbsp;
