<h2>            Trying to contact microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems almost impossible to contact the microsoft staff so this is my only hope right now. &nbsp;I have a hotmail account and it has been hacked. Someone is using it still. I am trying to change my password so that I can prevent whoever it is from using it
 but it doesn't seem to be working. It tells me I am not giving enough information for them to recover the account. Most of the questions I am being asked I cannot answer. This is because of the kinds of questions they are asking such as "the last email I sent
 out". I cannot answer this question because I do not send emails out often, I mostly receive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it I cannot contact Microsoft directly regarding this matter. It is extremely frustrating. Someone please help!</p>
<p />

    <title>Cannot find my Excel spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jkinfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find my Excel spreadsheet</h2>
                    I made some modifications to a (Microsoft Office 2010) Excel spreadsheet today, SAVED &amp; minimized, but the toolbar still remained on the desktop all by itself. After not responding when I tried to close the file I had to "end task"... and then discovered
 the file had completely disappeared from my desktop. I can see the file under "Recent Workbooks" but when I attempt to open it an error message states "file not found on the desktop, could it have been deleted or the name changed etc.?"&nbsp; I also tried using
 the search tool (which took FOREVER) with no results.&nbsp; Any idea why this occurred or HOW I can find it?? I've never faced this problem before and it's very frustrating to have lost a weeks worth of work!&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your help!

            Thank you for responding.&nbsp; No, it is not in the Recycle bin and I just tried your suggestion (using both options) with no results. In all the years I've been using Office I have never once "lost" a saved spreadsheet/document... but this one seems to have
 completely disappeared!&nbsp; Makes me wonder if I made a mistake in upgrading to Office 10.

<h2>            Can I run Insider builds on one computer and regular customer releases on another</h2>
                    <p>Hi All - I am on the Insider program and installing latest builds on my laptop computer. My desktop computer still runs 8.1. Since this is more of a family computer, I would like to convert it to Windows 10, but not get any Insider builds. I have a Microsoft
 account which I would still like to use as administrator for both computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a value in the advanced section of the Settings/Update and security app.&nbsp; But do these settings apply at account level or only relate to the individual PC ?</p>

            <p>You can upgrade Windows 8.1 to the public version of Windows 10 no problem. I have exactly the same as you but using a virtual machine for Insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using your MS account is fine for both. (as I do the same)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have several machines from a tablet to several desktops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two get preview builds, the rest don't.&nbsp;

<p>I am<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> logged in as administrator on all machines</span>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do make sure you are not set to receive insider builds on the machines you do not wish to receive them.</p>
<p>Just go to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">settings/updates/advance options</span>.&nbsp; Scroll down to the insider build section and make your</p>

<p>The new features for Link handling in Excel, Word and Powerpoint and Inking in Outlook do not show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm currently on 1807 (11807.20000), but haven't seen the options since they were implemented in the insiders builds!</p>

<p>Can you double check the version that you are currently using? Do you mean 1907 (11807.20000) rather than 1807? If you are indeed running an 1807 build, that indicates you are running a build that is a year old, and an update is needed.</p>

<p>And to further clarify, you are on Office 365 insider, not Office 2019 insider? The latter won't get updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The former has them in Options, Advanced. It is possible you don't have them yet as MS tends to throttle the updates, but I got these features about 2 weeks ago here.</p>

    <title>bcm remote database connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberfix  say:</h3>
<h2>            bcm remote database connection</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I have 10 PC's I need to connect to BCM. nine work perfect and one that was shipped with IE9 installed will not connect.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2010 with BCM 2010</p>
<p>Firewall is open. </p>
<p>Data base name is correct</p>
<p>All settings for BCM match all other PC's</p>
<p>I can open any file on the shared database PC</p>
<p>I have made sure even the registery entries for BCM match the working ones.</p>
<p>All PC's connect through a VPN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only issue I can see is that this users name and password are 11 characters while all the others are 10 or less but I can not connect even using other usesr login information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BCM itself works fine as I can move a backup copy of the database to the PC and restore it and see everything.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have removed and re-installed everything with no change. Using the server name fails with an error that "there are no BCM databases loaded" on the server - not true since nine others connect and work perfect. When I use the IP (which is how all the others
 connect) it acts as if it can not see the server at that IP yet I have mapped a drive letter to it to verify. We are only using the 32 bit version. I have gone into the SQL config on the client and verified that the adapter is configured correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of ideas, knowledge base links and google searches. Any thoughts anyone?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, the reason why you cannot sign into Skype&nbsp;is because Linux Mint 18.2 is not currently supported. Supported Linux&nbsp;distributions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>64-bit Ubuntu 14.04+<br />
</li><li>64-bit Debian 8.0+</li><li>64-bit OpenSUSE 13.3+</li><li>64-bit Fedora Linux 24+</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can access this <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Microsoft Access communicating with Microsoft Project</h2>
                    I know Microsoft Access can talk with various other microsoft products.&nbsp; I was wondering if it can use VB code to talk with Microsoft project.
<br />
<br />
I know microsoft Project will export into a .csv file.&nbsp; I want that uploaded into access tables to run queries and special reports. I have 8 different Projects to monitor and control and it would be easier to create a tool that will get the .csv files with
 clicking on&nbsp; a button instead of opening all projects manually, downloading, uploading....etc.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is no direct way for Access to talk to Project. However, if Project data can be exported to txt, xls or csv file format (for example), Access has the ability to import or link to that data.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different approaches you could take depending on what you need.</p>
<p>1. You could import your project data contained in the text/excel file into an Access database and then build queries and reports off of this data. Using this approach will create static data in your Access tables and each time you wanted to update the data
 you would need to re-export your project data to text/excel and then reimport your updated project data back into your Access database.</p>
<p>2. You could link to your project data contained in the text/excel file from your Access database and then build queries and reports off of this data. Using this approach, your data would still be pretty much static within the Access database. The difference
 with this approach is you would only need to replace the text/excel files if you wanted to update the data (provided they are named and saved the same as the original files). The linking would remain in place and you wouldn't need to make any changes directly
 in your Access database.</p>
<p>Here are a couple articles that you might find helpful:</p>
<p>Import or link to data in a text file<br />

<h2>            How me user being hacked with Microsoft commercial programming.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;removed&gt;&nbsp;I am a home user of Microsoft 10 Pro. I am being hacked by commercial Microsoft programming. I am migrated into winSXS and then placed on an obscene amount of "servers". First it is an OOBE server(I have a white box computer" so there really is
 none. I am placed on a DNS server that I cannot identify. Then onto a Windows 2007 or 2012 server and then on an SQL server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to stop this nightmare? I am trying to go to school for programming as I have to find something to do from home as I cannot work in the public due to &lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>I tried Microsoft support and because all of the issues are related to server and commercial programming they want $500 for a one time fix!&nbsp;&lt;removed&gt; there is no way that I could afford it! I tried &lt;removed&gt; and they can't help me because it is commercial
 software from Microsoft being used in the hack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please if anyone has the knowledge to help me please please help!!! I started school last week and have already had to clean and reinstall Windows 3 times. At this rate I will never learn anything which I think is the intent of the hacker.</p>
<p>I should be running only on &nbsp;DHCP server on my router and nothing else. I will post</p>
<p>everything I can when this wipe and install are done.</p>

            <p>1a: &nbsp;The first build was last March. It got hacked, motherboard was trashed and I bought a new ASUS Z97A motherboard and new hard drives about a month ago and the same thing happened again except this motherboard is still working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b: purchased it over the phone with Microsoft when I brought my computer home from the shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c: I am unsure, I think that it is still that way as I have no way of getting rid of that information. Is there a way to tell?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d: The only install ever by me was Windows 10 Pro and the original install of Windows 10. Microsoft tells me that they only have Windows 10 in an efi format so I would suspect that all have been installed that way. The hacker has obviously installed more
 than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e: I had the hard drive I am on now unplugged in case it happened again when I installed it yesterday. So the drive that I was using yesterday is now unplugged and I am using the one that was unplugged. I only have the two drives and no other OS's installed
 with my permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1f: Not to my knowledge or with my permission, other than whatever the hacker has installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: I have only ever used wired LAN. I know that it has wifi capability on the motherboard though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a: I am running Webroot. It show the definitions are up to date:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbe52520-5df9-4afc-949c-72cb1608988c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbe52520-5df9-4afc-949c-72cb1608988c" /></a></p>
<p>It wouldn't let me update.</p>
<p>I had to get on with s***d to get it to update and I saw it flash updating settings for 2012 server definitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: It is set to automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5: Yes and yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6: Right now all that is on there is Microsoft Edge and I.E., but I did previously install google Chrome, but it was version 10 . something. I did install water fox, but I don't remember what version it was now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7: I have not personally used any of those, but I know I saw s***d use an MRI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I had to download Chrome to get into my studies and I downloaded Google Chrome 10.something and now it is Google Chrome

<h2>            Office 365 for Mac keeps deleting my synced gmail account from outlook</h2>
                    <p>This is a new issues. I have been able to sync and view my gmail (and create messages, appointments etc) in outlook for mac for nearly a year no problem, and now all of a sudden Outlook keeps sending me an error message telling me that the gmail account
 has been "permanently deleted". When I click "cancel" it doesn't actually delete previously downloaded mail, but it is no longer syncing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on and how do I fix it?</p>

<h2>            Creating a Color conversion in VBA to acquire equivalent colors, by clicking a command button on a form</h2>
                    It would be handy to have the tool (among many other cool tools) on a popup form, which can convert hexidecimal color codes to decimal (or vice versa) and an RGB converter also. &nbsp;Are there any URLs which already have such an animal? &nbsp;Allen Browne? &nbsp;others?

</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see by the above you can enter a OLE Color, RGB Color, HEX color value, move sliders (if you were trying to find a color)&nbsp;and they get converted back and forth between all the formats in real-time and you get a visual of the color in question
 at the top of the form.</p>

            Simply because I didn't declare all of the my variable.&nbsp; As I said, this is archaic code.&nbsp; It works, but could use a little loving to bring it up to par.&nbsp; It would take you 1 minute to declare the missing variables to be able to enable the Option Explicit
 as it should.

            Yes, I use similar code for standardizing forms, reports for my databases, and especially when taking over someone else's database.&nbsp; A great time saving tool!

<h2>            screen capture using windows &#43; shift &#43; s not going directly to onenote</h2>
                    <p>I've been using onenote for a couple of years now specially their screen clipping feature which is so easy and reliable. I set it to automatically place the clipping on the quick note and adding new page everytime i do screen clipping. This is easy and reliable
 since you can go back and check again if you need the previous clip and doesn't cause extra effort to copy and paste the clip everytime you need one. But since we upgrade to windows10, the automatic save has been lost.&nbsp; so everytime i do a new screen clipping
 using windows+shift+S i need to open a new file (ex. word, onenote) and paste it, unlike before that it was automatically be in one note. Is there a solution for this to be back again? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Glaiza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I test that feature on my side and here are my test results:</p>
<p>1. I can take a screenshot and save it directly when I take a screenshot via clicking OneNote&gt;Insert&gt;Screen Clipping.
</p>
<p>2. I can also take a screenshot via the shortcut directly. However, the screenshot wouldn't save into quick note directly. The same as you mentioned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That feature may be changed during the Windows update. As a workaround, you can use the OneNote quick icon to take a screenshot and save it into Quick notes directly. You can follow the steps below to do that:</p>
<p>1. Right-click OneNoteicon&gt;OneNote icon defaults&gt;Take screen slipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a9fded4-05c5-4eeb-88cb-a30d6019db0a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a9fded4-05c5-4eeb-88cb-a30d6019db0a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. Click OneNote icon&gt;Select the location you want to save your screenshot&gt;Check the option Don't ask me again and always do the following&gt;Send to Selected Location.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/053d7f67-2e39-4665-a8d8-15c322927729?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/053d7f67-2e39-4665-a8d8-15c322927729?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>After that, we can take a screenshot and save it directly to quick notes via clicking the OneNote icon. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<h2>            How to update PowerPoint 2010 slides automatically when linked with data from Excel file</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to search for my answer but none of the suggestions I could find did the job.</p>
<p>In short (I am using Office 2010):</p>
<p>I have an Excel sheet with some data from which I have created several graphs and tables on different sheets.</p>
<p>Those graphs and tables should be shown in a PowerPoint file in presentation mode. The PP is running on a big monitor and displays different content from the Excel sheet (at the moment around 20 slides with link to the same Excel sheet).</p>
<p>Some of the Excel sheet&nbsp;are updated daily (from another PC but both files are stored on the same&nbsp;network) so the PP should reflect those changes rather quickly after the Excel data has been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I marked the data in Excel I went to PP and did "Paste Special --&gt; Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object --&gt; paste link."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I make a change on a graph in Excel and close the file the graph doesn't automatically update in PP even though the link is set to "automatic" update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the graph and press "update link" it updates correctly with the changes. I just want it to do it automatically also when being in presentation mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also looked into using a VBA code to run an update every 15 min or so but apparently the application.OnTime function doesn't work in PP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Martin</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks but I am not sure this solves my issue. The idea is that the slide show will run "forever" once started so the PP slides should be updated automatically in the background (e.g. by using VBA if it cannot do by PP itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So would something like this work if I put this one after the IF statement:</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.UpdateLinks</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it would help with the updating to leave the slide show while updating the links it could work as well.</p>

            Please try the macro. That's exactly what it does: every time it loops, it updates at slide 1.

            <p>Thanks - I tried to run the macro but nothing happens at all (it pops up with the screen where all macros are listed and where you can run then). It seems like it is not even recognizing it as a macro&nbsp;as it is not on the list (and yes, the PP is saved as
 .pptm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then code I try to run is:</p>
<p><em>Sub OnSlideShowPageChange(ByVal objWindow As SlideShowWindow)</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; If objWindow.View.CurrentShowPosition = objWindow.Presentation.SlideShowSettings.StartingSlide Then</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActivePresentation.UpdateLinks</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</em><br />
<em>End Sub</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions why this happens? </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I guess it is because I need to be in the slide show :-). I will do some tests to see if this could be the solution.</p>
<p>What I fear is that it will take quite a long time to update the 20 different slides and during that time it seems like it won't continue to slide 2.
</p>
<p>Any solution to that part? Could it be possible to update slide 2 once being on page 1, update slide 3 once being on page 2 etc. to make it smoother?</p>
<p>I think it should display each slide for 5-10 seconds. </p>

            <p>The method John suggests is not reliable. You <strong>do </strong>need to be in slide show mode but even so it can be unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In particular after saving, close and reopen it may not run at all when the slide changes. To fix this add any item from the Control Toolbox to a slide e.g. an ActivX textbox. and drag it out of view. This will kickstart the code and it should then run fairly
 reliably.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks, it looks to be close to the ideal solution for me. </p>
<p>However, only smaller issue is that it shows the original graph on the slide a couple of seconds before the new, changed graph on the slide. Is there any way, as I asked in my previous post, to update the coming slide instead of the one it is showing?</p>
<p>So when showing slide 1 it is already being updating slide 2 so it is ready once displaying slide 2. I guess it should be some kind of "i+1" increment&nbsp;but I can't figure&nbsp;how the code exactly should be adjusted...&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I just add a "Text box (ActiveX control)" but should it include the entire code from above or should it just be an "empty" macro?</p>

<h2>            Home User Program Order History</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to delete most applications in an effort to install the Creator Version (1709) of Windows 10. In that I deleted Office 2016 that I purchased through the home use program. My problem is that I cannot repurchase Office Professional 2016 and
 every attempt to retrieve my order history leads to a webpage that says temporarily unavailable. Who do I talk to so that I can retrieve the download and product key?

            I'm sure there are valid reasons. I'm just wondering, if setting a default password and requiring that they user select their own wouldn't be better. Users HATE having to use a password chosen for them randomly. So if you are going to have them change
 it to their choice, is it necessary to generate a random one.

<p>When sending the eMail you let them know they can reset it BUT you have to set it initially.&nbsp; You don't leave a protected site open like that.&nbsp; Suppose the person can't set it for a few days?&nbsp; Then what?&nbsp; All anyone has to do it type in their eMail address
 to get in and nowadays that's just not a good way to go.</p>

<h2>            Many symbols now gone from MS Word</h2>
                    I used to have a lot of symbols in MS Word 2010, but for some reason they are mostly gone now and I'm left with a very basic set of symbols. &nbsp;I get the same result in new documents and old ones (in old documents that already have the missing symbols in
 them, the symbols remain in the document but I cannot add more because they are gone from the symbols menu). &nbsp; Why would symbols that used to be available now be gone, and how do I get them back?
<div><br />

<div>Additional unrelated question: &nbsp;Could this forum possibly exist with, say, 12 point font instead of 4 point font?

    <title>Excel 2013 grouping symbols gone &#40;SOLVED&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ppdm2800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 grouping symbols gone &#40;SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Following up on this thread: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/excel-2013-grouping-symbols-gone/4ea521a9-b77d-4680-ac81-6dd9ab4b59f1?db=5">
Excel 2013 grouping symbols gone</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem: +/- grouping symbols had vanished into thin air, the only&nbsp;workaround was the&nbsp;useful&nbsp;tip given by VV.936: select all cells and then click on 'AutoFit Row Height' (Home tab, Cells group, under Format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find a solution, I converted my xlsb workbook to xlsx, made a copy, applied VV.936's workaround, and compared both xlsx archives (xlsx files being in fact zip archives in disguise). There, in the xml file of my sheet, there was a setting called 'defaultRowHeight'
 that was set to 0. Resetting it to 12.75 corrected the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to fix the issue in a xlsx file, step by step:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the xlsx file/archive with an archive manager (eg. 7-Zip)</p>
<p>2. Browse to the \xl\worksheets\ folder</p>
<p>3. Open sheet<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><strong>n</strong></span>.xml (<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><strong>n</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> being the number of your worksheet)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Find the &lt;sheetFormatPr ...&gt; tag,&nbsp;near the top&nbsp;of the file</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. If you have the same problem I had, the 'defaultRowHeight' argument should read defaultRowHeight="0". Replace it by defaultRowHeight="12.75"<br />
6. Save the xml file, and make sure the change is reflected in the xlsx file/archive</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this helps!</span></p>

</p><p>I have 4 pivot tables with 4 charts I inserted a Slicer to connect all 4 Pivot Tables. Only 2 of the Pivot Tables will allow a connection between each other. All Pivot Tables have names. I have seen the Slicers only connect on the Pivot Table in which it
 was generated. I do not seen any way to add to the Report Connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your assistance</p>

            Issue was resolved by copying and pasting Pivot Table ranges in each of the Pivot Tables.

<h2>            Can&#39;t use F4 &#40;or anything else&#41; to toggle absolute cell references in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to get the F4 key to work to toggle absolute cell references in Excel. I first tried on a Mac, and used every permutation suggested on forums (including Cmd+T). When that didn't work, I decided to try it on a Windows machine, since the Mac versions
 of all Microsoft products seem to be riddled with unsolvable mysteries. But when I try F4 on my Windows machine, it seems to trigger "Redo." I've tried it in combination with Shift, Ctrl, Windows, Alt. Nothing works. (In case it's useful, I'm using Windows
 365.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge spreadsheet of things that need to be changed into absolute references, and I REALLY don't want to do it manually. Can anyone help?</p>

            Hi Liz
<br />
<br />In Excel, if no cell reference is selected in the formula bar, F4 will perform a Redo operation
<br />
<br />Click any cell with a formula
<br />
<br />In the formula bar, click into a particular cell reference in that formula for example A1
<br />
<br />Then press F4
<br />
<br />Does that change the type of referencing?       
        </p>

<p>Thank you so much, Dave! The idea of having to select within the cell was never clear to me in any of the other guidance I read. I really appreciate your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming there isn't a way to make a bulk change to make all references in a selected group of cells absolute instead of relative, is there?</p>

            <p>That was a slip up on my part.</p>
<p>MSP cannot tell you directly how many people you need, because its not managing the project, and it does not know how you want to balance time against cost, or how many people you can get</p>
<p>What it can do, however, is tell you how long the project will take, given the tasks as you have modeled them with their respective durations and predecessors/successors.</p>
<p>It does this, if necessary, with resource leveling, which delays tasks which have over-allocated resources assigned, and comes in various flavours depending on the check boxes selected in leveling options, and the priority of each task.</p>
<p>You have as many people as you have defined as resources.</p>
<p>You need enough people so that none of them are over-allocated, but over-allocation can be resolved in a number of ways, and getting more people is only one of them.</p>
<p>If by "on time" you mean that you don't want to delay tasks and choose not to perform resource leveling in any flavour, and if you have over-allocated resources, you still have a method which is this. In the resource sheet, increase the max units of the
 over-allocated resources until they are no longer over-allocated. if it is 1500% then you need 15 of those guys, or that guy and 14 other like just him.</p>
