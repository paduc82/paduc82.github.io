<h2>            OWA Mobile APP with IOS9.1</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a user that uses the OWA APP on his Iphone.&nbsp; When we first installed it he was able to see shared calendars in the monthly view.&nbsp; Lately he can only
<br />
see it in Daily view.&nbsp; I just updated to the new IOS9.1 and I tried and am having the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before when we went to calendar on the OWA Mobile APP you could see a monthly and I think weekly view of everyone's calendars now we cannot.&nbsp; Any suggestions?
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Karen </p>

    <title>Inherent Bias in Bing News Lead Stories - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossburke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inherent Bias in Bing News Lead Stories</h2>
                    <p>i use Bing News very heavily to compile and curate articles for several Flipboard magazines. I've noticed recently that there is a very heavy bias toward the use of lead stories from Fox News, especially political stories. There is very little balance with
 articles from other sources such as CNN, the NYT, or WashPost. As a result, the Bing News front page often looks like. Fox News mock-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way for users to adjust their settings to get a greater balance in news sources? Greater diversity would be helpful, including more lead articles from international sources. Right now it appears that Fox is using SEOUL to game the Bing search
 algorithms.</p>

<h2>            Problems with alias email address</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I have an outlook email account set up. I have also set an alias to this account which I have made my primary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is I am not receiving a lot of emails which are being sent to this alias address. if I send an email from say my googlemail account to the alias address then it is not received and there is no error message come up in the gmail account.
 If I send it to the original live address then it goes through fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is I am getting some emails through although these seem to be more from companies rather than individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone could help me with this issue I would be most grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            &nbsp;Edge has been full of bugs since it first saw the light of day 10/1/2014.&nbsp; Microsoft is too busy putting in new stuff that the majority of us will never have any use for to be bothered with fixing long existing bugs.&nbsp; We ARE using pre-release software,
 but I avoid EDGE on the released version of Windows too.&nbsp; Firefox and Chrome are so much better alternatives.&nbsp; YMMV.

<h2>            Paste as picture - text box moves</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used multiple shapes and text boxes to create a graphic in Microsoft Word. When I attempt to copy and paste the items as a picture, one of the text boxes (only one) shifts and the word is no longer aligned in the shape the way that I want it. All
 shapes/text boxes are aligned "In Front of Text". This text box is the only one that has a "transform" on the word to make it arched, so I think that might have something to do with it? Any assistance would be most appreciated.</p>

            It is hard to tell exactly what goes wrong without looking at the document in question. However, what you can do is take a screen shot of the shapes and text boxes, save the screen shot as a graphics file and insert that one into the target location.

<h2>            Windows 10  Home User &#47; Windows Defender Protection -  Does it really protect the at home user or is it just BASIC protection</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Please realize that I would love to use Microsoft Defender as my front line of defense as an anti-everything tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have used Kaspersky and Norton in the past successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen the test results from Av-test, Av Comparatives, Mrg-Effitas and SE Labs
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (which shows the product is not 100% effective - there are some wholes, just like there are in other AV suites)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not using the PC/Notebook in an enterprise setting or a IT Professional Setting --- Simple home computer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ! am seeing in a high volume of posts in this area &nbsp;Use Malwarebytes, Emsoft and so on. &nbsp;The USE list seems to</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; never end and feels as though it is a generic post that is cut and pasted in many of the situations with minor
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modification.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My usage is purely a home user, I do emails, I use microsoft office, vision, project etc, &nbsp;I may access a corporate site, &nbsp;I&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may visit a couple of professional social sites (eg linkedin) don't twitter, Facebook,youtube,torrent,ftp, software dloads</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except for microsoft store and microsoft software) &nbsp;Basically I'm a business and home user - user</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Edge is browser of choice, Adobe is technically off and Java is technically in a secure as possible setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this form, I am seeing trojans, adware, pup issues, browser issues and ransomware issues (which somewhat frightens me) from using Microsoft Defender as my front line of defense as an anti-everything tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having provided back ground, please tell me in a non-cut and paste cookie cutter document</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: Being the type of user that I am, am I safe in using Microsoft Defender and why</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: Are you using Microsoft Defender in a similar setting and what have you encountered</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: Why are people experiencing all of these issues trojans, adware, pup issues, browser issues and ransomware issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: What type of scenario, could I be impacted by</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5: What are best practices outside of keeping product up to date with definitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6: IF i beta or control test the product and then put down a full complete av suite what may I encounter
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;best case/worse case: &nbsp; has anyone done that ?</p>

<p>As carefully as you're describing your process and what we've discussed already in an earlier thread, you're obviously a very methodically careful and safe user of your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason, you could probably get away without using AV at all, since the built-in Windows 10 security protection is far better than anything in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since it's always recommended to include a security application as a backup, Windows 10 Defender would be more than enough to protect you, so the other information is spurious and unimportant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's those who browse dangerously without thinking who have the most problems with items like pups and ransomware is often received in email attachments, which a careful person wouldn't be likely to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you haven't picked up on it, the true problem is typically personal behavior rather than the security technology, so your situation is really far to the opposite extreme.</p>

            Hi michaelpahlke1,
<br />I will keep my response to specific questions.
<br />1. Yes, based on your use windows defender is more than enough protection, windows defender has come a long way in the last few years and is now a competent security solution. built by microsoft specifically for windows 10, it works with windows rather than trying to control it.
<br />2. Yes, I tend not to open email from unknown or unexpected sources or visit dodgy websites, I have only experienced the odd tech support scam popup in the browser but this is not an infection on my pc.
<br />3. user habits, and a lack of common sense, opening unsolicited emails, downloading attachments from unknown sources, downloading pirated software, illegal or dodgy file sharing sites - and/or bad luck, security software is always in a race to fix a vulnerability before it is exploited or to update the protection before an exploit becomes widespread.
<br />4. from what you have said there is little that would affect you, keep an eye out for the tech support scams (that no security software is going to protect against) popups in the browser, emails or phone calls.
<br />5. Backups on external media.
<br />6. the only issue with testing various security packages is making sure of full removal before attempting to install another - use the removal tool from the company concerned.
<br />yes, I have looked at some and found that for the smoothest running of windows (and based on what I (and you) do with the device) windows defender does the job.

            Martmcd, Thank you for the direct response to each of the questions and sharing your insights. It is appreciated. &nbsp;I haven't really used Microsoft Defender (this iteration) over an extended period of time E.G. 30 Days of Defender as primary protection,
 I have used it in a controlled setting (maybe over the weekend or during a low computer usage week) with success, but I just had to ask the question again a little differently (being who I am). &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you&nbsp;

            that response shows that you are less likely than most to have any issues.
<br />care and common sense is as important as the security software.

            Hi. Thanks for your reply. Right. I get the problem on Outlook, (Hotmail), also AOL and 7Dayshop sites. It comes up as a message ay the bottom of screen, "Outlook has stopped running due to a long running script".&nbsp; "Stop script" is in a box at the end
 right, and gets the program going again, but not for long. I have not made any changes, unless W10 updates can cause this. I use Outlook .com as my server, my browser is Internet Explorer. When this happens, I am usually trying to read emails, or looking at
 goodies on 7dayshop. It does happen at other time but these are the worse. I have tried switching off Java scipt editing. That is all I have tried, not really good with computers, except swearing at them some times.!!

            Dear Mr,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Please follow tips in this support article about exceeding storage limit <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storage-limits-in-outlook-com-7ac99134-69e5-4619-ac0b-2d313bba5e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/storag...</a>
<br />
<br />After you will move all unnecessary emails to deleted items, go to deleted items and select any email, press CTRL+A (this will select all emails) and delete them. After you will delete those emails from deleted items, storage should be released. It is better to do in Private browsing.
<br />
<br />Afterwards please log here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/storage/mailboxStorage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/s...</a> and make sure that you have used space less than 15GB.
<br />
<br />Please share the results!

            Hi Mr,
<br />
<br />Hold the CTRL Key on your keyboard down and Press A this will highlight all the emails that are for example in your Junk folder or your Deleted Items folder. Then while holding the Shift Key down and press the Delete key on your keyboard. There will be a pop up say yes to permanently delete emails. Do not leave the folder you have just deleted emails from until the emails have been deleted. Give it a couple of minutes. If you do not use shift then all emails deleted will go into your recover deleted Items folder. 
<br />I also like to filter my inbox by size to make sure there are not emails with large attachments that I can save for later viewing. Click filter All Checked then More Sort by size. Save attachments if you want to keep them before deleting emails. Again hold the Shift Key then press the Delete key. 
<br />Once completed the Deleted Items folder look in that folder you'll find Recover Items Deleted from this folder check and delete those if not needed. 
<br />You can shift a or Ctrl and click on individual emails as long as your holding the Ctrl key when clicking the will highlight emails. I would then do the Shift Delete to remove these emails. 
<br />Clear your browser cookies CTRL SHIFT AND DELETE will bring up the box to delete cache and cookies. A restart of your computer never hurt. 
<br />If still having a problem try deleting in a Private window. 
<br />Chrome and Opera Browser -Open a browser window hold the CTRL &amp; SHIFT Keys and press the N key to open a private (Incognito) Window 
<br />Edge Internet Explorer and Firefox-Open a browser window hold the CTRL &amp; SHIFT Keys and press the N key to open a private window 
<br />Do the delete from there after clearing your Cache. Using the Shift Delete method
<br />
<br />Please let me know how it goes the biggest problem is when you change folders before the deletion has completed. Give it time!
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sam

<h2>            Samsung Epix &#43; Activesync &#61; No Fun</h2>
                    Hi All-&nbsp; My samsung Epix crashed yesterday and would not sync to either of my computers among other things. I did a hard reboot and the phone seems to work fine except Activesync is not discovering the phone. I reloaded activesync 4.5 with no luck.&nbsp; I
 am running the free Macafee security suite from comcast and removed it since apparently none of the known tricks have worked.&nbsp;

    <title>Changing the type of field in the Assets Web Database template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> millymf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the type of field in the Assets Web Database template</h2>
                    <p>We are using Sharepoint 2010 and Office 2010. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the Assets Web Database is an ideal template for us to get our inventory on Sharepoint. However, I want to be able to automatically increment the Item field and not make it editable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, for example, we would use PR1000 format assigned to each of our printers in house. When a person enters a new asset in the Inventory, we want this field to automatically populate with the next available number and not allow the user to change
 that field. So, if the previous asset was called PR1023, when someone adds the next printer asset, the Item will automatically be called PR1024 and so on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way of doing this? when I open the asset database in Access from Sharepoint, it's not giving me the option to look at the table in Design View so I don't have a lot of options when it comes to changing the field. I am not that familiar with
 ACcess anyway so any help would be great. Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Ok, so what we need to do here is build a table of the categories (you only need one table).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Right now there is a combo box column for the category in table assets. However, it is a hard coded list (a poor design choice since you have to go an modify the table direct to add more categories).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now that we also need place to "setup" a list of "prefixs" to use for a given category, and furthermore we ALSO need to keep track of the last asset number for a given category. So a new table that holds this info kills about&nbsp;4 or 5 birds with one stone
 by creating a new table for the asset category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this also shows what happens when poor design decisions are made (the category should have been a separate table ‚Äì however it really is just a sample template).</p>
<p>Ok, so lets make a new table. Lets call it Catagories</p>
<p>It will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Category:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (autonumber)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (text) (eg: Personal Computer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (text)&nbsp;&nbsp; (eg: PC, FW etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;NextID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (number) this will hold the last number used</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so this table will thus allow us to easily add new asset types. I think you imagine how bad this would be if you developed such an application and your company found out that for each new asset type you have to bring in a developer to modify the table
 direct! I know some of my clients would consider this a form of theft or even just dishonesty at best. So the original free template is just a free sample, if we going to use this in a production envirnemnt we really need to add the above table else risk being
 seen as a dishonest person.</p>
<p>Ok, now that we built this table, we should add in the choices that we see for the Category type. So lets enter the data list this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PreFix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NextID</p>
<p>&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Servers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desktop Computers&nbsp; PC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Printers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1024</p>
<p>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copiers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faxes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Office&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also with such a table we can then build a form to allow users to add new category. And in fact you could also use a form based on the above table to edit/set the NextID. So in place of the next asset ID starting at 1, you could type in 100 or even 1024
 as I done for printers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, now that we done this, the next step is to replace the category column in the Assets table to use the above table for the drop down. This means we have to re-enter the catagoreis here. You could thus re-name the collum Category to Category1 if you already
 have data entered (that way&nbsp; could bring up the assets table and re-enter the data into our new collum by looking at the old values).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the lookup wizard, and I think id,Description,Prefix makes reasonable sense for this drop down (you can enable data integrity here also ‚Äì delete restrict). We also now need a new column called AssetID that will be our automatic number column + prefix.
 This column can be a text column, and lets not forget to put an index on this column.</p>
<p>Ok, the next part is to add some code that grabs the value of the new category, and then sets the AssetID column based on what we choose for category.</p>
<p>The easy way to do this is to use the table before update event. The code would be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Updated("Category") Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look Up A Record In Catagories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Condition =[ID]=[Assets].[Category]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alis<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setfield<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name:&nbsp; Assets.AssetID<br />
&nbsp;Value:&nbsp; [Catagories].[Prefix] &amp; Right("0000" &amp; [Catagories].[NextID],4)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the above will then "pluck out" the next asset number based on the category, place the prefix in front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point the next thing is we need code to increment the asset value used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code for that needs to be placed in the asset after update table event for Assets. The code will look like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If updated("Category") then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lookup A Record In Catagories<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where : [id] = [Assets].[Category]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; EditRecord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; SetField:Catagories.NextID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Value: [Catagories].[NextID] + 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point in time we thus have a automatic incremting and setting of the AssetID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also have to add the above code to the after insert event (since after update does not fire on a table insert event)</p>
<p>You now have to go through each of the forms staring with AssetDetails and delete the category combo box, and then drop in a new one based on this new table.</p>
<p>Build a nice for to edit the catagories, and you will have made a nice addition to this system, and one that will automatic update the next assetID for you, and allow you to easy set the nextID.</p>
<p>The above is much "air" code, but is the general approach you need here.</p>

<br />
It is probably not the case that TODAY() and NOW() are causing the circular reference.&nbsp; Instead, the circular reference probably was pre-existing, and using TODAY() and NOW() -- any volatile function -- simply caused Excel to discover the circular reference
 during recalculation.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, "the" cell with a circular reference is displayed in the lower-left part of the status line.&nbsp; However, that can be misleading.&nbsp; It depends on the complexity of the circular references.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes clicking on Formula, Error Checking (drop-down menu) and Circular References in the Formula Auditing section will reveal the problem.&nbsp; But again, that depends on the complexity of the circular references.&nbsp; Often, the Circular References link
 is greyed out, in my experience.<br />
<br />
The following procedure was suggested by someone else some time ago.&nbsp; Select a cell, ideally one identified as having a circular reference, then click on Formula, Trace Precedents in the Formula Auditing section.<br />
<br />
If you see a red trace arrow, I believe it indicates a circular reference.&nbsp; Otherwise, repeatedly click on Trace Precedents (adds more depth) until you see one or more read trace arrows.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that might be difficult to see in large worksheets.&nbsp; And it might be nearly useless if the circular references involve another worksheet.<br />
<br />
If you wish, post the URL of an example Excel file that demonstrates the problem, uploaded to a file-sharing website.&nbsp; The following is a list of some free file-sharing websites; or use your own.<br />

<p>Also win 7 became very slow to start. After trying many things I decided to re-install win 7 from my CD. Everything went well except IE 8 was installed and the IE 11 Update kept failing. I tried downloading and installing IE 11 from the web but installation
 does not complete. I even tried downloading and installing IE 10 but that didn't work, I have carried out virus and malware scans deleted some programs and startup files, tried booting with all non windows services shut down nothing fixes the problem IE 11
 will not install,</p>
<p>My latest IE main log file is below. What is next? Can anyone help I'm becoming very frustrated :(</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delayed response. I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing at this moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you get any error when you try to install Internet Explorer 11?</li><li>Do you have any third-party software installed in the computer?</li></ol>
<p>If you have any third-party anti-virus software installed in the computer, disable it temporarily then try to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span><span>
</span></p>

            <p>Hi Soumya, Thanks for responding. I realized that I had a lot more problems than just ie 11. The computer had become very slow to boot, a back up resulted in empty folders, and I was experiencing several other issues. I had tried everything and then some
 to find and repair the corruption issues and eventually gave up and did a full re-install of windows on a new hard drive. Now IE 11 works fine, I performed a good back-up&nbsp;and set up a schedule, and the computer now boots up and shuts down quickly. The only
 hiccups were Outlook lost all my email (but I did recover most from a copy of the pst file I had wisely made), I lost all my game progress files (bonus, I get to start them all again :))&nbsp;and the fact that there were 186 windows updates to install. So far everything
 is good but I do not have everything (programs games etc.) re-installed yet. It has been quite an adventure :) Good job I am retired and have the time to do this.</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I have just gone to write an email address on my E71 contacts and for the life of me I can't see how to put a '_' in the email. I can see a '-' but not a underscore _</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still remember the details of your old Skype account, you might want to try on signing in with using just the
<strong>Skype name </strong>of the old Skype account instead of using the <strong>
new email address </strong>you have added. Or if you cannot remember the details, I suggest to reach out to anyone of your contacts to view your old Skype account and ask them the
<strong>Skype Name</strong> they are seeing for you to sign back in using that and recover the original account before you changed emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing would be if there would be any chance that you can check the old email address connected to your Skype account, there should be a renewal email that includes the correct Microsoft account the subscription is connected to. Use that to sign back
 in with Skype to recover the account before you changed any details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further inquiries or clarifications. </p>

<h2>            Excel Online rows loading slowly</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have multiple users (3 at a time) editing an Excel workbook on a SharePoint Online site. While scrolling they have issues in both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome where the rows won't load, or will take a long time to load. If they leave the workbook
 and go back in, the cells load quickly until some time has passed and they go to a different place in the workbook again. The workbook is small (&lt;1 mb) and we really need the ability to simultaneously edit, but this issue is causing a lot of lost productivity.</p>
<p>Are there settings for the Workbook, SharePoint Site, or Browser that we can implement to make sure that it is more responsive?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Bobby</p>

Hi Bobby,</p>
<p>To narrow down this issue, I‚Äôd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Does this issue occur to a specific workbook?<br />
2. Have you tried the workbook in a different library to check the outcome?<br />
3. Try a different network environment to see if there‚Äôs any improvement.<br />
4. If it‚Äôs convenient, could you capture a full screenshot of the abnormal page for our investigation? To upload screenshots, you can click<strong> Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of<strong> Insert/Edit Media.</strong></p>
<p>We look forward to your updates.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

<p>The question is quite open ended, I am basically looking for a list of optimizations that can improve this functionality. I understand you cannot diagnose my specific situation, but would appreciate even a vague list of things that speed up / slow down this
 system.</p>

                    <p>I too have experienced the same problem, however it is NOT with every website.</p>
<p>Happens with Facebook, Comcast, Yahoo, some Google pages.&nbsp; Very annoying.&nbsp; At first I thought it was having to do with our deep packet inspection, but it happens even when I am not on our office LAN but also at public Wi-fi connections.</p>
<p>So has nothing to do with proxy settings or physical network firewall.&nbsp; Things used to work fine for a long time, but this has been going on for several weeks now.&nbsp; Have reinstalled IE8 several times and checked for rootkit and registry problems, No virus
 or malware.&nbsp; No key logger either found.&nbsp; Reinstalled Java Runtime and still have issues.</p>

<h2>            Horizontal scroll bar started to appear on MS Forum Page.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to have horizontal scroll bar on MS Forum Page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had seen this happening first on my Notebook in the beginning of April 2018 and put out a post here. My notebook has a screen resolution of 1366 by 768.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/forum/edge_issue-edge_win10/why-do-i-need-horizontal-scroll-bar-on-the-ms/81f2ba66-4d64-4e75-819a-b82c4f8cab3e">Forum Reference</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>( I did not get an answer to my above post, by the way. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have started to have the horizontal scroll bars appear on my desktop, which has a monitor resolution of 1920 by 1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>( A screenshot is supposed to be here. But I can't upload it. Forum does not accept screenshot uploading )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need a monitor which should have at least 3840 by 2160 screen resolution ? A 4K monitor ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are 8K monitors on the market now ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I really need a bigger res monitor in the first place ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do forum designers have shares in monitor manufacturing companies ?</p>

<p>It's a new feature. No matter how much wasted space there is, Microsoft is now giving you more. So far it seems it has only been applied to the forum page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My resolution is 1920x1080.&nbsp; Adjusting the scale between values of 100%, 125%&nbsp; or 150%&nbsp; in Settings or IE11 does not make much difference.</p>

<p>For my System it is only on the main page also and only with Edge not Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be the way Edge is working or maybe it is just another thing with the site that the other browsers can handle. It seems to let me insert Snips at the moment.</p>

    <title>Problem in SharePoint - Access required - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem in SharePoint - Access required</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am encountering with the following problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I&nbsp;have tried to test for user accessibility&nbsp;in a blank folder in one big folder in SharePoint. Even though I have only applied to the specific blank folder by unclicking permission to any of the owners, it has been applied to the whole big folder
 (which is unexpected). Therefore, I cannot get access to the big folder now while I need it. I got the link of the folder but it says 'Access required' whenever I enter the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me deal with this issue. Any of the site owners cannot get access to the folder now.</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Sunhye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the SharePoint admin in your organization right? If you have account that have
<strong>full control</strong> <strong>permission</strong> to the folder(if the folder still inherited permission, site owner will have access), you can assign permission back by select the folder &gt; Details &gt; Manage access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not SharePoint admin, Please contact IT admin in your organization. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Limited-access mode and workflow isn't in your case, because only the account with full control permission could solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are sure that there is no account can access the folder and change permission. Please get help from my Admin Help in my previous post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to give feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eric</p>
