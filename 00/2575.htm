<h2>            Odd cpu and bios behaviour</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I've had a system based on a q6600 and a p5a se motherboard for a number of years now. Overclocked to 3ghz @ ddr2 800.</p>
<p>I've just installed Windows 10 preview to check things out. All went well initially until pc went to sleep. On waking I got a bios screen. I found that none of my overclock now worked even though settings in bios are exactly same as ever. Once into Windows
 and checking on cpuid it's now showing as if I'm running a q8300 at stock speeds. Bios post shows stock speeds not overclock aswel. I'm at a loss to explain what's going on. Anyone any ideas please.</p>

</strong>Overclocking comes with many risks, such as overheating, so you should become familiar with all the pros and cons before you attempt it. Additionally, overclocking isn't supported by the major chip manufacturers which means overclocking your CPU will
 void your warranty. Overclocking can also decrease the lifespan of the CPU, cause failure in critical components and may even result in some data corruption. You may also notice an increase in unexplainable crashes and freezes.</span></span></span></p>

            Been overclocking computers for 15 years with no negative effects on hardware or speed. Yes it's a watercooled closed circuit system runs cooler than stock. System has been happily Overclocked for 5years. All hardware is fine. Overclocking would have no
 consequence on the issues I've had with windows 10 preview or cpuid. While I appreciate what your saying you've not control anything I've asked about. So again does anyone have any idea what could have happened in the above senario and why windows 10 would
 suddenly appear to being 'seeing' a different processor in My system. Thanks

            <p>also i have to remark that MS support engineer has never heard of i7 - K processors.&nbsp; (build and sold for Overclocking by Intel)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'd advise to reflash your bios. because win 10 might sometimes corrupt&nbsp;it. (or hackers using all&nbsp;zero-day's they can find)</p>
<p>reflash and do a full clean reinstall. (wipe all disks, maybe you even need to take apart your rig and rebuild it to lose any resident mallware)</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe MS has some trouble with subversive elements working for them and abusing their position to do harm for their own purposes.</p>
<p>(plus MS must have told the NSA to take a hike when they requested backdoors)</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can't rule out any posibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this was all to be expected.</p>

                    <div>JUST WHAT IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MEAN???</div>
<div>I have &nbsp;been trying to get Access 2007 to open my Access 2000 files, but several refuse to open, with the error message that "Permissions have not been granted".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what is this explanation from MSN that suggests that there now is "lack of workgroup security in Microsoft&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access for accdb format databases"? &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So why cant ACCESS 2007 open my ACCESS 2000 files???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Where is the Work Group Administrator file in ACCESS 2007???</div>

</div>
<div>The new MicrosoftÂ® Accessâ„¢ 2007 delivers several new security enhancements, along with&nbsp;</div>
<div>one significant change that is less publicized. &nbsp;Namely, the lack of workgroup security in Microsoft&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access for accdb format databases. &nbsp;If your organization is considering or deploying Office 2007,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access databases that rely on user-level security present a considerable, and potentially costly,&nbsp;</div>
<div>migration challenge. &nbsp;Moreover, recent legislative and regulatory requirements across the globe, such&nbsp;</div>
<div>as Sarbanes-Oxley in the US, make control of user access to sensitive information a corporate&nbsp;</div>
<div>imperative. &nbsp;This brief paper outlines key considerations for migrating databases that rely on user-level&nbsp;</div>
<div>security to Microsoft Access 2007.</div>

            <p>Same reply as to your other question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have applied user-level security to an Access database, the users and groups are stored in a workgroup file (.mdw). If that workgroup file is not available on your new computer, you probably won't have sufficient permissions to use the database. So
 you should copy the relevant .mdw files from your old computer to the new one. For each database, you have to create a shortcut that opens the database with the corresponding workgroup. The target for the shortcut would like similar to this:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\MSAccess.exe" "C:\Databases\MyDatabase.mdb" /wrkgrp "C:\Databases\MyWorkgroup.mdw"</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Usually I prefer using the full date format written as yyyy-mm-dd, ex. 2015-11-16, and that's how I want it in the formula field, but in some cases all
 dates are in the nearby future and then I want to use the short form dd/MM, ex. 16/11. This, however, has given me 2 issues:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. When I enter dd/MM Excel automatically converts it to show dd-MMM, ex. 16/11 shows as 16-nov. I can reasonably easy deal with this by pre-formatting
 the whole column, but I feel I shouldn't have to. I've tried to change the date settings in Windows to dd/MM, but that only results in Excel showing dd/MMM, ex. 16/nov. How can I make Excel show the date as I enter it instead of converting it to a format I
 never want?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2. If the day of the month is 12 or less, ex. 05/11, Excel interprets this as MM/dd, ex. 05/11 shows as 11-may instead of 5-nov. When the day of the
 month is 13 or more it works fine but I want to be able to enter all dates as dd/MM no matter what date.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Is there a setting to manage this, or am
 I stuck with the US way to interpret dates?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please be noted that when you enter the left side of the dd/mm and itâ€™s within twelve months of the year, it will automatically change as Excel works that way. Since you are already used to pre-formatting,

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing short form to 10/11 and long form to 2015-11-10 through the control panel, but it only works partly and makes other things worse. Entering 10/11 will then show 10/nov in the cell and 10/11/2015 in the formula field. It makes Excel understand
 I'm entering it as dd/MM even in this case, but it still automatically formats it to 10/nov, which I consider slightly worse than 10-nov, instead of keeping it as entered. Also I really don't like the format 10/11/2015 that shows in the formula field. When
 showing the full date I always want the format 2015-11-10.</p>
<p>I can format the individual cells to show what I want, but feel there should be a way of not having to since I only ever use 2 ways of showing dates, 10/11 och 2015-11-10, and I tend to enter them the same way I want them shown. Is it possible to set a general
 rule in Excel to get that, not having to set the format in every document?</p>

<p><span>Hi,<br />
I cannot launch any of the MS office aplication available from withing the inbox. When I go to Office -&gt; New Word document (and excell and powerpint and onenote), instead of having been able to create a new document using web app, I get the following message:<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
With my other live account (for which I signed up several months ago) I do not &nbsp;have such a problem and I am able to create documents using web app. Of course I can go to</span><a href="http://workspace.office.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://workspace.office.live.com</span></a><span>
 but it's not the point, is it?</span></p>
<p><span>Some user suggested to acces oneâ€™s profile and exit out without changing anything. It didnâ€™t work in my case.<br />
<br />
Please advise<br />

Thank you<br />

<h2>            Newly created macros disappear in Excel 2007 and 2010. Please help</h2>
                    <p>I've been using macros in Excel 2003 for many years. In Excel 2007 I started having issues with my macros. My old macros worked fine. However, I when I created a new macro it worked as long as I was in Excel, but the next morning when I tried to use the
 macro it had disappeared. Over the course of the last 3 weeks, I've recreated about 40 macros and all of them record, I'm able to use them the same day, but they are gone when I go to use them the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our IT department told me it was an issue with 2007 so they upgraded me to 2010. However, that has not resolved the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always save my macro under personal.xlsb and I save my workbook under .xlsm. I've checked the macro security settings and they are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, I'm tearing my hair out. Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;You are doing the right things. Excel should prompt you when closing Excel to verify that you want to save changes to personal.xlsb. If not, I would start trying to identify why not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you are working in a virtual machine environment (Citrix, etc) where the environment is actually locked down for security- you can do lots of things (install add-ins, write macros, etc.) but every time you access the Citrix desktop
 server from scratch, you get a 'clean' instance of the environment. In those situations, some directory pointers in the citrix machine may be pointed to your local fileshare or local machine (such as where to save program files) but that environment might
 not have 'local' versions of things like personal.xlsb... in which case, every time you (or anyone) loads the citrix client desktop, you get the fresh/plain version of all system files including personal.xlsb.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if this is the problem (regardless of whether it is Citrix or a similar product), when you were upgraded to 2007 and then 2010, did they come and physically install the new versions on your PC? If not, it increases the likelyhood that you are
 working in this type of virtual desktop environment. If that is the case, you can either argue with your IT department about how you need a personal copy of that file (I wouldn't bet on them changing the environment for everyone just so one person can write
 macros), or, you can just start packing all your code in a local add-in, and then install it every time you load Excel- not a very efficient solution, but if you have code you want to re-use across different workbooks, but maybe someone else in the forum is
 in the same situation and can suggest better approaches to work in a virtual desktop environment</p>

    <title>Uninstall Zune - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr jawad ahmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstall Zune</h2>
                    I have Zune Version 04.08.2345.00 installed on my Windows 8 64bit computer.
<div>I decide to uninstall it but it gives me an error showing a dialog box asking for zune-x64.msi. The problem is i cannot locate the msi anywhere. So when i cancel this dialog box, the uninstall is closed prematurely giving a message "Zune failed to uninstall"
 Error code 0x8007064c and a link to goto which is&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=101254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=101254</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am unable to understand why microsoft saves the msi outside of zune installation folder so it got removed/deleted in the first place.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Solutions i tried so far:</div>
<div>Downloaded&nbsp;ZuneSetupPkg and extracted it using Universal-Extractor to see if the x64.msi file is there or not. No such file in the package.</div>
<div>Dowmloaded&nbsp;zunesetuppkg-x64 and extracted using Universal-Extractor and found an msi with exact same name but using that msi in the uninstall dialog box says this is not the same msi used to install Zune.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please someone help me get rid of this problem.</div>
<div><br />

mythilig</a>. Are you still having this issue on your phone? If yes, you may try rebooting it by pressing and holding the volume down and the power keys at the same time for 10-15 seconds. To make sure you're blocking the phone number right, you may check this

    <title>user name given to reviewer comments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> afeenix  say:</h3>
<h2>            user name given to reviewer comments</h2>
                    <p>When I add comments to a collaborative document, those comments are identified with the Windows system username of the computer on which Iâ€™m working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does not use the Microsoft Office defined username.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can find no way to change that.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I need the Microsoft Office user name to be used as it identifies my organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(When I create a new document, it assigns the Microsoft Office user name as the author, as expected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yet, just as on the collaborative document, it identifies the person editing the document according to the Windows computer user name).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to have the reviewing comments labeled with the Microsoft Office user name (which, in my case, will then appropriately identify my organization as the source of the comment)?&nbsp; &nbsp;Even an ad hoc name I assign for the comments would be
 fine.</p>

                    <p>I am struggling with trying to figure out how to use VBA to format a picture how I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I usually right click on my picture, click on style, and choose "simple frame black". I also change 'WithTextWrapping' to "Square"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only been successful with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub FormatImage()<br />
Selection.ShapeRange.WrapFormat.Type = wdWrapSquare<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I can not figure out how to choose a border type, much less how to determine its thickness and add a shadow</p>

<h2>            IE10 for Windows 7 will not prompt to save passwords on websites</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to get IE10 to prompt me to save an entered password and it simply will not do it. I have checked the Content and Autocomplete options and YES the "Usernames and passwords on forms" is checked AND "Ask me before saving passwords" is also checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also looked in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Internet Explorer/Main and I have the following:
</p>
<p>FormSuggest PW Ask set as "yes"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also deleted Autocomplete history to no avail. I believe at one point on this particular computer (I have transferred locations and inherited this machine) someone may have clicked "Never for this site" and I do not know how to reverse that or even
 check to see if that has happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Important, Serious, If anyone can help please do asap</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am 19, I am a naive silly, irresponsible university student</p>
<p>I made a mistake, a 'girl' messaged me, flirted with me and made me do things I'm not proud of doing</p>
<p>I **** online</p>
<p>It was a man who stole and recorded me pleasuring myself and threatened to put in on Facebook and send it individually to all my friends unless I gave money&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have money, my loan barely gets my rent,hence I work for my rent, I don't think I'm a bad person, just irresponsible and not mature as I thought I was</p>
<p>the Skype account is (Axxxxxxxxxxxx) (live:xxxxxxxxx2)</p>
<p>My point is I cant contact Skype which is frustrating me</p>
<p>Because Skype needs to stop this man ruining other boys/men/women/girls lives like he did to me&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            sticky notes</h2>
                    I like to use sticky notes when I type documents in WORD. How can I prevent them from disappearing to the bottom of the page as soon as I start typing?
                </div>

<br />How can I prevent them from disappearing to the bottom of the page as soon as I start typing?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />By disappearing to bottom of the screen am assuming you are referring to it appearing on the Task bar when it loses focus - correct? The StickyNote itself actually stays on screen but behind the app that currently has the focus (i.e. Word in this case)
<br />
<br />To my knowledge there is no way to force the a Win10 sticky note to stay on top of all open windows. You would need to search for a 3rd party "stickynote" app that has that functionality/capability
