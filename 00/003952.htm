<h2>            Nokia N70 and BMW bluetooth car kit</h2>
                    I have a Nokia N70 software V2.0539.1.2 19-10-05 RM84. I just bought a BMW 5 series with an integrated bluetooth car kit.<br />
There is no way to make any connection between the 2 devices.<br />
I tried to connect a Nokia 6230i and works great, I could also download the address book in the car. I tried a Nokia 6680 and there is connection but not address book, but my N70 does not works at all.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
Thanks and regards

            No any reply yet. In the meantime I sent my phone to Nokia, they'll try to replace the software and I'll see if there is any improvement.<br />
They told me they need 15 days!! for this work..,<br />
<br />
I let you know,<br />

            In general, phones that utilize the Bluetooth HANDSFREE protocol SHOULD be compatible with the BMW Bluetooth systems, although issues with how the handset manufacturer implements this protocol impact overall compatibility as well as automatic phone book
 and SIM transfer (sound familiar?). BMW's requirements for a phone to work are:: (a) Bluetooth, (b) Handsfree profile, and (c) Object Exchange. (a) Bluetooth + (b) Handsfree profile =&gt; ability to make/receive calls (c) Object Exchange =&gt; transfer of phone
 book from phone to car Below is a list of all KNOWN compatible phones for the BMW Bluetooth factory option: (the data gathered here has been compiled from a variety of sources) Blackberry 7100 - SIM and phone memory GSM Requires manual transmission of phone
 book entries Blackberry 7130 - CDMA Requires manual transmission of phone book entries Ericsson T39 - SIM and phone memory GSM 1. You can only pair with one headset device at a time and the BMW ULF is paired as a headset device. If you wish to switch between
 the ULF and a different Bluetooth headset you must repair from scratch each time. 2. Requires manual transmission of phone book entries HP iPaq h6310, h6315 - SIM and phone memory GSM Requires manual transmission of phone book entries LG PM-325 - CDMA Phone
 pairs and works with the BMW ULF, but address book will not auto transfer due to lack of Object Exchange in phone. *Sprint PCS have been asked to NOT cripple this phone like Verizon did to the V710* Motorola A630 - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible
 Motorola e815 84 21 0 393 570 Automatic CDMA Fully compatible. Motorola V330, V505, V551, V525, V600, V620, V634 - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible. Motorola V710 - Not known - untested. Visteon BT Module (pre-2004): Compatible with 1.3 Software and
 552 Module or 1.4 Software and 522 Module but no phone book pairing either way. Not compatible with 089 or 387 Module. Motorola BT Module (2005 combo Assist/BT module): Pairs fine and supports automatic transfer of the address book. Motorola V80 - SIM and
 phone memory GSM This is a tri-band phone with no support for 850 MHz. Motorola RAZR V3 - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible. Motorola SLVR L7 - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible. Nokia 3620, 3650 - SIM and phone memory GSM The voice dialing
 works great. The address book only works if sending contacts from the phone when the system is in BT PAIRING mode. Nokia 6310, 6310i 84 21 6 930 108 (E46, E53, E83, E85) 84 21 0 304 651 (E60, E61, E63, E64) Automatic - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible.
 Nokia 6230 - SIM and phone memory Automatic if phone is upgraded to SW release 5.24 and higher. The phone pairs and works with calls and SMS. There may be an issue with address book compatibility. Address book issues reported to be resolved if the phone is
 upgraded to SW release 5.24 and higher Nokia 6600 Not known - untested. Nokia 6820 - SIM and phone memory GSM Address book issues. Nokia 8910, 8910i - SIM and phone memory GSM Fully compatible for phones with software version 3.75 and higher. Phones with earlier
 software versions - unverified. Nokia N-Gage Not known - untested. Panasonic X70 Not known - untested. PalmOne Treo 650 GSM or CDMA versions available With the available patch, the phone pairs but may only transfer a limited number of address book entries
 to the vehicle. Siemens SX1 Not known - untested. Siemens SK65 - SIM only GSM The Siemens SK65 phone (like a S65 with integrated blackberry) has been tested on a new 645Ci. It works fine with good communication quality, but transfers only the contacts on the
 SIM-card. Firmware version of SK65 is V40. SonyEricsson T68i - SIM only GSM Fully compatible for phones with software version R8A and later. Phones with earlier software versions not verified. SonyEricsson T610, T616, T630, T637 - SIM and phone memory GSM
 Fully compatible T637 a close fit for the T610 snap-in adaptor. SonyEricsson K700i, K750i / W800 - SIM and phone memory GSM Successor to the popular T610 and T630. This MAY be a tri-band phone with no support for 850 MHz. SonyEricsson Z600 - This is a tri-band
 phone with no support for 850 MHz. SonyEricsson T608 - Only issue is the contacts do not always stay in the Car Module memory. This may be due to the phone NOT automatically resending them upon re-pairing. Manual phonebook transfer supported with BMW ULF versions
 from the 84 21 6 945 387. The 84 21 6 955 522 has been successfully tested and is fully supported. SonyEricsson P910 - SIM and phone memory GSM Pairs fine with certain BMW models, but requires manual transmission of phone book entries SonyEricsson K700i -
 This is a tri-band phone with no support for 850 MHz.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the lack of SPACES and PARAGRAPHS, with such a large amount of text, the edit option will not allow me to punctuate any further. I suggest you might like to just scroll down and find the particular model that relates to your phone and read the
 outcome.

            I have a 2005 E46 330Cd Sport and a Nokia N70 on Orange with 2 lines. It works fine to make and receive calls when using Line 1 but, although still paired ok, it will not make and receive calls on line 2. My previous phone a 6680 worked fine on both line
 1 and line 2. Has anyone else had or solved this problem?

            go to www.bmw.co.uk/bluetooth to check which operating system number your phone needs to have to be compatible. Also you can (apparently) take your BMW to a dealer and get the bluetooth software upgraded to a more current version if your car was made before
 the time they specifiy at the above website.

            I find it incredibly annoying that a Bluetooth kit that cost nearly ¬£1800 extra on a BMW does not have full compatible with all phones available. I have a 5 Series with which my N70 does not connect and yet for ¬£49.95 I purchased a piece of kit which is
 fitted to my other car and there are no compatibility problems of any kind. I think it is time BMW pulled their finger out and paid attention to their electronics which are certainly not compatible with the standard of their mechanical engineering.

            I experience the same issues with an SPV M2000 pda phone and non connectivity to the BMW system. I suspect it is not BMW at fault but more to do with the availability of bluetooth software that is compatable with the operating systems on the smartphones
 / pda's

            Thank you very mich for your contribution. However for a layman as myself I had some trouble figuring out what is what. I will summarise as follows. I purchased a BMW 5 series that came with a Nokia 6230i and car kit, blue tooth and voice recgnition and
 it works great, but being an Erricson man all my life I had problems with syncronising the info on my computer when it came to first name last name, ie the 6230i has only one field for name and being used to look up contacts with last or family name I have
 a problem with the sequence of first name last name. On trying to pair with the Erricson K700i it would work intermitenly ie on and off, however no phone book is visible.Can you advise on the following:-<br />
1-What Erricson (new model) is compatible with the system?<br />
or<br />
2-What other Nokia phone that has first name last name format is fully compatible with the system.<br />
Thank you very much for your help.

    <title>Columns&#40;i&#41;.Autofit with multiline text and Wrap Text set&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            Columns&#40;i&#41;.Autofit with multiline text and Wrap Text set&#63;</h2>
                    Columns(i).AutoFit works if cells have only one line of text.&nbsp; But it does not seem to work if some cells have multiple lines of text, even when Wrap Text is set in the Alignment tab.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make Columns(i).AutoFit to work in both cases?<br />
<br />
Please note that I trying to autofit the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
column</span> width.<br />
<br />
Previous discussions that I found in a search of the forum seemed to focus only on autofitting row height.&nbsp; That does not seem to be a problem once I adjust the column width manually.&nbsp; That is, Cells(i, 1).EntireRow.AutoFit seems to work just fine.<br />
<br />
(Hindsight....&nbsp; I probably could have used Rows(i).AutoFit instead.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; That's not important.)<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; Although I would appreciate a solution for XL2003, the person I am trying to help actually uses XL2007 or XL2010 (not sure which).&nbsp; So if this is a non-problem for XL2007 or later, or if your solution works only for XL2007 or later, that might be sufficient
 -- not for me, but for the person I am trying to help.<br />

            <p>If you include line breaks - vbLf or Chr(10) - in the value of a cell, Wrap Text must be on, otherwise the line breaks will not be displayed.</p>
<p>Excel will not widen a column to autofit wrapped text, but it will narrow it if possible, so perhaps you can use something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub AutoFitWrappedText()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Range("A1").EntireColumn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ColumnWidth = 255 ' maximum width<br />

    <title>5800XM Bluetooth power bug &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbdom---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            5800XM Bluetooth power bug &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been experiencing poor battery life on my Nokia 5800 XM recently. Sometimes on a full charge I could only get a day to a day and a half of standby time with minimal usage (2-3 texts, no calls and 5 photographs). I put this down to an old battery and
 ordered a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime we went to my parents-in-law and the battery lasted 5 days on a full charge including a reasonable amount of web browsing via WLAN.</p>
<p><br />
Got back home and the battery died a couple of days later despite being fully charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put in a brand new battery, charged it up and used the phone - 2.5 days later it was dead (minimal texts and a couple of photos). Charged it again - 2 days standby before dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloaded the power profile app - everything seemed to be fine. The phone idled nicely on standby with minimal power drain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I used the bluetooth and everything became clear. After connecting to OVI for a minute or two, downloading my photos then closing OVI and disabling the bluetooth on the phone, I noticed my power consumption didn't go back down. I was getting regular
 peaks of around 150ma and the battery life was considerably reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I left the bluetooth disabled and power cycled the phone, it would settle down to minimal usage. The moment bluetooth was enabled, the problem reocurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then backed the phone up, totally wiped the sd card and reinstalled from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exactly the same problem - fine until BT enabled then even when disabled, the phone started drawing excess current on idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a search on this problem and come up with very little.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it would be a pain backing up all essential data, you may have to consider carrying out a "hard reset" to return device to "Out of box" state by keying in
<strong>*#7370#</strong> followed by <strong>12345</strong> (default Nokia lock code unless altered by yourself) to exclude any possible software corruption.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Asha 210 Mail for Exchange unable to start</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i've bought Nokia Asha 210 today. Right after I went through the settings I tried to launch Mail for Exchange.</p>
<p>It promted for language, I've selected English and after that i got the message "Checking for newer version" and "Updating" on the top. The phone connected to internet (tried mobile and wifi) and after few second the screen flashed with "Operation Failed"
 and after that "An error has occured. Retry".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to restort the phone to factory state (tho it was already), but nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what could the problem be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a domain name recently bought on NameCheap. I've created a mail address like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but i fail to make it functional through Outlook.com (the webmail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concretely, i want to send and receive email from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. But i can't manage to do it. When i go to account, add a sending/receiving account, i put my name, the mail that i want to use, a new password, then click next, and there's an error
 (fail to connect to POP), then it directs me to the advanced settings but it seems everything is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me</p>

<h3> wil greenhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista</h2>
                    Why, when Microsoft evidently discontinued standing behind its Vista product years ago, will Microsoft charge more money for a replacement product? It's sort of like no longer making engine parts available for an automobile while there are millions of
 them still on the road. How do you propose to protect clients who paid hundreds of dollars for your product and depend on you for support?

            <p><span><span>You probably can get this to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first big issue is that the c:\Program Files (x86) folder is HIGHLY protected today to prevent virus software etc. from modifying software that you installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course older programs like access 97 don‚Äôt know this, and thus freely used files in the Program Folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A simple way around this is to place the wrk group file in say the folder where the application resides and specify the workgroup file in a shortcut.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In fact I do find that Access 97 will install + run on windows 7 or 10 if:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Turn off all virus protection software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Turn off all UAC prompts (turn off user account control).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Install Access as an ‚Äúadmin‚Äù</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And run + launch Access as an admin user.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(you can run as admin by right clicking on the access or program shortcut and choosing ‚Äúrun as administrator‚Äù ‚Äì this alone may well fix your issue).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do the above, then Access 97 will quite happy install&nbsp;+ run on a win 7 or 10 box.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So the issue is the workgroup file is being created in the program files folder which is HIGHLY locked down and protected these days to prevent virus and programs ‚Äúchanging‚Äù things
 in that folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù workgroup file will be created (or attempted to create), but due to user permissions this is often not possible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try running as admin - that alone might fix this issue. If not, then as noted you could grab a workgroup file from a older machine - transfer with a usb jump drive.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As a few pointed out here, if the data is valuable, then you eventually want to consider pulling out the data into a newer format, as 20 year old software is rather old.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    I am not receiving emails from Microsoft about future updates on windows 10 and such, I thought I chose to receive emails? I am fearing that this also means that I will not receive build updates?

<h2>            Error 70080020 on Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I bought a used Samsung phone with Windows 8, I know problems are to be expected but I really need it to work, with my low budget. So, the Store doesn't work, it returns error 70080020 when I try to download an app I selected in it. I know it's normally
 date and time, but they are correct.</p>
<p>It's very tricky because right now I can't download any fix, any update of the store or anything that would fix it. The Store itself cannot be updated on this old version of Windows. But internet, the phone and synching to OneDrive all works.</p>
<p>I've been to many procedures that didn't solve the problem, including this one :</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/13390/lumia-what-to-do-if-i-cannot-download-or-update-apps-from-store</p>
I'm disappointed because the problem is really the one described, but it's like it's normally fixed easily I think. So, the main thing that is synching the phone with my Windows account isn't succesful, although it is synching well and my Windows account is
 fine! I went on it and really updated as much things as possible, as far as my date of birth. And it's funny because from it, I can make my phone ring and also locate it succesfully. And I have an Xbox account.
<p>Anyone has an idea?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. : The phone is a Samsung Ativ S, manufactured in 2012. Resetted to factory settings just yesterday. Nothing seems wrong with the phone itself. Windows is 8.0.10521.155. Firmware is 2212.13.11.2.</p>

<br />
i found the setting you are referring to but it is all greyed out. i'm not sure it's an issue with outlook since it seems to stop at the docmd.sendobject line when it fails.

<p>i also found out that the pc doesn't seem to like&nbsp;docmd.openreport commands either, same thing it will try to open and just pop up the 2501 error message.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot see or contact one specific contact - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot see or contact one specific contact</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one specific contact that I cannot message/call on Skype.</p>
<p>With all my other contacts it's working fine, except this one.</p>
<p>They cannot see my messages and they do not get notifications about incoming calls, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Previously we were able to use text messages, but not calls. This was in January 2017.</p>
<p>Now we are simply unable to talk at all via Skype.</p>
<p>We are both using Skype version 8.34.0.78. It does not matter if we use Skype for Windows 10 or desktop, Mobile devices don't work too, creating brand new Skype accounts did not help either (we are unable to even find each other by email).</p>
<p>My Skype ID is f*****r.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2a646732-2bff-4c8c-9efc-3f3d4b252cc4" title="NikoSegen">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you are adding a different account than the one you are currently using.
</p>
<p>I would recommend to try and check your Skype Name and give that exact Skype Name to your friend in which you are trying to contact to in order for them to find the right account to add.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try also checking your <strong>Discoverability </strong>in your Skype account, this helps your friends to find you in their searches. You can do this by logging on to this link:
</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down and make sure that the two checkbox for <strong>Discoverability</strong> is marked. Once done, try to give your friend the Skype&nbsp;ID instead of your email address to search you in Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that you might have misunderstood me somehow.</p>
<p>I said that we originally could use text messages for communication in Skype.</p>
<p>Now it is impossible for some reason because neither I can see their messages nor they can see mine.</p>
<p>We cannot call each other either because I do not receive their call and they do not receive mine.</p>
<p>We have double checked our Skype IDs and, again, we could use messages in the PAST and cannot NOW.</p>
<p>The part about not being able to find one another is only applicable to our attempts to create brand new accounts in desperate attempts to contact each other.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the clarification and the prompt response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, I would suggest to reset the Skype app folder in your device. This would help clear any cache that might be preventing you to see the messages of that certain contact. Here are the steps on how you can reset your Skype app's folder:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Close the Skype app.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<em><strong>Windows + R</strong></em></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><em>%appdata%/Microsoft </em></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>hi!</p>
<p>i saved a word file, looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5450752f-d3b9-474d-9ff7-44820c8a8f70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5450752f-d3b9-474d-9ff7-44820c8a8f70" /></a></p>

<p>but when it's uploaded to send, it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f688c04d-65e5-4e05-afed-ab03471ba59c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df688c04d-65e5-4e05-afed-ab03471ba59c" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Ali,</p>
<p>I noticed that when you uploaded the file, the issue occurs. So to clarify if it is a client issue, could you help me in confirming the following?<br />
1. Where do you upload the file? Where do you open the file when the issue occurs?<br />
2. If you open the file in Word Online, what‚Äôs the outcome?<br />
3. If you create a new file, can you reproduce the issue?</p>
<p>If the file works fine in Word Online and the issue only occurs when opening in the Word client, it can be proved that it is a client issue.</p>
<p>If so, as our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business online services, I suggest you post on our

                    <p>I haven't been able to download apps from the store or marketplace or get my Cortana to work etc etc because every time that I try, my phone asks me to login to the Microsoft account associated with my store etc, &amp; every time I enter my password it keeps
 saying its incorrect. But I think the reason it keeps saying my password is incorrect is because its showing the wrong email address! The email address that it shows is an address that I vaguely remember even creating so I think that's why it keeps telling
 me I've entered the wrong password; but it won't let me change my email linked to the account either &amp; I've successfully changed my password several times so that isn't working out for me either! I'm pretty sure this exact same problem happened to me before
 &amp; I was told the ONLY solution was to reset my phone but if that's truly the case, I dont want to have to reset my phone &amp; lose absolutely everything!! And I dont understand why this keeps happening to me! Has anybody else experienced this problem?? Can someone
 please try &amp; help me with this? I dont know if the problem is caused by something I'm doing wrong or is it a Windows glitch, or a Microsoft glitch maybe?? Help please!</p>

humyrasattar</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Are you referring to restart by turning the phone off &amp; on? If so, are there any changes if you hold down the power button + volume down button at the same time until the phone restarts? Do you have
 an SD card on the phone? Could you try removing it and see if it helps? We look forward to your reply. ^_^</p>

    <title>How to work with large binary numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rothrock42  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to work with large binary numbers</h2>
                    <p>I've got some numbers up to 32 bits that I need to work with in binary. The built in dec2bin function only deals with with number -512&lt;n&lt;512. Which isn't nearly enough!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this VBA script for a UDF: <a href="http://mcgimpsey.com/excel/udfs/longdec2bin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mcgimpsey.com/excel/udfs/longdec2bin.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it isn't working properly. It is displaying 8 = 000. Which isn't correct. It should be 8 = 1000.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that for&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;powers of 2 (namely 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 26, 28, 30) they are missing the leftmost bit. The other powers of 2 are fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't gone in and checked all the number between 0 and 2^32 so I don't know if there are other things wrong with the code. I'm not fluent enough in VBA to really debug this either.</p>

<em>I think I may have left something and never deleted it.&nbsp; My laptop has slowed down considerably also.&nbsp; Not sure if it is the new router that I have been supplied with because I have noticed it since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone help me out?</em></p>

            <p>Hi Bones, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens when you&nbsp;access Internet? Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>2. Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer? </p>
<p>3. Is this issue confined to a specific website? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>You may run the network troubleshooter and update the network adapters and see if it helps.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1: </strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are unable to connect to Internet, you may c</span><span><span>heck if the issue persists in Safe Mode with Networking.</span></span></p>

            Is the work address an office 365 address?  This message:
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This email is associated with a personal account in Microsoft as opposed to a work account.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />appears to say that the address is set up as a Microsoft account on the consumer side. You might be able to use it to create a free Teams account on the consumer side, but if you have a business office 365 tenant, you want to create it inside the tenant.  
<br />
<br />If it is set up as a Microsoft account and it is a mailbox on the business side, you should add an outlook.com alias to the Microsoft account and remove the office 365 address. 
<br />
<br />On the second error, is there a mailbox associated with the admin account? If it's used only for logging in, it may not have a mailbox. 
<br />

    <title>Link to specific SharePoint document version for head revision - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenpowley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link to specific SharePoint document version for head revision</h2>
                    
<p>As part of a business process, it is necessary to reference specific versions of files stored in SharePoint. This is fairly trivial for historic versions, but I can't figure out how to do it for the head revision.</p>
<p>I need to create a link to the latest version (head revision) of a changed tracked document that will always link to that specific version. I can do this for historical versions by right-clicking the file link in the Version History and selecting "Copy link
 address" from the context menu. This creates a link with format:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://mycompany.sharepoint.com/QMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mycompany.sharepoint.com/QMS</a><strong>/_vti_history/512</strong>/Knowledge%20Base/Qf4_CorrectiveAndPreventiveActionLog.docx</span></p>
<p>When I do the same for the head revision, the crucial <strong>_vti_history</strong>&nbsp;reference is missing.</p>
<p><a href="https://mycompany.sharepoint.com/QMS/Knowledge%20Base/Qf4_CorrectiveAndPreventiveActionLog.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mycompany.sharepoint.com/.../Qf4_CorrectiveAndPreventiveActionLog.docx</a></p>
<p>So how do my users who need to reference the head revision as a fixed version, rather than the latest version, do that?</p>
<p>Usage example: We are generating requirements for a product based on source documents, which may change over time. It is common to be working with the latest version, but we know there might be updates in future. We need the specific reference in order to
 ensure traceability back to the source as it was at the time of creating the requirement.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>Yes, you‚Äôre correct. If a new version is created, the contents of the canonical path will change. The canonical path will point to the new document version while the previous version of the document is only available with the revision path.</p>
<p>About your requirement to create a link for the head revision, it‚Äôs recommended you follow Rene‚Äôs suggestion to manually create a link for the specific history. Also your computational method and result are correct and you‚Äôre able to get the link as you
 want.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

            MfE only supports one Exchange profile at a time to aid security on the device.<br />
<br />
Yu would need another MfE compatible device to have two different domains active.
