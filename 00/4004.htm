<h2>            Can I see who attended a Teams meeting that just finished&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way for me to see who attended a Teams Meeting that just finished? As in, I'm no longer on the call but I would like to take attendance and verify who did and who didn't call in.

<p>Hi&nbsp;Adam.charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. For your question, if you have correct <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#who-can-see-office-365-reports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
admin permission</a> of your organization, then you can use activity reports for Microsoft Teams to check user activities for a Team meeting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, just a kindly reminder, the activity report will only show how many meetings a user participated in a specific day rather than if the user have attended a meeting in the specific time on the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is only one meeting a user need to attend on the day, you can follow the detailed steps to get the report:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign in <a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Admin Center</a>.</p>
<p>2. Negative to Reports &gt; Usage.</p>
<p>3. Click Select a report &gt; Microsoft Teams &gt; User activity.</p>
<p>4. Then you can check who attended a Team meeting and who didn't. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an article for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-activity-reports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use activity reports for Microsoft Teams</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps. If above method doesn't meet your requirement and you need to check who attended a specific meeting and who didn't, I'd like to suggest you may send us your feature request by submitting a new comment in the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a>.</p>

<h2>            Tabs not working</h2>
                    I set up a new word doc by copying and pasting from another source. I have &nbsp;an 11X17 doc divided into 2 tables, both about 8 X 10 " instead of trying to use columns. This document is a menu for a restaurant and I need the entre prices to line up near the
 right margin. When i set the right tab the cursor doesn't jump to it when i press the tab. It goes to the left margin of the next table. When I highlight the vertical row of numbers (entree prices) and try to align them with the tab indicator it just slides
 over them instead of dragging them together.

                    <p>Hello VBA Guru's</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 30 lines of the same code below doing the same thing with conditional formatting.<br />
I am trying to work through my macro and both streamline and speed it up and I thought by condensing it to maybe just a one statement with all of the search criteria in it.<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Outlook.com exchange clients keep asking for my password despite the right password</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I check my email (say, <code>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</code> ) through Outlook 2013 as well my iOS devices.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Quite frequently (about 10-15 times a day), I'll randomly get the password prompt box on both the Outlook 2013 client or my iphone or my ipad. My password is correct but at times it'll keep prompting me 5-6 times in a row before going away. It's almost like
 a server side outage but I couldn't see any issues on the internet. Internet connectivity of my devices is perfectly fine since every other internet service works when Outlook.com ActiveSync is having a fit and I can easily fire up a browser and login via
 the outlook.com HTML portal.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For Outlook 2013, I added my <code>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</code> through the standard Outlook 2013 wizard - it seemed to pick up the server settings and accepted the password. The server seems to be
<code>blu-m.hotmail.com</code> when I open account properties again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For iOS, I used the default "Outlook.com" option when setting up the email account in the Mail app. I can't see what server it's using since the Mail settings doesn't show me (because I used that standard "Outlook.com" wizard?)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had two factor authentication but have disabled that recently to see if that's the source. It didn't help - this problem continues despite turning off two factor authentication on Outlook.com</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone know what I should look at next? I started having these problems about 3 weeks back and it's becoming unbearable to use Outlook.com now (which sucks because I recently migrated from gmail.com).<br />

            I noticed one correlation. <br />
<br />
When I'm having these problems on Outlook 2013 or iOS (guess any exchange clients), if I log into the Outlook.com website via my browser AFTER this problem starts, then the exchange clients immediately begin to work (with the same password that they were refusing
 just seconds back).<br />
<br />
I recall Microsoft denying exchange logins when I had just started my account a year back; it would force you to log in via the portal to prove that you're not a spam bot.
<br />
<br />
I wonder if this is that same rate limiting feature that's kicking in as a bug. Can any moderators send this to the Outlook.com engineering team for review?<br />

            I chatted with support at <a href="https://answerdesk.support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://answerdesk.support.microsoft.com/<br />
</a><br />
I was asked to turn on "Two step verification" in Account -&gt; Security Info (<a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage</a>)<br />
<br />
Then I was asked to use the app password to plug into my exchange device. It didn't work the first 3-4 times (kept re-prompting me for the password - just like the original problem) but it finally did.
<br />
<br />
Lets see if this works ...<br />

            Ok, it's now solved but the solution from the support helpdesk (turn on two factor authentication + app password) did NOT solve the problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Short version</b><br />
I had in-home IP security cameras that kept failing SMTP logins every minute, so outlook.com would periodically block all other email clients from connecting from my home's IP address (even with the right password).<br />
<br />
<b>Interesting but long story</b><br />
<br />
I had IP security cameras setup to email me on some events. Those were setup to login and send email via SMTP and they were using my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** + an old password. They are essentially "SMTP" clients but since they are fixed to the ceiling and outside,
 "out of sight = out of mind". <br />
<br />
Yesterday, Outlook.com's login page (finally!) hinted that I was having too many wrong logins, so it wanted to verify if I'm a human (usual mangled text image). That was a clue, so I logged onto
<a href="https://account.live.com/Activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Activity</a> and noticed that there was a failed login almost every minute (= 10,000 failed logins per week since who knows when!!). Even more surprising, the source IP address for all logins
 (failed or successful)&nbsp; matched the external IP address of my router. So either someone hacked into my WiFi or was spoofing my IP or my one of my email clients was just nuts.<br />
<br />
I disabled Outlook.com email on my iPad, kept iPhone off my WiFi (only LTE) and kept Outlook 2013 as-is overnight. Still saw the weird failed logins at
<a href="https://account.live.com/Activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Activity</a> so logged to my router (Apple Airport Extreme) to see if I had any suspicious WiFi clients connected. None, but I did notice the WiFi cameras and then it suddenly hit me that
 many months back I had setup SMTP notifications on the security cameras and I had changed my Outlook.com password in the last few weeks but had forgotten to reconfigure the security cameras!<br />
<br />
I reconfiguring the security cameras for the new Outlook.com password (happened to be an application password since I now had two factor authentication) and sure enough, the IP camera sent me an email about the there being a reboot event sometime back. I have
 no idea how long the camera was attempting to send out that email (it was last rebooted a while back) but it had been trying, every minute for quite sometime effectively mounting a DoS attack on the rest of my email clients (by triggering a security response
 on the Outlook.com authentication servers).<br />
<br />
Anyway, now everything works very well and I'm happy that this was my issue an not a Microsoft Outlook.com issue. They've really built a fantastic product because it worked exactly as expected. One suggestion would be to notify the user of 3+ failed logins
 on the next browser login AND putting a link to <a href="https://account.live.com/Activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Activity</a> right below that notice asking them to check.

<h2>            Skype is no longer working on my Lumia 640</h2>
                    <p>Up to 6 months ago my Skype account was working perfectly OK on my MS Lumia 640 XL running Windows 8.1. However it suddenly stopped working, and I was no longer able to login using my MS Live account - I got the error message "You cannot be signed at this
 time - please check your network settings and try later". I later upgraded&nbsp; my Lumia to Windows 10 but the issue remains. I also get the same issue when I launch Skype from my Start Menu on my Windows 10 PC. However if I logon to my Live.com account on my
 PC and select Skype from the dashboard then I can start up Skype with no issues. I have tried to do the same with my Lumia but whenever I logon to my live.com account it only opens up the MS Mail application, and I cannot access the Dash Board to open Skype.
 Has anyone had the same issue and got around it?</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>

<p>Hi Laurie, <br />
<br />
<br />
If you're getting this error message "Sign in unsuccessful, you cannot be signed in at this time. Please check your network settings and try again" when trying to log in to your Microsoft account on the Skype app, it's possible that the app is outdated. To
 get this working back again, we advise you check the OS build version of your device first, and make sure that it's also updated. To check, just go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Phone update &gt; Check for updates</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, check if there's a pending update for the Skype app by going to <strong>
Microsoft Store &gt;</strong> tap the <strong>menu</strong> at the upper left side, then select
<strong>Downloads and updates &gt; Get updates</strong>.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Change Hotmail account to Outlook.com - Lost old SkyDrive account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james-santa barbara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Hotmail account to Outlook.com - Lost old SkyDrive account</h2>
                    <p>How do I sync my old Hotmail 'SkyDrive' account with the Outlook.com account? It has the extra storage space that was given to old Hotmail account users and I claimed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to change my Windows Live ID back to the Hotnail email address? And will my old SkyDrive account still be there? I never cancelled my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't believe Microsoft is going to punish old account users for opening (soon to be) a required email/Windows Outlook.com account; and again this shows the lack of simplicity that Microsoft software and apps still exhibit. It should have been easy to
 find and use the changeover without punishing the user and not being a smart enough piece of software to make this switch a no-brainer.</p>

            <p><strong>With the pointers from other forum posters I found my solution.</strong> And there were none of the delete or cancel account selections involved with some non-Microsoft step-by-steps; less risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Signed out of and cancelled all auto-logins for Windows Live, Windows Messenger; turned off my LastPass auto-logins</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Went to my Windows Live account page and changed the email address&nbsp;connected with my account from
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. outlook.com gear icon now showed a 'Switch back to Hotmail' selection. I chose it but it DID NOT make the switch the first time because an outlook.com&nbsp;feedback dialog box popped up and when I chose 'give feedback' it was unable to load the feedback form?
 And it did not switch to Hotmail? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I clicked on the gear icon again and again selected 'Switch back to Hotmail.' This time I chose 'Skip feedback' and it switched back to Hotmail. Hooray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it switched to Hotmail it also dropped&nbsp;a yellow information bar saying Hotmail had been upgraded and to refresh. I refreshed and it switched to the outlook.com format? I went back to the gear and switched back to Hotmail again. This time I didn't get
 any drop-down information bar and my hotmail was back and my SkyDrive account was back (with 25GB of storage) and thank goodness all my files were there as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft must find a simpler way of linking all accounts to the (Windows Live) ID and should make sure all email accounts linked to that ID are displayed; Hotmail.com, Outlook.com, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Microsoft needs to find a way to transfer the existing SkyDrive account linked to Hotmail.com to the Outlook.com email address so people don't lose their files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone's feedback and help!</p>

            <p>I have not researched if you can turn off all auto-logins but each account in the My LastPass Vault has an auto-login icon (green arrow on something?) and the edit icon (the pen/pencil); both under the Actions column.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on that edit icon to edit each account. There is an auto-logon check-box that needs to be unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you.</p>

<h2>            Problem with the Automatic calculation</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the Excel for long time for tacking finance and doing budeting. &nbsp;In the last two or three days, I have notice that my spreadsheet for the tracking my finance is not doing the automatic calculation for me, I have always make sure to not
 mess with the programing so that it can do all the work for me when I do any changes to the value that I am inputing so that it gives me a running total.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had check my other file to ensure it was not a programing issue but it more of the file issue. &nbsp;How do I get the automatic calulation to work again for the file that I am working on. &nbsp;I dont know what I did to cause the file that I am working on to not
 do an automatic calcution for me, which I have to go to the cell and click enter to get it to the caluation for me where in my other file all I had to do was change a value and it would do it for me automaticly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is very much helpful in resovling my issue with my file to work propertly.</p>

<br />On the right, under workbook Calculations, set that to Automatic

    <title>Cannot Install Windows 10 Tech Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetechguy77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Install Windows 10 Tech Preview</h2>
                    <p>Hello-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I registered for the Windows Insider Program a few days ago, and I have tried many times to install it. Every time I try to install it, I get an error within the Setup window simply saying "Something happened." The caption says that I should try restarting
 Setup and try again. I am running Windows 8.1 and meet the minimum requirements for Windows 10. At first I tried using a virtual link (built-in when you double-click an ISO) and then I used a USB drive. Still no success... I read on another post that completing
 every update, optional or required, but this did not help. Is there anyway I can fix this error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I had similar proplems with WTP installation. &nbsp;I finally was able to install it by wiping the drive with diskpart/clean command. &nbsp;Make sure that you have made an image of your system drive first.

            Try looking for a windows.old directory on your hard disk if you have one it may be stopping the install. I had this same problem when upgrading to 8.1 either delete or rename the directory and see if that works.

<div>I spoke with the Answer Desk yesterday and after troubleshooting, he suggested running an in-place upgrade of windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is my question: Can I remove those files in safe mode, and if so, will they be created after I restart Windows?</div>

<h3> marchhair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia maps on 6303i do not work, maps not on SD card, how do I reinstall them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have really tried to find this out by searching the web but am not getting anywhere - hope someone can help.&nbsp; I have owned a Nokia 6303 and now 6303i; I understand the maps to go with the Ovi Maps app should come on the supplied microSD card.&nbsp; However,
 I do not have this and am using my own, larger one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the very start, the Maps app has never worked for me, I'm not after Sat Nav but just viewing the maps and using them that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open the app, maps do not load or display, instead you can just see a kind of cursor in the middle and the whole area where the map is just a plain beige or some such colour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to use PC Suite and the Nokia website etc to get the presumably missing map files onto my mobile or SD card, but to no avail.&nbsp; There seems no actual map download option on the Nokia maps webpage, so none of the advice given I can actually execite
 - am very confused.&nbsp; Hope someone can help, please...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Maps works fine (albeit rather slow) on the same handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dannie</p>

<p>I can only speak from the view point of 3720 Classic, which was a similar S40 6th Edition (initial release) to your 6303i Classic; upon which regional mapping supplied on 1GB microSD which I immediately copied entire content upon 4GB microSD and Series 40
 Nokia Maps 2.1 contunues to function although have not tried to update or add to existing mapping for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that since Nokia no longer market their own Bluetooth GPS receiver(s), support for devices without integral GPS chip seams to have slowly faded away.</p>

<p>Yes, it's true the support for this phone is poor, not only maps but there also are very few apps available that are any use.&nbsp; It's a shame as I don't want to move to a touchscreen smartphone as I prefer the keypad and see no need for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing back, unfortunately I am still none the wiser as I don't have the card with the maps on and don't know where to get them from - Nokia don't seem to make it easy to contact them, is there a link somewhere where I could email or phone them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot for my 3720 Classic and although I can <strong>add</strong> more maps they haven't been updated for ages now for S40 devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst you can try using "Contact us" on Nokia site for your region, I doubt very much that you will get a sensible answer to such a "specialist request" apart from suggestion to re-install existing device software and before you ask I do not have contact
 to any of the Maps Team either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On models other than S40 just opening the Maps application creates the necessary folder structure in E:\cities which is then recognised by Nokia/Ovi Suite.</p>

<p>Thanks - even though I have Nokia Suite installed, I have never been able to access a screen like the one in the screen shot, which is what seems to be the key problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click on Maps on the like rectangular menu of the Nokia PC Suite, it just takes me to the Nokia Maps website, and when I then follow the link to 'get maps for your phone, it take sme to a part of the Nokia support site, there I am asked to select my
 model, and then told&nbsp; my phone has the maps preinstalled and I'm 'good to go'.&nbsp; Very helpful.&nbsp; No option for the possibilty that someone no longer has the maps, grrrr.</p>

<p>Being inrigued by your issue I just inserted a blank 2GB microSD into my 3720 and formatted it upon device, opened Nokia Maps application and then closed it. This was recognised by Nokia Suite v3.3.49Beta available from Nokia Beta Labs (sign in with Nokia
 ID &amp; password) and was able to downoad maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On looking at memory card via card reader on PC normal folder structure that I would expect has been created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell me whether you in "<strong>diskcache</strong>" you have "CachedatHeader.cdt", "config.cfg" and "ffffffff.cdt" created in addition to 0 - 9 and a - f?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In "<strong>Maploader</strong>" do you have a "<strong>content.xml</strong>" file which just may be critical?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may of course be something stored in phone memory which has allowed me to recover available mapping, which is not present upon yours.</p>

<p>I had this same problem with the same phone. It took me a while to find out that there are two Nokia suits. Nokia PC Suite and Nokia Suite. You need to install Nokia Suite and you will be able to download the maps form there. See the screen dump from the
 previous poster. I donloaded the UK maps from this for my 6303.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            N78 hard reset &#40;format&#41; - certificate error for Nokia TTS</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I have had to bring my phone to factory settings and delete everything but now I am facing some problems with certificates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I could not install Nokia Conversations and Python but Nokia OVI Suit 3.8 has successfully installed on my phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service Control 1.81</p>
<p>Contacts Group DS plugin&nbsp; 1.23</p>
<p>Licence Manage 6.22</p>
<p>Media DS plugin 1.23</p>
<p>Open C LIBSSL Common 1.06</p>
<p>Open C LIBSSL Patch 1.06</p>
<p>Open C LIBZ Support Files 1.06</p>
<p>PIPS Installer v1.06</p>
<p>Signal Server 1.06</p>
<p>SMS DS Plugin 1.15</p>
<p>Symbian OS Pipes Upgrade 1.03</p>
<p>Symbian OS Pipes Upgrade 1.06</p>
<p>Symbian OS STDIOSERVER 1.06</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I could not install Nokia TTS files available at</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/text-to-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/support/text-to-speech/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not try all of the files but</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Text-to-speech_S60_32_voice_en_uk_Ellen.sis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Text-to-speech_S60_32_voice_en_uk_Ellen.sis</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it will fire a certificate problem though phone date and time are correct. Setting the time in 2010 won't help. Online certificate check is turned off and phone is set to install anything though I know it will never install unsigned packages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint crashing adding video or hyperlinks or attempting to run show</h2>
                    <p>I've not had a crash in Powerpoint in ages. &nbsp;Suddenly the deck I am working with&nbsp;</p>
<p>is crashing all the time. &nbsp; It all went south when I tried to insert a video from youtube.</p>
<p>It couldn't find the video by URL, so I tried the imbed code option, using the imbed</p>
<p>code from Youtube. &nbsp;BOOM. . Crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I instead tried to just create hyperlinks for the videos. &nbsp;BOOM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I can save changes. &nbsp;But anything pretty much seems to fail.</p>
<p>I tried to play the slideshow, and you guessed it, BOOM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the info from my event log. &nbsp;I need this to work very soon.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to stop windows from upgrading to build 9926 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jared321  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop windows from upgrading to build 9926</h2>
                    <p>Excuse me for my attitude but build 9926 is compeltely unusable on my Dell XPS 15. Graphics are choppy to the point where I can't even use most of my programs. The fan is constantly on now which never happens. SOmetimes it doesnt even boot and just hangs
 on black screen. My Intel graphics control panel dissapeared and won't come back after reinstalling drivers. The Nvdia update won't install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is do you guys know what you're doing? How do you realease something to people's computers that is so across the board buggy for people?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My third question is how I can I stop windows from reinstalling this build once I rollback to build 9879. Because I'm basically now in a loop of being forced to reinstall 9926 and then rolling back so I can use my computer. It's just crazy to me that this
 is the cutting edge OS in 2015.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry to hear that the installation of Build 9926 did not go well. Windows 10 Technical Preview 2 is still in development stage there might be some issue due to hardware compatibility. For more information refer this link:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Before you install</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq?ocid=tp2_nav_faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq?ocid=tp2_nav_faq</span></a><span>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>You may try these methods and check if it helps. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong><span> You may try updating all the latest device drivers for the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>(Steps also applicable to Windows 10 Technical Preview).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong><span>: You need KB3025379 and KB3025380 to upgrade to Build 9926. After rollback you can hide this updates so that it won’t upgrade to build 9926. You can hide the update, and then Windows Update won't offer it to you
 again unless you choose to restore it.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">I keep being offered an update from Windows that I don't want or I already removed.
</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the list of available updates, right-click any update that you don’t want to see again, and choose Hide Update.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you later change your mind—or if you just want to see a list of the updates you’ve chosen to hide—on the main Windows Update page, click Restore Hidden Updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method&nbsp;3</strong><span> I suggest you&nbsp;download an ISO file and run a fresh installation of the Windows 10 Technical Preview 2, this will avoid bottleneck which is causing the issue. Make sure you backup the important data before installing
 Windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer to the Wiki article: <br />
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_tp-windows_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_tp-windows_install/how-to-10-tips-before-installing-the-latest/4fbec413-fed4-4a18-b1de-399a2d1e2a3a</span></a></strong></p>
<p>

</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>Happened on my Lumia 720, running Lumia Black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you take a Pic, the pic goes and Get saved, but into the Other Cateory. So, it does not appear on camera rolll.</p>
<p>As a consequnece, the Default Camera App closes and return to the Home Screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i use other Camera Apps, the aApps does not close but just that the Pics are not saved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this issue suddenly happened 3 days back . I was using a SD card which was running very normal last 1 year. Now, this problem even happens when the phone is Just runnong with Inbuilt memory and the absence of SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried Soft reset. Have not done a Factory reset as i dont see anyone suggesting that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell me what is the problem and how to fix this?</p>

    <title>Changing color in pivot table from Source Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip vanderwerf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing color in pivot table from Source Data</h2>
                    I am working on a New Pivot Table where I would have to work form the source data constantly. I would like to be able to change colors from the source data cells and the pivot table cells would then automatically change color as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The goal is to show where I made changes from the original data so that it can be easily tracked from the pivot table.<br />
<br />
Is there something I can do to make this possible or would I have to take a different route?&nbsp;

<p>AFIK PT do not pick up much in the way of format information from the data source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can think of to do that is by adding one or more fields to track the row last changed date. The question is, how much detail do you want to keep.&nbsp; You can set PowerQuery to filter to keep only the newest version of a row.<br />

    <title>How do I remove the graded background colours in Skype IM chats&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous cowherd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the graded background colours in Skype IM chats&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using web skype for a while as it works. The colour scheme in chats in web skype is pale blues for backgrounds with black text. I find this easy enough to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's encounter with Skypeforlinux&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)"> v 8.17.0.2 was a bit of a surprise. While
 my chats appear with a light grey background and black text, which I find quite readable, replies from contacts seem to have graded colours such as blue and orange backgrounds with WHITE text. I find it much harder to read these IM's due to the colour combinations.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">Is there any way to remove the coloured back grounds such that ALL IMs from all
 contacts use the light grey background/black text combination?</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid to say, we do not have the option to change or remove the chat color background from your contacts as these are their preferences.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only change the chat color background from your end, but not theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your feedback with regards to this issue and have this duly noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further concerns.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, I assumed that that was the case. Until I have the option of configuring the colours on my personal copy of Skype for Linux on my own computer, the way
<em><strong>I </strong></em>want them then I will not be using Skype for Linux. Neither will my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd liked to have been a fly on the wall at the Skype product development meeting where people decided that being able to make your IMs unreadable for all of your contacts was a "must have" feature. I assume that legal was not part of the decision as I am
 sure they would have considered the possibility of lawsuits from organisations representing people with visual disabilities. But then again, that is assuming that the US of A has laws governing the design of websites and software to ensure people with disabilities
 can use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit : I will start up Skype for Linux every month or so to see if the devs have been able to add colour configuration for IMs that can override your contacts' unfortunate colour choices.</p>

<h3> astro46  say:</h3>
<h2>            stop automatic hyperlinks in notes field</h2>
                    
<p>first, i am using outlook 2007. i have office 2010 installed except for outlook 2010, and have word 2007 installed only for editing purposes in outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't want outlook turning email and web addresses into hyperlinks when i put them in the contact notes field. i right click and remove the hyperlink, yet when i reopen the contact, they have been converted again.</p>
<p>web search led me to unchecking "convert to hyperlink" in "while you are typing" in outlook, in word 2010 (in two places, autoformat and format as you type) and in word 2007 in 2 places . didnt' make any difference.</p>
<p>this is really frustrating. is it not possible to keep outlook from converting to hyperlinks in contact note fields?</p>

            nevermind. i went into outlook and unckecked the autoformat for hyperlinks (or perhaps i missed it the first time around) in addition to autoformat as you type.&nbsp; it now seems to be working..
