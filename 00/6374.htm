<h2>            Seagate D3 External USB 3.0 HD Causes BSOD</h2>
                    Just like the title says, my Seagate D3 External Hard Drive causes a BSOD when I plug it in. 9926 worked just fine but any version newer causes an instant crash. Any thoughts?

<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us with your question, we’re happy to help!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blocking certain IP addresses from seeing your ad via the Bing Ads UI is a&nbsp;process that can be achieved by following the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Click Campaigns located along the top of the page. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the Campaigns tab located in the middle of the page. </span></li><li>
<span>Select the checkbox next to the campaigns where you want to add the exclusion.</span></li><li>
<span>Click Edit, and then click Other changes. </span></li><li>
<span>In the Campaign settings list, select IP address exclusions. </span></li><li>
<span>In the IP address exclusions box, enter the IP addresses that you want to be blocked from seeing your ads. Enter one IP address per line. You can also add a range of addresses using a wildcard character (*).
</span></li><li>
<span>After you are done making your changes, click Apply.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please keep in mind that when blocking IP addresses, it must be done at the campaign level in order for it to be effective. You may also only exclude 100 IP addresses per campaign and they must be
 IPv4 addresses. You can check out our Bing Ads </span><a href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51041/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to prevent your ad from showing to certain people help article</span></a><span>
 for more information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing as this issue sounds as though it may be account specific, I would like to take a closer look into your account to determine the cause of these IP addresses still seeing and being able to click
 on your Ad. I have sent you a private message on how to proceed. Please check your private messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Cortana vs &#34;OK google&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> softwareuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana vs &#34;OK google&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some observations from 10041.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to get 10049 update but no luck so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried the phrase "Play Aerosmith Walk This Way" on both Cortana and "OK google" - whatever they call their assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Toshiba tablet for Windows Cortana and Samsung
 GS5 for other.&nbsp; On "OK google", it brings me to the 1975 version of the song and plays it&nbsp; (video of record).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Cortana, it opens a new tab in IE searches and brings me to the Run-DMC version of "Walk this Way".&nbsp; While it is a fine video in its own right
 and a milestone of bringing rap-rock together in mainstream,&nbsp; I'd have to say I prefer if it would show "Walk this way" as the original.&nbsp; And I would like it to just play it, without requiring yet another touch&nbsp; (should be hands-free).&nbsp;&nbsp; Just bringing page
 up requires me to divert my attention to now see what was found and click it.</p>
<p>My other observation was that Cortana is a bit impatient.&nbsp; If I hit mic, I have a few moments to ask something if not, I get a "sound" and I have to hit again.&nbsp; "OK google" waits much longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like Cortana to always listen, possibly even wake-on-voice-command.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Wake-on-voice-command seems a critical for a hands on experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this may require more power, but for my applications power back up is present for the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For wall mounted tablets, it would be very useful to just be able to ask a question and get a verbal response.&nbsp; That seems to work well with math (Hey, Cortana what is the square root of 122, what is the weather?).&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like the search based answers
 that open up a new tab in IE for each question.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it would be nice if Cortana read the find like Narrator would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for reading.&nbsp; It's a great product, just needs some more tweaking.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SU</p>

            <p>Microsoft needs to better the competition, not just provide an "almost as good" me-too experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google search is better than Bing, even though Bing shows pretty pictures in its results and it may look nicer at first glance, but if you're really looking for INFORMATION Google wins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Now (OK Google) is better than Cortana - sure Cortana is a work in progress, but so is everything that Google does. &nbsp;Today's technology is an ever-moving target. &nbsp;You can't play catch-up because you will always be behind. &nbsp;You need to leapfrog. &nbsp;Cortana
 needs to <strong>deliver</strong> that which Google can't or won't.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update 14342 did not work. Also 14332 did not work Back to 14295.1005</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a total of now 18 attempts for 14332 I had hopes that 14342 would correct the faults in 14295 but 14342 failed like 14332.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a HP Pavilion RAM 8.00Gb with AMD A8-4555M APU. 62 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC/Scannow does not work as it says Windows resource Protection could not start the repair service. I checked with Task Manager all are switched on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth done that and all is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noticed that Windows constantly changes my LAN settings from Automatic to Proxy, which I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Box computers I built myself running Windows 10 but 32bit which have accepted Upgrade to 14342 today with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Microsoft what is the answer.</p>

 everything &nbsp;&amp; 'dirty update' install like you would do within WU .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need the <strong>ESD decrypter .zip file</strong>, &nbsp;put both files in a named folder after extracting the .zip file to same &amp; execute the CMD &nbsp;button @ extracted .zip file (choose option 1) and it will decrypt the new preview build ESD &nbsp;into an
 ISO to the same folder .</p>

</p><p><strong>Note you must copy the ESD preview biuld installer file soon after The WU download or before a&nbsp;restart/&nbsp;install&nbsp;execution (what I do. ) &nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
The ESD will vanish of it's own accord at some point after the restart/install option is executed or otherwise .<br />
<br />
The ESD &amp; decrypt .zip are &nbsp;always good to have you never know when U will need them. &nbsp; I keep about 3 recent and decent test builds in named folders outside of the preview biuld OS and delete older ones .

            <p>TBH at this point of your difficulties &nbsp;if you can't do a simple<strong> clean install</strong> from the WU ESD as outlined above to see if that helps perhaps you shouldnt be using a beta OS anyway ☺</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;:</span></span></p>
<strong>Having easy updates previously and suddenly a problem is not unheard of with &nbsp;these preview builds been there &amp; done all that more than once &amp; recently .</strong><br />
<p>
</p><p>What it is , barring HDWE or configuration problems, driver or software conflicts
<strong>* ^^^ all that*</strong> is your most likely solution especially if you've just been casually rolling in new preview builds via windows update . ☺</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OTOH 14332.rs1 ISO&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;preview build is available to download now @ MS so that makes it all (a little) &nbsp;more simple if you want to get that build and either way &nbsp;you get a fresh start and all that will probably enable you for a currently staged
 WU 14342.rs1 &nbsp;x64 download &nbsp;without all the drama anyway.</p>

            <p>You can help get answers by describing your problem in detail, such as the point at which your attempted installations failed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: In build 14332, there were a few isolated instances in which it mistakenly saw some items of hardware as incompatible, so aborted the installation. Those failures happened at the end of "installing features and drivers", and in those cases, doing
 a clean install, rather than upgrade, didn't help. The failure still occurred at the same point, because the issue was with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install, of course, will get rid of corrupted files that may cause upgrade failures, and is highly recommended periodically, to help insure that reported operational problems are not simply due to corrupted files from the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, too, some have refused to cleanly uninstall their favorite 3rd party security program, thereby causing failures due to files remaining after a "normal" uninstallation. Some have only disabled theirs, rather than uninstalling, not realizing that it
 is re-enabled upon rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are just some of the reasons that knowing what you have, and what you have done, makes it more likely that we can help you.</p>

            <p><strong>FWIW 14332.rs1</strong> saw my Windows 7 x64 discrete sound card as incompatible ( in Sound card /audio troubleshooter diag ) unlike earlier preview builds and would not find an updated driver but it proceeded with the OS installation normally &nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it worked fine but only with very basic Windows controls &nbsp;&amp; no custom features ,all the custom features,effects, &nbsp;controls ,mixer, level &amp; EQ features and &nbsp;the proprietary GUI application &nbsp;would not &nbsp;not load at all .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an updated windows 10 driver at Asus sat. after my clean install that was a very recent addition to thier driver &nbsp;repository it all works fine and loads in an instant now rather than the prolonged loading times before when it worked in Windows 10
 and it's all more stable now ☺</p>

            My problem is similar. &nbsp;It was Phishing scam-mail, but using a major online provider's name, logo, etc. &nbsp;Very convincing, except for very small clues that alerted me to not click on links. &nbsp;Now I need it (at provider's request) so that they can track back
 the links. &nbsp;It is not in the Deleted Items folder and no-where else in my account that I can see. &nbsp;Can Hotmail please provide some sort of answer to this problem? &nbsp;Preferably sooner ... as I want the scammers to be tracked down before they do any damage!

<p>When I search for anything in my emails using the search bar in the top right of the screen - it brings up nothing... Ever. It's set to search the folder I'm searching in but reveals absolutely nothing. It's obviously a really important feature (for me at
 least) - and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong...</p>

<p>Please please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks, I'll take a look at this answer . Is this response relevant even though I'm using office 365 (not outlook)? It's a fresh install so can't imagine it being set up wrong. Am I correct to assume the search should still work on imap email?</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>It is more likely to be a client (Outlook for Mac) feature. But, it should work with IMAP account as neither the above KB tells to be related to the account kind nor do I find any article/blog regarding this.

<p>If you need any further assistance, please feel free to let us know.</p>

<h2>            E71 Not on List of Supported Phones&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am trying to use the Youtube client on my unlocked E71 (on AT&amp;T network).<br />
<br />
Tried to download as instructed by using browser and going to <a href="http://m.youtube.com/app." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://m.youtube.com/app.</a><br />
<br />
However, I get a message that says that my phone is not on the list of supported devices.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

You could always get a supported phone model, instead. ;)<br />

            How about these then:<br />
<br />
Download it with a supported phone model, and then take the installation file and try installing it on your phone.<br />
<br />
Try to locate the installation file through some other site/link where it is accessible without checking what device/browser is trying to install it.<br />
<br />
Download it to a PC using a browser like FireFox where you can change the user-agent to one that a supported phone has, and then download the installer.

            Makes sense. Trick is to find someone that will download it for me, so will use it as a last resort.<br />
<br />
My 30min search on the internet could not find an alternative site to download the application, but will keep trying.<br />
<br />
Some great ideas, but but I'm hoping the solution is easier than that. Phone settings, etc.?

            No phone settings that can help. The web site is probably using the HTTP_USER-AGENT header string to detect whether the device is supported or not. The E71 browser does not allow for editing the user-agent string. With Firefox on a PC you can.

<br />
I tried Mobitubia, but some videos kept crashing.<br />

<h2>            Cumulative cost-time curve &#40;axis format&#41; - Project 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm relatively new to Microsoft Project and I'm using the 2007 version.</p>
<p>I have produced a project, entered tasks (and dependencies), resources and costs.</p>
<p>I've been asked to produce a cumulative cost-time curve for the project.</p>
<p>I've used the 'Visual Reports' option and modified one of the existing templates to only show the cumulative costs (the project is still only in the planning stage).&nbsp; The problem is the x-axis scale (Time) only has five categories (Quarter1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and
 Q5).&nbsp; I was hoping to have this broken down into smaller increments (weeks).</p>
<p>I've tried to change it the way I usually do it in Excel (Right click and format axis) however I can't seem to make it change.</p>
<p>Can anyone please help?</p>
<p>I also looked into exporting the information into Excel and producing the graph that way but I got very confused and didn't really achieve anything.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Astoria Boro</p>

<p>I think I may have sorted it out.</p>
<p>I produced a new template for just the cost information.&nbsp; I change the drop-down menu to weeks like you recommended.</p>
<p>The graph still appeared with 'Q' labels on the x-axis so I right clicked on the axis and went into the 'Expand/collapse' option and made sure the 'Weeks' option was ticked and I turned off the 'Quarters' option.&nbsp; I then went into the 'Show properties in
 tooltips' option and expanded until it showed the weeks.</p>
<p>The only thing I would want to change is the week numbers (they are currently shown according to the yearly week numbers and not the project week numbers) however, I'm happy to have got to this stage.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

    <title>outlook 2010 open specfic folder macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianguk  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 open specfic folder macro</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
On old Outlook I was able to select Choose Form and then set a path to open when clicked.&nbsp; I had this set to open a folder containing a list of templates I use.<br />
I understand you can not do this on Outlook 2010, but you can if you create a macro?<br />
<br />
I am able to create a macro to open a file within the folder, but I am not able to open a folder to display the list to pick from?<br />
<br />
I am totally new to this so if someone is able to simply post what I need to run that would be great.<br />
<br />
This is as far as I have got:<br />
<br />
<span>Sub MyTemplate()<br />
<span>Sub MyTemplate()<br />
Set msg = Application.CreateItemFromTemplate("C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\MyTemplate.oft")<br />
msg.Display<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Ian<br />

<p>No need for any macro at all...</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Yes I had sort of done that, but I was just hoping to be able to click on Choose Form (after adding it to the Ribbon) and it opened my folder with my templates in.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help though.<br />

            <p>I am looking for the same thing.&nbsp; I want something with just one or two steps because we will have multiple email templates.&nbsp; The "New Items-More Items-Choose Form and in the Look in box drop down to User templates in File System" steps are way too many
 for my employees to deal with.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to do a marco below but I got an error message saying either the file is not there anymore or I do not have permission to the file.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I could tell, there was no restricting permission access to the file so I am not sure what was the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did change the &lt;username&gt; to my computer's name. :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Sub MyTemplate()<br />
Set msg = Application.CreateItemFromTemplate("C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates\MyTemplate.oft")<br />
msg.Display<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I want to place the marco on the Ribbon when I get it to work. I know how to do that, just need to get the marco to work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Over the past couple of weeks I've seen a huge (over 60%) increase in impressions from "Syndicated Search Partners" for my Shopping Campaigns. I haven't made any changes which would cause this. Has anyone else seen this? I was wondering if Bing have made

<h2>            Saving Contacts to Micro SD</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the problem of double and triple copies of media files on my Nokia Lumia 520. Apperently this is a known bug which Micr$oft have failed to fix.</p>
<p>I order to fix this problem I had to reset my phone to default factory settings. I have been trying to save my contacts on the micro sd card using the Nokia app Transfer my Data. It shows that it is doing the saveing. However nothing is saved on the sd card.
 If I remember correctly It has been working in the past. What can I do please ?</p>

    <title>how can I auto update milestones with predecessor completions from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken san diego  say:</h3>
<h2>            how can I auto update milestones with predecessor completions from other tasks</h2>
                    <p>I have a Home Construction calendar.</p>
<p>there are tasks that repeat for each room, like paint, tile, etc.</p>
<p>I currently have the rooms as the summary task&nbsp; with all the tasks that need to complete that room</p>
<p>I can see percent complete on the room at the summry level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a milestone summary&nbsp;that has all the milestones of the repeating operations.&nbsp;this is so I can tell how far along Paint is or Tile across the entire project..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to have the&nbsp;Milestone auto update as they are marked&nbsp;complete in the room summary area,&nbsp; the milestone&nbsp; will then show a percent complete of all the tasks assigned to that milestone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if there were 30 paint room tasks assigned to "paint complete" &nbsp;task milestone, when 15 were marked completed the milestone would show 50% done.

            Ken,
<div>Well you might be able to do it using Paste Links, depending on your hierarchal structure, &nbsp;but I don't recommend it. The use of paste links quite often leads to file corruption, and that's a problem you don't need.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other option is though a VBA macro. You would update the individual task milestones and then run the macro to calculate the value for the project summary milestone, which by the way would need to be an extra field (e.g. Text1), because the summary
 level values are calculated by Project and cannot generally be manually changed by the user.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand what you are trying to do but just for reference, a true milestone is either done or not done, there is no partial complete on a milestone. I suggest you change the summary "milestone" to a regular task since it is in fact a series of steps
 (i.e. milestones).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I agree with John, milestones are the changing of a condition and are one instant in time.&nbsp; I think there may be another way to accomplish what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a spare text field such as Text1, you can label each task as to which "effort type" it belongs to such as Carpentry, Painting, Electrical.&nbsp; You can then use the custom grouping features (In 2010 that is on the View Tab, in the Data group.... look for
 "Group By..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can Group By the Text1 column and then you will change your display from grouped by "Room" to grouped by "Effort Type".&nbsp; You can undo this arrangement by selecting Group By ... no group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens is you will now have "summary tasks" that are for Painting, Electrical, etc.&nbsp; The %Complete should roll up correctly weighted for the tasks beneath it.&nbsp; If it does not, I use this trick:&nbsp; In a spare number field (Number1) set a formula in that
 field as =[Percent Complete] and then it should roll up fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office 365 login prompt&#47; window keeps popping up in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernds88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 login prompt&#47; window keeps popping up in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Dear support team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>at work we recently got Office 365 accounts with Office 2013 as the local software suite (at least that's how I understand it? 2013, 2016, .. local; 365 online account w/ apps for browser, cloud for data, etc., correct?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite happy to finally have the new Office at work. Since I always tend to update every piece of software I work with, I couldn't resist upgrading to 2016 (there was that button in my Outlook I think... ;-) ). For a few weeks now, the window to log into
 Office 365 pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made some screenshots and since I don't know how to put pictures in here, here's a Dropbox Link:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n20uo2r0z0afryy/AADDNkbXQj6Ez7qe4SDZMSDLa?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's the problem which I some can't manage to solve on my own:</p>
<p>The login window appears all of the sudden and seems to not really go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I do:</p>
<p>- I put my email address into the first field (see picture 1)</p>
<p>- the moment I tab to the password field or click it, the domain of my email is recognized (see picture 2) and I'm being forwarded to 'my company's login page'</p>
<p>- then, one of the two following happens:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a) I'm logged in and everything is fine</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;b) I see a progress bar (looking like the forefront login page I know from accessing company intranet without VPN), the window then closes and pops up again, just as if I never logged in just before</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my workaround in case of b) (because b sometimes happens 100 times in a row): I 'x' the window. Sometimes it pops up one or two more times, I just 'x' it and then Outlook seems to be fine.</p>
<p>But then, sometime later, not triggered by anything manual, the window pops up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more information:</p>
<p>- For my outlook exchange to connect, I need to be connected to VPN (sometimes the 365 window comes when I'm not in VPN, sometimes it comes when I am - but as I understand it, the exchange is not really interlinked with the office 365 account login, is that
 right?)</p>
<p>- A while ago I created a microsoft account (private) with my company email address. I think this might be one of the root causes (having two accounts for 365 with the same mail address) but meanwhile I changed the email address in that private 365 account
 to another one and deleted the company mail address (so it should be solved, right?)</p>
<p>- just for the record - I have admin rights on my company computer so I can perform anything you might come up with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried so far:</p>
<p>- I emptied the credentials manager</p>
<p>- I renamed the folder&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">System C </span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">à</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">

<p>- I created a new mail profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT support says I should delete 2016 and use 2013 instead (as they only support 2013...) which I'd rather not do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone of you have any idea of how to get rid of that annoying login window?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Mouran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your detailed list of possible root causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have time yet but it seems that I found the reason for the problem. It was a "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Shared calendar" from a client Sharepoint that I connected to my Outlook using another Outlook account (created by
 my client's IT department).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank god I found it. Since I just deleted it, I can just assume that this should've been the problem. If it wasn't I'll get back to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also I'd like to apologize for my long response time. I'm quite busy at work and I wasn't able to go through your list and answer quicker.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Again, thank you all very very much for your help!</span></p>

<h2>            Double space when pressing enter</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft Word 2016 for Mac, and I dont seem to be able to find the option to change the double space thing when I press 'enter'.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The paragraph style you are using probably has the double space attribute set. You can fix it on a paragraph by paragraph basis by clicking, from the Menu Bar, Format &gt; Paragraph and then correcting it from the Paragraph dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4b620f6-d180-4358-9b04-f53fbda69b4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4b620f6-d180-4358-9b04-f53fbda69b4b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you'll have to keep doing that for all paragraphs in your document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The better approach is to modify the Style you are using. If you need help with that let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps<br />
</p>

<h2>            office for mac 2011 14.3.6 update failed &#40;suspect malware or trojan 14.6.3&#41;</h2>
                    This started after starting Microsoft Word, and then I was prompted to update office to "14.6.3" and that is right, 14.6.3, which doesn't exist. This happened more than once, so I did some digging, and could not find anything about a 14.6.3 update, so
 I suspect malware.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Office 2011 for Mac 14.3.5 installed, and saw that 14.3.6 is the latest update, so I downloaded it separately, mounted the dmg image, and tried installation, which failed. I booted into safe mode and tried again, and it failed. I renamed /Library/Automator
 to Automator_old, and it still failed. Below is the log from the latest attempt, errors and progress only. If you want the entire log, I have that too.</div>

            I had a similar issue. &nbsp;The cause was that my /tmp directory was too small. &nbsp;I had previously created a RAMDisk for the /tmp directory that was limited to 256MB. &nbsp;Increasing the size of /tmp solved the issue.

    <title>Powerpoint images &#34;washed out&#34; on projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjmode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint images &#34;washed out&#34; on projector</h2>
                    <p>I have a Powerpoint presentation including a number of images of old maps. The maps were scanned at very high resolution, creating very large files. In order to avoid creating a huge Powerpoint file, I've reduced the images; for example, I reduced a 25mb
 image that was about 9000 x 6000 pixels at 300 ppi, to an image of about 1.5mb of 1800 x 1200 pixels at 150 ppi. I've done all this on an iMac with a 27 inch screen, running a fully updated version of Powerpoint for Mac 2011. The reduced images look terrific
 when I run the Powerpoint slide show on my iMac (or a similar iMac belonging to my wife).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I run the presentation on a standard projector, many of the images look dramatically "washed out," very flat with little contrast or vibrance. The first time this happened, I thought it was a problem with the projector. But I made a second
 presentation yesterday on a much newer projector at a museum, and had exactly the same result. Any idea what could be causing this? Could this be caused by my reducing the size and ppi? (The literature says that at 1800 x 1200 pixels and 150 ppi this should
 not be happening.) I have not yet experimented with running the original jpegs as a slideshow on a projector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One further thought. Before reducing the size, I adjusted the colors on each of these images using Apple Preview &gt; Adjust Color (not Photoshop). Could that be creating a problem that does not show on the iMac monitor but does show on the projector screen?</p>
<p>

            <p>I don't think this is an effect of the high resolution. There are many things that can cause a washed out appearance. Projectors are inherently less contrasty than monitors. Ambient light in the projection area is bad, but there's not much you can do about
 it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Photoshop, I use the Levels command a lot because it displays a histogram of the light values in the scan. I can then slide the highlight and shadow sliders to meet the lightest and darkest points on the histogram and that gives me a picture with maximum
 dynamic range. It makes your whites whiter!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also nothing wrong with opening Hue/Saturation in Photoshop and bumping up saturation by 10% or so, it compensates for vivid colors lost during scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For older maps that have fewer color values, consider converting them to indexed color. In the Indexed Color dialog, set the Palette to Local (Perceptual) or Local (Adaptive) and Colors to 256. I usually turn off dithering. Indexed color will give you comparatively
 tiny file sizes with very little loss of image fidelity, when the original is close to monochromatic.</p>

            While I did download that latest version I think I will hold off on installation as I'm planning to pickup a larger hard drive,&nbsp;I have 3 operating systems on here with only a 320 gig hd.

<h2>            Excel Maps Chart Missing</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 E1 licence at my company and use version 1902 (build 11328.20146) of excel. For some reason the Maps chart is not available in Excel. I've tried to download example charts and receive error to say version is not compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Maps charts no longer available for later versions? 3D maps is available but this isn't as quick and easy to use to does not provide the same functionality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>According to your description, you are using Office 365 E1 license.</p>
<p>Office 365 E1 subscription is not include Office applications, you can check it via the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get the latest advanced features with Office 365</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can use Excel, I need to confirm which account did you activate Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I need to confirm the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. The screenshot of Product Information. (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85547e3d-056d-48b5-ba5e-74947ecfc070?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85547e3d-056d-48b5-ba5e-74947ecfc070?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. The screenshot of <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>3. Can you use the feature “Map Chat” before, did the issue occur after updating Office?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Welcome to the Nokia discussion boards!<br />
<br />
It might be worth you trying to do the following resets:<br />
<br />
Soft Reset:<br />
Enter into your keypad *#7780# and when prompted, enter the default passcode 12345. If you have changed the code, it will be the code you changed it to.<br />
A backup will not be needed as this will not delete any data.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Also, have you tried to download the Store QML from&nbsp;<a href="http://info.publish.nokia.com/?p=1936&amp;cat_id=55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if that works for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Sorry <strong><font color="#FF9900">haZey</font></strong>, this is probably a typo. error upon your part "<em>Store QML client is available for all devices running Symbian^3, Symbian Anna, or Symbian Belle software</em>"</p>
