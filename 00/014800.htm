<h2>            Error Code 80048830 on Lumia640XL</h2>
                    This E/C has recently started every time I access my Gmail account. This error does not happen with my other account. I note there has been a lot of suggestions in the past but no solution seems to have been really successful as far as I can can see,&nbsp;

<h2>            hotmail won&#39;t send my messages</h2>
                    <p>December 9, 2018</p>
<p>I have had a Hotmail.com account for years, and have liked it.&nbsp; But for the last two weeks: PROBLEM.&nbsp; I still receive emails OK, but can no longer send emails out.&nbsp; Every time I try, even to addresses which I know are good, I get back a near-instant red-triangle-with-exclamation-mark-inside
 message which says "Unable to send this message.&nbsp; Try again later".&nbsp; But it never works, sooner, later, or at all.&nbsp; Does anyone have a similar problem, and what is the solution?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; -- tom from utah</p>

            Dear Tom,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You posted your question in Outlook.com forum, so I assume you have problems with receiving emails to your Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />You can find lots of suggestions for sending and receiving issues and fixes in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-outlook-com-email-sync-issues-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-ou...</a>
<br />
<br />Also, If you are using Microsoft Account please try to verify your account here <a href="http://account.live.com/reputationcheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com/reputationcheck</a> Verification is needed in case your emaiol address was marked as spam too many times.
<br />
<br />Please share the results.

<p>Dear LA,</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I appreciate your interest.&nbsp; 1) I have not done a "reputation check".&nbsp; I don't know if I have a "Microsoft Account".&nbsp; I don't know if I have an account at all.&nbsp; 2) I guess I could try the site you have given to be able to take a screenshot, but
 I'm not sure if I want to bother.&nbsp; I basically hate computers.&nbsp; If they work I use them.&nbsp; If they don't I don't think more than once about why not, or how to fix them.&nbsp; 3) I have two other email services, and I am basically transferring my communication over
 to those other two.&nbsp; Actually I have gone back to communicating with my real friends through letters written on paper with ink put inside envelopes that have a street address on them with a stamp on the upper right-hand corner.&nbsp; I don't like the "instant"
 communication which email provides.&nbsp; The world is already too Speedy.&nbsp; -- tom</p>

            Dear Tom,
<br />
<br />I understand your frustration, however please note that I am a user like yourself trying to help with this situation.
<br />
<br />1. If you have Microsoft account, you will be able to login here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail</a> , if yes then you can do reputation check, if you account is not Microsoft account you should contact original mail provider. In majority cases the domain will give you a hint, for example @google,com is Google domain, so it would be Google account
<br />2. This is up to you, if you do not want to.
<br />3. If you have other means of communication it is good.
<br />
<br />I am also pleased to hear that you found alternative solution
<br />"Actually I have gone back to communicating with my real friends through letters written on paper with ink put inside envelopes that have a street address on them with a stamp on the upper right-hand corner. "
<br />
<br />Let me know if you would like to proceed. If not than have a nice day!

            Hello KathleenMurray2,
<br />
<br />i am an independent advisor willing to help you.
<br />
<br />where are your emails arriving, are they in deleted items?
<br />Do you have the account configured in a mobile device or outlook client.?
<br />
<br />If emails are in junk, I would suggest to remove the email configuration for your mobile (for almost one day to test) and check the junk settings:
<br />Click Home &gt; Junk &gt; Junk Email Options.
<br /> And share with me a screen with the option selected.
<br />
<br />
<br />If not check in outlook web what are the rules that are activated, you can disable rules to check the email behavior.
<br />Also you must check if you are working with allow senders option, if you have list of senders to allow or block, check if someone allowed can send you without go to junk folder and send to you an email from an address not listed.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have further questions.       
        </p>

<p>Unfortunately I am not understanding the remedies I've read.&nbsp; I have no one to help me fix the issue; I suppose I just am not a technical person.&nbsp; I have no mail coming into the inbox; I only receive the usual junk mail.&nbsp; This has been since last week.&nbsp;
 I surely wish I could receive the mail I've been missing.</p>

            Just open both documents in Word, then use <strong>View&gt;Arrange All</strong> to make them both visible on- the same monitor. Word's default arrangement is one window above the other, but with a couple of mouse moves they can appear side-by-side.

</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the primary Email Account that is connected to your phone during the first setup? If that's the case, there is no other way to delete your Email Account but to reset the phone.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to back up all your files to avoid data loss when you want to perform the reset process.

<h2>            conditional formatting if cell is blank and others are not</h2>
                    <p>I have conditional formatting on a column to highlight cells that are over 4 months old, this works!&nbsp; However, I have cells in that column that are blank, and I'm trying to not make those turn yellow...I've tried all of the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;=" "</p>
<p>ISBLANK</p>
<p>NULL</p>
<p>&lt;BLANK&gt;</p>
<p>but not sure if it's not working because I already have the first CF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so this is what I did, selected the column, Conditional Formatting &gt; Format&nbsp;only cells that contain &gt;&nbsp;Cell Value less than =today()-120 .... I think I need to add another condition to not highlight the cells that are blank...Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am trying to make a group of email on Office 365 so the recipients don't know who I am sending too. But, in exchange you can create groups instead and then its easy to double click and see who is inside the group in outlook 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have any solution to hide the address? not using bcc function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi WanAdnan,</p>
<p>Based on your description, do you mean to hide the distribution group email address from the recipients without using Bcc function?</p>
<p>If yes, please note that it is not feasible to do that in Office 365. Using the Bcc function is the only solution currently.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we have more options to hide the address in Office 365. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>

<p>thanks.</p>
<p>i think have the other solution. you can refer below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>step 1. login your office 365</p>
<p>step 2. go to admin function</p>
<p>step 3. click exchange</p>
<p>step 4. click groups</p>
<p>step 5. choose group and double click</p>
<p>step 6 . go to general and tick the "hide this group from address lists"</p>

<p>No that does not work. Not for this particular problem. Here is better explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a sales report that needs to show this year sales, last year sales and percent difference. It is constantly being updated based on when each manufacture sends us their report and the sales are always show the first of the month, so
 daily sales dates are no concern. The first issue I was able to resolve as far as not calculating months I don't have data for, however sometimes there are blanks in months that are already closed so I need it to treat those a zero's not blanks. And if there
 are zero sales for this year it won't count last years because it shows blank. I don't know how Dax can distinguish the difference if they are all blank. Is there a Dax formula for that, do I need to tell it to fill blanks in with zeros, but not for months
 that I don't want it to? I am sure this is a common problem but I cannot not find anything anywhere to correct it. I have taken many courses and read some books on Dax, but I cannot wrap my head around this one. It would be nice if the data already had zeros
 for the closed out blanks. :( Any help would be truly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>If you would prefer to use Outlook.com in a web browser and remove your local storage, you can do this easily using Outlook Profile Manager to delete your local profiles. Deleting your profile will completely erase all of your Outlook content locally including
 email, contacts, tasks, and calendar.</p>

Perhaps I should interpret your answer to mean, I can't retain my existing O365 Home account if I want to use the HUP? i.e. A HUP account needs to be associated with my work email perhaps?
<br />
<br />
I am hoping that this is just a billing change, and won't affect my existing subscription at all. Am I wrong?
<br />
&gt;&gt; <br />
Yes, if you have the HUP Office 365 subscription, it is just a billing change.&nbsp; And no, it does not need to be linked to your work address. Use the same address you use for your current subscription.&nbsp;

<p>With the new HUP program offering the office 365 subscription discount, you redeem the HUP key in your microsoft account and it extends your Home subscription.

</p><p>Can I take advantage of the Home Use Program offer if I already have Office 365 Home or Office 365 Personal?</p>
<p>Yes. If you already have Office 365 Home or Office 365 Personal, you can still take advantage of this discount. Once you purchase, additional time is added to your existing subscription, and the discounted rate will begin at your existing subscriptionâ€™s
 annual renewal date. Be sure to specify the Microsoft account thatâ€™s associated with your current Office 365 subscription during the purchase process.</p>

<h2>            Email display name is incorrect</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I can't get my email display name to show up correctly. I originally set up the email account with my first and last name (e.g. first name A and last name B). I then went and changed the name to what I want displayed when people receive my email (e.g. first
 name C and last name D) in all settings that I could find. In email, when I click on my profile it correctly shows C and D. However, when I send an email everyone receives it with display name being A and B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What/where do I need to change to have my outgoing email's display name? This is very frustrating...</p>

    <title>local forest rename and how will it affect O365 Synchronization - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            local forest rename and how will it affect O365 Synchronization</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company just changed its name from example to fabrikat, accordingly i have added and verified a new cloud domain fabrikat.com</p>
<p>also, changed the UPN suffix for all users from example.com to fabrikat.com, and made the Primary SMTP as fabrikat.com,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in short i only changed the UPN suffix for users to the new name, and did not perform domain rename as it is considered a high risk procedure,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the problem now is that the old domain name is still visible for users while logging in " example\ ", and my company wants to eliminate all traces to the old name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">how will renaming the local forest affect O365 Synchronization?&nbsp;</span></strong> will it stop syncing? will it work? what are the possible scenarios?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Referred over here from the Moderator at Outlook.com forum.&nbsp; They told us to refer the set default email client to Outlook.com over to the Internet Explorer engineers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is that when visiting websites and you click on the hyperlink to contact by email (MAILTO), we want to use Outlook.com as the default email program.&nbsp; Don't tell us because it's a web based email that we can't - that's ridiculous because hotmail
 had that functionality to set it as default mail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we WANT is for Microsoft Internet Explorer engineers to provide us with a fix to select Outlook.com as a default program when selecting defaults in IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross post to the Outlook.com forum when you've finally fixed the problem!!!</p>

            <p>It is not a fixable program.&nbsp;Outlook.com is nothing more than a Website. You can install an e-mail client like Windows Live Mail and use that to fetch your Outlook.com mail and it can be set as the default e-mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No browser including Chrome is going to recognize a Webpage as a default e-mail client. Try it.</p>

            Why&nbsp;is it necessary to have&nbsp;both&nbsp;an installed&nbsp;email&nbsp;program and the Outlook.com web based email? You forced the Outlook.com version upon the MS mail user community but&nbsp;still&nbsp;require users to have an installed version. Why? I just do not understand why
 is it so difficult for you to just&nbsp;provide the option, when you click a mailto: link,&nbsp;to direct&nbsp;the user&nbsp;to&nbsp;a web based email program like Outlook.com. Is&nbsp;this&nbsp;REALLY&nbsp;that difficult? I am really getting frustrated with MS. Since Windows 8 was released I began
 to lose faith in&nbsp;your decision making skills. You all REALLY need to&nbsp;start caring about&nbsp;what it is that the users REALLY want instead of trying to force users to change to a system like Windows 8.&nbsp;Most of the&nbsp;"real" people out there find&nbsp;it is not&nbsp;user friendly,
 in fact I would&nbsp;refer to it as user hostile. When Windows 7 was released I was so impressed and thought "Finally they g

            <p>FYI - My&nbsp;comment was not directed at you Bruce. My "rant" (as you put it)&nbsp;IS directed&nbsp;at Microsoft not at you. They designed Windows, in all of its many&nbsp;flawed forms,&nbsp;I am highly aware of this fact.&nbsp;I am just&nbsp;exceptionally frustrated with them.&nbsp;My above
 "rant"&nbsp;is only a small fraction of what frustrates me about Microsoft. I&nbsp;do&nbsp;direct my&nbsp;complaints and concerns&nbsp;to them.&nbsp;I am, however,&nbsp;only a small blip on the map to them. I may express my opinion and comment wherever and whenever I feel like it. Why, because
 this is America. </p>

<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to get "Any type of Outlook item" to become the default option when Advanced Find is opened in "Search Tools on the "Options" section of the Outlook 2010 ribbon. Usually in my haste to search for a word&nbsp;I type the word
 first then realise that I want to search in Any type of Outlook item. Then when you change from Message to Any type... it clears your search and the text has to get reinserted.</p>

<p><span>Hi AbbasDean,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Message rate limit for Office 365 is 30 messages per minute. If you breach the limit, outgoing server wonâ€™t stop but the message will return to you with an NDR. When you under the limit, you may resend the
 message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But it is not recommended for you to breach the limit. Because your account may be finally blocked by EOP if you frequently beyond the limit. EOP may regard your messages as spam.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Huni</span></p>

    <title>Loss of video playback when using an external HDD. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Loss of video playback when using an external HDD.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody! </p>
<p>Thanks to the Xbox One update I can now play videos on my external hard drive by plugging it into the usb port. It will play fine for anything from 10 mins to 40 mins, but then it will loose connection with the external hard drive. The external hard drive
 is still showing as connected, the video just stops and it goes to the top menu for Video Player with the device listed. I can immediately go back into the device, select my video and play from the start. I can fast forward to before I lost connection and
 it will play through that section without issue. Eventually it will loose the connection again. The external hard drive is still lit up and it works fine on my PC. I have tried using the USB port at the back, instead of the side, but the same issue occurs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me&nbsp;Xbox Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope! </p>

            <p>Hello Matt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with the Xbox One media player application.&nbsp; This forum is specific to Xbox Music and Video on all devices.&nbsp; We will do our best to assist you with this today but you may need to seek
 additional support from Xbox forums and chat.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you try is to uninstall the media player application from your console.&nbsp; Once it is off the console, unplug the console power for 5 minutes and then reconnect.&nbsp; Once the console has been reconnected, go to the store and install
 the application to the console one more time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have the same experience the next things I would suggest are some tests to try and determine where the issue might lie.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try connecting this hard drive to another Xbox One or Xbox 360.&nbsp; Here I want to verify if this is an issue with the Xbox One in general, an issue between just your one and this hard drive or an issue between this hard drive and any Xbox console.&nbsp; Additionally,
 if you have access to another external hard drive, try copying your video to that drive and connect it to the Xbox One.</li><li>The next thing you might consider doing is seeing if there is any issue playing this content via the Xbox One.&nbsp; If you can connect this hard drive to a computer on the same network as the Xbox One you should be able to see this computer listed in the application
 and play the content from the computer.&nbsp; I would be interested to know if this works for you and if so, do you have the same experience.</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            <p>That's an unusual error message. it means "class not registered" which suggests a problem with components in the operating system.</p>
<p>I don't know that this is due to a virus.</p>
<p>Does Windows Update work?</p>
<p>If Windows Updates are not working you may need to reset the Windows Update components -</p>

<p>What operating system and service pack?</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

<p>
</p><p>SolverTable is an add-in which you can do sensitivity analysis with an output from solver (optimization).&nbsp; There is a free download with instructions how to set it up, but it doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            Definition Update for MSE  KB2310138 &#40;Definition 1.147.677.0&#41; failed</h2>
                    Hello, The above update (one definition)&nbsp;failed on 3/28/2013. This is the first time
<strong><u>ever</u></strong> that an update did not succeed. all updates after this fail have been ok. I have been searching for help for one week now. "Submit a support case" was the last link i clicked on, and ended up here. (The link should be changed to
 "Micosoft Community<strong>".) </strong>I have been here 3 or 4 days ago and <strong>
searched</strong>.&nbsp;I did find&nbsp;
<p><strong>You can manually download the (large file with engine and full defintions) latest definitions from the portal here:https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/default.aspx. This s</strong>hould say the "most recent" because that is all it will do,
 further down the page i click on a link that would download all of the updates for my version&nbsp;which i did. After i ran the download i did a restart. Did not fix, nor could i find where anything had been done. (even tryed a 2nd time). This is the info i get
 when i double click on failed update &gt;</p>

 MSE which i already have and trying&nbsp;to just find one update. Or do i have to make another install? Is there any fix or way to get this failed update? I have clicked on to many links to list here. Windows 7 hp, IE9, and MSE. MSE is the only security that i'm
 using. (no others on machine except from time&nbsp;to time i will download "Malwarebytes" to my desktop and run, but do not save). If i can uninstall&nbsp;and reinstall MSE to fix i wll do so.&nbsp; One last thing, i do not use Windows Auto update. Updates are checked
<strong>Daily </strong>and done manually. Updates for MSE are done by clicking on MSE then click&nbsp;check, then download. Other&nbsp;updates are done with windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;scare0340&nbsp;&nbsp; Before i left this site i clicked the link on this page. It took me a site that is
 pay money to fix. I will also do so if advised to do.</p>

            <p>I can't tell you why that single update failed in Windows Update history, but the fact that subsequent updates for MSE have been applied mean that all is well. Updates offered in WU are *optional*&nbsp; for MSE. MSE checks for updates once per day. Signatures
 are released multiple times per day and a check for updates by WU (or via Automatic Updates at the scheduled time) may present multiple updates available since the last update internally performed by MSE. When MSE updates internally, it updates cumulatively,
 so that error listing should be ignored as MSE is still updating fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manual update at the bolded link from the portal is the *FULL* definitions/signature database as well as the scanning engine. Updates performed by MSE or via WU/AU are smaller "delta" signature files.</p>
