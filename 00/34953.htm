<h2>            problem after updating to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have recently updated to Windows 10 and every thing is fine except one annoying occurrence: which ever page or window I am using, when I open up another one, the page appears but within a second the page drops by about half an inch. It doesn't matter if
 it's a program or the internet I am using. Could it be the graphics card? This didn't happen with Windows 8 on the same lap top.</p>
<p>Thank you for any suggestions.</p>

<p><span>Hello petercharles,</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are those applications?</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were those applications working fine before?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if they are compatible with Windows Vista or not:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to put the computer in clean boot and check:</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

    <title>Mouse Lag when Streaming Video - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sparkles171  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Lag when Streaming Video</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased my new computer today with a i5 8400 and a GTX 1060 6Gb, whenever I load up the Netflix/Twitch interface my mouse seems to lag a bit whenever I move it around the screen. It doesn't seem to be much but it is still definitely noticeable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I could possibly fix this issue? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Sparkles.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />4) If this only happens in those programs then try resetting them in Apps Settings or uninstalling, restart PC and then reinstall from their latest download.  Make sure you check their website also for patches.  
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Why are windows jumping up and down as they load in IE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eveningprimrose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are windows jumping up and down as they load in IE</h2>
                    Please forgive me, as I am not tech savvy at all, so I&nbsp; hope I can explain my problem clearly.<br />
<br />
Whenever&nbsp;I open a new webpage in IE, or even refresh one which is already open (for example, Hotmail) the window appears to jump up and down while it loads.
<br />
<br />
I have no electrical equipment or magnets near my computer, and it's not the 'shimmering' effect that those produce anyway, but more of vertical jumping of the actual window.<br />
<br />
I'm running Vista.<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated.

            Hi eveningprimrose,<br />
<br />
Is just the IE windows jumping up and down or is it the whole screen?&nbsp; Does the entire window do this (title bar and all) or just the contents of the webpage?&nbsp; Is it only certain webpages or all of them?<br />
<br />
Try starting Internet Explorer with no add-ons and see if the problem still happens.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> orb. </li><li>Select <strong>All Programs</strong>. </li><li>Open <strong>Accessories</strong> then <strong>System Tools</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</strong></li></ul>
<p><br />
Use Internet Explorer as you normally would and see if still jumps when loading a webpage.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the results.<br />

            <p>I am of the notion that suggesting sfc /scannow is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow is designed to run one time when you install XP.&nbsp; The purpose is to populate the dllcache folder with backup copies of important XP files.&nbsp; Sure - you can run it manually if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow does not replace missing or corrupt files in the system32 folder.&nbsp; It only cares about the dllcache folder.&nbsp; If you would like a little test case where you can prove it to yourself, I can post that (I composed it in hopes that the Microsoft
 engaged Support Engineer "experts" would stop suggesting it).&nbsp; Then you will know what sfc /scannow does and what it doesn't do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when sfc /scannow runs successfully, you will only see a starting and complete message in the Event Viewer System log that looks like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
There is no information about what it did or what it didn't do.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do and replaces a file, you will not know about it, but you will have wasted your time and still have your original problem.<br />
<br />
That makes suggesting it or trying it even more of a waste of time.<br />

            There was a bug with a previous version of Windows 1809 which prevented users from setting the default app for file types, run Windows update to see if there is anything needed.
<br />Also when you try to set the default app, if the program isn’t listed you can scroll down where there should be an option to search for a compatible app which should allow you to select the app/program you want to use.
<br />.atn extentions are specific to Adobe photoshop &amp; are used to automate steps when working with photos within that program so if you don’t have Adobe photoshop then you cannot open/use it.

<br />I have asked you to try something, to provide more information or offered the truth. I see that as helpful.

            Your reply doesn’t state clearly that you have Adobe installed just that you’re trying to set a default app to open a certain file type, then you say there’s no free Photoshop app thus further suggesting that you didn’t have Adobe photoshop installed &amp; was looking for a free version that is why I gave you an answers I did.
<br />Is photoshop a full program or from the App Store?
<br />If the App Store then it will be under ProgramData which is a hidden folder.

    <title>Android to Windows 10 PC &#40;version 1803&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorne wolfmackenzie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android to Windows 10 PC &#40;version 1803&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My Android phone is a Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) &amp; my PC is running Windows 10 (version 1803)</p>
<p>Somehow was able to get my music (audio period) to stream from my phone to my PC using the Smart Switch Feature built into the phone that does the Cast feature. Tried using Connect through the Action Center after my A5 gave me a notification of a pin to
 enter into PC's Name after I turned on Wi-Fi Direct to share. Went from there to Project &amp; suddenly my PC threw up a blue screen similar to Samsung Share giving an all new PIN # &amp; my phone display changed to a countdown for entering the same PIN on both devices.&nbsp;<strong>EXCEPT
 at this point</strong> I had only the blue connecting screen on the PC &amp; with 10 seconds it
<strong><em>FINALLY </em></strong>displays a # to enter into my phone! Obvious failure.
</p>
<p>The PC doesn't have Bluetooth but does have Wi-Fi &amp; both are on the same network. Given the timer tried to go in reverse starting with the PC &amp; telling it to find my phone. Tried to project to my phone &amp; saw right away in Settings that my hardware doesn't
 support projecting OUT (is nothing about IN...) which is no good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wanting some music as I searched through the various post's already here &amp;&nbsp; online in general, I plugged in the headphones &amp; tapped play in my music player on the phone. No sound came out of the headphones. Thinking had a loose connection to they needed
 wax or some other obstruction cleaned out (skipping through a few things) took them off my ears to hear my music coming from my PC instead!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point wasn't sure how I did it yet shut down both to start again &amp; see what I did as I wanted to copy my music files wirelessly if I could as I have before. My only 2 options came down to Wi-Fi direct which tells me max of 500 files (guessing ACTUAL
 FILES not including the stupid folders!) after trying to move 1000+ then slowly cutting back to try 2. On the phone it would show an upload icon that would eventually time out while the PC did nothing. Despite trying again the various connection options Windows
 provides. Reverse engineering again lead nowhere. Adding device was my last attempt. Aggravated I put the headphones back on &amp; wound up getting connected to the PC instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have it figured out that my Smart View feature is what is working. At least until I had a call come in. The connection stopped dead which was fine. But I just 15 minutes trying to reconnect it &amp; watching the swirling circle with a random pin to
 be entered into my phone at random appear.&nbsp;<strong>Does anyone know how to do this on command?
</strong>Starting the attempt by phone 1st winds up with no gains. PC 1st &amp; it will randomly set off the phone trying to connect with a new random # each time! So between trying to look at 2 different screens &amp; tap 2 different # keypads'...<strong>Wi-Fi direct
 can be shared if on same network can they not? Is this possible between the 2? </strong>
</p>
<p>Am trying to repair some drivers' that hopefully will allow for a USB connection between the 2 if needed! Right now have the sound quality of a vinyl record on a old country road used by farm equipment in the rain until it dries out!! If the sound is not
 bouncing in &amp; out it is speeding up &amp; then will crawl dragging out each word for a good 15-20 seconds (I HAVE TIMED IT!!) only to suddenly impersonate the Chipmunks!! AC/DC has never been so disgraced &gt;=(
<em>At the moment this is my only option until I can repair several drivers' adding to the misery.
</em></p>

<p>In my original message, I am not able to enter a pin code for both device's before allocated time is up. Depending on which device starts the pairing process determines where the pin number originates from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the audio jack on my phone alone regardless of which headphones ALWAYS work's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to 1803 edition pairing my Android phone was done with USB cable which would either use Synchronisation through Media Player or Samsung Smart Switch.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>After down loading movie maker, you ask for my registration number. I don't have it? How can I get it? and other thing, before the down load there was no words about free trial. Then no information about the cost. For the last year I had movie maker, and
 then my hard drive had to be replaced. now I am trying to recover. I don't remember have to buy movie maker then? Any way if it don't cost to much, I might use it.</p>

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a D-Link 3.5G HSDPA USB Adapter and intend to use it for my Surface RT. Unfortunately, i am unable to install the driver as the System prompt me to install via "Store". I spent long time to search for the apps but still unable to allocate it. Can
 some one teach me how to install the driver? Beside this, can Surface RT install the software like Real Player and QVOD Player?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

                    You probably won't believe your eyes on this one, but I'm looking for programming language reference for the VERY VERY VERY old, VERY short lived QuickBASIC for Macintosh. I'm a vintage computing fan and am working on a disk image transfer utility for
 Macintosh running Classic OS from version 6 to version 8.6

<div>Hope someone from Microsoft sees this and responds. I know it's an oddball request, but I'm doing my part to keep the history of personal computing alive!</div>

<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

    <title>FPS limited to wrong value, when VSYNC is off, under Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mez 101010  say:</h3>
<h2>            FPS limited to wrong value, when VSYNC is off, under Windows 8</h2>
                    It is common for performance gamers to turn VSYNC off and rely on frame limiters to reduce lag.<br />
<br />
Playing "Unreal Tournament 2004", under Windows 8 (Desktop), wrongly gives a limited frame rate of
<b>83</b> FPS when the following settings are used:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>UseVSync=False</li><li>MaxClientFrameRate=<b>90</b></li></ul>
I'm using an AMD Radeon HD 7850 graphics card.<br />
<br />
I don't want to buy a 120Hz monitor until I can be sure that Windows/DirectX limits the FPS correctly.<br />

            I found the solution to this issue - unlocking the frame limiter can only be done for this old UT2004 game by ensuring that the following lines are in the
<i>user.ini</i> file:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Engine.Input]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert=netspeed 10001<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; [Engine.Player]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ConfiguredInternetSpeed=10001<br />
<br />
And in the <i>ut2004.ini</i> file, ensure this is specified:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MaxClientFrameRate=92&nbsp;&nbsp; (don't ask me why it's 92, not 90!)<br />
<br />
Now, when I play the game I just press the Insert key, at the start of each map, and I can see the frame rate change from 83 to 90.<br />

<h2>            Control Panel and Uninstalling Programms</h2>
                    Well, when i enter my control panel it starts freezing but not that much. BUT when i go to Uninstall Programms it takes for ever to load and doesn't show the icons next to each programm. Meanwhile i can not do any other action because if i do my computer
 will freeze to death. Every time i tried to minimize the window or go to the internet my computer froze and i had to restart it. All these waiting only the Control Panel\Programms to load. If i try to Uninstall a programm, comes disaster. My computer totally
 freezes and i have to restart it.&nbsp;
<div>I saw something about .cpl files but i dont know if it is only about the control panel or for the programms, too. And i don t recognize which .cpl is from microsoft and which not.</div>
<div><br />

<div>I run windows 7 and i have SONY-VAIO Laptop. For more information if it is needed, fell free to ask.</div>

    <title>msi extension won&#39;t install apps. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbartell  say:</h3>
<h2>            msi extension won&#39;t install apps.</h2>
                    every time I try to install an app with the extension " msi" , the install goes to mse install (microsoft security essentials), which is already installed on my pc. Every app with the msi extension will not install. I have tried to change the file association
 to its default properties, but this does not change or correct the problem with this process. I believe this problem started right after I installed " mse" app which used the msi extension, and since that time, I have not been able to install any application
 with the msi extension. All other apps and extensions install just fine.
<div>My pc is high end with 4Gb. of Ram. O.S. is Win7-Home-X64bit- HDD has plenty of space. No firewall issues. All security scans performed reporting no issues. No overheating issues. Have attempted same process in admin mode unsuccessfully.<br />
<div>can anyone help with this problem. Contact - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to try the steps in the link mentioned below and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>How to fix MSI software update registration corruption issues :</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue is still not resolved you may try to manually unregister and re-register Windows Installer following the steps mentioned below:<br />
<div>a) Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.<br />
b) Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run this command, the operation is complete.<br />
c) <strong>Try to install files with MSI extension again</strong>.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue still persists you may check if Windows installer service is started.<br />
<div>a) Click ‘<strong>Start’</strong>, type ‘<strong>services.msc’ </strong>and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
b) Locate “<strong>Windows Installer</strong>” and check if the <strong>service is started.<br />
</strong>c) If not ‘<strong>Start’ </strong>the service.<br />
<br />
<div>Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<h2>            Unknown USB Device &#40;Device Descripter Request Failed&#41;, for any thumb drive in any port, but mouse and KB fine in all</h2>
                    <p>Get "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)" for any/all of my thumb drives in all USB ports, but USB mouse and keyboard work in all USB ports. Thumb drives all work in two other computers just fine.</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Pro (64 bit) with latest update</p>
<p>- MB: Intel DG41TY with latest bios and latest drivers.</p>
<p>- 2GB RAM</p>
<p>- CPU: E6850, Intel Core2 Duo, 3.00 GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just replace an identical MB with this one due to the MB going bad and would not boot, determined problem was MB related by process of elimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have repartitioned and reformatted the drive, re-installed all drivers and windows from a windows 10 disk, and stopped after each update to check if flash drive works, same results each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have uninstalled all USB root HUBS and USB controllers, and Enhanced controller and still same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions or answers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it behoove me to go back and install Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and see if problem persists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine a few years ago was running on Win 7 Pro 64 bit, before I did the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro 64 bit.</p>

<p>Hi, William</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact version of Skype that's installed on your Windows 10 computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to have a better view of what you're experiencing, I am requesting for a screenshot of the issue. You can mask your faces on the screenshot you'll provide. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I do not know how to determine what version of Skype I have.&nbsp; However, my normal process is to update any program when prompted to do so, so I would think I have whatever is most recent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype session scheduled for tomorrow morning, and will try to get a screen shot then.</p>
<p>I have never done this -- do I use the screen clipping icon with the scissors?</p>

<h2>            Receiving SMS messages</h2>
                    I live in different places around the world and am grateful to have Skype to keep in touch with my family in the US. I usually text my sister or sister-in-law to let them know when I am available to Skype, otherwise they hardly ever log in. For security
 reasons, we will not have a mobile phone at our current post. I tried sending SMS from Skype yesterday - my sister received the message but I did not receive her reply. Is there a setting that I am missing in order to receive SMS replies?

<p>Buenas gente,</p>
<p>El problema que tengo es con la página xbox.com, en el apartado de logros, no me aparecen algunos de mis juegos (de 360), es como si no los hubiera jugado nunca:</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3, Lollipop Chainsaw, Microsoft Flight, Halo CE Anniversary y alguno más.</p>
<p>Lo curioso, es que si cambio la región del bazar de "España" a "United States", me aparecen todos los juegos por lo que supongo que es un problema exclusivo de Xbox España.</p>
<p>¿Me podría alguien con esos juegos confirmar que a ellos tampoco les aparecen en sus cuentas? ¿Con quien podría ponerme en contacto para notificar este error?</p>
<p>Saludos y gracias.</p>

<p>Hola, buenas tardes. Estoy igual que vosotros.</p>
<p>En la página de xbox.com, en la sección de logros, no aparecen muchos juegos, por ejemplo, el que ahora mismo ando jugando, Brutal Legend, no aparece. Tampoco Dead Space 3, ni Batman Arkham Origins, etc.</p>
<p>Desde septiembre del año pasado vengo notando estos problemas de juegos 'desaparecidos' en xbox.com. y el problema continúa sin visos de que se vaya a solucionar.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only problem is, it's not so accurate and the screen is small, so sometimes I hit the wrong clip or something along those lines.</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Display Adapater Rotation Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> art4mad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapater Rotation Issues</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the Microsoft Display Adapter with my Wacom Cintiq Mobilestudio Pro running Windows 10 (fully updated as of today). I'm trying to "duplicate screen". Connecting works fine but the TV keeps having problems with the rotation of the screen.
 Currently in Landscape mode the TV the display adapter is hooked up to displays the screen upside down. If I try switching to "portrait" rotation the TV displays the screen correctly but my Cintiq's pen calibration is upside down. Switching back to landscape
 causes the TV to stay in portrait orientation but to display the landscape screen, only squeezed into the portrait aspect ratio. The display adapter is majorly confused.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure the adapter has had firmware updated and current. The Intel Graphics drivers are also current, and I have deleted them and reinstalled.

<p>I have read that article but it does not help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Responding to those with similar problems: I have found a "solution" of sorts. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to when the screen rotation is correct and when it is not. What I did was lock the rotation on the Cintiq Mobilestudio Pro to the portrait
 mode I wanted to use, set the display resolution to match that of the TV I am using with the wireless adapter. Then I just rebooted everything over and over until the display matched my tablet display. After that I was careful to booth up the Cintiq first,
 keep it in portrait mode, then connect to the wireless display. As long as you don't change orientation/rotate your tablet, it works. Not perfect but for my needs does the job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more point, if you are using a Cintiq Workstation Pro often when you first boot up and connect to the wireless display your pen calibration is upside down. When you go to calibrate your pen via the Wacom driver make sure your select "generic monitor"
 in the drop down box. If you leave it the default blank, you will have to reboot again to fix it.
