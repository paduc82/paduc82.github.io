<h2>            Computer freezes after crashing during windows backup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm new on here and I've done lots of searching but it seems I'm the only person in the world this has happened to, but I hope not. I'm sorry this is so long but&nbsp;I really have nowhere else to turn without spending vast amounts of money. My life is pretty
 much on my computer too. I've just started out as a photographer, so if I loose my computer, not only do I not have money to replace it, but I loose the photos I could sell to get money.&nbsp;There are loads of symptoms, but here's what happened chronologically:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd been trying to back up my PC for ages. It kept failing, so I searched the error code. It said I should do a full scan in MSE (what I've got), that it would pcik up something java-related and I should remove it. Then if that didn't work, temporarily remove
 java. I did the scan, it found the thing; I removed it. Backup still didn't work so I removed java. I started it backing up, the after the whole day accidentally closed the lid of the laptop, so that backup was cancelled. Started another backup and left it
 to it. Came back to find the thing was shut down. I assumed one of those windows updates things had installed and it had shut down. Switched it on and it gave the "Windows did not shut down correctly" message. I started normally and tried to look at the event
 log to see what happened during that backup that caused it to crash. While the event log loaded, the laptop froze. When it freezes, the screen just hangs on whatever is up. Also, the laptop has 3 LED indicators, one for HDD which normally flashes when it's
 doing stuff. That LED goes out when it freezes. I then tried to start in safe mode. I opened event viewer again and MSE to do a scan. It froze again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other symptoms I've picked up:</p>
<p>In safe mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>After a while after logging in, the backup in progress icon appears in the action centre at the bottom right, even though the external HDD I've been backing up to isn't even connected. If I open the icon and try to click on "Backup in progress" it says
 "Running in safe mode not supported".</li><li>If I open the action centre from the control panel it says backup in progress. When I click "details" it says "Running in safe mode not supported".</li><li>In task managed the "Windows Backup" service is "Stopped".</li></ul>
<p>In normal mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "backup in progress" icon is still there. If I open the icon and click on "Backup in progress", it opens "Backup and Restor"&nbsp;(Control Panel\System and Security\Backup and Restore). That window is just black, white though. It only says "Back up or restore
 your files" at the top.</li><li>In task managed the "Windows Backup" service is "Stopped".</li><li>In the HP support assistant&nbsp;(it's a HP), in "Troubleshoot"&nbsp; and in "Storage Devices"&nbsp;it says I've only got 2.91GB of free space on the windows partition, when I actually have about 26GB (I recently had about&nbsp;2.91GB and less&nbsp;but I had 26GB when it crashed
 during the backup).</li></ul>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dissabling all the non-microsoft services and programs.</li><li>A couple of clean boots.</li><li>I've done a memory check which came back fine.</li><li>I started the computer in recovery mode and did a diskcheck ("CHKDSK" in the command line) on the windows partition of my drive. It&nbsp;said "chkdisk discovered error in index..." but then just seemed to be at the end of what it did. I looked that up and apparently
 it needed to be "CHKDSK /F" in the command line in order for it to try to solve the errors. So I tried typing that in both in safe and normal mode, but it wouldn't do it, I think becuase I was using the windows drive. I think when it boots in recovery mode
 it uses the recovery partition of the drive.</li><li>I've tried the steps in the answers on here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/backup-aborts-with-error-code-0x80070422/639e2b91-0d65-40e0-aed4-7d8bffd6609b">

<p>Things that have made it freeze so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening MSE doesn't seem to but starting a scan (full or quick) always seems to make it freeze</li><li>As does opening the event log</li><li>Once in normal mode, it froze after being idle for a while.</li><li>Once while I was editing the services it froze</li><li>Although I can't do a backup, I've been trying to copy and paste some of my most valuable files onto the external hard drive. I had to do this at about 1GB at a time, any more and it froze (possibly after about 1GB moved). After a while of moving stuff
 in this way, it refused to move a single thing.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I can think of any other relavant information. I would be incredibly greatful to anyone who can help in any way. At this point I'd even be willing to pay someone who thought they could fix it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: would appear I'm not new on here! Hard to keep track of different acounts these days. Still... help!</p>

            Hard drive has just gone. I was trying to copy using the XCOPY command to ship stuff across. I was still trying to get to grips with the syntax. The HDD gave a few click then brief blue screen and it went off. Hasn't been able to boot since. Game over.
 I think I might be in&nbsp;warranty&nbsp;so calling HP is for tomorrow. I don't think this thread will ever know exactly what happened during that first backup!
<div>Thanks for the help though, appreciate it.</div>

<h2>            PC Hibernating Overnight with Advanced Power Options set to Never, then upon wake it&#39;s rebooting</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop PC with a fresh install of Windows 10 and whenever I leave my office I use "Windows Button + L" to lock the PC so it requires security login. &nbsp;During the day, when I leave for lunch or run errands, it's no problem. I come back and move the
 mouse and logon and work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I leave in the evenings, and return in the morning, my PC is in Hibernate mode. &nbsp;I have to press the power button (which is blinking like a laptop in hibernate mode) which then shows me the logon screen. After logon, I can usually work as normal,
 but sometimes it just reboots after a few minutes (not every time, but it did it again today).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to remote into my PC sometimes so I don't want it to sleep or hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before posting and for several days I have updated Advanced Power Options --&gt; Sleep:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; Sleep After = Never (both On Battery and Plugged in)</p>
<p>--&gt; Allow hybrid sleep = Off&nbsp;(both On Battery and Plugged in)</p>
<p>--&gt; Hibernate after = Never&nbsp;(both On Battery and Plugged in)</p>
<p>--&gt; Allow wake timers = disable&nbsp;(both On Battery and Plugged in)</p>
<p>I already Ran the SFC<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
<br />
I already ran&nbsp;<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
<br />
Scanhealth<br />
No component store corruption detected.<br />
The operation completed successfully.<br />
<br />
Restorehealth<br />
The restore operation completed successfully.<br />
The operation completed successfully.<br />
<br />
And I already ran<br />
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML<br />
<br />
Which gave me an error&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Add-AppxPackage : Cannot find path 'C:\WINDOWS\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML'&nbsp;<br />
because it does not exist.<br />
<br />
But I can run "Store "and I can install Apps </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking in the Event Viewer I'm seeing Administrative Events and have a few Warnings and what appears to be some Critical Errors. I'm not sure if they are causing my issue but would like to eliminate those if that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>General Error:</p>
<p>Failed with 0x490 modifying AppModel Runtime status for package Microsoft.WindowsAlarms_10.1510.14020.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe for user PCNAME\USER (current status = 0x0, desired status = 0x20).</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you have an issue with power settings. I appreciate your efforts,
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To understand the issue better, let me know what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Incorrect power settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Missing Windows Updates or drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before starting the troubleshooting make sure you have&nbsp;</span><span>installed all the available Windows Updates. You
 may also download and install all the latest device drivers including chipset driver from the computer manufacturer website. If the issue persists, t</span><span>ry the steps listed here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1:
<br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Letâ€™s run the power troubleshooter and check if that helps.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press â€˜<strong>Windows + W</strong>â€™ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. In the search box, type â€˜<strong>Troubleshootingâ€™</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">restore the power plans to default and check if it helps.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Reset and restore the power plans to default:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right-click</span></strong><span> on
<strong>Start button </strong>and click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></span></li><li><span>In the command prompt, type
<strong>powercfg â€“restoredefaultschemes </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Exit</span></strong><span> command prompt.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> This would reset the power plan settings to default.

    <title>Old Windows 10 upgrade key, still usable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Old Windows 10 upgrade key, still usable&#63;</h2>
                    So the title might be a bit to understand, I never am good with titles. My question here is, while Windows 10 was being offered for free I downloaded and installed it. Since then, I have reverted back to Windows 8.1 for technical reasons at the time, but
 had made sure to save the key to the installation of Windows 10 for future use. Now that Windows 10 is no longer being offered for free, if I were to reinstall it would my previous key still work, or do I need to actually buy Windows 10 despite having activated
 it during the free period?

            If you connected to the Internet first time around, then Microsoft has your machine registered.&nbsp; While reinstalling, when it's time to enter a key, look around the window for another choice<br />
and click on that : "don't have one" "do it later".&nbsp; Windows will self activate once it's installed.

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<h2>            Preview Program Dilema</h2>
                    
<p>So I had purchased the xbox one day one edition, which game me the option I believe to be apart of the preview program. I had accepted this. But nothing ever came from it or maybe it did but I've gone back to check my emails and I never found anything. I
 have also had friends invite me to the preview program and still nothing. it wasn't bothering me before, but know that the backwards compatibility is out on it its kind of frustrating me. I have called the support line and they said they had no information
 on the preview program. if anyone else could send me an invite maybe one more will do the trick idk. Thanks for any feedback</p>

<p>I'm sorry to say that we are unable to provide Preview Program invites here on the support forums. We suggest finding a friend who is currently participating in the Preview Program and request an invite from them Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p><strong>How to Remove Current Account Picture</strong></p>
<p>Is there a way to hide or remove the user picture at the login screen? How to disable the user account picture from the Start menu? Follow these steps and you can hide/remove current account picture completely in Windows 10/8:</p>
<p>Open the File Explorer.</p>
<p>Copy and paste the following path in the address bar of File Explorer. Press Enter and you can see all built-in default account pictures. Delete all images.<br />
<code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures</code> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.top-password.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f12%2fuser-account-pictures.png" height="417" width="600" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have to clean the cached account images. Copy and paste the following path in the address bar of File Explorer. Press Enter and youâ€™ll see a folder with the name of your accountâ€™s SID.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">C:\Users\Public\Public Account Pictures</span>

<p>
</p><p>Just rename the folder or delete it. If you want to delete that folder, you need to firstly take ownership of the folder using the freeware&nbsp;<a href="http://www.top-password.com/take-ownership-pro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TakeOwnershipPro</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log off or restart your computer. Youâ€™ll see the account picture disappeared from Windows login screen.</p>

</p><p>Windows 10 is saving your screenshots to OneDrive.&nbsp; Did you read this page?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/stop-saving-screenshots-onedrive-automatically-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/stop-saving-screenshots-onedrive-automatically-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you take the screenshot, it is saved in a folder on OneDrive, which is Microsoft's cloud service.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened OneDrive App.&nbsp; I right clicked on it's icon in my system tray and clicked on Settings then the Auto Save tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my own backup system in place, so I don't save everything to OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97290d70-5216-4cf3-b291-a28996d2c85c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97290d70-5216-4cf3-b291-a28996d2c85c" height="407" width="365" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, look at these settings.&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp; Change your settings under the
<strong>Save Locations</strong> heading to your preference. &nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Even though I had not unchecked Automatically save screenshots I capture to OneDrive, when I tried a screen shot, it did not save to OneDrive&nbsp;as I had my "Save Locations" already set to "This PC."</p>

<h2>            LifeChat LX-3000 microphone not un-muting</h2>
                    I have been using my LifeChat headset for approximately a month now and all of the sudden, the red mute light will not turn off.&nbsp; In otherwords, it will not un-mute.&nbsp; I have tried removing and reinstalling the driver.&nbsp; The volume up and down buttons work
 but the mute and hang up buttons do not function.&nbsp; It is disappointing to thing that the headset won't even last a month but, is that what it comes down to?&nbsp; Do I need a replacement?&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Try connecting the headphone to other USB ports and check if the same issue occurs.</p>

<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand the Universal Serial Bus controllers
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>See if the first or second entry is "Lifechat Lx-3000 Microphone ".
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click on Lifechat Lx-3000 Microphone and select Uninstall.</p>
<p>

<p>1- no, if I decrypt individual file in this folder, the padlock disappears, but any new files I save in this folder become automatically encrypted, with padlock icon,it can be decrypted individually.</p>
<p>2- No just in this folder, the picture folder.</p>
<p>3-No error message when I decrypt individual files, but on trying to decrypt the folder by right click, then properties, advanced and uncheck encrypt folder, then on clicking OK or apply an error message appears, it says an error occur when applying attribute
 to this file with options, I tried all options yet no changes, attached snap shots of all steps taken.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a ThinkPad running Windows 10 and it makes this weird chiming sound. This sound only happens when the speakers are on and I have already tried disabling notifications, going through sounds to disable it, and more. It is annoying as I use my laptop
 for school and I watch a lot of videos for class and it chimes in the middle of a video. Trying to look for a solution as this is extremely irritating.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mouse and Keyboard makes controllers obsolete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coast1653  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse and Keyboard makes controllers obsolete</h2>
                    <p>The angle precision mouse and keyboards have make controllers inferior to FPS such as Counter Strike, Rainbow Six Siege, COD, and Battlefield. I find there is no competition with keyboard and mouse when you have a controller. To have a mouse and keyboard and that much precision on a game that requires you to be precise definitely has unfair advantages. When you have an xbox elite controller and people with mouses and keyboards are doing 360s to kill you i think that says something. Controllers are going to become obsolete in this kind of setting. Not what i imagined when buying the xbox elite controller if that was the case i wouldve gotten a mouse and keyboard for sure but&nbsp;i didnt get an xbox just so i can competition with a mouse and keyboard. So now whats to stop players from moving to PC?</p>

            <p>I don't think it will kill the controller, I know many PC gamers that use control pads of some discription. I'll make a more reasoned assessment once I have had the chance to use one, as to whether they give an advantage or not.

            <p>What's to stop players from moving to PC? </p><p><br /></p><p>Xbox offers simplicity. We play games for fun, not to worry about precision down to the 20th power or something. I've played on Xbox 360 and Xbox One and the controls on a controller are more than adequate. Why strive for perfection. Also consoles are cheaper with gaming than a gaming PC. The average laptop school and uni students use struggles to play games as well as Xbox One or higher end games on PC, cause those sorts of laptops only have like dual core CPU's and Intel graphics and 8GB or so RAM. Mac is guilty of this and so is HP etc. And the prices they charge makes it more better to go for custom PC desktop builds which can be pricey but every PC part is customized to suit the consumer better. PC gets viruses and infections. And with the state of the internet infrastructure, it's easy to get infections etc, and you don't have to do naughty things to get a virus. That's why people may get internet security software and since Wi

<h2>            Cannot set up Fingerprint using Sign-in options</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use to log into my windows 10 using finger print reader. However just recently i foolishly decided to add another finger print. When I did it, it asked my for my PIN, but I had forgotten it so I deleted it and then when I press "Add" under PIN my computer
 does nothing. I can no longer log into my PC using my finger print. And now, when I try to to add a finger print by pressing "Set up" under fingerprint, I can add the first finger print, but then it says "Set PIN" and on pressing this, it closes and no further
 pop ups appear to add a PIN. My windows 10 is fully up to date.</p>

<p>Hi PacmanMFC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, PIN issue happens due to incorrect/corrupt permissions set applied to a hidden system folder called NGC. To resolve the issue, I suggest that you delete everything within the NGC folder and try to add a new PIN code. Please follow
 these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open&nbsp;<span><strong>File Explorer</strong></span>&nbsp;and browse to this location:&nbsp;<span><strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC</strong></span></li><li>Delete everything within that folder. To do so, you must be logged in as an administrator.</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<span><strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Accounts&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Sign-in Options</strong></span>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<span><strong>Add a PIN</strong></span>&nbsp;and add a new PIN code for your account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. However this was one of the first things i tried already (i have googled it and this is suggested in multiple places) however, like with most of the responses to this advice, it did not help. I even tried it again just to be sure, and
 even deleted the entire Ngc folder and rebooted the computer. However every time I click "add" under PIN, nothing happens. Ie. there is no pop up to allow me to enter a pin, and no error message. It just ignores the press.</p>

<h2>            No internet connection &#40;wireless&#41; since last windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since windows was updated few days ago (the one that changed some icons and the sleep/power off menu) my wifi is not working anymore.</p>
<p>It was not working good before but i could roll back and then update the driver and as weird as it is, it was working. Since the update I don't have the possibility to update or rollback the driver.</p>
<p>When i try to diagnose it, i have the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One or more network protocols are missing on this computer.</p>
<p>Automatic repair didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed this driver but it changed nothing:</p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25511/Intel-PROSet-Wireless-Software-for-Windows-8-1-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several commands i've found around. The device seems to have ipv4/v6.</p>
<p>I tried to restore the system, it changed nothing.</p>
<p>I have eset nod32 antivirus, if that could matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any solutions ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your answer. The problem definitly does not come from the network, all other devices have access to internet.</p>
<p>As for those steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-network-connection-issues</p>
<p>
1. Update the network adapter driver
</p><p>Done, does not change anything.</p>
<p>
2. Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart
</p><p>Worse than everything, i couldn't see any wifi spot, even after several restarts, i had to use the restore point.</p>
<p>
3. Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands
</p><p>I have the following result for the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">ipconfig
 /renew&nbsp;</span>command:</p>
<p>An error occured while renewing interfarce Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 Virtual Switch: unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has time out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other commands seems to work.</p>
<p>
4. Temporarily turn off firewalls
</p><p>Done, does not change anything.</p>
<p>
5. Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software
6. Reinstall network devices using netcfg â€“d command
</p><p>Didn't tried it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you want me to upload the result of the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1); font-weight: bold">netsh wlan show wlanreport&nbsp;</span>command ? There are
 a lot of informations and it looks like there are problem with the centrino again, but i already knew it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to go back to a previous build ? And wait for the next update that will (hopefully) fix this ? I'm losing too much time trying to debug your product :s</p>
<p>

    <title>Elite controller - pressing down on the D-pad often - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sigmathedj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite controller - pressing down on the D-pad often doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work in Titanfall</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using the Elite controller with the standard cross-shaped D-pad. I have one paddle attached, which is mapped to the A button, but other than that I haven't customised any of the controls.</p>
<p>When I test the D-pad in menus, it never fails to register a press in any direction. However, when playing Titanfall, when in a titan you have to press down on the D-pad to activate the titan's core ability and I'm finding that sometimes I have to press
 the D-pad down about 10 times before it finally works.</p>
<p>It's very strange because like I said, if I'm just in a menu and I repeatedly press up and down over and over, it never fails to register my down press - it's only when I'm in the game that it does. I've never had this happen with the regular Xbox One controllers.</p>

<p>Your not the only one, same issue during light or quicker presses on my Elite controller as well. I use the D-pad for all menu navigation and find it (D-Pad down) failing to register 3-4 out of 10 presses. I refuse to use it, forget gaming with it.</p>
<p>When that button clicks, the input should register, period.</p>

            <p>Hey SigmaTheDJ and Master Voltage</p>
<p>Do you have issues within any other games or is this just with Titanfall? If it's only with Titanfall try a full power cycle on the console by holding power button for 10 seconds (or until console turns off) and try again. If you're still having issues it may be worth uninstalling and re-installing the game.</p>
<p>If you're having issues with all games it may be worth reaching out to the retailer for an exchange. If they don't have any available for exchange currently you can set up a Repair/Replacement for the controller over here at our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>. Keep us in the loop with what's going on.</p>
<p>H8edHero, I'm afraid if the stick is drifting you'll also want to reach out to your retailer or set up a Repair/Replacement with the steps above. Really sorry about the issues you're having with the controller, certainly isn't something that is normal with the controller.</p>

            Hi Charlene
<br />
<br />By default in Skype you do not have or need a Number
<br />
<br />Provide your Skype ID or the Email Address used to join Skype to your friends and contacts, so they can find you on Skype
<br />
<br />Click your Profile Picture to find your Skype ID - that will usually begin with Live: . . .

<h2>            Problem in turning on Windows Automatic Updates.</h2>
                    <p><font color="#000000">Iâ€™ve one HP Pavilion PC with genuine Microsoft XP Home P4 installed with the built in feature of SP1.&nbsp;I had all the latest application installed in my PC,&nbsp;i.e.
 IE8, MSE, along with SP3 etc.&nbsp;I noticed some erratic behavior in the PC which&nbsp;I wanted to remove. But unknowingly I must have corrupted some of its path or built in features, I noticed it when it didnâ€™t start normally. I tried the Safe Mode method but it didnâ€™t
 work. Then I used this feature of HP PC System Recovery. After a long marathon, it came into life showing all its icons on the desk top which were there previously. But in the process, the application like media player, internet explorer etc. got its previous
 look. All of them have gone into their primitive factory shipped version. I failed to download the latest, i.e. IE8, Windows Media Player 9, Zune, MSE, and automatic updates feature as my PC didn't have SP2. I also noticed that System Restore has become non
 functional. I tried my level best to download SP2 directly from Microsoft; but I&nbsp;couldn't.&nbsp;So. I installed it i.e. SP2 manually. The Sp2 installation helped me download Windows Media Player9 only. All others were still out of my reach. Iâ€™m still unable to
 download other features like MSE, Zune, and Windows Updates including System Restore. Automatic updates donâ€™t turn on in spite of application of your suggested methods. Iâ€™ve come to know there are more such methods which helps overcome this problem. Please
 tell me how one can turn on Windows automatic updates in the case as mentioned above.</font></p>

<p>As far as I know a complete deletion isn't possible, but I've seen suggestions that you can call <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support</a>, they can help/advise in the things that are possible for 'deleting' an account.</p>

<h2>            Computer goes into power save mode at start-up</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a computer that I have recently installed Windows 10 on. Since upgrading to Windows 10, my computer goes into power save mode ~90% of the time when starting up. In order to start my computer, I have to press the reset button at which time the
 computer starts normally. There was no problem before upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have updated all my drivers. I have performed a clean-boot. I have shut off all services with the exception of Microsoft. Any help is appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sounds like when you turn off your PC its going to sleep rather than turning off.</p>
<p>This might be because your closing the lid before the PC turns off?</p>
<p>If so then you can go into Windows Power Plan Settings and turn off the feature to go to sleep when you close the lid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not the case then please check the following things;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Go into Windows Power Plan settings and check to see if when you press the power button it is set to go to sleep; if it is then disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Also in Windows Power Plan settings there is a&nbsp;feature Fast Start Up I would disable it; thought your PC might be slower however it could fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p />
