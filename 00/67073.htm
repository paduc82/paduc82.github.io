<h2>            mysterious E66..</h2>
                    
<p>I just got skyrim for christmas and went to play it. Low and behold error E66! After doing some searching about what the problem could be I found many people seem to be having the same problem. Xbox support was claiming it was only on "tampered" or "modded"
 systems.</p>
<p>Personally I have never opened or added software to my xbox and have been a loyal customer with xbox since their original console release. I have gotten the red ring of death and sent my box in to be serviced by xbox support once.</p>
<p>More support representatives are now saying the xboxs with e66 errors "need repair".. most forum posts theorize it's to do with the dvd drive. (you can tell which dvd drive you have by
<a href="http://www.llamma.com/xbox/Repairs/Images/DVDComparison.jpggthe%20way%20the%20tray%20looks%20when%20you%20open%20it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the way the tray looks when you open the tray to insert a disk</a>) I find that theory strange since my xbox 360 will play any other game I have (some newish titles as well). If it did need repair wouldn't I be getting this error message with any game I try
 to play. Seems to be a software problem.</p>
<p>Xbox support's only answer is for me to send in my system to be repaired. They are charging $123 cdn for this "repair". That is nearly the cost of a new xbox! (conspiracy?!) haha perhaps. Since no one has ever touched my system other than to play licensed
 titles on it I have no fear of sending in my system for repairs but can not justify spending so much fun what seems like a software error out of my control.</p>
<p>If xbox can't find a reasonable solution to this issue with it's members, who have been using their products withing user agreements, I foresee plenty of new loyal playstation customers. Including me...</p>

<p>Does your console work with games that pre-date Gears of War 3?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Gears of War 3, Modern Warfare 3, or Saints Row The Third, do any of those work?</p>

<p>my games are pre Gears of War 3. That seems to play to my idea that my xbox isn't the problem...
</p>
<p>I have already tried contacting them through Support. I was asked if I had modded or opened my xbox and when I stated no I had not I was told "it needs to be fixed" at nearly the cost of a new system. No, thanks. Especially not when it plays games just fine.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm still bitter from the whole red ring of death as well. Seems xbox has had some poor judgement with sending out product/updates which have put a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know anyone who's had similar problems with their sony. Well, besides
 that whole credit card thing but I feel sony jump on that right away and handled as well as compensated it's users for their mistakes.</p>

<p>Hey Quick! I checked on this error on our support site and it doesn't make any mention of console tampering. It does recommend that your console needs to be repaired, which you can set up online (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../repair-process</a>).
 Please let me know if you have any questions with this process, thanks! </p>

<p>side note before I start: boxing day sales today in my area had xboxs on sale for $129. only $6 more then getting mine shipped for repairs.</p>
<p>Mister Gwyther, I do appreciate reps, moderators and support staff monitor these forums and respond and for that thank you. I also realize you personally were not responsible for the errors. With that in mind...</p>
<p>Xbox support has no longer been claiming it's simply tampered xboxs though it is a question they asked me (and others) with regards to the e66 error code. Perhaps xbox now denies it was to sweep out modders (which would be fine by me since I am not one)
 but has cause problems with honest users within their user agreements.</p>
<p>It seems, other then Microsoft, common knowledge regarding this problem is that it's a firmware issue caused by updates with the dvd drives.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=484726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">E66: DVD Drive Error - Dvd drive pairing failure: DVD model, or version does not match that of the version expected by the dashboard. OR the firmware version on the drive is older then the
 firmware version expected by the dashboard. Make sure the DVD drive is of the same version originally included with the console and that it is using either the original firmware included with the console or newer. if drive can eject, read, and write under
 windows but errors on console, replacing original firmware should fix issue.</a>"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>"<a href="http://xbox-experts.com/errorcodes.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">E66 - Wrong DVD-drive version</a>"</strong></p>
<p>since no one other then xbox support has ever opened my xbox and no software has ever been change on it other then xbox update how could my dvd version be wrong? I couldn't... I just hope and wish Microsoft will own up to it's mistake and fix the problem
 before too many people are turned away from their product forever.</p>

<h2>            Cannot update to .NET Framework 4.0 from .NET Framework 3.5 SP1</h2>
                    I have tried three times to update .NET 3.5 SP1 to .NET 4.0. Each time it fails saying there is a fatal error. I have followed other various "fixes" as provided by the assorted communities and gotten nowhere. As a last resort, I attempted to run the .NET
 Framework Cleanup Utility Tool. It, too, failed. I am at my wits end and have put a similar post in other groups in hopes of finding a resolution to this. Windows Update is driving me crazy trying to update .NET 4.0 even though it does not exist. The .NET
 Framework Cleanup Utility Tool log error results are listed below. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>More than that&nbsp;your CBS.log is showing problems which are being attributed to having redundant corrupted profiles but strangely the only problem showing in your WER reports is some corruption detected by Boot File Servicing.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW notice that the timestamps in the WER reports predate the CBS.log so we just have to imagine seeing the same thing in your CBSPersist&nbsp; or other pieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is more discussion in the previous month's thread (which my post links to) about the profile corruption issue, including one poster's workaround.&nbsp; Also I think others on Answers have discussed this issue and included their workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for making me see how those two diagnostics correlate.&nbsp; Few people are including the WER reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your System log could be useful to you too but this one was two days old.&nbsp; E.g. if it was current what you could do is do a Find in it for&nbsp;the string
 (KB&nbsp; and then use a timestamp found that way to make sure that you were capturing the right piece of the CBS.log.&nbsp; In fact, there are some general details seen there which could be used to give general advice:&nbsp; both MBAMProtector and Norton products are seen
 loading during each boot.&nbsp; Consider uninstalling both before trying to do your problem updates.&nbsp; I'm not sure that would be enough to workaround the other issue but it might.&nbsp; Other posters have indicated that removing interferers&nbsp;helped them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be interested in knowing how to make WER reports more readable.&nbsp; One way is to use the View Reliability History tool on your OS.&nbsp; Another which works on the downloaded information is to Paste one (or more) items into a TechNet forum HTML Edit frame,
 Update that, then view the HTML again.&nbsp; Strange but true.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

            <p>I have not done the repair install yet but I did use DISM Restore Health from a mounted Windows 10 ISO download. &nbsp;The process finished without an error so I went back and tried a SFC scan and it also worked. &nbsp;That did not fix the cumulative update problem
 but it was progress. &nbsp;These are the log and summary files from today. &nbsp;My computer seems to be running fine but is not installing the cumulative update from April (KB3163018) and a Windows Defender update (which I don't use because of using another program).</p>

            <p>Okay,you mean the update reverts after a restart.Correct?</p>
<p>If it is,the only known fix is a repair install.Some say turning off AV and malwarebytes if you have work-you might have to try it 3 or 4 times to install the update.</p>

</p><p>This shows more of the same&nbsp; Boot File Servicing&nbsp; problems.&nbsp; Did you look at the other thread I referred to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I extracted&nbsp;items for 6/25/2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW they would be more convenient to sort if you used&nbsp;ISO date format and 24 hour time.&nbsp; In the case where the date is the same fortunately that doesn't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another option would be to use&nbsp; msinfo32.exe&nbsp; /nfo&nbsp;
 and save the file in that format instead of text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case here are some results for an analysis of that subset</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;paste&gt;</p>
<div>PS C:\&gt; $WER = Get-Clipboard<br />
PS C:\&gt; $WER25 = $WER | Select-String -Pattern "6/25/2016"<br />
PS C:\&gt; $WER25 | Measure-Object | ft Count -HideTableHeader</div>
<div>&nbsp; 172</div>

<div>PS C:\&gt; ($WER25 | Select-String -Pattern "bfs" | Measure-Object).count<br />
106<br />
PS C:\&gt;</div>
<p>&lt;/paste&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you can see that over half of yesterday's problems were associated with this issue.</p>

    <title>Realtek PCIE Card Reader Uninstall for Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Realtek PCIE Card Reader Uninstall for Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 10. However, I am continually running into a barrier. Windows 10 Setup is telling me I need to manually uninstall Realtek PCIE Card Reader. I uninstalled it in the programs. It's gone in the device manager. I've even tried
 deleting registry files relating to the reader. I cannot get it uninstalled enough for windows 10 to finish the installation. How can I fix this issue?

            <p>I took a differrent aproach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched for realtek in regedit, but instead of deleting the keys found I noticed that one of the folders was related to Windows 10 installation. The folder was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\UpgradeCompatibilityTemp\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inside, it has many {<a href="http://intra/arquivos-intranet/orcamento/PPA2016-19_para%20ALESP_21set15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">guid</a>} with apps that may have trouble with the upgrade.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Inside one of them I find the realtek one and it has a key with name ExeFullPath witch pointed me to the folder with rtspstor.sys file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the folder that contained that file (you maybe asked for admin permissions) and clicked in update on the windows installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installer then continued without hickups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this works.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the device is detected in device manager. Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>start</b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>In <b>run</b> box type in
<b>devmgmt.msc</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>And search by the name of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Check if the settings to share media in windows media player are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Change settings for sharing media in Windows Media Player</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-settings-for-sharing-media-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-settings-for-sharing-media-in-Windows-Media-Player</a></b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The article holds good for windows media player 11 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Check the protocol and the proxy settings of the player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Which protocols does Windows Media Player use for streaming?</b></p>

<h2>            Safe To Delete Temporary and Previous Windows Installation Files</h2>
                    <p>My brand new laptop came with Windows 10 Home 64bit. In September, 2106, there was a major update done on Windows 10 by MS. After that, I noticed System Restore turned off, Restore Points deleted and Temporary (4GB) and Previous Windows Installation (19GB)
 Files created. Is it safe to delete these two Windows via Disk Cleanup?</p>

<p>&nbsp;Joy Ride Turbo is "Achievement buggy".</p>
<p>I collected all 40 Crimson Park trophies and the achievement won't unlock too...</p>
<p>Some people have same problam, but in Perilous Park:</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_live_arcade/e_k/joy_ride_turbo/f/2536/t/369269.aspx</p>
<p>Its a 1200 ms points game, I expected more quality, or a patch to fix the achievements.</p>

<p>I join a online game in this "track", reinstall the game, light candles, nothing works to unlock this achievment.</p>

<p>Hi Mister Darcy.</p>
<p>I GUESS I were connected. I think about that, but I never play disconnected, except when there's some ISP problem. &nbsp;But still the achievement don't say you may be connected to earn.</p>
<p>No, I don't unlock any achievement since in Joy Ride Turbo, but, I figured out: what if it was the last achievement in the game?</p>
<p>I will try, by the way. Thanks</p>

<p>Were you able to try re-earning the achievement by chance? Sometimes this will be necessary if you are having issues getting them to unlock. It might also be a good idea to see if starting on a new save file to perform this achievement is any help. Let us
 know if it helps. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mister Rush.</p>
<p>There's no way to re-earn this, because since you collect the trophy, the trophy don't appear anymore, so, you can't collect "again"
</p>
<p>I don't find any way to "reset" the achievements and the game itself.</p>

            Hi Fastride,&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Could you tell us how many speakers are connected to your computer and have you installed any software to manage sound effects on your computer?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Also could you tell us whether you have installed the Sound Card drivers on your computer after installing Windows?</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>In solving the problem you can follow the link provided below.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Click Start, type Sound in the Start Search box. <br />
2. Click Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu. <br />
3. Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is Speakers. Make sure that your audio settings are configured as expected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow these steps: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. On the Playback tab.</div>
<div>2. Select the playback device.</div>
<div>3. Click Properties.</div>
<div>4. Click the Advanced tab.</div>
<div>5.&nbsp;Make sure that the Default Format is set to the value that you expect. When you finish,</div>
<div>5. close this window to return to the previous window.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default device, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Configure, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the sound settings are set correctly, and your speakers are already set as the default device.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>If the above steps doesn’t resolve the issue then you need to follow the steps provided below.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>You may try uninstalling the drivers for the sound card and then reinstalling the drivers.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2. In Device Manager, locate the device, right click on it and uninstall.<br />
3. Restart the computer.<br />
4. Let Windows 7 detect the drivers by itself and install. If that does not help, install the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</div>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />Is the image below what you are seeing when you say the virtual agent is showing?
<br />
<br />If so, that is the Microsoft Virtual Agent, you have not been hacked, that is shown in error on your system . .. 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts, Sign-In options
<br />
<br />In the Privacy section, if this option is turned on, turn it off - 'Use My sign-in Info to automatically finish setting up my device and . . . '

</p><p>I just not took the computer out of sleep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a screen up that had the look of a microsoft type of screen saying "Looks like your internet is down" with a picture of the network statues, computer - ethernet public network- globe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I close that screen and behind it was the virtual agent screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>curious. I followed the instructions you laid out.&nbsp; Any how.&nbsp; no blue screens so that's good.</p>

    <title>Unable to open shortcut&#58; Can&#39;t open this item. It might have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael a. grumbein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open shortcut&#58; Can&#39;t open this item. It might have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Do you want to remove this item&#63;</h2>
                    <p>original title: Can't open this item. It might have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Do you want to remove this item?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;just got a brand new Asus A53SV-TH71 notebook with&nbsp;WIndows 7 Home Premium x64. Within the first 24 hours of having this PC, I started having some problems with my shortcuts. I began getting the following error message everytime I clicked on&nbsp;a pinned taskbar
 item:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Can't open this item</p>
<p>It might have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Do you want to remove this item?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I right-click the pinned item icon and click on a file I have saved in the list, the file will open just fine. It's just that the program itself will not open when I click the icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>Also, when I double-click on a desktop shortcut or on a program listed in 'All Programs' in the Start menu, nothing happens: the program does not start and I get no error messages. The normal icons ('Computer.' 'Network,' 'Recycle Bin,' etc.) still work
 just fine; only program shortcuts do not work.</p>
<p>In any case, If I open 'Computer' and locate the programs manually, they open just fine. Everything that is installed on the PC works; it is just these shortcut functions that do not work (which is why I put this question in the&nbsp;'Desktop and Personalization'
 topic).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only changes I had made to the PC between the time it worked and the time I noticed the problem were Windows updates and installations of programs that I had before installed on my older&nbsp;desktop PC with Windows 7 Home Premium x64: changes that had caused
 no such problem on that PC.</p>
<p>I tried the Microsoft Fix It utility, but it found no problems. I tried System Restore, but to no avail. I tried doing the "sfc /scannow" function in the command prompt, and upon scan completion, it said that corrupt items were found but could not be repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are any suggestions to fix this issue, I will appreciate any help on the matter. Thank you all in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your efforts. In answer to your questions on the matter:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not make any changes to the target programs</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have made new shortcuts and pinned items, and they still do not work.</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Microsoft Fix It I used was the same one as you provided in the link (I tried your link just to make sure, and it was the same one and it yielded the same result).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I tried the elevated command prompt operation that you outlined (running it as Administrator and using the ‘sfc /scannow’ command), and got the same result as before.</p>
<p>Finally, I tried starting a new user account, and the new user account had the same problem.</p>
<p>As it stands, the problem has not been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any rate, thank you again for your time and effort. I highly appreciate your participation in this matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>I resolved my problem. Come to find out, the registry entry that tells&nbsp;Windows what to do with .LNK files (shortcuts) had been deleted. I probably
 did it by accident while installing and configuring my software. To fix it, I followed the instructions provided through this link:</p>

<h2>            Len2&#8217; Win 10 Home not able to connect to the Homegroup.</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original title: </strong></em>Local IP blocked but www DNS is fine
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 windows machines on my local network. Only 2 can talk to each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Win XP SP3</li><li><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>‘HP’ Win 10 Home <span>&nbsp;</span>Ver 10.0.10586 Version 1511 Build 10586.318 upgraded from Win 8 automatically</li><li><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>‘Len2’ Win 10 Home Ver 10.0.10586 Version 1511 Build 10586.318 bought new with hw</li></ul>
<p>XP &amp; Len2 are hard wired into local network. HP can be either wirelessly or hard wired attached.</p>
<p>HP &amp; XP can see and ping each other and the modem eg ‘ping 192.168.1.12’</p>
<p>HP &amp; XP can access equipment on local network by IP address from web browser</p>
<p>Len2 must go out onto the web to a remote DNS server and back to the local network to access the same security camera on the local network.</p>
<p>Len2 cannot access the modem via the web browser address 192.168.1.1</p>
<p>All 3 machines can access web resources via DNS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Len2 cannot ping HP or XP – it gives “General failure”</p>
<p>Len 2 cannot access local resources via web browser using IP address – it says “unable to connect”</p>
<p>HP &amp; XP cannot ping Len2 – it times out</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Len2, Private, Guest and All Networks are set to </p>
<p>“Turn Network Discovery on”</p>
<p>“Turn on file and printer sharing”</p>
<p>“Allow Windows to manage homegroup connections”</p>
<p>
</p><p>XP can share files with HP</p>
<p>Len2 will not share with anyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>‘Mouse without borders’ will not install – XP cannot find Len2 and Len2 cannot find XP</p>
<p>Norton – all machines have Norton 360 running</p>
<p>Firewalls – I have turned both firewalls (Windows &amp; Norton) off on Len2 – same result</p>
<p>I have connected XP and Len2 together with a simple hub (ie not thru the router/modem) – same result</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion – it would seem some setting in Len2 (Win 10) prohibits local addressing via IP address and only responds thru a DNS server. But what is it ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thank you for trying, but I have wasted many <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
more&nbsp; </span>hours following your suggestions on Homegroups, without avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is far more basic - I can not ping local devices from one Win10 device - from the other Win10 device I can ping as expected. This one troublesome system can only access things from web browser via DNS and not by IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact one of your entries states "Printers that are connected with a USB cable can be shared with a homegroup." This has NOTHING to do with my problem as my printers are
<p>
</p><p>Can I please ask you to review the initial question somewhat closer and provide suggestions as to why one Win10 system can ping others and one cannot ?</p>

            <p>No, my question has not been answered. In fact my updated post and question from June 3 seems to have been ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However further experimentation has shown that if I turn off '<span>password protected sharing for All networks' I can then ping the rest of the network and print on network attached
 printers. However I still cannot reach local IP addresses.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to have pwd protection turned on and would like to reach local IP

<h2>            CHKDSK Problem - chkdsk has been cancelled</h2>
                    
<p>Got new Dell N5010 laptop in July 1010.&nbsp; The first time I used the CHKDSK Utility, it ran fine.&nbsp; On the third attempt, after restarting CHKDSK began to run, but immediately after displaying the counter&nbsp;for pressing any key, it&nbsp;displayed CHKDSK has been&nbsp;cancelled,
 and&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;Windows.&nbsp; A Dell tech had me to download and run a&nbsp;fix (396288_intl_x64_zip.exe)&nbsp;from Microsoft RE Article KB975778.&nbsp; The fix worked because I was able to use CHKDSK four more times without any problems.&nbsp; However, CHKDSK is now doing that
 same problem again.&nbsp; I downloaded the same fix again, told the setup to overwrite the&nbsp;copy of the previously unzipped file&nbsp;(Windows6.1-KB975778-x64.msu),&nbsp;then&nbsp;the setup stated that all files had successfully unzipped.&nbsp; However, the fix did not work this time.&nbsp;
 Also, on searching I found file had been unzipped to OS(C):Users/JB/AppData/Local/VirtualStore.&nbsp; Please help me get CHKDSK working again.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

YOU must make a double click on the Windows6.1-KB975778-x64.msu to INSTALL the fix, not only unzip it!<br />

<h2>            Last Win 10 update, lot of old games stopped working</h2>
                    <p>10/26/15</p>
<p>After the last Win 10 update, a lot of my old games stopped working.&nbsp; I get window not compatible or the mouse is not working right anymore.&nbsp; I'm about to go back to win 7 or XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Microsoft update Win 10 I'm have more and more problem getting games from
 the XP era to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Star wars "empire at war" ; Stronghold 2 and the new Baldur Gate Enhanced have all stop working.&nbsp; I'm having issues with Divinity and with Axis and allies locking up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft test these update before they put they out there?</p>

<h3> ayondubey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 -&#62; File &#34;Open With&#34; dialog has different behavior from Win 7 &#34;Open With&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an application which used to work well in triggering the "Open With" Dialog to open files. However in Windows 10 this dialog is changed and it vanishes if it loses focus. Is this a new behavior added and if so, how can I handle it so it stays open
 on the top for user to choose what action to take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Hi Ayon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean. The "Open With" dialog is the same in windows 10 however the way you select your default apps in "Open With" has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now e.g. Notepad is shown automatically as an app to choose whereas in old windows you needed to select the actual .EXE file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One issue is if the file you are trying to open is a folder, the "open with" dialog is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is specific files you want to open with specific apps, can edit these apps in "Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs" in here you can select your default programs to open documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an issue that nothing works, it can be an issue with the registry. Then you need to create a registry file and ingest it into to your local registry like this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open notepad</li><li>When Notepad opens, paste the following into it
<ol>
<li>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\Open With]@=”{09799AFB-AD67-11d1-ABCD-00C04FC30936}”</li></ol>
</li><li>Click File &gt; Save as.</li><li>In Save as type section choose All Files.</li><li>In File namesection enter OpenWith.reg.</li><li>Click Save.</li><li>Now find the OpenWith.reg file and double click it to add its content to the registry.</li><li>After adding OpenWith.reg to the registry, Open With menu should start working again.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>Hi Henning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. The issue I have is I try to open the PNG file and to open it I go to the&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Registry ROOT -&gt; .png(pngfile) -&gt; Shell -&gt; Open -&gt; Command</p>
<p>but in some systems the Open-&gt;Command is missing . In this case I try to use shell32.dll and&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;::GetProcAddress(/*LoadLib(shell32.dll)*/lib_h, "OpenAs_RunDLL")<br />
So the the user selects the app to use. It seems that if the focus is moved from this popup, it considers it as a "cancelled by user"? Since I cannot see the popup to select the application in WIN10 (or may be it goes away very fast) but in WIN7 it was always
 open(in background window).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would you suggest I handle such case, is there any flag/option i can make use of so that it remains open even if the focus has moved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for you help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Ayon</p>

<p>Hi Henning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have tried that option, but the my program cannot find the details of that setting. Could you please suggest/guide where Windows is storing the information about the "preferred application", when we set a preferred program through control panel. I
 will update my code to access this information, since you suggested no open command can be found in the registry key where I am trying to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I am trying to accessing "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pngfile\shell\open\command"</p>

<br />
<br />Olá  ChicoCrevin
<br />
<br />Atendendo ao seu texto que merece a nossa melhor compreensão dado o prejuízo envolvido sempre que tem uma actualização sem ir de contra a sua decisão a minha sugestão será fazer nova actualização mas forçar updates do windows.
<br />
<br />Pois bem, os updates funcionam de forma programada. No seu computador já obteve a versão 1809 mas foram as iniciais, assim depois de a microsoft obter o feedback lança novas actualizações para corrigir os prováveis erros existentes.
<br />
<br />É nesta segunda actualização que consegue corrigir todos os erros que descreve.
<br />
<br />Pode fazer da seguinte forma como descrevo em baixo:
<br />
<br />Para forçarmos os update vamos proceder da seguinte forma:
<br />Aceder à pasta localizada no disco na directoria C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br /> - Apagar todos os ficheiros existentes na mesma. Alguns irão dizer que estão em uso e questionam para ignorar ou continuar. Seleccionar a opção "Ignorar para todos" caso pergunte mais que uma vez
<br />
<br />Em seguida abrir uma linha de comandos pelo menu "executar" em modo administrador: Escrever "CMD" e clicar com botao direito em cima, aparece a opção executar como administrador
<br />
<br />Escrever na linha de comandos o seguinte comando: 
<br />                                          wuauclt.exe /updatenow
<br />
<br />NOTA: SEM pressionar ENTER e deixar a janela ainda aberta
<br />
<br />De seguida ir a definições de windows; Actualizações e clicar no botão "procurar actualizações"
<br />
<br />Ao mesmo tempo que o windows procura as actualizações voltar à janela da linha de comandos e pressionar ENTER
<br />A correr tudo bem verá novas actualizações
<br />
<br />Se ainda assim continuar com problemas queira por favor solicitar nos ajuda. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Cumprimentos,
<br />Miguel Tomaz

<h2>            Microsoft 800 keyboard not working</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft 800 wireless keyboard and 1000 mouse. I bought this combo an year ago. Now the mouse works fine but the keyboard does not. I have changed USB drives, batteries and devices. Still the same. No way to reset. Can the connectivity be reset?

<p>I have the same problem. The microsoft&nbsp;keyboard 800 and mouse 1000 worked just fine on windows 8. I upgraded to windows 8.1 and it worked fine for a week and then the keyboard stopped working.</p>
<p>The mouse works just fine. On the keyboard 800 only the calc, mute and volume -+ buttons works, meaning that the batteries are ok and that wireless communication is also working, but the rest of the keys do not work.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Any news here?</p>

                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 - first on my laptop (where all apps show up) - and then on my desktop, but here I don't see any of the built-in apps, like Calendar, Mail, Store and News - I don't even have a calculator at the moment!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what this is all about, and how I can get the so-called built-in apps? I tried a couple of them on the laptop, and rather fancied them, so I'd like to use them on my desktop too.</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to search for the apps by typing the app name in the search box individually. If still unable to locate the apps, suggest to perform an in-place upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform an in-place upgrade, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Download the Windows 10 ISO file and make a bootable media.<br />

            <p>Hi, and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps are definitely nowhere to be found with search or any other method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the boot disc as you suggested, but when I try to launch, I get an error message that "this product key didn't work". I obviously only have one product key - the one I got with the computer, for Windows 7. Like I mentioned, I have already upgraded
 to Windows 10 via the "Get Windows 10" app, but with the mentioned missing features. When I search for the particular error message, I land on this page:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-errors-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-errors-windows-10</a>&nbsp;where
 I can't see any other solution than first going back to Windows 7 ... but I *can't* go back to Windows 7, because "the files needed were removed from this computer", according to the recovery settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm at my wit's end, here. I'm stuck with an only partly functioning Windows 10, can't go back to Windows 7 and start over, and can't use "repair this computer" to fix the current install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do about this?</p>

</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
