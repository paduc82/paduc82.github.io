<h2>            Hard Drive Enclosure - Disc needs to be formatted - I don&#39;t want to&#33;....and another error message</h2>
                    <p>My laptop died and will not reboot. I did not have a reboot disc but did try software downloaded from Windows to create a start up disc and got advice from this forum, however, nothing worked. All I wanted to do was to copy files to my new computer. One
 suggestion was to purchase an external hard drive compartment. I did this and removed my hard drive from the laptop and inserted it into the compartment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug it in to my new PC, the new drive shows up in Devices and Hardware, however, when I click on it I get a message saying "Hard drive needs to be formatted". Of course, i don't want to do this as this will wipe it clean and the entire purpose is
 to get files that I need or want. When I click cancel, I get the error message: "E:/ is not accessible. The volume does not contain a recognized file system. Please make sure that all file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, both the old laptop and the new PC are running Windows10, so there is no conflict there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made sure that the old hard drive is seated properly in the enclosure, I have made sure that there is power to the enclosure (as it does show in the Device manager). I'm just wondering why it won't recognize the old drive as having files on it and
 asking me to format the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I am simply doing this to copy files from the non-working laptop to the new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help!</p>

            Hi Greg.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible the hard drive died?  Did you run bootable diagnostics which are built into Dell (F12 key at boot) or HP (ESC key).  If not you can run Seatools installed from WIndows or from bootable media in the present PC or by putting it back in the old PC to boot the media and  know for sure the hard drive's condition:  
<br /><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/313457-seatools-dos-windows-how-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/313457-sea...</a>
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />If it tests out you may be better off installing it internally as the USB hub can be a hurdle for a pre-formatted hard drive especially. 
<br />
<br />Your  files should always be backed up if you value them at all because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn on File History to keep your files backed up incrementally to external hard drive.  However I would also use one of the other methods above to be safest:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-windows-10-file-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/how-to-create-an-image-backup-in-windows-10-and-restore-it-if-need-be.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/...</a>
<br />The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Andre, thank you for your help. Unfortunately, I tried each of your options and I keep getting the same results. What if I plug the enclosure in the USB port of the laptop this hard drive came from and started the computer. Is it possible that it may boot?

<h2>            Access Denied to second hard drive.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.&nbsp; I've had a second hard drive sitting around for a while now.&nbsp; I used to use it as my primary drive, but replaced it when I upgraded to a larger one.&nbsp; I finally decided to go out and buy another ATA cable to use the second hard drive for storage.&nbsp;
 After hooking everything up and booting up my PC, my computer seems to recognize the hard drive (it lists it Local Disk Q:), but it doesn't give any storage space info and when I try to access it, I get the "Access Denied" error.&nbsp; I've looked at a few different
 sites to find solutions.&nbsp; Many of them say to go into Safe Mode and try to change the permissions.&nbsp; However, when I did this, the second hard drive doesn't even show up in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I can't seem to figure out any solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should mention that I am doing this all with the Administrator profile.&nbsp; I've also tried checking in Device Management, but the HD doesn't show up there either.</p>

<p>Hi drkessence,</p>
<p>Dominic has some good advice.</p>
<p>You might want to double check the jumper settings on the secondary drive to make sure it's not set as master, as it likely was from your first setup.</p>
<p>If you are able, you might check to see if the device is showing up in the BIOS.</p>
<p>This will tell us if the hardware connection is good enough to try to connect with Windows.</p>
<p>You may have to read the book that came with your motherboard for more information.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can e solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t right-click on Local Disk &#40;C&#58;&#41;</h2>
                    Ok, so I tried to right click on my Local Drive (C:) in the Explorer to get to Properties, but the menu won't come up. Windows Explorer just crashes and I get a message that say "Windows Explorer has stopped working..." I can still left-click on it and
 access all the information on the drive. I tried restarting the computer, but it does the same thing. I tried going to File in the toolbar to get to Properties that way, but it doesn't do anything at all then. I'm stumped!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi andfedo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a classic case of 3rd party shell extensions problem. Right-click crashes/delay are caused by third-party shell extensions. To identify the culprit, you need to use an utlity like ShellExView, and disable non-Microsoft context menu handlers one by
 one (or disable items in a batch) and observe.</p>

            Some security programs prevent changes to their files and have to be configured to allow System Restore to work.&nbsp; For example, if your computer has Norton Antivirus or Norton Internet Security, you must&nbsp;<a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">turn

<div>System Restore is a frequent target for malicious software attacks. &nbsp;If SR was&nbsp;working before and is now afflicted, run some scans and then resolve any remaining&nbsp;issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is the issue you have that compels you to use System Restore in the first place (or are you just practicing)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep in mind that System Restore is not a time machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It could be that some other application is keeping SR from working, so Microsoft hints that you should boot your system in Safe Mode and then implement your System Restore. &nbsp;While booted in Safe Mode, applications that may be interfering with SR may not
 be loaded and then your SR might just work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unless you are practicing SR, even if SR works, I would still be&nbsp;suspicious&nbsp;of the condition of your system. &nbsp;SR is not a time machine (it is worth saying twice).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your system is infected, my recommendation would be to clean it up and whack all but the latest of your old RPs and start your Restore Points anew, but first you have to get stabilized.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection&nbsp;programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>

            Norton Internet Security is just one example of security programs that have to be configured to allow System Restore to work. What antivirus or Internet security program do you have?

<h2>            Accessing input data in C-disk to work on SPSS AMOS 23</h2>
                    I bought a software download of SPSS AMOS 23 online (after the license of a previous one I had on my computer expired). &nbsp;I logged in the 12-month license key I received OK. &nbsp;After I sketched a graphic model, AMOS could no longer access the input data file
 located in my C-disk. &nbsp;I got as message indicating something like: "AMOS not authorized to access C\ location...." (I'no not sure about the exact text of the message). &nbsp;Please help! I'm on a fixed schedule to analyze survey data!&nbsp;

                    <p>I have recently found that my external sound card does not work in games and Winamp.</p>
<p>Example of games :</p>
<p>Age Of Mythology (works if sound card is in Stereo Mode)</p>
<p>South Park - The Stick of Truth(Does not work in any configuration I have tried 16bit 44.1khz to 24bit 192khz)</p>
<p>Both installed from Steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in Winamp, it only works if I choose Stereo mode. I play Winamp quite a lot so I'm sure it was working sometime back with my 5.1 setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same sound card works fine in Flash and HTML5 players and Video players like VLC.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Power OFF (not just restart)&nbsp;and let it sit for 3 minutes + to allow a hardware reset.<br />
<br />
Then proceed :<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point 1st so you can get back to where you were if needed.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Do<br />
same for Network Card (NIC) - Then Right Click on both&nbsp;Devices and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will
<br />
refresh the driver stacks.<br />
<br />
Now go look at System maker's site for updated drivers.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as
<br />
Vista loves updated drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Let reset your TCP/IP Stack just to be sure :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp; - find at top of list and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter these one at a time (or copy and paste)&nbsp;and hit enter after each<br />
<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
<br />
netsh int reset all<br />
<br />
netsh int ip reset <br />
<br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
Reboot<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
Other tips :<br />
<br />
If using a wired cable -<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Network Adapter -&nbsp;(NIC) - double click Advanced&nbsp;Tab &nbsp;and set the
<br />
"Speed &amp; Duplex" to 10 mbps full duplex and then try 1/2 duplex. Be sure to APPLY / OK. Maybe some<br />
help here : (remember the answer is complicated since there is likely more than one single thing causing
<br />
the issue) <br />

<br />
There are many causes one of which is the little monitor is paying attention to the wrong network device.<br />
You can try disabling any other network device such as WiFi and rebooting to see if that has an affect.<br />
<br />
Even a hardware issue such as a loose network card&nbsp;that is not secured properly in the computer can
<br />
cause this.<br />

<h2>            User account keeps getting disabled when someone else signs in.</h2>
                    <p>So my issue is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;User a logs into windows (7) &nbsp;in the morning no issues, they lock their screen to leave for a moment , someone come in behind them and logs into their account no issues logs out or locks PC. 1st user comes back and their account now has been disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Second users did not accidentally try to log into 1st users account.</p>
<p>Second (subsequently any other user but 1st) users(s) can still log in and out of PC just fine</p>
<p>1st user did not mistype password 3 times</p>
<p>only this users account is affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am being told its a pc issue not a security issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;This PC is part of a Network</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas?</p>

<p>There is no way to decrease your gamerscore. Even mods and hacks work to increase gamerscore. That is just the way that the system is set up.</p>
<p>MS can and will reset gamerscore for cheaters, but they do not reset the scores of individual games (and I am not sure if it would even be possible). There gamerscore resetting policy is all or nothing.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Basic vs  Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>We have an educational license for Office 365; however, we have a number of part-time programs where&nbsp;these individuals will be using machines that have their own copies of Office and are sometimes administrated by their school system.&nbsp; As such, students
 do not want to install the full office 365 for business; however, we would like to use Skype for Business as an online learning tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific features we don't at this point feel are important is co-authoring documents.&nbsp; Is there a list of features, online method for us to make use of Skype for Basic for this?&nbsp; Is there a list of features?&nbsp; Are there issues we should be aware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't really locate a clear list of Skype for Business/Skype for Business Basic which includes the information we need.</p>

<p>Hi Shelly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business Basic is a free download that has a minimum set of features: instant messaging (IM), audio and video calls, online meetings, availability (presence) information, and sharing capabilities.<br />

<p>Thanks Ronnie;</p>
<p>I eventually fixed the problem on two different machines both running Windows 7 Ultimate. The steps were;</p>
<p>1) Stop windows update loading the recent update for the J6410</p>
<p>2) Use HPs tool for stripping out all HP printer software.</p>
<p>3) Cleaned up the registeries.</p>
<p>4) Loaded the minimum drive suite from HPs page <a href="http://search.hp.com/gwukeng/query.html?lang=en&amp;qp=&amp;hps=Home&amp;qt=J6410&amp;la=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;hpr=http%3A//www8.hp.com/uk/en/home.html&amp;hpa=http%3A//www.hp.com/country/uk/en/contact_us.html&amp;charset=utf-8&amp;hpn=Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>from the driver page <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-79315-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;os=4062&amp;product=3635396&amp;sw_lang=&amp;key=null&amp;site=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-79315-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=uk&amp;os=4062&amp;product=3635396&amp;sw_lang=&amp;key=null&amp;site=null</a></p>
<p>Worked fine even identifying printer via network not via USB.</p>
<p>So far the installation has been stable.</p>
<p>If you dont clean things up using the HP clean up tool HpAiOScrubber_v2038 you always get the error and if you let windoows load its own J6410 driver it works vis USB but not via network connection.</p>
<p>The full suite for this printer still will not load but you can, after carrying out the basic installation above then add the software piece but piece to get the full suite.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, I hope this answer helps others HP were not helpful.</p>

<blockquote>I cannot download hp officejet 6400 series, with windows 7.&nbsp; Iy says the operating system is not compatible.</blockquote>
Hi<br />
<br />
According to the HP support website, the OfficeJet 6400 series will have fully compatible drivers, but they will not be ready until late January 2010.<br />
<br />
Until then, they recommend using the drivers that come with Windows 7, using the instructions at the following link.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01887433&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;os=4062&amp;product=3635396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Installing the Product with the USB Cable and Using the Driver Located in Windows 7 Until the Product Driver is Available for Download
 HP Officejet J6410 All-in-One Printer - HP Customer Care (United States - English)</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>Thank You for using Windows 7

            <p>Hey there hhdavid,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue with syncing your saves. Let's check a few things to narrow this down. Does the issue persist when using both wired or wireless network connections on the console?</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Run a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/slow-performance-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Detailed Network Statistics</a> test on the Xbox One console and please provide the following information.</p><p><br /></p>
<ul>

<li> Packet Loss %</li>
<li> Wireless Strength (if applicable)&nbsp;</li>
<li> Modem Manufacturer</li>
<li> Router Manufacturer (if being used) as well as the model number</li>
</ul>
<p>That information will help us determine the next best steps. Thanks!</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>I had this problem on 1 of 4 machines and came to the conclusion that it was a faulty install, so I gave up and reinstalled Windows 10 from scratch using the
<strong>media creation tool. </strong>Found on: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 to create a bootable USB stick with the Windows 10 Anniversary edition on it. The I used it to boot the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what is known as a clean install which I installed in the same partition as the prior version. It was Version 14393.0. Updating via Windows update to .105. It solved the facebook app problem, but I had to reinstall all of my programs, apps and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all seems well.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 - Issue with searching within PDF files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Issue with searching within PDF files</h2>
                    I was missing the content of PDF files in my search results so I came accross the description Adobe has on his page:
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/pdf-search-breaks-110-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/pdf-search-breaks-110-install.html</a>. I did as instructed but still no results... Then I examined the "file types" tab in the advanced indexing
 options. There I found out that pdf was missing completely. So I added pdf again and enabled content indexing. However now I see that it's only a "plain text filter" which is available. As far as I know (and that's what Adobe states as well) Windows 8 has
 an own filter. Why isn't it available? Any way how to reanable this filter?

            <p><span>Hi Thomas,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you referring the search option in the charms bar?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you set Adobe PDF viewer as the default viewer for PDFs?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings. You have mentioned that in the advanced indexing settings, the PDF extension shows only ‘plain text filter’ instead of the ‘reader
 handler filter’. In this case, I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, I would suggest you to make sure that the built-in PDF viewer is set as the default viewer to view PDF files. Refer to this article for more information on setting default programs
 to open a file type:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you run the search and indexing troubleshooter and check:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press
<b><i>Windows key +F</i></b> to bring up the <b><i>search</i></b> Charms bar.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select
<b><i>settings</i></b> in the drop down menu below search and type <b><i>Troubleshooting</i></b>.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on
<b><i>Troubleshooting </i></b>and select the <b><i>view all</i></b> option on the left pane.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on
<b><i>search and indexing</i></b> troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the above steps didn’t help, I would suggest you to completely uninstall the Adobe software and then reinstall
 the Windows PDF viewer and check. Refer to the section ‘reinstall the app’ in this article:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was referring to the search in the Explorer window (sorry, still an "old School guy")...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I set the Windows Reader as default, no change</p>
<p>The steps to run the troubleshooting seem to be a bit different on Windows 8.1 but I found it, however it didn't identify any issue.</p>
<p>So I uninstalled the Adobe PDF Reader, uninstalled Windows Reader, installed Windows Reader again, checked the indexing options: The Windows Reader is set to be the default app for .pdf, however still only the plain text indexer is available...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any other idea? I personally don't like the idea to go on third party solutions like Foxit...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Your problem is caused by the silly Hewlett Packard idea of making the HP Tools partition visible. This serves no purpose at all but irritates users. To fix the problem, run the Disk Manager (diskmgmt.msc), right-click the Tools partition, then remove its
 drive letter. This will have no effect on the operation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel unsure about this operation, start by creating a manual System Restore point so that you can back out gracefully.</p>

            <p>It is not really the fault of HP but the way Windows reports disk space. HP Tools file set requires a set amount of disk space, just under 2GB. This would never increase so HP have only allocated sufficient disk space to take the files, it would be wasteful
 to give it more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Windows requires a certain amount of free space for maintenance so even though the disk is big enough for its purpose it flags up as an error. You can stop the error status through a registry mod but this will affect all disks.</p>

<p>Windows reports this "problem" only when a drive letter is assigned to a partition. Since there is no need to assign a letter to the Tools partition, why does HP do it?</p>

            <p>Because Windows will assign a drive letter automatically to any standard partition. If there is a problem with HPs configuration it is that the partition type could be changed to prevent that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the issue is&nbsp;that Windows treats the drive as having a problem when it does not, it is working exactly as intended. Removing the drive letter does not remove the supposed fault just removes it from view. In this case there is no fault in the 1st
 place, the drive requires no maintenance so requires no free space. A CD-ROM has no free space but is not flagged as faulty</p>

            <p><em>Because Windows will assign a drive letter automatically to any standard partition.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; I beg to disagree. Windows does not assign letters automatically to standard partitions. You can have any number of FAT or NTFS partitions without a drive letter. They will remain so until you manually assign a letter. Please give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Removing the drive letter does not remove the supposed fault just removes it from view.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Again I disagree. A full partition is not a "fault" but it generates a warning. The warning is only issued while a drive letter is assigned. Without a drive letter there is no warning. You can easily test this yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>A CD-ROM has no free space but is not flagged as faulty.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This is irrlevevant. We are talking about hard disks, not optical media.</p>

            <p>Take a disk with partitions from one&nbsp;computer and fit it to another, it will be assigned partition letters in the 1st instance. They will not be the letters from the original PC, they are issued letters by the running O/S. If that disk is an operating system
 disk even the System Reserved which not have had a drive letter will get one, The running Windows assigns letters as required. There are rules as to how letters are issued by default, Windows just introduced the option to modify them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is drives can exist with being flagged as requiring maintenance and therefore free space. With the advent of super large disks the arbitrary 15% leads to several hundreds of Gigabytes "unusable" and even this is unmodifiable.</p>

<p>Sine the drive letter assignments are kept in the registry, what you say is patently obvious. However, it is also irrelevant because the OP is not moving this disk from one machine to another.</p>

<p>I get the impression that things were moved about on this machine, that it is no longer in the condition it was in when delivered by HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to move the boot files to a different partition. However, this requires a good deal of expertise and can easily make your machine unbootable. An easier and completely safe method consists of moving your paging file to drive C:. Here is the
 path to follow: Control Panel / System / Advanced / Performance Settings / Virtual Memory Change. Now set the radio button to "No paging file" for all drives except C:. On drive C:, use "System managed size". You must click "Set" for each individual action.
 After rebooting, the paging file should be on drive C:, giving you some breathing space on drive E:.</p>

<h2>            Blue screen with igdkmd.sys</h2>
                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having a blue screen of death about every day or every two days since last month. I didn't install anything new before the first time it happened. I am using an Asus laptop (UX32VD) with windows 7 professional.<br />
It seems it comes from the file&nbsp;<span>igdkmd64.sys, part of Intel graphics drivers. I have updated this driver, done every other windows update and I also updated the BIOS to the last version, but the problem still happens.</span></div>
<div>See the analysis from WinDbg of the dumps of two different crashes below.<br />
Thanks for your help.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            pop up error</h2>
                    i recently up graded my Gateway FX6840-15e to windows 8/8.1
<div>I understood the AMD catalyst was not working with 8/8.1 so I removed it. and solved one error message.</div>
<div>My new problem is a pop up window with a yellow triangle and exclamation mark inside it. This just says device is not supported by current operating system have been through all the drivers and all say they are working correctly and updated to the latest
 version. Gateway offers no support for this system with the upgrade in windows. It only offers support for windows 7 premium which is what came with the system. any help is much appreciated.</div>

            <p>Hi Glenn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you see a yellow exclamation point next to a device in Device Manager? </p>
<p>2. Where exactly do you see the pop up message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A yellow exclamation point next to a device in Device Manager means that Windows has identified a problem of some kind with that device.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The yellow exclamation mark provides an indication of a device's current status and could mean that there is a system resource conflict or a driver issue.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter: <br />
a. Press “Windows key + W”.<br />
