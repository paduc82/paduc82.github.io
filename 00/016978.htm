            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have table of centre coordinates and radius of about 200 circles.&nbsp; They are not overlapping but they will reside inside three concentric circles with centre at 0,0. I can easily do concentric circles using row(indirect) to define a small angle and ploy
 the points in the graph. I can also manually create each circles as one series but this will take a very long time to define one series by one series&nbsp;with x, y ranges. In addition to this that the number of circles vary for each time I run the excel application.
 So I need to dynamically delete the old series and create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very good at creating chart VBA, but can write simple VBAs. Perhaps time is easily done by someone with good knowledge of writing vba to create charts. By the way I like to place the chart in the worksheet and not as a separate sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Bernard,</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick reply, but I am looking for a solution without generating coordinates for all the circles. I need to cretate upto 200 circles and prefer a solution using VBA to generate series of non-concentric circles using a table containing x,y
 of centre and radius. The VBA need to delete old series of circles and generate new ones as number of circles to generate varies each time I use the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appriciated.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>The problem still persist. &nbsp;I have decided to writxvalues and values as named ranges using vba and then link it to chart series. The problem is that it's not easy to keep track of the series index as adding/ deleting using vba apper to be inconsistent. &nbsp;I
 need a robust routine to make it more reliable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same issues. Syncing used to work. I use OneNote on a Dell running Microsoft and also on an ipad pro to take notes.&nbsp; I went to geek squad and they tried a bunch of things. It looks like both devices are not syncing to onedrive correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried reinstalling app, deleting credentials and signing back in/out. Please help. Where can we call, I have wasted days trying to figure this out and have already lost a lot of data attempting to fix this on my own. Calling Microsoft was unhelpful
 as the line punts you to a recording that says go to the internet and hangs up on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two devices used to sync fine. The more I mess with it (or other people try to fix it) the more it seems to mess it up</p>

<p>OK, for what it's worth I found a workaround for my situation but it's ugly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my situation, it was showing me about half a dozen specific notes that it couldn't sync in one of my notebooks.&nbsp; I segregated those to a different 'temporary holding' notebook and then thankfully the main notebook resumed syncing correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But every time I attempted to move back one of the other notes, the sync broke again.&nbsp; It never said why, just that it couldn't sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reorganized my main notebook to have many more sections and section groups, thereby reducing the number of notes I had in each section.&nbsp; Somehow, that allowed the sync to occur even after putting back *all* of the notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have had to manipulate the notebook layout this way, but at least it worked for me.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to get in gear and fix this long-standing issue, but hopefully at least my method will work for someone else too.</p>

            Thank you for posting! &nbsp;I'm actually in the process of doing just this so your positive outcome is encouraging. &nbsp;However, how did you know which specific note was giving you an error? &nbsp;I don't think I've seen that just a general error for the entire folder
 itself. &nbsp;

<p>I don't think it shows the info on my iPad Pro, but on my MacBook in the upper right-hand corner there's a small icon looks like a bell.&nbsp; When I clicked on that it actually enumerated all the specific notes it was having problems with.&nbsp; I don't think it
 used to do this; just after I upgraded to a new version of OneNote a month or so ago... maybe check for an update if the option doesn't appear there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; I'm a huge fan of OneNote but these bugs drive me up the wall and make me nervous about trusting the tool with my important notes in general.&nbsp; Isn't syncing kind of job #1 for a note taking tool? :)</p>

            I followed someone's advice above and figured it might be an issue with having too many big files in to few folders. &nbsp;So, I broke up my categorization system to make even smaller chunks of information. &nbsp;Instead of having two main folders I have 6 for example.
 &nbsp;I think that helped it deal with the information. &nbsp;Previous to this, however, I had to clear out space on my laptop because I have too little memory and I worried it was't allowing it to sync because of that. &nbsp;So, I would check on that--it *might* be related.
 &nbsp;Once I freed up space on my laptop, and broke my files up into much smaller folders, it all synced rather quickly. &nbsp;1 of my notes did end up being corrupted though. &nbsp;Not sure how that happened, but it can no longer load in OneNote and the contents also do
 not appear on the site. &nbsp;Bummed about that, but happy it wasn't a worse issue. &nbsp;best of luck.

<h2>            Activation Failure After Refresh</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a full reset on my laptop this morning whilst on build 10532 all from the update &amp; security tab in windows - deleted everything including personal files and all was going smoothly until we got to activation - Windows won't activate with error Error code:
 0xC004C003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i'm still on 10532 surely the product key would already be preloaded - how can I reset it so it activates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Did you sign in with your original MSA that you used to become an Insider? were you an Insider before July 15 and on build 10240? that code is also linked to network (slow-dropping-intermittent) if on a wireless try&nbsp;a wired network cable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Yeah I've been on the insider programme since Feb/March - looking at the windows feedback it looks like this is a known fault of the build but the last post was 2 weeks ago and wondered if anyone on here had found a workaround?<br />

            Only reason I asked about being on the original MSA is your profile is saying you just signed up, and Preview builds won't activate until the original MSA signs in on an active internet. Googled that code found a few tips most dealing with internet connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I find it absurd that there is no inbox forwarding for K1 plans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, why isnt there a more descriptive response in OWA when trying to add a rule to the account than: &nbsp;</p>
you don't have permission to update specified options
<p>really? You can do better MS!</p>
<p>Hopefully this email will save someone the pain I went through to find the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to mass select emails to recover back to inbox</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally deleted hundreds of emails in my Hotmail inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to deleted items folder they were not there. However the option to 'recover deleted items' was available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the link and all my emails were in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot see a way to mass select all those emails to restore them to the inbox. I cannot go through individually clicking as there are literally hundreds!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Ctrl + A but this did not seem to work. There must surely be away to restore all of them back? Please can someone help, thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can restore the deleted items in Outlook.com by selecting the items one by one. To select multiple items, hold the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> while clicking the items you want to recover. </p>
<p>

<h2>            &#34;This is Not A Valid File Name&#34; message when trying to save a Word document</h2>
                    Last year, after Office for Mac 2011 suddenly started sending a "This is not a valid file name" message whenever I tried to save a Word document, I uninstalled it. Yesterday I purchased a new copy, installed it, was amazed to find my old files .... and
 now, when I try to open or save any of those documents, I am getting the same message. The message also suggest two fixes: Check the path to make sure it was typed correctly and Select a file from the list of files and folders. I spell correctly, have no idea
 what a path is, and no clue what the "Select a file from the list of files and folders" means. I have found reference to this message in several places online -- lots of people seem to be getting it -- but am not technical enough to figure out what to do.
 If someone could tell me, IN PLAIN ENGLISH A NON COMPUTER PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND, PLEASE DON'T USE MICROSOFT-ESE - what to do to fix this, I would be most appreciative.&nbsp;

<h2>            Appy Geek App will not run, says &#34;Error No connectivity&#58; you need an internet connection to use this app&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Only options I get are to close or try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a desktop with wireless capability (currently turned off but get the same if connected via Wi-Fi without Ethernet) and connecting via Ethernet to broadband router.</p>
<p>Current build rs1_release 14342. PC model HP P6-2019UK with 6GB ram.</p>
<p>Appy Geek has not been running over the last few builds.</p>
<p>Tried a reset my&nbsp;PC (without transferring data) hoping that would get me back to standard but still have issues.</p>
<p>Have also tried uninstalling / re-installing App. Other Apps running fine. Have another machine with Appy Geek running fine so assume it is a local PC issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of in-installing and clearing any local cache of data / settings?</p>
<p />

            In a further attempt to resolve the issue, I rebuilt my machine from a downloaded ISO image, going to the store I was not able to find the app by searching.<br />
Looking on the net I found a link which then brought me back to the store but said the app was "not currently available".<br />
Signing in to the store, it then said I owned this app and could install it, I installed it and it failed straight away.<br />
Checking on the official Appy Geek site, it showed links to the Apple, Google and Amazon but not to Windows store.<br />
I'm forced to conclude that the app is not available for new users (may still work for previously installed situations) and it will not work until and if AppyGeek update the app to work with W10.<br />
Assuming this is the case, would it be possible to put some information in the store about supported apps as I have now rebuilt my machine twice&nbsp;and feeling a little peeved. On the plus side Edge is not crashing as badly as before but did&nbsp;have a hiccup forcing
 me to re-type this in again when it lost&nbsp;this post.&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have gone through the app on Windows store, I have not found the app on the store and also you can contact Appy geek developer. For the other apps, I would like to inform you that even if you rebuild
 your machine you will be able to use all the apps using the same Microsoft user account in 5 different device.

<span>Hope this information is helpful for you. If you need further assistance on Windows let us know, we will be glad to help you</span>

<p>I just had this problem now on a tablet running Windows 10. Hadn't realised this but had done same as above, googled and installed the app as could not find it in the store, getting no connectivity message. This works on another tablet where it had been
 installed long time ago. </p>

<h2>            &#60;Remove&#62; element in ODT config.xml is not functional</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to develop a script so I can uninstall Office2013 ProPlus on a users computer and install Office2016 ProPlus. &nbsp;I'm not having much luck with the uninstalling of Office 2013. &nbsp;I've tried a variety of config files and options within the config files.
 &nbsp;I've included my current install path. It install Office Pro Plus, VIsio and Project successfully. &nbsp;The uninstall fails to uninstall any of the software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be same issue as was described here:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/256683,&nbsp;but no real resolution was provided. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I installed office C2R using this config file:</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Add SourcePath="UNCl\apps\Microsoft\Office_2013\ProPlus\" OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="ProjectProRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="VisioProRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;/Add&gt;<br />
&lt;Remove&gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Remove&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Updates Enabled="TRUE" UpdatePath="" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Logging Name="C2RLog(*).txt" Path="%temp%" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>

<p>When I try to uninstall I get the same results as described in this Archived post:</p>

<p>hi jnickell,</p>
<p>according to your detailed information and configuration files, i tried to reproduce the situation, and i uninstalled the office successfully. i would like to share my steps with you for this scenario.<br />
1. firstly, i copied your config file for installation to the newly downloaded file
<strong>configuration.xml</strong>. then downloaded and installed the office application successfully.<br />
2. i copied to your config file for uninstallation to the<strong> same configuration.xml</strong> (deleted the old commands), then run the command to run the config file to uninstall the office application, it promted to uninstall office after that. see my
 screenshots:</p>

<p>I have been specifying a config file parameter after the /configure. &nbsp;i.e. &nbsp;/configure \\UNC\uninstallConfig.xml and a different config file when installing. &nbsp;Is this the wrong approach. &nbsp;It has worked for installing repeatedly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi jnickell,</p>
<p>we can specify a configuration file parameter after the /configure command.</p>
<p>about the issue, i’d like to confirm whether you are using the 2013 version of odt. generally, we need to use the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 2013 odt</a> to uninstall office 2013.</p>
<p>in addition, please try saving your configuration file to the local instead of a network location and then check the outcome.</p>
<p>moreover, i have tested the following configuration file (modified your file to delete the “_<strong>en-us_x-none</strong>”) and it can also work properly on my side, for your reference:</p>
<p><br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;display level="none" completionnotice="no" suppressmodal="yes"/&gt; --&gt;<br />
&lt;!--&lt;setting id="setup_reboot" value="never" /&gt;--&gt;<br />
&lt;remove&gt;<br />
&lt;product id="<strong>o365proplusretail</strong> "&gt;<br />
&lt;language id="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/product&gt;<br />
&lt;product id="<strong>projectproretai</strong>l"&gt;<br />
&lt;language id="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/product&gt;<br />
&lt;product id="<strong>visioproretail</strong>"&gt;<br />
&lt;language id="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/product&gt;<br />
&lt;/remove&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>you can&nbsp;also try this simple configuration file and share us the result. for your reference:

    <title>Turn off AutoComplete for hyperlinks in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walter_l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off AutoComplete for hyperlinks in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of our users regularly create hyperlinks to specific pages of other documents. They are facing an issue&nbsp;that the hyperlink AutoCompletes to a hyperlink that was previously created. This usually happens unnoticed which causes the hyperlinks to be fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce this issue, see the following example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a blank Word document in Word 2010</li><li>Type in Link 1, press enter and type in Link 2</li><li>Select Link 1, click it with the right mouse button and choose hyperlink. Copy and paste the following address:<br />
http://test.link.nl/page=12</li><li>Select link 2, click it with the right mouse button and choose hyperlink. Copy and paste the following address:<br />
http://test.link.nl/page=1</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When performing step 4, you will notice that the hyperlink will autocomplete to "../page=12". See image below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eafc1260-37ce-4b32-9f07-4f393be5fe7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eafc1260-37ce-4b32-9f07-4f393be5fe7c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To try prevent this behavior, we turned of "Show AutoComplete suggestions" on the advanced options tab. Additionally,&nbsp;we turned off the autocorrect feature "Replace text as you type". None of these changes had effect on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to prevent Word 2010 from AutoCompleting these hyperlinks?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are able to reproduce the issue about autocomplete option in Word. The autocomplete link option is related to Internet Explorer options. Kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Content </strong>tab.</li><li>Under <strong>AutoComplete</strong>, click on the <strong>Settings </strong>button.</li><li>Uncheck all items, and then click on the <strong>Delete AutoComplete History...
</strong>button.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK </strong>button.</li><li>Close all windows and check if the issue persists in Word 2010<strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps above helped you to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Janeane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed all applications and then followed your suggested steps. Then, I repeated the steps I mentioned earlier to reproduce the issue. Unfortunately it had no effect. The link
<strong>http://test.link.nl/page=1</strong> was AutoCompleted to <strong>../page=12
</strong>as seen in the image in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have additional suggestions to resolve the issue.</p>

    <title>Field Code For Accessing Chapter Number from Heading Style Level 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenburrows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Field Code For Accessing Chapter Number from Heading Style Level 1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to fine-tune a Word 2016 Mac template to include an autotext entry for inserting mathematical equations. &nbsp;I am using this template to write a dissertation and I am composing this document in pieces (separate chapter files) which I hope to combine
 later into one document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to enter mathematical equations with equation numbers, which I would like to be formatted as 'C-NN', where 'C' is the chapter number and 'NN' is the equation number within the chapter. &nbsp;In order to get these equation numbers to appear on the right
 side of the page, I am using the technique of creating a one-row, three column table with invisible grid lines. &nbsp;I would like to set up field codes in the right-most table cell to extract the current chapter number from the level-one heading, and append a
 sequential equation number with a hyphen separator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What field code would I use to prepend the level-one chapter number to these equation numbers? &nbsp;I don't want the word 'Chapter' to show up in the equation number. &nbsp;Presently I am thinking that I will just have to type the chapter numbers in manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I already know how to embed a field code for attaching an equation number that increments by one count for each new equation. &nbsp;How can I prevent these equation numbers from resetting when I combine the chapters? &nbsp;For example, if the last equation of Chapter
 2 is equation (2-10) and I want the first equation of Chapter 3 to be (3-1), is there any way to prevent the Chapter 3 equation (3-1) from becoming (3-11) in the final, merged document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is there a way to make these equation numbers show up in a table of equations for the front of the dissertation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included a screenshot of a page with the equation table (I put the grids back in temporarily). &nbsp;The hyphen in the equation number shown below &nbsp;is my separator. &nbsp;I presently plan to just type in the chapter numbers manually.</p>
<p>

<p>I think Daniel's answer + your \r switch for resets nails it, but just for clarification, when you are using the built-in Heading styles Heading 1 etc. and you use Heading 1 as your "chapter" heading, you can use&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ SEQ EquationChapter \s 1 }</p>
<p>
</p><p>to restart the EquationChapter sequence at each new Heading 1 paragraph, regardless of whether Word's automatic numbering is being used to number the chapters or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are actually using Word's automatic numbering for the chapters, the way Word itself does this kind of thing is to use</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ STYLEREF 1 \s } </p>
<p>
</p><p>for the chapter number instead of a SEQ field. In this case, the "1" is a shorthand for "Heading 1". which makes the document slightly more portable across different language versions of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact when you have automated chapter numbering with the chapter-caption numbering option, that's what Word inserts, when you use References-&gt;Insert Caption. (Have a look at the Numbering: Format.... options and take note of the option to exclude the Caption
 label. Also worth knowing that the character it inserts when you specify a - separator is a special hyphen of some kind (non-breaking or some such, I forget). Captions in that format will be picked up by the ToC field code inserted using the References-&gt;Insert
 Table of Figures option (which AFAICR uses the \c option to specify the SEQ sequence name you want to list - e.g. if you use SEQ EquationNumber, you will need \c EquationNumber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since you want ( ) around the number, you would probably be better off defining an autotext/autocorrect that inserted the entire caption. If that's all you want in the table of Equations as well, you can use the standard Insert Table of Figures ToC field.
 If you want something else, you would probably still need to follow Daniel's suggestion of using TC fields to insert the right thing in the ToC.</p>

If both laptops have nic cards connect laptop to laptop via cat 5 cord, use transfer files/folders option.&nbsp; That should do it.</p>

            <p>C:\WINDOWS\system32\gthrctru.dll is consistent with being a malware file (the random letters are quite typical) but I'm certainly not any sort of&nbsp;malware expert...perhaps one of the other forum users will offer you an opinion on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;best way you can obtain confirmation would be to submit the file to MMPC and Virus Total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/submission/submit.aspx?ppud=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/submission/submit.aspx?ppud=4</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/en/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Hitman Pro has a "good track record" from what we've read in these forums and I'd be comfortable it had identified and quarantined the malware if it was my computer.&nbsp; It would be nice to know what the name of the malware is but it's not critical to know.&nbsp;
 You need to decide whether you want to submit the file for analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure MSE is working properly, updating, test it on Eicar, etc.</p>

<h2>            Deploy Sharepoint Online Intranet app</h2>
                    
<p>I have developed an intranet application in SharePoint Online.<br />
Now I want to deploy to a customer site where they will have their own SharePoint online account.</p>
<p>How will I deploy it into my customer's environment ?<br />
I would also like to know how to deploy my app design into customers environment, do I need to package design seperately or I can directly use design codes (HTML/CSS) into the files while coding my application?</p>

<p>Hi Rishav,</p>
<p>I would like to know if you mean to deploy a custom app to SharePoint Online. If so, after we upload a custom app to the
<strong>App Catalog(SharePoint admin center &gt; apps &gt; App Catalog &gt; Apps for SharePoint),</strong> it is automatically available for users to install when they browse apps under
<strong>From Your Organization(Settings &gt; Add an App &gt; From Your Organization).</strong> If you want the app to be available for use without the need for site users to install it, We can deploy it via adding the custom apps to the App Catalog site. And then
 add the app via clicking <strong>Settings</strong> icon in the top-right corner<strong> &gt; Add an app &gt;</strong> select the app
<strong>&gt; Trust it &gt;</strong> select the ellipses<strong> &gt; Deployment</strong>.</p>
<p>To add custom apps to the App Catalog site and deploy a custom app, I would like to share with you an article:
<a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Use-the-App-Catalog-to-make-custom-business-apps-available-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-0b6ab336-8b83-423f-a06b-bcc52861cba0#__add_custom_apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks for your answer but I would &nbsp;like to know that If i customize the design of intranet using design codes (HTML/CSS) into the files while coding my application in visual studio and then if i package it and upload in client environment using app catalog,
 will it inherit the same design in the client server also ?</p>

    <title>PC Suit Bluetooth Connectivity Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathewmba  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Suit Bluetooth Connectivity Problem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a new Nokia 6233 Phone. And I bought a new Bluetooth Dongle for connectivity with my PC running on XP. The Bluetooth software installed is IVT BlueSoleil 1.6.1.4 Release 050606.<br />
<br />
I also installed the PC Suit Software that came with my Phone, Version 6.7.<br />
<br />
The PC Suit was working well when I installed it for the first time and I could transfer files between the PC and the Phone. However, when the alert came for Software update, I updated to the latest version, and problems started.<br />
<br />
When I tried to connect after installing the new update, it shows 'Nokia 6233 Connected via Bluetooth' but when I try to open file Manager, it says could not connect to phone.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I can transfer files using the BlueSoleil Software.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a problem with PC Suit and due to the update. I uninstalled the programme and installed the older version that was working in the beginning. Still the same result. It has become totally useless.<br />
<br />
It was very useful in the beginning for PC Synchronisation and Contact updation.<br />
<br />
Please advise me how to make this thing work.<br />
<br />
Mathew

            I am having exactly the same problem with a Nokia 2760. Using IVT BlueSoleil 2.7.0.8 VoIP Release 070930, with the same problem with Nokia PC suite - worked fine to begin with, nothing since I've upgraded it, including un-installs and re-installs at the
 lower and higher version. I have got some files to transfer via IVT BlueSoleil directly, but often the files are truncated and the program reports an error.<br />
<br />
I thought software updates were meant to improve and expand functionality, not remove it!<br />
<br />
Let me know if you find a solution...

            I've managed, since my previous post, to get my phone working with the Nokia PC Suite. I can now use all the functions of the software, including file transfer etc. It does however assume you've got System Restore turned on in XP, to restore your system
 to before you upgraded the Nokia software:<br />
<br />
&gt; Uninstall the Nokia PC Suite software;<br />
&gt; Use System Restore to restore your system to a point before you installed the Nokia software;<br />
&gt; Re-download the Nokia software;<br />
&gt; Re-install the Nokia software, but don't use the "download newer version" option;<br />
&gt; Restart your PC;<br />
<br />
The software should work. Obviously, it will stop working if you update it. :-P<br />
<br />
Please note that the software didn't work until I had restarted the PC at the end, and that using system restore requires a restart. Also note that using system restore may muck up and other programs you've installed since installing the Nokia software originally.<br />
<br />
Obviously the new version of the Nokia software mucks up some system files/registry, meaning that in this situation Bluetooth won't work properly even if you down-grade the software. Obviously System Restore fixes this. :-)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps in your situation too!

            Follow the folllowing steps. It should work without the Blusoleil driver software. It worked for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.Uninstall all third party Bluetooth drivers then reboot your PC.<br />
<br />
2.Let Windows detect your Bluetooth hardware. Wait while Windows detects new hardware and install its drivers. If Windows found new device and installed it correctly then done. Otherwise follow to the next step.<br />
<br />
3.Open your file manager and change it settings for showing system and hidden files.<br />
<br />
4.Go to Windows folder (for example C:\Windows) and find there folder Inf. If you can't find that folder check that Show hidden files option checked in Windows Explorer settings.<br />
<br />
4.Open it and find here bth.inf file. If you can't find that file then you have unchecked Show hidden files option or does not have Windows XP.<br />
<br />
5.Go to Device Manager and find there Unrecognized device (Other devices with yellow ? mark).<br />
<br />
6.Open its property sheet go to Detail tab and copy the text which looks like this: USB\VID_1311&amp;PID_0021\B7E4090D0B00.<br />
<br />
7.Next, find in bth.inf file this text line: USB Bluetooth Wireless Adapter = BthUsb, USB\Vid_1310&amp;Pid_0001.<br />
<br />
8.Now you must change Vid_1310 to Vid_1311 (the text you found in unrecognized device) and Pid_0001 to the PID_0021.<br />
<br />
9.If you have other dongle VID and PID then you must change it to yours.<br />
<br />
10.Save changes in bth.inf file and reboot your PC.<br />
<br />
11.If the Bluetooth device not found go to the Device Manager and refresh devices list.

hi.. followed your steps.. all seemed to be ok and i got my bluetooth driver installed. (unninstalled my Blusoleil driver software 1.6 as per your post).<br />
<br />
However, when i try to connect my phone (Nokia 6233) with the help of Nokia PC Suite, i get the following error message:<br />
'Cannot use the connection type. Check that all the needed hardware, software and drivers are available.'<br />
<br />
when i go to the device manager, i notice the yellow exclamation mark (not the ? mark) against the driver indicating some problems with the installation.<br />
<br />
I click on the properties of the USB Bluetooth wireless adapter under Bluetooth Radios and in the General tab i find the following comment in the 'Device Status' box:<br />
'Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43).'<br />
<br />
Any suggestions wht might hav gone wrong? since you hac it working in your pc i presume it wud be nice if you could shed some light..<br />
<br />
Note: Included a screenshot in the attachment for better understanding. (chng the extension frm .txt to .jpg. only .txt &amp; .log extensions can be attached here.)<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot, Cheers!!<br />

            May be your Microsoft bluetooth stack is not working properly. U shoud find "microsoft bluetooth enumerator" node under Bluetooth Radio in device manager.<br />
<br />
Try instaling Microsoft Service pack 2 on your PC from <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</a> .<br />
<br />
It may solve your problem

    <title>E51 Business Card problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pduytengsu  say:</h3>
<h2>            E51 Business Card problem</h2>
                    Here is my problem:<br />
<br />
1. sending business cards to other people via text messages to non-nokia phones is a problem. My sent messages box shows that it was successfully sent.<br />
2. sending or receiving text messages is fine<br />
3. receiving business cards from other people is also not a problem<br />
<br />
Is this a network problem or phone settings?

            well, it could be network problem or more likely the other cellphone does not support nokia's business card...

            It's more likely the other phone - my son and daughter both have non-Nokia and neither manage to process the business card format

    <title>Yammer reset&#47;start over - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesc_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yammer reset&#47;start over</h2>
                    Is there a way to reset or start over with yammer? Our company used yammer in the past and we are looking into using it again. However there are old posts from former employees and would like to start over. Its a small network, like 5 groups, not alot
 of activity. This is using the basic/free yammer.

            <p>Hello Jesc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity&nbsp;to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once yammer is activated, the data cannot be erased for the whole network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In yammer basic you don't have administrator rights hence you cannot delete the content or the users on the network, However in yammer&nbsp;enterprise network&nbsp;you can manually delete the groups, users and the&nbsp;verified&nbsp;admin can also delete the posts.<br />
If you upgrade&nbsp;your yammer network to enterprise network then you may delete the content manually.</p>
<p>
