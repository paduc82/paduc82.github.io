<h2>            Windows 10 Small text and Buttons</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Before anyone asking to do this, I am informing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Windows 10 is fully up to date.</li><li>All drivers are up to date.</li><li>I started seeing this issue from the moment I purchased two new Yoga 910 laptop in USA and both have the same trouble. Windows 10 was already installed on them. I did not change anything, they was like that from the first use.</li></ul>
<p>Many program are running in tiny windows and showing extremely tiny texts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since long time ago many people have been writing about it to Microsoft, but unfortunatly they are not treating this question seriously.</p>
<p>We may remain working with this trouble, but it is completely annoyng.</p>

            Hi Eduardo.   I'm Greg, a volunteer and 8 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried increasing the DPI scaling at Settings&gt;System&gt;Display?  I suggest trying 125% but if that is too big making a CUstom setting of around 115% or so.  
<br />
<br />Also in the same location see if adjusting the Screen Resolution helps.  Highest is usually best for sharper pictures but sometimes needs to be slightly lower to make objects proportionate or reasonably sized text or objects.  
<br />
<br />It may also require updating the Display driver from the PC"s Support Downloads webpage.  Make sure all Windows Updates are also installed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Sorry, we still need to know what Windows version you are running.  MS allows us to run one of several major versions and still be "up to date".
<br />
<br />In the 'latest and greatest' (that is sarcasm) major version, 1709, MS has listened to your complaints. They almost completely REMOVED the option of user control over individual display elements like fonts.

    <title>Realtek Drivers wont install properly, at least from what I know.. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Realtek Drivers wont install properly, at least from what I know.. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hi</strong>, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I reformatted my desktop, from from <strong>Vista</strong> to <strong>7</strong>.</p>
<p>Everything went well, except for the audio drivers, see, currently I don't even have a set of speakers to test my sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the real problem is that , when I installed the <strong>Realtek Audio drivers</strong> (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Used to function properly in windows Vista</span>)</p>
<p>It had no effect after the prompted restart, even the tray icon still had an <strong>
'x'</strong> mark. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b19297d-d69e-4b3f-8a2a-d6e9c2891e1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>So I went to the <strong>device manager</strong> and found out that there aren't any Realtek Audio drivers installed (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I've downloaded and tried various version and had many attempts.</span>) and this is all I get is
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b24e701f-c99f-4a68-9fe9-a8cede81eba3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b24e701f-c99f-4a68-9fe9-a8cede81eba3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why there isn't any Realtek drivers present here, and no, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
none of the setup files are corrupted</span> and it all works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Doubt</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After Realtek's installation restarted my PC, I think maybe it's supposed to continue installing after that reboot, but it didn't. or Maybe I'm just wrong.</span>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please guide me through this and tell me if it's a problem with my <strong>
sound-card.</strong></p>
<p>I've been stuck on this situation for 4 days now, it's starting to stress me out trying to resolve it all day&nbsp; long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have not changed your video card on your computer and assuming that your computer is built/sold by one of the major computer manufactures, and assuming that you have the same [supported] operating system on that machine,&nbsp;then, to download
 a driver for your video controller, go to your computer Manufacturer's website, click on the "Support" link, and look for a "Download Drivers" link somewhere.</p>

            <p>I had this same problem.&nbsp; I am using Windows 10, and it did not let me uncheck boxes for programs I did not want to start up.&nbsp; Instead, I had to select enabled or disabled.&nbsp; The program that has been opening automatically and starting up each time I turn
 on my computer (QuickBooks), is already disabled from the start-up screen!&nbsp; And yet it still opens automatically, tying up my RAM and making everything slower, then when I close it out, it takes forever and sends me an error report to submit, as if closing
 a program is an error?!?&nbsp; So, since it is already disabled from the start-up&nbsp; tab, and it still starts up automatically, what more can I do?</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Favorite Gameplay Video From Upcoming Game&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favorite Gameplay Video From Upcoming Game&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So as the title says, what's your favorite gameplay video from an upcoming game that you will get? In my opinion, it would be the&nbsp;Battlefield 3 and BioShock Infinite one&nbsp;for now:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[View:http://www.youtube.com/v/2zw8SmsovJc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3]</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[View:http://www.youtube.com/v/H12J5spkBFM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3]</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'm pretty sure that there will be&nbsp;new gameplay videos at this year's E3 to like, so what's yours?</span></span></p>

    <title>Device Manager Automatically Opens on Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teching together  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device Manager Automatically Opens on Startup</h2>
                    <p>Posting this question so I can answer it for anyone else who runs into this issue since the older thread about this is now locked with no complete solution listed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/device-manager-automatically-opens-on-startup/480ed799-b3d6-4481-ae4f-3270545b5bf3">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/device-manager-automatically-opens-on-startup/480ed799-b3d6-4481-ae4f-3270545b5bf3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically, the issue is that Device Manager is oddly in the Startup programs, so tries to start automatically whenever a user logs in.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You don't notice with a local admin account, but standard users get a warning because they don't have admin privileges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to only impact:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10</li><li>Computers from Refurbishers, so I'm guessing it's a leftover from some of their imaging techniques.</li></ul>
<p>

<p>The problem appears to come from a registry key that adds 'devmgmt.msc' into the startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At least on the computers we had that were impacted, I was able to clear up by deleting a Registry key located in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM\Software\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into computer management screen. The&nbsp; right click an the Windows key. There were a bunch of errors and I wanted to remember to send it on so I figured out how to get it to Notepad. So now it shows up on the desktop all the time and for the life of
 me, I cant' remove it because I don't remember the exact name of the thing that got me there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't screw with things unless I am positive I won't screw it up anymore than it already was. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Howdy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received the new Transformers game this morning from Lovefilm, and had a quick blast before the ole F1, and is pretty good - more of the same as the last one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are cheevos for scoring on each chapter,but Im unable to see what my final score is, and indeed any reference as to whether it is just kills or kills &amp; mission time, or whatever. As its a Lovefilm jobby, I don't have a manual so if any one could shed
 some light on this, Id be grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ill be up for some MP later too, if anyone's interested.</p>

<p>Yup, Acti dropped my copy through the door on Thursday and I just finished it, well, five minutes ago :D</p>
<p>I don't have a manual either, but I do know your score does not take time into account ( or doesn't appear to) except for the multiplier decreasing when you aint blasting.</p>
<p>Melee attacks fill up your multiplier quicker, so try and use them.</p>

<p>Just an FYI folks this is a definite renter. Really enjoyable but damn its short. Only started it yesterrday morning and completed it already in 2 sittings.</p>
<p>@WorstedOrphan: Yeah Bumblebee still has that, but there are far better moves and I probably only used 2 or 3 times. 3 multiplayer modes Team/Single Deathmatch &amp; Conquest. Max level 20 per class, takes about 6 or 7 matches to max out a class.</p>

<p>This might sound silly but are you remembering to "turn on party chat"? It should come up as an option under the people's names in the party. When I first went into a party on the Xbox One I didn't notice this at all and was wondering why my mic wasn't working.
 For some reason the party chat is muted by default... I'm not really a fan of the party chat system on the One... I use Skype to chat to my mate at the moment, means i can play a different game to him without issues.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I've tried that been jumping in and out of party's and making sure I turn it on but still nothing just keep coming thru my tv speakers, I'm gonna take a damp cloth to the connector and clean it up abit cuz the xbox one is a dust magnet.

<p>I'm having kind of the same problem. My mic won't even turn on though. Yes, it's connected, I've turned party chat on, attempted to raise the volume (which doesn't work, because it won't turn on). It won't light up when I hit the mute button on the chat
 pad, the volume down/up does nothing, and it won't register that I'm speaking. It was working fine 5 minutes ago.</p>

<p>definitely an issue because I'm on my third one now. &nbsp;The first that came with the system worked for a little over a week, then the mic stopped registering but the sound still came through the headset. &nbsp;Went and bought a new one yesterday, it worked until
 just a little while ago, so i took that one back and got a replacement, and now this one is doing the same thing. &nbsp;Mic is not working. &nbsp;I think it has to do with the connector in the controller. &nbsp;And of course if i try and get my controller replaced by Microsoft
 they will make me send mine back before i can get a new one which means i won't be able to play for a few weeks until they send the new one</p>

<p>i found a solution. &nbsp;If your mic is no longer working try doing a system reboot by unplugging your power to the xbox console, waiting a few seconds and reboot it up. &nbsp;Fixed my mic, think the problem is the cache builds up on the system and messes up the
 mic for some reason</p>

<h2>            Wont stay connected - Disconnects every few seconds - BrightHouse</h2>
                    
<p>I hear Bright House may have its own set of issues but I can't find the answer anywhere.</p>
<p>My Xbox live will disconnect every few seconds. I know because I hear the sound of it reconnecting and disconnecting. I also watch it on the settings where you'll see the "Connect to Xbox Live" option appear and then disappear.</p>
<p>My internet is fine. I've tried connecting my Xbox One wirelessly and directly plugging into my router (with two separate ethernet cords) and still have this issue. I have BrightHouse and this issue started a few days ago. I'm betting the most recent update
 is to blame because this wasn't an issue too long ago. My iPad, laptop and cell are all able to connect with no issue. What's going on?</p>

<p>Agree with Genesis1953 on bridge mode but ONLY do that if your comfortable getting in there , I had one guy try it on another thread and he blamed me for "trashing his connection" cause he couldn't get it back (even though it only takes a simple reset)

<p>This may seem stupid, but I just realized an extreme noobie error on my part: my two routers are actually modems as they both plug into the cable outlets. SO instead I have an Arris modem dg1670 and the other (and it's the one directly plugged into my Xbox
 One) is an actiontec wcb3000n modem.</p>
<p>Does this make a difference when trying to go into bridge mode?</p>

<p>the Arris &nbsp;dg1670 &nbsp;is your modem , the actiontec wcb3000n is a Wireless Network Extender , the arris should be the only one getting the internet signal from your isp &nbsp;, if the &nbsp;actiontec wcb3000n is also hooked to coax cable , its probably using a Moca connection
 instead of Ethernet ....you could try plugging your xbox into the Arris instead of the &nbsp;Actiontec &nbsp;but the Arris gateways like you have from brighthouse have been the absolute worst ones to go down for some reason...if you plug into the arris and its still
 a no go , I would call your isp and see if they will replace it , they should be aware of the issue...</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 did not connect  to the system event notification.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Operating System on my wireless laptop. (it is 32 bit), Lately, when I start the computer it is very very slow and then I get this message which says, Windows 7 did not make connection to the system event notification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did system restore but it did not work. I ran Fixit program but nothing happened. So what is causing this and how do I fix it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read some solutions on the internet but when I &nbsp;tried to follow them, I can not find certain things on my computer, which are mentioned in the instructions, so I can not complete the step by step instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply at your earliest it will be appreciated.</p>

<h3> michael basden  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Internet only works in Safe Mode with Networking</h2>
                    <p>Hiya. &nbsp;I recently ran into some nasty ransomware &nbsp;virus while searching &nbsp;for some music the other day. &nbsp;I quickly unpluged the &nbsp;Ethernet cable when alt f4 wasnt working. &nbsp;doing that freed my screen from the &nbsp;nonsense. I imediately &nbsp;began scanning &nbsp;on my
 &nbsp;laptop, but i only found a few things like exploit java's and some old files that i deleted manually. &nbsp;However Im at &nbsp;my wits end now as &nbsp;it seems to be running back to normal except for the fact that my internet isnt working &nbsp;on that laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a alienware &nbsp;m17&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 64bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says im on an Unidentified network &nbsp;but when i go to check on it it doesn't give me any options &nbsp;on how to fix it. Im not too sure what to do at this point; If &nbsp;I should restore to factory settings or &nbsp;keep on fighting? Can anyone help me?</p>

<p><strong>Netsh int ip resetlog.txt</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, Please refer to Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>

<h2>            Screens go black in one minute</h2>
                    <p>I have been into the power options and set all the plans to never shut off the monitors or hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, lately, something has changed things in my computer and now my monitors go black after only one minute of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no keystrokes or mouse movement the screen just goes black after one minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it takes is to touch the mouse and move it slightly or hit a key and it pops right back ... no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it &lt; shouldn't &gt; be doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anyplace where it is set to turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            World of Tanks Stopped working on my PC after 2019 W10 Update_</h2>
                    <p>I would like to say the World of tanks has worked seamlessly since 2011 but it hasn't. But the issues were easily resolved because of the huge user base. This is my first time ever reaching out to the Microsoft community with a problem. But as I have exhausted
 WarGaming Support and not found the answer I am here.&nbsp; World of Tanks Support Admin have been fantastic and we have exhausted every possible problem known to them. At this time</p>
<p>Both Windows 10 and WOT provided updates at the beginning of 2019. Thats why I am now here!</p>
<p>Other Wargaming game in the group run fine as with World of War Ship etc! But when I hit the play button for World of Tanks, the game load and as it starts to open I am kicked back to the "Play" open again "add infinitum". I have had instances when the game
 has started and run for a while before and fast appearing "Play" screen appears. But generally&nbsp; its the rapid cycle that I have to deal with. Instantly the system said it had produced a report for Microsoft. I have no idea where to find those if they are supposed
 to be read by customers and I would not understand it anyway!</p>
<p>As I am a completely non tech, person Titles and jargon mean nothing to me. A page for me is made of paper and I eat bit's of chocolate. Please help me. I am a 74 year old housebound pensioner and I need my games to make a day bearable- thank you!</p>

<p><strong><span>Method A</span></strong><span>: Suggest you to temporarily disable
 both the security software and the Firewall on the PC to check if the issue persists. The steps to turn off the Firewall and the antivirus or malware-prevention software depend on the software you’re using. Check the documentation for your software to learn
 how to turn it off. </span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you turn it back on as soon as possible. Not having Firewall and antivirus or malware-prevention software turned on makes your PC vulnerable.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Get Help&#34; button not working on web page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried to get help with outlook.com but it took me to the page below where I have found that the "Get Help"&nbsp; button doesn't work.&nbsp; If I fill out the box with info and then put my cursor over the "Get Help" button, a red circle with a red line through that
 circle appears on that button and of course I click on that button.&nbsp; The red circle stays until I move the cursor off the button, so of course I cannot show it to you.&nbsp; What is going on with this?

Thats why I was recommending you report it to Outlook User voice, they might not be aware that its broken.
</blockquote>
<p>OK.&nbsp; the problem appears to show when uBlock Origin is turned on in the browser.&nbsp; I tried MS Edge (uBlock not installed) and when I clicked to "Get Help" the little red circle appeared for a moment but then was replaced by 3-5&nbsp; possible solutions drawn from

<h2>            Internal HDD not detected in Dell Vostro 3300 32 bit after upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I was running Windows 7 Home Premium in my Laptop, Dell Vostro 3300 32bit and decided to upgrade to windows 10 after several upgrade notification. It was running fine for few days but now all of a sudden it stopped working. I tried restoring and then resetting
 the PC but came of with error "unmountable_boot_volume". I started with auto repair then diagnosis pc and advanced option troubleshoot. I tried to check inside BIOS setting and changed the boot order to HDD and started resetting PC again. It did not work.
 Now, it does not even detect hard drive. How can I solve this issue or how can I revert back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello Krishna Prasobh V,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the instructions. I followed both the steps. I downloaded Windows 10 using media creation tool and created DVD. There’s &nbsp;5 options under Advance Option as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>System Restore</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>System Image Recovery</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Startup Repair</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Command Prompt</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Go Back to Previous Build</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">None of the options worked. When I tried Startup Repair, it went thru "Diagnosing this PC" but failed with message “ Startup repair could not repair this pc. Use advance option to try other options to repair this pc.” I did troubleshoot
 “Repair Your Computer” with advanced option to automatic repair. It says, “The drive where windows installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.”&nbsp;I am not sure how/why it is locked and how to unlock it. I also tried, Remove all files and Reset PC under
 repair troubleshoot. It says, “Unable to reset this pc, a required drive partition is missing.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I tried another option to Install Windows instead of Repair. After few steps I got a message “No device drivers found. Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers and then click ok.” Now, final step for Command
 Prompt. I typed chkdsk /r as you instructed. It returns message as follow:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">-The type of the file system is NTFS</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">- Cannot lock current device</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">- Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p><p style="margin-left: 0">I tried to change drive such as C:&nbsp; and D: &nbsp;but it shows only- X:\Source</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Does this mean now my hard drive will not work anymore? If it is completely gone, I lost all my data and I will have to buy new one anyways. If I replace with new hdd, will this installation from this disc image will be able to retrieve
 windows Product key automatically? I do not have Product Key as Windows 7 Home Premium came pre-loaded with this laptop. Any instructions and help would be much appreciated at this point.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Thank you for your assistance.</p>
