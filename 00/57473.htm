            <p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you made any changes to your BIOS, recently ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there wasn't anything important on the drive, you might as well wipe it clean and do a fresh install from the latest build, as previously suggested : you end up with a shiny new OS.&nbsp; However, if you don't want to sit through that, or you've some data
 that it would be nice to keep, then</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest booting into the Recovery Environment (if you don't have one on disk, insert an Install disc or usb stick and boot from that), and choosing
<strong>Repair My PC</strong>.&nbsp; See if that does anything for you.<br />

            <blockquote>Thank you very much. &nbsp;It helps a lot. &nbsp;Before I mark this as the answer i would like you to confirm again my understanding that Microsoft seems to say like what you said that the static IP addresses should be in the Alternate Configuration, not
 the other way round. <u><strong>&nbsp;If I have the static IP address on the General tab, then it won't obtain addresses automatically</strong></u>. &nbsp;Am I right?</blockquote>
<p><br />
Yes that is the way I understand it. It looks at the settings in the General tab first and if it can not find a DHCP server it should then switch to the static IP in the Alternate tab...</p>

<h2>            Games with Gold that are Region Locked.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>Been having and pondering over this question for a while and although I have received numerous answers from other forums, I would like to ask the real Xbox Enforcement team&nbsp;and&nbsp;support&nbsp;this question and their answer will be what I will take and stick with
 because I don't want an account banning....a lot of sweat and time from work has gone into my current Gamerscore and can't bare it when taken away from me thus I live by the Xbox Terms of use and Code of conduct.</p>
<p>Now the problematic question:</p>
<p>I live in Ghana (West Africa) and an Xbox Live Gold subscriber. Now with the Games with Gold system, most Retail games (not all of them though&nbsp;because I have been able to download&nbsp;a few Games with Gold retail titles&nbsp;without any warning or restriction (not
 region locked in my country)&nbsp;are unavailable in my Region although all Arcade games are fine to download without any restriction. Now it hurts me a lot to see some of these retail games pass me by&nbsp;without being able to download them. I visited a few forums
 and read some threads that I can actually get these region locked games if I change my country's IP.</p>
<p>BEFORE I give this a&nbsp;first&nbsp;shot on the next retail game with gold title in December (Gears of War) and subsequent ones that will be region locked to me, I would like to ask the support and enforcement team here that; will changing my IP to get REGION LOCKED
 FREE RETAIL GAMES IN THE GAMES WITH GOLD PROGRAM get me BANNED?</p>
<p>Now to isolate my question with the ones I read here, these games with gold games&nbsp;are FREE to me because I am a Gold subscriber but the problem being that, I'm not able to download because&nbsp;SOME of them are region locked to me. Will downloading these free
 titles since I'm entitled to them as a Gold Subscriber&nbsp;by changing my IP get me Banned from Live.</p>
<p>Second question is if I am in a region locked country, why am I able to download all the ARCADE titles in the Game with Gold program without any sweat or warning....does that mean my country laws has no problem with Arcade titles?</p>
<p>Third question, if most of these retail games are locked in my region and changing my IP to download them can&nbsp;get me banned, what happens if I get the same game physical copy (CD) on the market in my&nbsp;country, buy, go home and play? What's the difference
 between that?</p>
<p>Sorry for the lengthy question but would love answers to them so that I can continue to stay clean and not be banned and like I said, (As a Scientist) I have less time and so far being able to manage and put the little time I get between labs and trips not
 forgetting the sweat to build my current Gamerscore, I can not bare to see it taken away from me as a result of BANNING.</p>
<p>So I would appreciate any help here....Thank you all in advance and have a nice day :)</p>

<p>The problem that you will most likely run into if you switch your region, just to download one of the games is that you may not be able to. When you download these games your physical location must match your region or it wont work.</p>

<p>As I understand it, if you change your IP or create an account for a different region, etc., to get a game that is not available to you, the PET can use it to ban you for marketplace fraud. Here's a thread from a gaming forum where this was heavily discussed:

<p>Great guys and thanks for your responses but you just answered only one of my three questions.</p>
<p>Also to @HyruleBalverine, I've read the thread and as compared to myself, these guys who did this Moroccan and Oman account thing created Moroccan and Oman accounts to get free games in that region. Now in my case, these games are free to all Gold subscribers
 and I see them as such on my console just that a few of these retail games are region locked to me. So even if I decide (not planning to do though) to change my IP (not create an account) to get these free games as I am entitled to them, does this not make
 my case a little different from these people?? As a matter of fact, I'm part of this Games with Gold program and these retail games are free to me as well but just that a few are region locked, is Xbox gong to punish/ban me for the method I use to get these
 games that are free to me as a Gold subscriber??</p>

<p>ngocphi is correct, because you would be manipulating the system an changing your region to one that you do not actually reside in to get a game that is not available in your actual region, you would still be violating the Terms of Service / Code of Conduct
 in the same manner as those that simply created a secondary account in a region that they didn't live in just to get a game that wasn't available to them. If the Games with Gold game is not available in your region, Xbox will normally make a different one
 available to you. For instance, the December 1-15 game is Gears of War. However some regions can't get this so they're getting Halo Wars.</p>

<p>Being offered a different game has never happened to me, maybe because my country isn't supported. But would have loved that system rather than me being left out and feel cheated. Anyway I'll just feel cheated than to try any dubious means and bad ways to
 get region locked games that can ban me for good. All I have to do is to pray and hope Xbox releases games that are not region locked to me. I pray Gears of War isn't region locked to me. Once again thanks a lot guys, really appreciate your help and insights.
 Enjoy your day and would appreciate any other add-in to the topic.</p>

<p>Yaaaayyyy.....thanks Xbox for this year's (2014) first Games with Gold title (Sleeping Dogs). I was able to get this one without any country restrictions preventing me. It gave me no sweat and I'm very glad I got this game. Thanks a lot for this title. Hope
 more ones like this will come so that I can also enjoy this Games with Gold Promo...like everyone else. HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL :)</p>

<p>When you're military and this happens it sucks. Happy Memorial day Xbox, thanks for blocking me from more stuff. I live on a military installation which counts as American soil yet I'm region locked, its ridiculous, I can go to the Military Exchange and
 pick up new games but what if I want a game that I can only get on Xbox live or it's old so there are no physical copies in the Military Exchange? I'm sol. It's also hilarious when a game I try to pick up is made from the country it's region locked in, Japan.
 Points to Armored Core Verdict Day. Oh and by hilarious I mean idiotic.</p>

<p>Flashpoint Gold - It is the publishers of the game that set the region locks so complain to them. &nbsp;Also, please do not revive old threads. &nbsp;It is always best to start one of your own and detail the issues that you are having. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 login nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> checmark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 login nightmare</h2>
                    <p>Two new computers which both came with WIN 10. Went through the setup to add a four digit PIN. On startup I get the desktop photo. I click and nothing happens. I restart and this time get my photo and the field for the PIN after clicking. Enter my PIN and
 it says "Welcome", forever! Nothing. Restart yet again and finally get my desktop. After this happens time and time again I research removing my PIN, which I find and remove.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On boot up and click I still see my photo and a field for the PIN I have just removed. I try entering my four digit PIN anyway. Get an error that the password is incorrect. No clue what to do so I leave it blank. Same error. In desperation I try my
<em>hotmail</em> password. It fails as well but now I get the dumbest procedure I have ever seen. It asks me if I've forgotten my password, which I haven't. I say yes anyway. It tells me my email address that I have had for at least twenty years is not correct.
 I change it and try again. I now get a screen telling me it's sending a code to my phone and the last four digits of the number are shown. There's no way to change this so I hope it is right. I click and it reports that the phone number is not correct. Then
 I see that I am supposed to re-enter the last four digits for some unknown reason, which I do and I get a code on my phone. I enter it and it now says "preparing Windows" as though this is the first time, which it's not. Finally I get my desktop but I get
 yet another message telling me that my login is not correct and it says to "sign out" or "dismiss". I select sign out. Oh, big mistake! It just sits there signing out forever. I have to power down, terrified that I will not be able to get back into my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully it restarts and accepts my new password and I appear to be good to go after wasting about an hour on Microsoft's stupid procedures. Doesn't anybody at Microsoft check that these things actually work before hoisting them on the public? It's becoming
 more and more frustrating to deal with stupid software issues that your engineers think are great, but no one else does. It's about time you start listening to your customers and stop frustrating the **** out of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless someone magically responds to me from Microsoft, which I highly doubt, I'll have no choice other than to leave my computer on twenty-four seven to avoid stupid stupid login problems.&nbsp;<br />

            Nothing solved yet. I have reported the issues to Dell but no answers there as well. I am leaving my computer on because of issues with rebooting. It does shut down if there are updates processed and then asks for my Microsoft password on reboot. I don't
 want any password requests.&nbsp;

            <p>Since you have already tried removing the pin that is required when logging in but the issue still persist, the next option that we recommend is that you perform a clean installation of your Windows 10. However, please do advised that performing a clean
 installation will delete your current files and setting on your computer. It would be best that you create a back-up first for the important files that you have on your end.<br />

<span>Hi Eileen,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may try performing a clean boot. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above KB article to narrow down the exact source.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow the steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>

<h3> capt brigg  say:</h3>
<h2>            My new Win-7 laptop does not offer &#34;Save on a Network&#34; for backup.</h2>
                    My new Toshiba laptop running Win-7 needs to backup to a network drive since it has no second internal or attached external drive.&nbsp; I have 2 other desktop PC's also running Win-7 and all computers recognize and share files with each other on my home network.&nbsp;
 The Toshiba does not offer a "Save on a Network" option in the "Set up Backup" window like the other two desktop PCs. I have checked all the network choices in the Control Panel and they appear to be all set to the same sharing options.&nbsp; I guess it's possible
 Toshiba does not want me to backup to MY network server instead of theirs, but it doesn't seem likely. Question: What have I missed that is keeping the network option missing?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

            You can't add a user account/password to a backup drive but you can certainly add a user account/password to a Windows installation. If you find the GUI method confusing then here is a two-command method.<br />
1. Get onto the machine that you use as a file storage medium.<br />
2. Click the Start button.<br />
3. Type the three letters cmd<br />
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
5. Launch the Console session as an Administrator.<br />
6. Type this command:<br />
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user backup xxyyzz /add{Enter}</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This command will create an account called "backup" with a password of xxyyzz.<br />
7. Type this command:<br />
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators backup /add{Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This command will promote the "backup" account to Administrator level.<br />
<br />
When creating the backup task, use "backup" as an account name and "xxyyzz" as a password.<br />
<br />
Depending on the actual backup program you use, you may have to go through Steps 1 to 7 on the other machines too.<br />

Mr. Fixit does not work, I have no Upper or LowerFilter file in the registry and I still have no dvd rom. What next?

            No, it does not nor did it the other two times. I went to regedit and removed the UpperFilter and LowerFilter and that worked for a few months then I went into folders and unchecked "hide empty drives in the computer folder". Which also worked for a few
 months. Now I am back to square 1.

            Shows up in the Bios but not in safe mode, (just like before). I have even tried replacing the DVD roms (I am on my 3rd). This seems to be a windows 7 ultimate problem. (I don't have this problem on my windows 7 home premium laptop nor does my brother.)

            USB&nbsp;works fine (borrowed)&nbsp;but I don't see why I should buy one when my DVD Rom is still good and windows 7 should be recognizing it naturally. BTW the DVD rom is recognized by Vista (spare computer).

    <title>Errore durante installazione di Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piter85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Errore durante installazione di Vista</h2>
                    Ciao... ho provato a reinstallare Windows Vista sul mio Fujitsu Siemens tramite il Dvd che mi hanno dato con il computer. Mi sono sbagliato nella schermata delle partizioni e invece di formattare la partizione l'ho cancellata. Una volta ricreata la partizione
 e formattata in ntfs l'installazione fa i primi 2 passi e poi si blocca durante l'installazione delle componenti. Mi da errore 0xC0000005 e mi dice che mancano le "origini di installazione" e di assicurarmi che siano accessibili .<br />
Qualcuno ha qualche idea su come possa fare a riabilitare Windows ?!? ciao e grazie delle eventuali risposte :)

            Hi Piter85<br />
<br />
I cannot say for sure if that is the Windows Recovery partition as I am not familiar with your brand of computer.<br />
Have you contacted the manufacture for support?<br />
<br />
thank you<br />

    <title>Something is wrong with default apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Something is wrong with default apps</h2>
                    <p>So this problem is bothering me since the initial install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I boot up the PC I get the message, that I can change my Default Apps in Start&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Default Apps. Ok, I get that. But the message pops up EVERYTIME I log in. It looks like this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.techdows.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Windows-10-change-your-default-apps-dialog.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cdn.techdows.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Windows-10-change-your-default-apps-dialog.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, even though Microsoft calendar and mail app is preinstalled and I'm using them daily, they kind of cannot be found when choosing a default app in the settings window. I only get an option to search for one in Windows Store:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49c7a23f-8366-4e93-bb11-2c4b0a1f9f2c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing other apps but they still don't show up in that list that's shown in a picture. Can someone at least help me with disabling that annoying message? I'm getting frustrated with this.</p>

    <title>Xbox one S and Xbox one X in same house - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brennanbrennan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one S and Xbox one X in same house</h2>
                    <p>can anyone tell me how I can have my account signed in to both our original Xbox One S AND the newer Xbox one X at the same time so my twins can play at the same time (different games) on different TVs? We own the disc for many games so arent trying to play
 the same game or use Gold ( we dont have that) at the same time. Each time we try simultaneous use, one keeps getting kicked off. The Microsoft store employee told me to create guest account and change profile to guest on one and log into the other with main
 profile. Tried that, totally didnt work, still got auto logged off one when we signed into the other. I prefer not to have to set up a separate account for each Xbox console, but I guess it might be the only way? I read you can use same account for an Xbox
 One and a 360, so was thinking it would work with an S and an X. Thank you<br />

<p>Hey Brannan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, an account can only be signed in to one console at any given time; hence why you keep on getting kicked off from your consoles. You would have to create a new account to be used in the second console. We encourage
 you to look into our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home Console</a> feature. This would allow for both consoles to share digital content and the Gold subscription by designating one account as the primary one. If you have any further questions or would like some clarification, don't be afraid to ask. Cheers
 :D</p>

            You'll have to set up another separate account. You can create one on the Xbox One itself, which makes it easier, and it will allow for each person that has one to have individual saves for each game. Unfortunately that does mean that one of your twins
 will have to start over with their game progress if they're using the new account.

<p>Thank you. Can i create a second account using my same email? My kids are only 9 and i dont want them having an account. If not, I will have to use my husbands email to create a new account, but that means he will have to participate in the process as I
 cant access his email directly. &nbsp;So, once i have a new account, i designate that account as home for both consolea, but use the new account to sign into one of the consoles.</p>

<p>If setting up an account for your children, you could try setting up a Child's Account. It gives you various permissions and parental controls for your children, where you want to limit what they are able to do on the Xbox.</p>

<h2>            How do I map a network drive to a different hard drive on the PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So I am new to mapping network drives, and I found that it only lets me map to the C drive but I want to map to a different drive. How would I do this?<br />
I am on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problem. First, you go to the PC you are trying to map a drive to, find the drive, right click, properties, advanced sharing, and there will be an option to share the drive.</p>

            <p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2. What is the complete error code when you say, "116, and 119 codes"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teredo is a tunneling communication protocol that makes it possible for a computer that is behind a network address translation (NAT) device to use IPv6 to communicate with other computers that use IPv6.</p>
<p>For reference:<br />
<strong>Internet Protocol Version 6, Teredo, and Related Technologies in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>However, it seems that the issue is causing due to <strong>corrupt display driver</strong>. I would suggest you to
<strong>update display driver </strong>of your computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer this article:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Search &#40;indexing&#41; doesn&#39;t retain index path - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eugenesv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Search &#40;indexing&#41; doesn&#39;t retain index path</h2>
                    <p>My setup:</p>
<p>Drive '<strong>C</strong>' (ssd): bootable drive with single <strong>Windows 10</strong> partition</p>
<p>Drive '<strong>F</strong>' (hdd): bootable partition clone of drive <strong>C</strong> that I've done through Paragon Hard Drive manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that despite no user activity with drive <strong>F</strong> it would still be in use from time to time. Now I've finally found a reason why and it's a very strange one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set up Windows Search Indexing Options (in '<strong>Control Panel/Indexing Options</strong>', '<strong>Modify</strong>' button) to index only one folder:</p>
<p>'<strong>C</strong>:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu'</p>
<p>However, when I go back and click on the 'Start Menu' folder (by clicking 'Modify' button in 'Indexing Options') the path shown is that of another drive '<strong>F</strong>[sic!]:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu'</p>
<p>Now, if I rename the folder on drive <strong>F</strong>, then indexing just stops since for some reason the folder on drive
<strong>C</strong>&nbsp;can't be picked up by Windows Search, it's somehow connected with drive
<strong>F</strong>&nbsp;on a level, invisible to me (there are no symlinks/junctions or anything like that, these are two totally separate folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can make <strong>Windows on drive C</strong>&nbsp;just forget that there is another installation on drive
<strong>F</strong>&nbsp;and only pay attention to what I actually want to index (i.e. a folder on system drive
<strong>C</strong>)?</p>
<p>Any ideas much appreciated. For now I've just disabled Windows Search indexing completely since I don't want to hear any cracking activity of hdd
<strong>F</strong>&nbsp;even when I'm not using it.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there any Operating system in F Drive?</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is it an External hard drive?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the index troubleshooter on your computer as below and then try to connect to your phone, then try to copy the photos to computer, check if the issue persists or not.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>“Windows+X”</strong> and go to <strong>“control panel”.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>“indexing”</strong> options.</li><li>Then go to <strong>“Advanced tab”.</strong></li><li>Click on “<strong>rebuild”</strong> and click on <strong>“ok”.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now I suggest you to change the settings to ‘F’ drive and check whether the issue persists or not.</p>

            <p>Hey,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b8a3a254-c47d-44f4-be72-f34b4062c4d9" title="Karthicka_R">Karthicka_R</a>, and thanks for a prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, it's a clone of the main partition, so there is the same operating system (Windows 10, although not updated) as on my drive C</p>
<p>2. No, it's internal drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already rebuilt index several times, but it didn't help. I've run troubleshooter several times as well, it fixed one folder permissions issue the first time, but it didn't help. Whenever I select any folder on drive
<strong>C</strong>&nbsp;the search thinks this folder should be on drive <strong>F</strong>&nbsp;and if it doesn't exist it will show at the top of the list F:\Path (Unavailable)</p>
<p>It it seems somewhere deep down there is a hardwired link to drive F instead of my main drive C and I can't change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you have another idea on how to fix it? Thank you<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I didn't get what you meant by connecting computer to phone (which phone?) and copying photos (what photos? and where should I copy them?)</p>

    <title>Unidentified Network after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninthfuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unidentified Network after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 this morning, and it booted just fine. But my network showed me a Limited / Unidentified Network connection. I tried troubleshooting and it told me the 'Ethernet does not have a valid IP config." I searched the internet
 for some solutions and tried bunch of stuff. What did fixed it was when i was power-cycling the router and my PC, but the network problem appears again once i restart the PC, and power-cycling doesn't seem to fix it now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is a custom-built PC, i tried updating the LAN drivers taken from the motherboard site (Latest on Windows 10 64-bit support) but somehow failed to install that stated "Cannot install driver. No Intel(R) Adapters are present in this computer."
 Feeling desperate, i decided to rollback my upgrade to Windows 7 using the Recovery settings in W10 and hope everything will revert back to normal. BUT, the network error is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need some help to what's going on here. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: Before i started the W10 upgrade, i had NO network issues whatsoever. This problem occur right after the upgrade.</p>

            <p>More power to you, but don't you think that was overkill?</p>
<p>I suspect that there are some network security settings being disabled by the Windows 10 update.&nbsp; Your scrubbing / reinstall would have had the same effect as deleting and recreating the connection.</p>

            <p>Sorry I think you have misunderstood - I am able to access and adjust the brightness within the control panel. However, it is still very bright and I want to be able to do adjust it further - for instance on my mobile phone I can download an app which allows
 me to adjust the brightness of my phone screen more so than what the OS will allow. I am not using a monitor - as mentioned just a Sony Vaio laptop. Is there something I can download to be able to dim the screen further than this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware incompatibility is the common reason as to why this would happen. Let's narrow down your issue. Please verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to use this controller on your laptop before?</li><li>If so, when did the issue start happening?</li><li>What changes has been made to your system since then?</li><li>What other devices are you referring to? </li><li>Have you checked if the controller is compatible with Windows? You may refer to the manufacturer for details about this.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

 my second laptop. I really want to use this controller on my device.

<p>Got it. Can we confirm if you are running the Anniversary Update on all three devices? Since it was working before, let's check its driver. If the latest driver is installed, try to roll it back. From the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click your controller and select <strong>Properties
</strong>&gt; <strong>Driver </strong>tab &gt; <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>. Restart your device afterwards.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 120px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14811b78-75ee-4e4c-86f0-8157d8a2bd9a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14811b78-75ee-4e4c-86f0-8157d8a2bd9a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the link, I'm expecting it to take me to specific help regarding the problem I'm having. What invariably happens is that it takes me to the Windows 10 help home page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the example above the link goes to this url</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 150px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4960f29e-8309-4445-a2d9-2d3678e378d4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4960f29e-8309-4445-a2d9-2d3678e378d4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and that immediately redirect to the help main page.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 150px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a49e89a7-0850-4fa7-a71d-4462d77215a1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a49e89a7-0850-4fa7-a71d-4462d77215a1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a waste of time having those links if that's all they do. Searching Google is more effective than searching Microsoft Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these links supposed to direct to that main page or is there some problem?</p>

<p>These "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=______" links have always pointed to a very specific Microsoft Help article directly related to whatever it was that provided the link. Very recently and suddenly, they all have redirected to the generic Windows
 10 Help page instead. It's bad enough that Microsoft's tech support never provides any help in these forums ANYWAY, but now the help links themselves don't even go anywhere!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now expect one single reply on this post from a Microsoft employee with some useless suggestion or complete dismissal of any issues, no further replies from Microsoft, and then this post will suddenly be marked as closed &amp; locked, even though no help was
 ever provided. This is the case with <em>every single Microsoft Help forum post I have ever read since the Windows XP days...</em></p>

            <p>I assume that your printer turns on but does not print your requests. &nbsp; It could be that you need the latest drivers. &nbsp; The link I have given indicates that this driver is given for Win10:</p>

            Hi DelBoy
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, when you say you re-installed Windows, did you use bootable installation media to do that or did you use the Reset option that is built into Windows?
<br />
<br />If you clean installed Windows 10 from bootable installation media, was your music stored on that same hard drive or on some other drive?
<br />
<br />If yo reset Windows 10, did you choose the option to keep your files?
        </p>

            Hi  DELBOY7733
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you performed a clean install there is a likely chance the files are deleted. 
<br />
<br />If you happened to perform a custom install, then your Music library might still be there in a folder called Windows.old. Review steps how you might be able to recover those files:
