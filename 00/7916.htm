<h2>            Unspecified error -- Part&#58; &#47;word&#47;comments.xml, Line&#58; 10287, Column&#58; 0</h2>
                    <p>I have a .DOCX file that was functioning properly yesterday. A user made additional comments, saved, and now we're both receiving the:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry. We can't open (doc name).docx because we found a problem with its contents."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The details are as follows (after opening in Notepad +++ with XML tools plugin using Pretty print, save and replace comments.xml file):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unspecified error -- Part: /word/comments.xml, Line: 10287, Column: 0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing line 10287 and its expansion and keep getting the same error message. I can eventually open the Word file, but all of the comments (there are many) from this line on have disappeared. Is there anyway I can retrieve in Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for reaching out. I actually discovered that there were two &lt;w:bookmarkStart&gt; commands without a &lt;w:bookmarkEnd&gt;, added those, and everything was A okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what the root cause of this was? We're constantly using Comments in our business activities...but not Bookmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            problems since wp8.1 update in my lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Lumia 1520 which I bought in may 2014. Last month I have updated to wp8.1. Initially it was doing fine but since last 10-15 days I have been facing a series of issues with my mobile. I suspect 8.1 update to be the reason as I never faced a glitch
 in my 3months of heavy usage on wp8.</p>
<p>below are the problems I have faced so far,</p>
<p>1) screen blacked out suddenly. No response whatsoever. It was working, I can receive calls and notifications but display does not work. Phone was continuously heating mean while. I visited the nearest,care center even they were clueless. Only thing they
 did was to hardreset my phone.</p>
<p>2) volume automatically becomes 0. I try to change it someone value but the bar goes back to 0. Its like the volume is playing with me.annoying it was.</p>
<p>3) the touch does not work sometimes. Its sporadic lock and unlock,it works fine.</p>
<p>4) few minor issues.</p>
<p>these issues really annoy me. These might be some minor bug fixes please take these up and resolve. I have gone through many forums and writing this. So</p>
<p>many users facing similar issues. Thanks.</p>

<p>Howdy ShivaramCh, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Support forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These issues are normally&nbsp;caused by a lack of a firmware update on the device. If your device doesn't have Lumia Cyan installed, that may be the cause.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device does have Lumia Cyan on it, try the following steps. Perform each step at a time and see if anything changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off battery saver.</li><li>Uninstall Live Lock Screen BETA app. (If it's not installed, skip this step)</li><li>Soft reset the device. (hold the Volume Down + Power buttons for 15 seconds until the device vibrates and reboots)</li><li>Hard reset the device.</li></ul>
<p>If your device doesn't have Cyan, installing the&nbsp;last stable release onto your device that comes with compatible firmware is possible by using the Nokia Software Recovery Tool. You can get assistance in doing that by contacting Nokia support here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/contact/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues even after the Cyan firmware is installed, please reply with the following bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OS version and Firmware Revision on the phone. (Settings &gt; About &gt; More Info)</li><li>The Manufacturer Name and Mobile operator strings. (Settings &gt; Extras + Info &gt; More Info)</li><li>How long since the update was installed.</li><li>If an SD card is being used or not.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps to address your issue. As always if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to reply to this post and we'll be happy to assist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, <br />
Bryce B</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><p>Share this information to assist you better.</p>
<p>What file format is saved in the CD's you are using?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Microsoft</span></strong><span> does not provide any application that can
<strong>convert an </strong></span><strong>WMA</strong><span><strong>to a </strong>
</span><strong>mp3</strong><span><strong>file</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may use your favorite search engine to look for <strong>third party applications over the Internet</strong> that can help you covert the files.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Using <strong>Third Party Software</strong>, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly.
<strong>Microsoft</strong> cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of

<h2>            Can I move&#47;backup data &#40;video &#47; photos&#41; from N95-8gb without a PC</h2>
                    HI folks...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if this is possible...<br />
<br />
I would like to able to move data (videos and photos) from my N95 8gb but without plugginng into a PC or laptop.. Is this possible?<br />
<br />
I'm going on holiday soon and want to make loads of videos but need a way of gatting them off the phone to free up memeory for more (I thought about an internet cafe but most of them I have used only allow surfing not burning data) I also definately do not
 want to take my old laptop with me.<br />
<br />
I thought i might b able to find some sort of portable hard drive that lets you bluetooth data to it but I can't.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got an answer for this?<br />
If you have any advice I'd be really grateful.<br />
<br />
Best regards, PAUL

            Will you have access to wi-fi on holiday?<br />
<br />
If so you could use share online 3.0 to upload your pics and videos to ovi, flickr (photo's only) or vox.<br />

            Thanks for that advice - very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I haven't used those features yet so I'll try them out before I go - in fact I'll have aplay around tonight.<br />
<br />
I must admit I was hoping to be able to take quite lengthy high quality vids which I suspect may be too large to upload and a also wanted to keep a set to burn to DVD on my return.<br />
<br />
The trouble with great devices like the Nokia N95 is that the more they do - the more we want to do - haha.<br />
<br />
Is that the only way of transferring video without a 'wired' connnection do you think?

            Give it a try because it does take a bit of getting used to. Not sure about the size limit on video's but you are most likely right about that.<br />
<br />
If it had been almost any other model I would have said just take a couple of spare memory cards but thats not an option.<br />
<br />
I know it's not possible to directly connect any form of external storage to it. I remember reading something about wi-fi enabled data storage devices a while ago but never seen anything.

            Thanks again 'Psycho' I do appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
I did a little research and didn't get very far... I thought it would be quite straightforward to get a little hard drive of say 40gig or so that you could bluetooth or infrared to but i couldn't find anything other than a usb to pc connection.<br />
<br />
Never mind... I will have a good look over the sharing features - i'll enjoy that anyway. maybe aI can compromise on quality although I really did want to keep a copy. There are internet facilties at the hotel so maybe I'll be able to burn discs.<br />
<br />
Thanks again M8.

            A device like that would be useful.<br />
<br />
Seagate announced a portable storage device back in early 2007 called D.A.V.E. that offered wi-fi and bluetooth connectivity along with up to 60GB of storage. Not heard anything about it for a long time now.

            There are many uPNP enabled back-up solutions (hard drives) that plug directly to a router and thus you can access via WLAN and move stuff.<br />
<br />
It's not so easy but it can be done.<br />
<br />
Anyway at some point you still need a PC to configure the External Network Drive.

<p>1.&nbsp; MSE provides protection against malware.&nbsp; It is not a "file cleaner".&nbsp; The only files MSE is concerned with are those files that have malware.&nbsp; Use Disk Cleanup to clear/remove temporary files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There is MSE, and there is Windows Firewall.&nbsp; They are two separate tools.</p>

<h2>            Can no longer edit SharePoint Online list default forms</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>i use sharepoint online, and i have just tried editing the default forms on a sharepoint list. i have done this in the past successfully, but i haven't done it in a while. i use the menu option on the list toolbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=92d32078-b68a-4e9f-81f7-b1728d8bab6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d92d32078-b68a-4e9f-81f7-b1728d8bab6f" /></a></p>
<p>i am wanting to update the forms again, so i have tried to do the same thing, but now when i select one of the forms, such as default display form, i get a blank space where the top menu bar should be. as a result i cant work out how i am supposed to edit
 the form.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=881a0a6c-c861-44fa-9d3e-6e21b17e4c0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d881a0a6c-c861-44fa-9d3e-6e21b17e4c0a" /></a></p>
<p>i have tried 4 different sharepoint online sites, using&nbsp;different browsers, ie, edge, and firefox, and chrome, all with the same result.</p>
<p>anyone know what is going on? is this part of some upgrade that is rolling out?</p>
<p>any work arounds?</p>
<p>regards<br />

<p>No I don't think they are moving to that direction, in the contrary InfoPath support will be dropped in about 10 years.</p>
<p>I was only asking you to do so as a workaround. It is very easy to do simple forms in InfoPath....I don't know why you are getting this behaviour on the ribbon though to be honest. Have you tried clearing your cache?</p>

<h3> aaadddaaammm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asha 501 touchscreen unresponsive</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Asha 501 about a week ago, and quite quickly it started having problems, where the touch screen would become completely unresponsive. Removing the battery as the only option to restart would let the screen work again for a bit. Now, the screen
 is completely unresponsive, even after a such a "hard reset".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I just return it, or can I do anything myself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            That's what the High Contrast themes are intended to do. As Rohn007 says, if you want color, don't use a High Contrast theme.

            <p>First of all, your subject is misleading.&nbsp; When I (and I think most other people) say "contents" of document files I mean the text, not simply the display colors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win High Contrast theme is something of an exception. It is explicitly designed to maximize the contrast between on-screen elements. To do that it also changes the display colors of text.&nbsp; You have already noted that changing the theme "brings back"
 the original colors.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to select a different Windows theme. You could try customizing one to approximate the effect of the built in High Contrast theme.

    <title>Efficient read-only link to table in external Access DB in SQL, no VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Efficient read-only link to table in external Access DB in SQL, no VBA</h2>
                    I am trying to develop an analysis process almost entirely with SQL statements, with absolutely minimal use of VBA in order to avoid handling countless SQL statements as VBA strings.<br />
<br />
I recently got advice on how link to a a table in an external Access database without resorting to VBA (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-access/link-to-external-table-via-sql-statement/a2188369-de00-40d6-aecc-45a65891c3c6, thanks
 to John V).&nbsp; Hoping to improve on this with the following two questions.<br />
<br />
Question#1a:<br />
The full path of the external database is needed in SELECT &lt;whatever&gt; FROM SomeTable IN "c:\Full\Path\To\Database.accdb", which makes for difficult to manage code.&nbsp; Is there a way to avoid this?<br />
<br />
Question#1b:<br />
Thoughts: I was toyed with the idea of creating a view from the aforementioned select statement, so the full path is only used once.&nbsp; However, for each statement in my SQL script that uses the view, the view must be reconstructed. Is this an accurate view of
 the penalty?<br />
<br />
Question#1c:<br />
Related to this, if the same view is joined multiple times in the same SQL statement (with different join conditions, of course), does the view have to be reconstructed for each instance?&nbsp; The context of this is not that the SQL statements make up query objects
 in the Access GUI.&nbsp; Rather, each SQL statement is read from a file using a VBA parser and executed using CurrentProject.Connection.Execute.&nbsp; Outside of this parser, the VBA is minimized so that most of the anlaysis process is in the SQL script.<br />
<br />
Question#2:<br />
Now I was wondering if the external table linkage can be done so that the linked table is read-only?&nbsp; The SELECT statement above, as well the creation of a view, might be a solution, but there are the caveats asked about above.&nbsp; My web surfing says that pass-through
 queries to SQL Server are the solution.&nbsp; But having web searched SQL Server (proper noun), it doesn't represent my situation.&nbsp; I am only trying to link to an Access database.

            <p>General comment: the IN clause is nice for temporary tables, but I would not build the whole app on it. That's why Access has linked tables, which work just fine in 99.9% of the cases. Linked tables do not require VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a: If you don't specify the path, Access will choose one; probably the current directory. Experiment a bit with that, but it may not get you what you want because the BE is unlikely to be in the current dir.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b: Yes, but Access will optimize the statements so the penalty may not be as severe as you think. Also see my general comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c: See 1b.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Linked tables cannot be made read-only. Some queries are always read-only (distinct, group by, union), others depend on finer points. For example this is read-write:</p>
<p>select * from sometable in "c:\Full\Path\To\Database.accdb"</p>
<p>while this is read-only:</p>
<p>select distinct * from sometable in "c:\Full\Path\To\Database.accdb"</p>

    <title>Loss of display on 6101 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baddriver13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of display on 6101</h2>
                    Dear Nokia Users,<br />
I'm hoping there is someone out there that can help please?<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia 6101 which is only a few months old and has never been dropped or abused.<br />
<br />
Twice now the display has just vanished - the main screen is just white with no text/display at all; this does light up when the phone is opened (and a blue screen on the min-display). I have tried removing the battery hoping to 're-set' the phone but upon
 powering up - and the music sounds - I still just have a blank white screen.<br />
<br />
The first time this happened the phone started working again just as mysteriously as it had stopped. This time though the phone has been like this for 24hrs.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Steve

            No idea what causes it but my wife experienced exactly the same. her cellphone is only 2 weeks old and the display has turned white for several times now. Does there already exist a solution to this ?<br />

            I purchased a Nokia 6101 last Thursday and already the display is gone. it lasts for days and will come back for a couple of hours. The phone is no good when it only works for a couple of hours a day. Did anyone check this out. I have an email sent to
 my network to see if they have a solution. Its good in one way to know that someone else has come across this problem

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I have a bit more information. It happened again (third time) - white screen.<br />
<br />
This time, while the screen was blank, she used her speed dial to check her balance. That worked.<br />
<br />
She then pressed the buttons to send herself a text message. When she pressed the send button, the screen displayed correctly - with the background showing and a message saying 'sending message'.<br />
<br />
She thinks it might be something to do with the size of the wallpaper she chose. Even when it worked, it would display quite slowly. It wasn't massive (about 12kb) but she has selected another (about 6kb), and we'll keep an eye on it.

            I had the same problem with two of my Nokia 6101 phones. The carrier is T-Mobile, and I bought it through a camera store in the Philadelphia area. The first 6101 phone had the blank screen problem after about 2 days, which I replaced it with a new one
 at the same store. The second 6101 phone worked for about a year, but showed the same blank screen problem early this week.<br />
<br />
The phone can still send and receive calls, but no display(white blank). Without display, I do not know how to use it for test massages. If someone knows the solution, please help. Nokia support center was not much of help. This problem must be very common
 for this model. I hope Nokia would come up with a solution.<br />
<br />
Cable problem or software issue?<br />

I suspect it is hardware issue - but if you are out of warranty, I suspect you are out of luck :-(

            I went to a local T-mobile store and checked for repairs (My phone had a blank screen when it's turn on). It's about 20 days over the one-year warranty term so T-Mobile would not be responsible for the repair or replacement.<br />
<br />
A customer at the T-Mobile store recommended to "rest" the phone for a few days and it might come back (he had heard such thing before). So I took the battery out for about two-days, and placed the battery back yesterday morning. It still had the white blank
 screen when it's turn on. So I left the battery in the phone together with the SIM card. When I came back last night, I saw the normal screen on and off. I then turned it off and turn on again, the normal screen stayed on up to now.....<br />
<br />
I have no idea why the screen came back... and do not know how long it will work... The moisture in the air, which was dried out after a few days (?), may cause it…

            My daughters Nokia 6101 has the loss of display and also difficulty turning on sometimes and a clicking sound like a gider counter sound every so often.This has all occurred in the last three days.Up to that it was perfect.<br />
Her phone is only 7 months old and has only been used to text friends,and the odd phone call.<br />
We have been told by Nokia that it will be repaired if possible and that she will have to send it in three times for repair before they will replace it eventhough it is under warrenty.<br />
Has anyone had similar problems with their phones and how did it work out.<br />
Would appreciate some info. Thanks in advance

<p>It is not feasible to change the Trash folders View Settings to be arranged ‘Date Modified’ in Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround to help you restore the emails, you can set the view to arrange by ‘folders’, then the emails from the Inbox will be sorted together and you will be able to recover them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
        </p>

<h3> sdpoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message for Office 365 applications and can&#39;t open Outlook on MacBook Air</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and activate my Office 365 subscription for 5 devices. It is working great on iPad Air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issues with a new MacBook Air (1.4GHz Intel Core i5 and 4GB memory) running OSX 10.9.4. This was a new MacBook so didn't have legacy office or other products that I thought may impact. It was a "clean" install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also updated to Office 14.4.4</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 1: </strong>When I open Excel, Powerpoint or Word it comes up with the following message;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"<strong>There is a problem with the Office database</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Office might be unable to access the database or the database file might be damages. etc...."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then suggests that I rebuild the database via the Microsoft Database Utility. I've followed the steps and it hasn't worked. I can use these programs but I have encountered some issues with cut/paste functions with the clipboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue 2:&nbsp;</strong>When I try to open Outlook I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>"Could not change to that Identity</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">An unknown error has occurred in Outlook"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clock on "OK" it takes me to a window to select an identity. Following the steps doesn't work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate any advice as to how to correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>Since this is a new computer, I suspect your data was migrated but you may be experiencing permissions issues because of the “unable to access the database” message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to follow these instructions safely without negatively impacting anything:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quit Outlook and all other applications.</li><li>Click on a blank area of your Desktop to ensure you’re in the Finder.</li><li>Choose Go menu &gt; Home.</li><li>Note the name of your home folder either at the top of the window or in the sidebar to the left. I’ll use “bill” for my example below.</li><li>Launch the Terminal application found in Applications &gt; Utilities folder. If you’re the only user of your computer then you’re an admin. You can run this command in the Terminal to correct ownership of your home folder files:<br />
<br />
sudo chown -R bill /Users/bill<br />
</li><li>Be sure to replace “bill” with the name of your home folder.</li><li>Press the return key.</li><li>You’ll need to enter your password. You won’t see the cursor move. Just press the return key again when done. Allow a little time for this command to run. It’s finished when you see the cursor return to the Terminal window.</li><li>Try launching Outlook now.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're an insider, then I presume you would have installed the insider app onto your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, download the app and install and restart the phone . select the fast ring update. It will offer you the newest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only for the preview and not the official release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run it on my 535, but have had a couple of issues so went back to 8.1 and then found out I should have done a hard reset LOL</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you somewhat.</p>

            Though there is no specific date announced, you may expect it before the year end .. but since the release is normally staggered based on the phone variant how long one has to wait even after an official release is difficult to say.

<h3> terrysullivanys  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Embed a Song on the Internet into a PowerPoint 2016 Presentation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've watched numerous videos and read several postings right here about how to embed an audio file into a PowerPoint presentation, but they all refer to adding saved music files in File Explorer/on the hard drive.&nbsp; The music I want to embed into my PowerPoint
 can be found on Spotify, YouTube, Napster, etc.&nbsp; I am, therefore, not able to save those songs to my hard drive.&nbsp; Surely in this day and age where online content has long since surpassed content from CD's or DVD's, there has to be a way to migrate music from
 an online source into a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be most appreciated.&nbsp; I'm already past a deadline in getting my PowerPoint to my local museum.</p>

            <p>Whether embedding an audio file from someplace on the internet is legal or not, that's up to you to determine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Audacity (a free sound recording/editing program) you can record pretty much anything that your computer is playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd need to download and install Audacity and also the LAME encoder (which makes it possible for Audacity to export MP3 files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Audacity, choose your computer's internal sound system as the input device, start recording, then start the audio playing from {wherever}.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find that some services pop up ads in the middle of the music; don't worry about&nbsp; it, let it keep recording, note the time where the ad's occurred (Audacity's timeline will give you this info).&nbsp; Afterwards, it's simple to go back and edit the ad
 out.</p>

            <p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the audio files can only be added to a PowerPoint presentation when it's already saved on the storage of your device. You may consider inserting a video from Youtube, and play it on your presentation. Kindly check this

<h2>            Pivot Chart&#58; How to Reset Axis format from TIME to GENERAL</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pivot chart in which the x-axis contains numbers.&nbsp; At the time of constructing the chart the data format for the contents that are used for x-axis were of TIME format (hh:mm:ss).&nbsp; I later on changed them to General.&nbsp; Nevertheless the x-axis is still
 displayed in hh:mm:ss in my pivot chart.&nbsp; The data in the pivot table is correctly displayed as numbers (general format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to change the axis format settings by right clicking on x-axis, selecting Format Axis ..., Number, Category = General.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nothing changes, the display remains in time format (see attached picture).&nbsp; How could I change the x-axis formatting so that it displays in general format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation</p>

            <p>1. Remove all the formulas from your table. </p>
<p>2. Now change that column to General</p>
<p>3. Now, you copy back your formulas from Notepad.</p>
<p>4. You will have the desired result which you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the liberty to change your formulas, change them as</p>
<p>= TEXT(Your Formula,"@")</p>
<p>Then you will not need Columns to Text conversion etc....This will behave the way it should.

                    <p><span>I am a 74 year old retiree who has just purchased Outlook 16 Home &amp; Business for my Mac but cannot afford another $229.99 to purchase Outlook 16 for my Dell PC.&nbsp; As a protected class, just like students
 &amp; veterans, I am asking you to provide the same discounts to your&nbsp;senior customers who have been loyal to you throughout the years!!!&nbsp; I really think that you could make additional monies, as we are living much longer &amp; want the latest &amp; greatest that Microsoft
 has to offer just like everyone else.</span></p>
