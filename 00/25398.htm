<h2>            Cannot sync my One Drive for Business files</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>all of a sudden I can't sync my one drive for business files. When it comes to syncing it show 198 errors (198 cause I have 198 files) all with the description: Logon details needed. The problem is I don't know where to fill the logon details in, so the
 problem is fixed. I deleted all the files and started the sync from my sharepoint website again, but no results. I even logout of my office 365 account and login again. Thank you very much for your help.</p>

            Which Windows version are you running? If 2000 or XP, download the latest version of PC Suite from http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite<br />

            Ok, then 5.8 is the latest suite version that is compatible with your setup. Go to 6100 support pages http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,4848,00.html and download the Suite from there and try with that one.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2010 &#47; Exchange 2010&#58; Send Contact Group to other domain users</h2>
                    Hey Folks,<br />
<br />
We have a couple of administrative assistants who normally maintain Outlook 2010 <i>
Contact Groups</i> in their Contact List / Address Book.<br />
<br />
When adding members to a <i>Contact Group</i> you get the drop down showing 3 choices (Fig 1):<br />
<br />
1) From Outlook Contacts (Pick from users Outlook Contacts)<br />
2) From Address Book (Pick from Address book which can show Outlook Contacts and Exchange GAB)<br />
3) New Email Contact (Appears to just key in a smtp email address and not stored in Outlook Contacts... unless you tell it to do so)<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmail.google.com%2fmail%2fu%2f0%2f%3fui%3d2%26amp%3bik%3d7ed6d6f728%26amp%3bview%3datt%26amp%3bth%3d13db6c67fbf431d4%26amp%3battid%3d0.2%26amp%3bdisp%3demb%26amp%3brealattid%3dii_13db6ab29f3559b4%26amp%3bzw%26amp%3batsh%3d1" /><br />
Fig 1<br />
<br />
Now I have found in most cases the user has clicked <i>From Outlook Contacts</i>, but sometimes they have clicked
<i>New Email Contact</i> and didn't let it create a contact in the contact list.&nbsp; So basically you have a
<i>Contact Group</i> with a mixture of contact types.&nbsp; You can see the difference in the icon as the
<i>Outlook Contact</i> will look like a Rolodex card with a person on it and the standard
<i>Email Contact</i> will look like a Rolodex card, but no person on it (Fig 2)<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmail.google.com%2fmail%2fu%2f0%2f%3fui%3d2%26amp%3bik%3d7ed6d6f728%26amp%3bview%3datt%26amp%3bth%3d13db6c67fbf431d4%26amp%3battid%3d0.1%26amp%3bdisp%3demb%26amp%3brealattid%3dii_13db6a9dfcdd22ae%26amp%3bzw%26amp%3batsh%3d1" /><br />
Fig 2<br />
<br />
So now let's get to the issue.&nbsp; We have a new employee come on board and asks the assistant if they have a list of staff contacts they can send them.&nbsp; So she will do the following:<br />
<br />
1) She will forward the <i>Contact Group</i> or email an <i>Outlook Item</i> (attaching the
<i>Contact Group</i>) to the user.<br />
<br />
The user will get the email with the attachment and he can drag it over to his contacts folder and now he will see the new
<i>Contact Group</i> in his Contacts folder.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER if he attempts to email to that group he will get an error stating: "An Internal support function returned an error".<br />
<br />
Now I know this error is because he does NOT have any of the <i>Outlook Contacts</i> that are in the
<i>Contact Group</i> in his <i>Contact Folder</i>.&nbsp; The original user did, but not him.&nbsp; Someone once said they though forwarding the Contact Group like this would auto create the Contacts in the destinations Contact folder, but I have never seen that happen.<br />
<br />
So now what?&nbsp; If you open up the <i>Contract Group</i> and double-click on one of the member
<i>Outlook Contacts</i> you get the error: <span><font color="black"><span>"Could not find Contact ??????. &nbsp;It may have been deleted or moved from its original location. &nbsp;Would you like to
 remove it from the list?"</span></font></span>&nbsp; This just confirms to me the reason for the earlier error mentioned.<br />
<br />
Now the user could click the Update Now button in the Contact Group and tell it to "Try to repair the lost members and remove only those that cannot be resolved".&nbsp; This will convert them all to standard Email Contacts and then the user can use the Contact Group.&nbsp;
 The user could also when sending an email expand the group by clicking the plus which will expand them into individual emails and let the user send.<br />
<br />
BUT... the ultimate questions:<br />
<br />
1) HOW can a user send a Contact Group to another user where that user can use the Contact Group just like the original user did???&nbsp; I tried exporting the contacts to a pst and then importing them to the destination user, but it is seen as a different contact
 so when you try to open the <i>Outlook Contact</i> from the <i>Contact Group</i> they still get the error about not finding contact.&nbsp; I also tried forwarding the contacts individually first to the user and then the group, but it still gives the errors.&nbsp; So
 how the heck do people do this???<br />
<br />
2) Since trying to forward or email a <i>Contact Group</i> to other users on Exchange appears problematic HOW do you recommend making sure our users all have the same Contact Groups?&nbsp; What are some of the things you do?&nbsp; Here are some things that come to mind,
 but don't know what is considered the defacto accepted standard:<br />
<ul>
<li>I see a share contacts feature in Outlook 2010.</li><li>There are public folders, but my understanding there is no Microsoft roadmap to continue public folders.</li><li>I know an administrator could create AD Distribution Group, but if some of the contacts needed in the group are NOT AD users then you have to create all these Exchange mail contacts.</li><li>Someone mentioned Outlook Business Contacts Add In product.</li></ul>
<p>We are really struggling with what we should be doing here and would love some advise.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
Greg

            This is not a supported feature.&nbsp; But if you are a programmer, keep reading.<br />

Get the IMsgStore pointer to the "ActiveSync" account and SetProps the PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS property to the WCHAR string of your choice.<br />

            A hard reset will remove the 'd'.&nbsp; It's unclear to me where the d came from, perhaps it was added by a third party application.<br />

There is no such thing as 'Windows 7 Office' so it is not clear what version you have. Proofing tools are currently only available for Office 2010. You need the Greek language pack.<br />
<br />
To type in Greek you simply change the input language and keyboard to Greek through Windows Regional settings. It helps if you have a Greek pattern keyboard, but you can always display the keyboard on screen from the Windows accessibility accessories &gt; on screen
 keyboard.<br />

    <title>Export everything out of a OneNote File - including collapsed outlines - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Export everything out of a OneNote File - including collapsed outlines</h2>
                    <p>I am running into a problem with Onenote that is driving me crazy. &nbsp;I have a client that uses Onenote in his law practice, with one notebook per client to keep track of his notes. &nbsp;The problem is we are trying to archive several of his older closed cases,
 and we need to export the data in Onenote to a PDF file. &nbsp;Either Exporting or printing to PDF works great with one major problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any outlines in the document that are collapsed don't get export or printed. &nbsp;The only solution I can find is to manually expand out everything prior to Exporting or Printing. &nbsp;The problem with this is doing this manually leaves a significant chance for
 human error, and since the original OneNote files will be deleted I need to make sure ALL the data is exported. &nbsp;Does anyone have a good solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running OneNote 2016 on Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Bfaler_452,<br />
<br />
It is not feasible to expand collapsed outlines in all pages or sections at one time. We can expand all collapsed outlines in one page as Fraser posted that, then repeat these steps for every page and section. I know it would be better if we can do that. I
 invite you to submit your feedback via <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uservoice</a></span>, this is the best way to perfect our
 service.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
Linda

                    For some reason, I am getting this "We can't sync this section because it might not be a valid OneNote file. (Error code: 0x26)"<br />
I get this even after creating a new Note in local drive.<br />
This is what I have done...<br />
+MS Defender, Malwarebyte and bitdefender online scan all came up clean.<br />
+OneNote /Safe and /Forcerepair does not help.<br />
+Uninstall Office 2013<br />
+CClean<br />
+I also did rename both Cache and document folders and create empty folders for the following<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\15.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\user\Documents\OneNote Notebooks\<br />
+Re-install Office 2013<br />
+Windows update done till there is nothing to update.<br />
+Create a new Note in local drive... wait couple of minutes and I get this message on a blank sheet "We're sorry, something's wrong with this section. Click here to fix it." Kept getting this msg "We're sorry..." even on a brand new Note stored in local drive.<br />
I am using Win 8.1 with Office 2013<br />
Any suggestion?

            <p>Thanks Anju.</p>
<p>I did exactly as the KB re disable all except MS stuff and also disable all in the StartUp.</p>
<p>After reboot and I confirmed none of the apps started up.</p>
<p>I start OneNote and it hung or spin for over an hour and I had to hard boot the PC.</p>
<p>After PC came up, I started the OneNote again and the safeboot came up. I chose to delete the cache.</p>
<p>I created a new Note TEST20151103 and input some text note. About 6-7minutes I get the message</p>
<p>"We're sorry, something's wrong with this section. Click here to fix it." </p>
<p>Figure I restart PC and this time rename both the OneNote\15.0 (cache) and Document folders.</p>
<p>Create TEST20151103-2 and few minutes later, I get the same message again.</p>
<p>Note that all the StartUp programs are still disabled.</p>

            <p>I created a new note in OneDrive and it worked without the error message. Input some data just for fun and waited a while. No errors.</p>
<p>I loaded my personal note that is stored in OneDrive and so far I am able to navigate without any issues. I waited for the sync to complete and it completed successfully.</p>
<p>Used it and made adjustments and updates to my note so far so good. No errors at all.</p>
<p>New problem though, I cannot use Outlook, Excel, Words because this OneNote is 2016 removed my office 2013. There is now no Office product in this PC but OneNote. Are you saying there is a problem with OneNote 2013 and it is time to use Office 2016? Not
 feasible as I have other PCs all still on 2013.</p>
<p>Any recommendation?</p>
<p>Should I try load Office 2013 again?</p>

            <p>Hi, OneNote 2016 is way better on sync than the 2013 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can install Office 2013 but i recommend that you customize the install and do not install OneNote 2013.</p>
<p>If you have access to Office 2016 there are great improvements with sync and collaboration if you are using that a lot its time to change.</p>

            Finally got it to work with 2016. I had the online version setup for 2013 and will not allow custom install. Managed to fine the img for MS Office 2013 x64 and was able to install all but OneNote. Insert the license. Then I installed OneNote 2016 and it
 was ok for the first two days. I did get a different kind of message on a new book though today. "It looks like this section file is corrupted. OneNote might be able to fix it, but you should avoid working here in the meantime." For some reason, it disappeared.
 So far so good. I will give try for next few days to see if anymore issues.

<p>Hello Garav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two links you can share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is the normal link that you as the author use to open the sway.&nbsp; When this link is opened, if the person is signed in as an author of the Sway, they will get the edit view, otherwise they will get the view-only page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other link is an edit link and can only be grabbed from the share dropdown.&nbsp; When someone follows this link, they are given the option to become an author on the Sway or just remain a viewer of the Sway.&nbsp; Upon making their choice, they are redirected
 back to the first link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are the owner of a Sway, you will always be an author of it.&nbsp; However, if you have been invited by the owner to be a co-author, you can always choose to remove yourself as an author of the Sway later (there is a button o the My Sways page to do this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason</p>

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
We suggest running a System File Checker to scan corruption on Windows system. It will also help fix the corrupted files. Please click this:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the System File Checker tool</a></p>

To isolate the issue, we'd also like to get a screenshot of the corrupted images.</p>

            Hi katieMcGovern1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, both requirements are not possible without deleting your Microsoft account itself. This would mean closure of all Microsoft services.
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.
<br />

<p>I am working on an excel spreadsheet and cannot find the date and time picker option under the developer ribbon. I am working with Windows 7, Excel 2016 (64-bit). I've tried several suggested ways and it's still not available. I use this function all of
 the time. Truly frustrated and spent too much time trying to resolve.</p>

            I am having the same problems and this answer has not helped me at all. Why has Microsoft made this so complicated?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All my old emails have disappeared. They are not older than 1 year just a couple of weeks. I do not access it through a client and I haven't changed my account to @outlook.com.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please can I get a straight answer from someone as I have been trying to solve this issue for a while now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks

</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span><font>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</font></span>
</li><li><span><font>Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?</font></span>
</li><li><span><font>Did you have issues logging in before noticing data loss ‚Äì did you have to reset password?</font></span>
</li><li><span><font>Did you click on any link before the issue occurred?</font></span>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The account was switched roughly 6 moths ago.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The data is losses after roughly 10 days so I only ever have 1 page of emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No problems logging in. Didn't reset password.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This didn't happen when it was Hotmail.com. Infact when I switched back to Hotmail.com the emails re-appeared but then I got switched back again to Outlook.com (which I didn't ask for) then the emails started disappearing so there is obviously
 some sort of filter.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My emails are set so they ARE NOT grouped together by sender and there is NO automatic clean-up set or any rules to make them disappear.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried retrieving deleted emails but this only brings back the ones I have deleted and not the ones that are lost automatically.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please please please can you help me as I can't find any solution on any of your forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben</p>

<h3> alun_rodgers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where&#39;s my Nokia messaging account gone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, this is all a bit strange but I have been receiving e-mails on my N86 from Hotmail, Yahoo and Sky right up until around 8pm UK time yesterday evening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point after that, I was prompted for my hotmail, yahoo and sky passwords al of which&nbsp;fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just tried to login to email.nokia.com&nbsp;with my hotmail address and it generates the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><span>The user name and password you entered do not match any accounts on record. Please make sure that you have correctly entered the first email address you used when you signed up for Nokia Messaging.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that Nokia has gone all Nanny State and decided that its better to disconnect me and leave me clueless about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Dear Nokia Messaging customer,<br /> <br />Recently we deactivated your Nokia Messaging account to ensure you would not incur unexpected data charges on your operator network. If you would like to continue to use Nokia Messaging, please note that data traffic will be charged according to your current operator service plan and may not be included in your flat data rate plan. Please contact your operator to know how much you will be charged. <br /> <br />To reactivate the service, first remove the mailbox(es) from your Nokia Messaging email software on the phone. To do this, <br />-- go to the Email program<br />-- go to Settings <br />-- select the mailbox<br />-- press Options<br />-- select Remove Mailbox<br /> <br />Then, run the Email Setup wizard, and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account.<br />-- press the Email button on your keyboard<br />-- select the "New" icon<br />-- press Start, and follow the on-screen instructions<br /></pre>
<p>It would have been more professional to send the above e-mail so that I knew what was going on before deactivating my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not very impressive Nokia, you certainly didn't connect me!&nbsp;</p>

            I have had exactly the same problem. I received an email from Nokia telling me to reply if I wanted to keep my account active, but Nokia went ahead and deleted it anyway. Very annoying, so have had to set it up from scratch again. Ridiculously bad customer
 service.

<p>What's more annoying is that the instructions in the e-mail don't work. you are informed that you have to be connected to remove a mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you add them in again on email.nokia.com and then try to remove them on the handset you're told that they can't be removed at this time...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got my 3 mailboxes working again but its another case of unecessary interference messing up an otherwise excellent product / service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also have this same problem and have had it for a number of months now. I cannot login to my outlook.com account or access any of my contacts (people) using a browser (any browser).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to setup Thunderbird as a mail client to access my online email account but I need to be able to login using a browser. I have tried multiple browsers (chrome, firefox, explorer), I have cleared the cache, cookies etc and tried to login
 on multiple PC's. I've tried to log in using incognito mode in Chrome - all with the same result as below:</p>

<h2>            Excel Shuts Down on My MacBook Pro</h2>
                    <p>In order to try to fix this problem, I was considering deleting Microsoft office from my programs and reinstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I bought Microsoft Office Mac&nbsp;011 through a download from Microsoft back in December.&nbsp; Microsoft send me an email that allowed me to download it.&nbsp; Since I have downloaded it once onto my Mac,&nbsp;will I be able to use the same download again to download
 the software?</p>

            Before anything else, make sure you have Office 2011 fully updated -- 14.3.9 is current.<br />
<br />
After confirming/updating run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions followed by a restart of your Mac. If the issue persists provide as much additional info as possible in your reply including:<br />
<ul>
<li>OS X version/update level</li><li>Whether this occurs with one specific file or with all including new workbooks</li><li>File type [.xls, .xlsx,...] of affected files</li><li>The content of any error report generated</li></ul>
<br />
Please understand that reinstalling Office is rarely the fix for other than the most technically involved issues. It's recommended only as a last resort &amp; requires a proper &amp; complete removal of the current installation... Just 'trashing' the apps is useless
 &amp; typically creates more serious problems which very well may result in a need to remove/install :-) The files that cause problems are not the ones written to the system during installation.<br />

<h2>            Charging time pureview 808 &#40;too much time&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am starting to think that something wrong can be happening with my 808, it takes TOO MUCH time to charge the battery, like 4 hours, even with a 2A charger it takes so much time. Can this be a software problem? I mean, the phone charges battery and once
 is charged everything is ok, but it takes a lot of time, I feel that it takes an excesive amount of time compared with my previous N8 and the N8¬¥s battery is 1200mA while 808¬¥s is 1400mA, indeed the N8 official charger is 800mA and the 808¬¥s is 1.3A so the
 charging time should be the same or even longer in the N8 and is not, the 808 takes a lot of time compared with N8!</p>

<hr />
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming that it is able to produce the maximum charge current that the battery accepts then the "power" of the charger is not related to the charge time at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know the charge algorithms that Nokia uses, but typically when a Li-ion (or Li-Polymer, which is the same chemistry as Li-Ion) battery is charged the charge current is first limited to somewhere around 0.8x (may be a bit more or less) the capacity
 of the battery, so may be around 1150mA for a 1400mAhr battery. This constant current charge rate is only maintained until the battery cell voltage reaches about 4.2v at which time the charge goes into constant voltage mode. Then as the battery charge continues
 to increase the charge current decreases (voltage remains constant) from that maximum rate down until the current approachs zero, at which time the battery is considered charged. So a great deal of the charge time is at a current much less than the maximum
 charge current.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This drop off in current is not linear (it drops off more quickly to start with so a graph of it is a concave curve), but if we were to assume it was linear, for the sake of an easy example, then for much of the charge time the charge rate would be half
 of the maximum charge rate. So taking the case of the 1150mA charge rate I mentioned above as an example, for much of the charge time (the time after the cell voltage reaches approx. 4.2v) the average of the charge current would be 575mA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So charge times are much longer than a simple comparison between the charger's maximum current capability and the battery capacity would indicate. I think that you will also find that because of the shape of the curve as charge current decreases during the
 constant voltage portion of the charge that a 1400mAhr battery will also take noticably longer to charge than the 20% longer that a simple comparison of battery capacities between a 1400mAhr and 1200mAhr battery might infer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I say that is the normal type of charge regime and I assume that Nokia uses something similar. Regardless, the charge times you are quoting don't seem abnormal to me.</p>

    <title>OneNote Section Size Limit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dislexicmofo  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Section Size Limit</h2>
                    <p>I use OneNote extensively at work, and plan on using it in grad school as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use OneNote in meetings, I have begun to record audio of our meetings. However when the recordings go over roughly 30 minutes at 256k WAV format, I end up with issues with syncing to my OneDrive for Business account. The errors say that the section
 size is to large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked around the issue by creating a Section for each month, and placing a new page for each meeting in this section. When the month passes I place the section into an archive section group. This help reduce the size of the sections and prevent the
 error, however if I have enough meeting I end up having to split the month even further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also decreased the audio quality, but If I go any further than my Surface Pro 2 mic starts to have problems and the audio quality gets too poor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio files are not that large, possibly a 100MB each for an hour meeting, with only one per page and roughly 25 pages per section (month). This represents a worst case making the sections a little over 2 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like the solution of linking external files and using a URL, I want the files embedded in the page itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions:</p>
<p>Is there a way to increase the maximum section size?</p>
<p>Is there maybe another way to organize that I am not thinking about?</p>
<p>If it is not a feature is there a way to request that the size be uncoupled form the storage format on the back end to allow sections to be larger?</p>

<p>1. It downladed the upgrade wgile my laptop was teathered tomy phone as a hotspot while away on business. Took all of my monthly data allowance is about 1/2 an hour.</p>
<p>2. Interupted my work trying to install. &nbsp;Gave me a chance to postpone for a max 8 hours and would happen on next rebot. , No option to leave the install to some future date when &nbsp;it actually maybe convenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.worst of all. Install went through the rather long process. But now the laptop wont boot up sat all. I get thr acer splash screen on power up, then the screen is blank with the mouse pointer flickering between the round thinking thing and an arrow pointer.
 Been doing this for the last 19 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make matters worse. &nbsp;I had to prepare slides and spreadsheet models for my client tomorrow and i now have almost nothing ready. It is 3am and I am due on site at the client in 6 hours. This now a complete nightmare for me. I need halp desperately.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Those kinds of events were what Microsoft was trying to protect you from when they warned you to not install the preview on any computer that you would need to rely on. They also warned potential testers of the preview to make sure they had on hand a means
 of restoring their computer to their licensed operating systems and installed software programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've seen a steady stream of desperate experiences related by those that chose to ignore the warnings.

            <p>This is also why forcing windows updates is a bad idea on the consumer side of things. &nbsp;Microsoft's updates are no longer quality checked like before and are sent out to test whether or not they work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the IT infrastructure side of things, you always want to validate any update on a test set of deployed machines so that you can determine whether the updates will interfere with functioning for your network/programs/group policies, etc.</p>

            If you had already installed on one computer and activated that, then product key is not needed again.
<br />
<br />Once you activate this, the license info is stored in a digital format on Microsoft Activation server and the same information will be used to install again.
<br />
<br />You just need to deactivate existing installation and reinstall on another computer
<br />
<br />1. Deactivate your existing installation - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deactivate-an-Office-365-install-767E3560-96ED-4B1C-806D-2FE01C529B1B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deacti...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install Office again on a new computer - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>
