<h2>            Excel 2016&#58; Formula component descriptions no longer appearing</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I upgraded to Excel 2016 I can no longer see the component descriptions of a formula (i.e. if I'm writing an IF statement, I don't see the component separators that say "logical_test", "value_if_true", "value_if_false"), and its driving me crazy!</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>First Impression Review&#58; Microsoft Band 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sirandar  say:</h3>
<h2>            First Impression Review&#58; Microsoft Band 2</h2>
                    <p>I recently wrote a blog post on the the ethics of data use for monitoring devices like the Microsoft Band 2:<br />
<br />
Physiologic Monitoring Devices: &nbsp;Who Owns the Data and What Purpose Should it Serve?<br />
<br />
<em>http://beautifulobscurity.blogspot.ca/2016/02/physiologic-monitoring-devices-who-owns.html</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>My Hardware Devices:</strong><br />
<br />
Microsoft Band 2<br />
Samsung Note 4<br />
PC Windows7<br />
<br />
<strong>My Nature:</strong><br />
<br />
I am a high level tech person but a conservative one.<br />
Haven't worn a watch in 10 years (too annoying and promotes time over-consciousness)<br />
Have Samsung Note 4 paired with Google Gmail and calendar and 7GB of LTE data<br />
No home Interent except via LTE tether by smartphone<br />
No television or radio (These media contain no useful information)<br />
<br />
<strong>Why Microsoft Band 2:</strong><br />
<br />
From the above I seem like the most unlikely buyer of this product. &nbsp;Indeed I believe both Microsoft and the Federal Government should be paying me to use this device.<br />
<br />
But my decision to actually buy this product comes from 3 directions:<br />
<br />
1) I think it can give me useful information about myself<br />
2) I think it can give society useful information about the human condition.<br />
3) I feel our medical industry and leaders are mired in willful disinformation and I have zero faith in just about anything they say*<br />
<br />
* I do not say this lightly. &nbsp;I am a medical professional myself in bacterial science and I attend many seminars and know how to read the scientific literature. &nbsp;Medial science related to human health is literally a badly made house of cards. &nbsp;Those few well
 crafted and important works of science are ignored if inconvenient.<br />
<br />
So I see devices such as the Band 2 as the only way to move forward and cut through the sloppy and willful deceptions and actually generate valid health data that can be used individually and aggregated to make social policy decisions related to health. &nbsp;More
 sophisticated versions of these devices may for the first time find out what is actually important for good health. Doctors and health scientists are salesmen and cannot be trusted to do this.<br />
<br />
Ideally these devices would provide constant in-depth physiologic, hormonal and mental state data AND they would link to a smart device where people can enter how they are feeling and what they are experiencing in real time. Data and context, &nbsp;the foundations
 of real science. People, especially pregnant mothers should be paid to use these devices. &nbsp;This might be the most valuable information humanity has ever generated.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Microsoft Band 2 Hardware:</strong><br />
<br />
It is primitive and probably deliberately crippled but it is a great start.<br />
<br />
I can't even wear a watch but I have no complaints about the Band 2 worn on my left hand inside facing. The size and shape is just right for me. &nbsp;It isn't a work of art but it is well designed and has a good utilitarian style.<br />
<br />
It seems over designed but I love the clip and the button feel and the screen is just right and clearly visible.<br />
<br />
When I took it out of the box I assumed it would have a induction charger and spent 15 minutes trying to get it to charge and then searched the Internet to find out how. &nbsp;Thinking about it I am glad it has a contact charger because induction is way to slow.
 &nbsp;My Samsung Note 4 seems to charge full in 15 minutes with it's dedicated charger.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The Microsoft Band 2 Software:</strong><br />
<br />
I would say the local software and firmware are incredibly well designed yielding an eminently usable package with information quickly accessible and nothing you don't need (if you configure it that way).<br />
<br />
Media controls work well, texts show up and allow canned responses and Google notifications fire properly.<br />
<br />
The downsides are that you don't have direct access to raw data and it obligately goes through the cloud and Microsoft's servers. No doubt Microsoft will sell the aggregated de-identified data to the highest bidder and it will probably be misused to make false
 claims and sell products.<br />
<br />
In Android, the Band 2 doesn't integrate with Google Voice Services only Cortana on Windows Phones. &nbsp;As a avid user of Google Voice Services I can say voice dictation of texts probably won't work on the Band 2 anyway. &nbsp;There is too much room for disaster and
 mis-translations that won't be easy to detect and correct. &nbsp;I am happy with canned text responses but there should be more than 4 of them.<br />
<br />
In the Android and PC App the user should have the option to hide the tiles they don't want to see, like Golf.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall:</strong><br />
<br />
It is a great product that doesn't try to do what it cannot do well or would be much easier on your phone.<br />
<br />
<strong>What About the Data?:</strong><br />
<br />
Far to early to give a decent assessment.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure ..... I want direct access to the rawish data.</p>

            <strong>Day 3 Update:</strong><br />
<br />
Unbelievably, the texting keyboard is actually usable. I laughed when I saw it but when I tried it a few times is correctly guessed what I wanted to say.<br />
<br />
Heart rate is useless unless the band is pretty tight .... then it is very accurate. &nbsp;Unfortunately at that tightness your wrist movement is impaired during actions like push-ups. I have a feeling that at least some band failures are caused by this. &nbsp;Fortunately
 the band clasp allow for very easy adjustment so this really isn't an issue. &nbsp;You probably wouldn't want to use it for boxercise or boot camp.<br />
<br />
The calorie counts agreed fairly closely with the elliptical trainer I tried, but they both may be wrong.<br />
<br />
Battery life isn't as good as it should be but guesstimate I am getting about 2 days. (I don't run it flat).<br />
<br />
Tried the smart wake up feature and it gave me the most tolerable wake up in years the first time I used it.<br />
<br />
The sleep monitor data is very interesting. &nbsp;

    <title>Long Text field not displaying correctly in Reports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Long Text field not displaying correctly in Reports</h2>
                    Hello all. We have an Access DB and recently upgraded to Office 365. Since then, the reports no longer print correctly - where the Long Text fields contain information, they take up more room "down" the page than they should (the background is colored,
 so it is visible). I've tried compacting and repairing, but that does not help. I am thinking this is a bug, but wondered if anyone else has experienced this.

            So this is what it looks like after export as a PDF. I wrote code behind the report to suppress the fields that are vacant from printing to save on printing costs, since not all fields apply to all bridges (this is from our bridge management system), and
 that still seems to be working, but anywhere there is something in the comments section, we get the effect you see.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3a6a9a4-a363-4f2a-b41c-730b7f7d5e70?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3a6a9a4-a363-4f2a-b41c-730b7f7d5e70?upload=true" /></a>

<p>It's not clear to me what, in the image, is the "comments section" that seems to be causing the problem.&nbsp; The last line, with the large, blank, colored area, doesn't seem much different from the lines above, except that it contains the text, "Summary Rating:".&nbsp;
 The first line item, C44, has what looks like long text with no apparent extra space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do both the text boxes and the report section have the CanShrink property set to Yes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you verified that the long text fields themselves don't contain extra trailing spaces?</p>

<p>One of my first thoughts was that somehow we got a bunch of extraneous spaces at the ends of the comments section, but doing some spot checking, that does not seem to be the case. It only seems to affect what were "memo" fields (now I guess they are called
 "long text" fields) and only those with comments in them. If the inspector only entered a rating, but no comments, the reports seem to display OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as you noticed, only the end field - the summary field seems to be acting up. I am beginning to think it is because the field in the report stretches from edge of page to edge of page so the colored "banner" prints from edge of page to edge of page.
 I keep the entered comments between the label and the rating label by using the margins in the field in the report. Both the can grow and can shrink are set to "yes". A colleague who looked at this said if I set the margins to zero, the problem disappears.
 But I don't think the report will print correctly if I do that (at least as far as the colored banner goes).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to keep playing with the margins, though, to see if I can figure out what is going on.</p>

            I can't quite picture how you have this set up without looking at your report design.&nbsp; If you can't figure out the problem, and are willing to post the database where I can download it to look at, let me know.

<p>I will have to ask permission to do that, I think. Where can I post it that you could download it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as an aside, I have been playing with the margins. If I set the margins to zero, the problem goes away, but then the label and the number rating over-write what is written in the summary comments. And if I resize the comment field so that the labels
 and the number rating are outside of the comment field but keep the margins to zero, it seems to print OK, but the colored banner is buggered up (but I expected that based on the way the report is formatted). And just for giggles, I tried increasing the margins
 with the field resized to fit between the label and the number rating and that caused the problem to reappear. So (it seems to me) that the problem relates to the size of the margins compared to the width of the field in the report. Which seems pretty strange
 (to me anyway).</p>

                    <p>I've created an MS Word Form in VBA.&nbsp;It works just fine, but now I'm trying to make it "look nice".&nbsp;&nbsp; I created the form as a template (dotm) which will eventually be placed on a shared drive.&nbsp; What I want is for the end users to see only the form (and not
 the Word document)&nbsp;when they double click and start a new document from the template.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they are ready to submit and select OK, the form hides and the Word Document is visible with the data from the form filed in.&nbsp; I almost got it to work using the code (and the reverse, [= True] after OK click)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim doc As Document<br />
Set doc = Documents.Open("template file name/location")<br />
doc.ActiveWindow.Visible = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>That worked while working on the template itself, but not when the template is clicked to create a new document.&nbsp; Most likely because the file name/path changes when one uses the template to start a new document.&nbsp; But I can't figure out what the name of
 the document would be or where it is located.&nbsp; The word document displayed behind the template is "Documen1" until the form is filled out, then the name changes to the template name&nbsp;after the OK click event (the form is filled in).&nbsp; I'm sure the opening document
 must be a temporary location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This procedure should be something done all the time.&nbsp; Can you help me figure out how to hide the .doc until the form is filled out?</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SPAM E-mail messages that use my Hotmail account address.</h2>
                    <p>My E-mail address NEVER got SPAM in the past.&nbsp; In the twenty (20) years that I've had it, I have only recently started getting it in the past year.&nbsp; I use the account for contacting family and employment endeavors.&nbsp; For some reason, although I block the
 senders who use my address in the address from which the messages are sent, I still get messages.&nbsp; Sometimes I will get messages that have the the following text:&nbsp; "Sent on behalf of
<em><strong>(the name of my E-mail address)</strong></em> <span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">
<strong>[Example: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***]</strong></span> and then additional nonsense characters around it.&nbsp; The nonsense characters could be random characters or dashes, underlines or asterisks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to creatively or universally stop this SPAM from coming to me by blocking it?&nbsp; Sometimes it goes to my Junk Mail folder but I get them in both my Inbox AND my Junk Mail folders.&nbsp; I am at my wits end sorting through and deleting the garbage
 that I get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            When the spammer is faking your address as the from address, the only solution is to create a rule to delete mail sent from you to you. 
<br />
<br />But... its possible the account was compromised. Change your password, consider enabling two-factor authentication.

            The email is generated when someone responds to your question. However, the "person" who responded is not real and the text of the message is a lie - its not Microsoft support. It's a fake support scammer. A moderator deleted the spammer after he posted that - that's why you dont see that reply.

<p>Thanks for clearing that question that I had about that scammer with the response to my question with the alleged Microsoft Support Number.&nbsp; I am glad that I didn't fall for that one.</p>

<p><em>6mz8mqnlinl2wb4 &lt;* __________________*<strong>[my E-mail address]</strong>@hotmail.com&gt;; on behalf of; Fidelity Life Insurance &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</em></p>
<p>I can't figure out an Inbox rule to stop idiots like this from sending me E-Mail.&nbsp; I use the Outlook client as well as the web version.&nbsp; I went through the Junk Mail options thoroughly.&nbsp; I found the section to block mail from other countries but
 want to know if you or any other person who reads and responds to my query, have any suggestions for creating a rule for senders with common
<span>resource names like ".com", "gov", ".info", ".edu" and the like.</span></p>

            You can create rules to files based on the top-level domain (use a words in the senders address rule), but its not a good spam-filtering technique because so many legitimate senders using those domains. 
<br />
<br />If you never send yourself mail, create a rule to delete mail from yourself.

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is reportedly putting the finishing touches on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which is slated to
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-windows-10-anniversary-update-is-officially-coming-august-2---here039s-what039s-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
arrive on August 2</a>. The report comes from <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-begins-sign-process-windows-10-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Central</a>, saying that <strong>build 14384 should be the first RTM (release to manufacturing) build.</strong><br />
<br />
The company has begun the sign-off process for the build, which means that it will put a variety of builds through internal tests, and then it will pick the best one for a public release.<br />
<br />
According to the report, Insiders can expect to see a final build by the end of next week. The timeline isn't surprising. With the Anniversary Update less than a month away, we should certainly be in the polishing phase.<br />
<br />
The fate ofWindows phones that are ineligible for the Anniversary Update is still undetermined. Such unsupported devices have had
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/heres-how-to-upgrade-your-device-to-windows-10-mobile-even-if-its-not-supported" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a sort of "upgrade at your own risk" option through the Release Preview ring</a>. These users will be unable to install the Anniversary Update, but it's not clear if build 10586 will remain available for them.<br />
<br />
The report also states that the Redstone 2 (Rs2) builds that Microsoft is compiling are in the 148xx range, and should begin shipping to Insiders in mid-to-late August. The Redstone 2 update isn't slated
<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/surface-phone-said-to-be-due-in-april-2017-with-redstone-2-and-redstone-3-is-coming-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
to arrive for the public until April, 2017</a>.</p>

<p>You have to alter the registry to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a read of how on <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/12757-microsoft-edge-ask-close-all-tabs-turn-off-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ten Forums Article</a>&nbsp; It will tell you how. There are a couple of reg files there as well, simply download them, and double click the one you need to run, agree and the problem will be sorted. Just tried it on the latest build 14383 and it worked perfectly.</p>

<h3> lornaok  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 search feature not working</h2>
                    I am having a problem searching emails in Outlook. I get no results every time, even when searching for my name.
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I am not having problems accessing other accounts on the same computer<strong>.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I can search email on my iPhone fine.</p>
<p>Indexing is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only been a problem in the past several months. Note: I have other Outlook issues (folders I have created disappear, emails disappear, and mailboxes take forever to sync). I don't have these problems when I access my email via webmail in a browser.
 Any help would be appreciated. </p>

            <p>Hello Lorna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you better, we need few details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What type of email account is configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync and Microsoft Exchange)?</p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error message when you use ‘Search’ function in Outlook?</p>
<p>3. What do you mean by “not having problems accessing other accounts on the same computer”? Have you configured multiple account in the same Outlook profile or with different profile?</p>
<p>4. Does the ‘Folders disappear’ issue is on the same account of which ‘Search’ function is not working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding ‘Search’ issue, you may refer to the thread link given below.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/windows-81-indexing-issue-search-not-working-in/c79d116f-31b7-4400-90a4-8b1b335042be">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/windows-81-indexing-issue-search-not-working-in/c79d116f-31b7-4400-90a4-8b1b335042be</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide us the detailed information about the account type configured which will help us to analyze in order to resolve both the Outlook issues.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Nyana. So sorry I'm responding so late. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What type of email account is configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync and Microsoft Exchange)?
<em><strong>Incoming - IMA</strong></em><em><strong>P&nbsp; Outgoing - SMTP</strong></em></p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error message when you use ‘Search’ function in Outlook?
<em><strong>No. Simply..."We couldn't find what you're looking for"</strong></em></p>
<p>3. What do you mean by “not having problems accessing other accounts on the same computer”?
<em><strong>I was asked this in a previous post, though I was told I posted in the wrong area, so now I'm here.</strong></em> Have you configured multiple account in the same Outlook profile or with different profile?
<em><strong>I have no problems with my gmail on this computer. Also, I have no problems accessing this email account through webmail or on my phone.</strong></em></p>
<p>4. Does the ‘Folders disappear’ issue is on the same account of which ‘Search’ function is not working?
<strong><em>Yes</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding ‘Search’ issue, you may refer to the thread link given below.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/windows-81-indexing-issue-search-not-working-in/c79d116f-31b7-4400-90a4-8b1b335042be">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/windows-81-indexing-issue-search-not-working-in/c79d116f-31b7-4400-90a4-8b1b335042be</a>
</p>
<p><strong><em>I wanted to try this, but I could not find scanpst.exe anywhere in C:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have yet another problem: I have not received any emails since Oct 8th. I receive them fine through webmail and on my phone. I wonder if I need to uninstall and reinstall Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A note that may help. I have not updated to Windows 8.1. This has kept me from downloading some apps, so maybe it's affecting Outlook? The reason I haven't updated is this: In January I attempted to update to 8.1 and my entire system crashed. Black screen.
 I was told I was a victim of an incompatibility issue between Windows 8.1 update and my HP hardware. Neither Microsoft or HP would claim responsibility or offer any answers. The laptop was still under warranty, so the point of sale merchant sent it to HP to
 clean it up and install 8.1. It came back to me without the update so I still have only 8.0 and now I'm afraid to try updating to 8.1. That crash was a nightmare to say the least and the laptop has just never been the same. Could this have anything to do with
 these Outlook issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lorna</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and I cannot make any change in the settings of the email accounts - I get a message that my "Outllook data file cannot be configured".</p>
<p>Also, I re-installed outlook (repair) but without success. The problem is that in the &nbsp;one email account the Outlook returns results &nbsp;while in the other three I get a message saying "We couldn't find anything, etc." I tried also another method that I found
 over the MS webpages &nbsp;(e.g., from Outlook &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Search tab &gt; Indexing options &gt; Modify, etc.) but without success again.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Nayara,</p>
<p>First of all, I am sorry for my delayed reaction. Regarding your questions about the problem (I still) face, my reply is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Where exactly are you changing the settings of the account and receive error message?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not sure; I tried via outlook and also via control panel but as far as I remember I could not make. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sure, before the problem occurred for first time, I had made no changes&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What type of email accounts are configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Active Sync)?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All my email accounts are IMAP and I have one additional Microsoft Exchange (i.e., my outlook.com &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;account just to synch my contacts and my calendar in my devices),&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Did
 the same issue persist in new Outlook profile?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes. I have just created a new profile (without however deleting the old one). In this new profil I &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;included only one of the three accounts with which I have a problem &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and, again, the same problem
 persists.</span>Thank for your consideration</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>I thank you for your prompt reply. &nbsp;Actually, I do not receive any error message. The outllook simply does not return any search results in the three out of my four email accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, while in the one i get a bunch of results,&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>You may follow the steps mentioned below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Check how search works in the Outlook application's safe mode. Click Start &gt; type 'outlook /safe' (Without the quotes and note the space in the command)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue still persists in Outlook safe mode then try to rebuild the indexing and check how search works in Outlook.</span></span></p>
<p><span>A. Open Outlook &gt; Click on ‘File’.</span></p>
<p><span>B. Click on ‘Options’ &gt; ‘Search’.</span></p>
<p><span>C. Click on ‘Indexing Options’ under ‘Sources’.</span></p>
<p><span>D. Click on ‘Advanced’ button.</span></p>
<p><span>E. Under ‘Indexing Settings’ tab &gt; Click on ‘Rebuild’.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The rebuild process might take a long time depending on the items to be indexed on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the results to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>I thank you for your continuing efforts to help me resolve the problem. I tried the step 1 (outlook in a safe mode) and the search function seems to work well. What should I do to have it working in the typical model also?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi ben Stallwood,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>According to You may check whether the your account email address has been listed in Exchange Admin Center-&gt;protection-&gt;action center (if you don’t have admin permission, you may let your admin perform the following steps in link ) :&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/dn458545(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/dn458545(v=exchg.150).aspx</span></a>

<p>Hi Ben Stallwood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your information in Private Messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-delivery report are composed of two parts: User information, Diagnostic information for administrators. And the Diagnostic information for administrators part generally including: Generating server, &lt;Rejected recipient&gt;, Original message headers. Here’s
 the reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/email-non-delivery-reports-in-office-365-51daa6b9-2e35-49c4-a0c9-df85bf8533c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the NDR you provided isn’t have original messages header, as we need messages header to analyze the mail flow of the email, may I re-confirm with you whether that is the full NDR provided in Private Messages? If not, would you please provide
 a full of it to me? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may also check your email address in Action center, does your email address listed in action center?</p>
<p>

            I take it you are wanting to print a single label? &nbsp;When you are in the <b>Address
</b>box of the <b>Mailings, Labels</b> window, select your label text and right click. &nbsp;You should then be able to choose
<b>Font </b>and enlarge the text. &nbsp;To move the text nearer the centre of the label, you can place your cursor at the beginning of your label text and &nbsp;press
<b>Enter </b>a few times, then select the text and choose <b>Paragraph </b>from that same menu and you can experiment with increasing the indent.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>If you wish to have greater control over your labels, it is a good idea to choose to print
<b>Full page of the same label</b> instead of a single label, then click the <b>New Documen</b>t button. &nbsp;This will take you to a full page of labels - you can delete the ones you don't want and use your normal editing controls to position the label text more
 accurately.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            Differences in storage reporting.</h2>
                    
<p>I've read this article but have some questions about it relative to what I'm seeing in our E1 tenant.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Manage-site-collection-storage-limits-77389c2c-8e7e-4b16-ab97-1c7103784b08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Manage-site-collection-storage-limits-77389c2c-8e7e-4b16-ab97-1c7103784b08</a></p>
<p>The first paragraph explains how your storage pool is determined, and that formula agrees with what I see in the Sharepoint admin center (site collections) area. It's a little more than 250GB.</p>
<p>For a long time now, we've had the storage management option on "auto."</p>
<p>If we look in the Storage Metrics section of our site collection, however, it shows 1024GB (of potential space--we've used only very little of it so far), which is of course the 1TB that the article goes on to discuss. That's not a bad thing, but it is confusing,
 since it's larger than the "pool."</p>
<p>My question: what is the point of the first paragraph of the article then--the storage pool calculation--if everyone gets 1TB per site collection? &nbsp;The site collection is much larger than the size of the pool. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;How?</p>
<p>Are they actually measuring two different things? &nbsp;Clearly I'm misunderstanding something about this.</p>

<p>Hi Reepster,</p>
<p>I have checked the article you attached. The first paragraph means that, when you set
<strong>Auto</strong> in <strong>Site Collection Storage Management</strong>, every site collection
<strong>can</strong> use up to a maximum of 1 terabyte. But it doesn’t mean every site collection already has 1 TB storage (it uses what it needs from the
<strong>storage pool</strong> when they need it), and when the storage pool is running low, you need to buy more storage for your site collection. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is not clear enough, feel free to let me know. I am glad to help you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April</p>

<h2>            circular error message pooping up on my excel file when opening. I have  office 365 and windows 10</h2>
                    I have a large file with some 10 worksheets and 5 of which have charts and 5 have the data. The data points are calculated from the data in the table pages and the names of the data points on the charts are assigned by a macro. I have done these for some
 time. My latest files are now having an error message popping up as my file opens. I have previous files with similar data-- produced quarterly - which do not have the pop-up error problem. Microsoft wants to charge me $400 to help me find the source of my
 problem. My guess is that they updated some thing and caused the problem, but has anyone had this problem and found a resolution.

<p>try removing or changing these references</p>

    <title>Assign page number and print specific page number in a section in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katelovesme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assign page number and print specific page number in a section in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>does anyone know how can skip the first page of a section and start numbering the page from the second page as Page 1, by default, Word will name the second page as Page 2, how could i make it Page 1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is also about printing a page in a section. I have a document which has a number of sections. All sections are separated by odd page section break, and they page numbers are consistent throughout all these sections.When I try to print a specific
 section, the printer always adds a blank page before the section. this will make the the first page of that section in an even page, how could I get rid of that blank page and print my first page at front. how can I print a specific range of pages starting
 from an even page number while adding a blank odd page before them. If the section page number restarts from each section. How do I print the page 7 to 9 in section 2, while there are also pages number 7 to 9 in section 1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any reply~</p>

<p>Thanks Stefan for your helpful tips, especially to display the section in the status bar.</p>
<p>But I still have problem about printing a section. I have many sections in my documents, and each of them are separated by odd page section break. Let's say when i choose to print only section of that document, and the first page of that section I want it
 to be on an odd page as it is in the document.&nbsp; Yet somehow the printer will automatically add a blank page before it(because of the section break I suppose), so that the first page of my section 2 turns into an even page. How can i get rid of that ?<br />

<p>Thank you Doug. Starting at 0 turns out to be very effective in my case. But can i ask one more question in this direction. I want to add a front page(odd page on the right hand side) without number to each of my sections, and the first page on its back(so
 it will be on an even page), but I want to set this first page's page number as 1, or if it's section B, as B-1, etc.. How can I set the page number format in this case?</p>

            <p>Using an Odd Page Section Break should give you what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to have a Heading Style that includes the "numbers" such as B so that you can select that Style in the Page Number Format dialog as the Style with which the Chapter starts.</p>

            Without the product key you are totally out of luck. So lets see if we can help you find it...<br />
<br />
Assuming it was 2010 and you needed an email account to buy it I'll guess / assume that you bought an online download. There would be no packaging or disks, just the confirmation email with the product key on it.&nbsp; If you bought an online download, then they
 probably setup an "online account" for you using that email address. It will contain your product key and a link to the installation file download.<br />
<br />
Here are the 2 most likely online store sites for you to try:<br />
<div>
<b><span>Digital River Download Signin page - for downloads and Find your Order</span></b>
<p><a href="https://www.findmyorder.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>https://www.findmyorder.com</span></b></a><b>
</b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<b><span>Microsoft Store- Phone 1-877-696-7786 or login at
</span></b>
<p><a href="http://store.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://store.microsoft.com</span></b></a><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
Is there any chance you have an image copy backup of the old setup? You could extract the key from there too.<br />

<h2>            EXCEL worksheet shows different Print Preview with different Printers</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Friends:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an EXCEL worksheet of A4 size. When preview under PDF printer, it captures all contents in one page. But when preview in Canon printer, the contents overflow into two pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know the reason why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hello! Friend:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the shrink feature in EXCEL to capture contents in one page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What intriguing me is why under same paper size, same margining, same 100% scaling, etc, EXCEL shows different print previews (hence different print results) with different printers, namely PDF and Canon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inconvenience that comes with this differing previews is I have to reconfigure the worksheet every time I move from one printer to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just checked. Canon doesn't update my printer driver anymore. The last update was 07.12.2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be the PDF driver issue and not Canon's.</p>

            <p>Since MS Office keeps getting updates, device drives also keep their drivers updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try updating PDF driver and see whether results of both printers are same or not..(I am not sure if Excel 2007 has native capability to do Save As PDF, if it has then no need to update PDF driver)</p>

            Hi Kyoko_PDX
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. First see whether they are installed or not. To check this type Excel or Word or PowerPoint in Windows search (Cortana) and see whether they come up or not. If yes, they can be pinned by right clicking on them.
<br />
<br />2. Another way to check it - type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; See whether you have your Office listed here or not.
<br />
<br />3. Start Excel by double clicking any Excel file &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; In Processes tab, right click on Excel &gt; Open File Location &gt; See whether Word.exe and Excel.exe and Powerpoint.exe and other MS Office product exe are there or not. If they are there, right click &gt; Create shortcut and pin the shortcut 
<br />
<br />4. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />(it might ask for product key for Office 2013 or below. Hence do it if product key is available for if you had Office 2013 or below)

            Did you do a repair to restore them? Do they disappear after every restart or just after updates are installed?

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure that we're one the same page, are you trying to alphabetize the folders/files on your File Explorer? If yes, then please do the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On File Explorer, right click on any blank space</li><li>Choose Arrange icons by Name</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have further concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Dear Jerico</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in "Word" and quite often when I want to save some item I go int a file which is normally arranged alphabetically, only to find that it is out of any sort of order. What I want is to be able to sort that file back into alphabetical order. I
 am not quite sure what you refer to as File Explorer as it is not a title I have in my system I am using Microsoft Windows version 10 and in the File mode. Sorry about the confusion but whilst I have been using computers for many years I am not an expert in
 any way shape or form.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Keith Moseley</p>

<p>Hello Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I hope you enjoy it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version of Word are you using?</p>
