<h2>            Windows 10 Technical preview driver issues with INTEL</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><strong>Hi </strong>all, first of all I want to confirm that Microsoft is really going on the right path with windows 10, cheers for that.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Metro apps on desktop, start menu with METRO APPS (LIVE ICONS) on it, best of all is that users can switch from a little start menu or the full screen start menu as before, thats wonderfull, when you shut down the computer it use
 same system as windows 8 so it boot really really fast even on older netbooks, to install drivers as the printer or tv hdmi i was really surprised how fast windows detect and install the drivers by him self and I even love these new windows effect when you
 open or close the windows plus the shadows behind each window, the possibility to have more than one desktop like Linux, etc...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have see lot of comments over the internet saying that all these tweaks already existed with Stardock and other sites:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">- Start menu, they are a lot on the internet for windows 8</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- Metro apps on desktop modernmix permit this already</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- The new efect on windows open/close, windows FX</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- Shadowsx from Stardock already made that shadow behind windows</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Ok that's true but its a lot better that windows implement these features straight away in the system cause then you win a lot of memory than using windows 8 with 4 programs running in the background, talking about the start menu,
 this start menu is from far the best until now.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So in a few words this system is very smooth, fast and im sure it will be the best windows&nbsp;OS&nbsp;from far away, plus the fact that im sure they are lot of features non revealed yet to make us even more surprised :D</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Now lets go to&nbsp;one problem that could be fixed, first of all I want to make clear that this issue is in my opinion 100% problem of INTEL, personally if i were windows I would stop straight away to work with INTEL, i gona explain
 why:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Ive been using computers since i were 5 years old, im 22 now, I started with windows 98 and so on been using a lot of systems, at 2003 I started using computers with AMD and been switching from windows to Linux and the drivers always
 worked perfect.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Now at this day I had a problem with my amd laptop so I decided to make my own laptop that will be in a couple month when I got time to buy all the components, now im travelling and don't have time, so a friend gave me a netbook
 to use temporaly, an asus eepc 1GB ram, INTEL ATOM CPU N2600, double processor 1.60 GH, so as i were using windows 8 on my amd since I prefer the performance of metro I installed windows 8 and now windows 10 on this netbook so i could see all improves and
 at least do my basic work on the netbook, all drivers were correctly installed just by one that give lot of trouble to 1000 and 1000 of customers all over the world and that's the famous GMA3600 VIDEO DRIVER, intel don't support windows 8 at all, i can install
 the driver without problem the resolution is allright the computer run smoothly but when I conect the laptop to a monitor to get big resolution and when I open any metro app the computer just crash as it used to do with windows 8, this is not cause I would
 use metro apps all the time but is the fact that if i want i cant cause a bloo dy driver that an incompetent company as intel dont want to update and make it work with windows 8 or later versions.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This issue is all over the web, and Intel as far as I know just ignore everybody, I dont really care cause in a couple of month I but my new laptop and of course it will be with AMD as I always used to do, so everything gona be
 alright but what about all these thousands of customers that have GMA3600, just because intel incompetence windows 8 and probably windows 10 will lose thousands of customers, from far as Ive seen when windows 10 is out im sure most of windows 7 users and of
 course windows 8 will upgrade to windows 10 but this huge amount of users that have good laptops or desktops or even tablets with GMA3600 WILL NOT UPGRADE JUST BECAUSE THIS ISSUES I JUST WROTE.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So we all know that Intel will lose a lot of customers that's Guarantee but why do windows have to suffer Intel's big mess, we know that they are millions using AMD but lose thousands is the same as losing 100000, cause every single
 customer can be a potential customer anyday.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">So I just see 2 options here, try to find out what make the computers with GMA3600 CRASH after opening any metro app and try to fix it out somehow, forget the fact that intell will fix it, I read on the web that this issue have
 been there for years and no solutions at all by INTELL.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Other choice is to stop at all working with INTEL cause all that company is doing is a big mess.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">BY the way another issue I see, not such a big deal but a bit no sense in my opinion is the fact that we still need minimum resolution to run metro apps even if we run them from desktop that seriously dont make sense.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thx a lot, ill keep checking out the system, by your side Microsoft you doing a great job, but please check out this issue, i dont care cause I am an AMD user, but im asking for all these INTEL users.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thx a lot</p>

<h2>            Linked phone camera will not connect to the internet</h2>
                    <p>I linked my android phone to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; When I use the camera feature in the search box, it will not save or upload pictures.&nbsp; It says "You are offline.&nbsp; Please check your network."&nbsp; I have three bars on my phone (4G LTE), the phone is connected
 to my network, Edge works fine, my connection to OneDrive works fine, I am connected to my WD NAS fine, and every other feature on the phone works - except the camera will not save or upload pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the android phone app and that saves/uploads fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening.</p>

            All of the phone and other Windows functions work fine, including the android camera app.&nbsp; The camera option in the search bar appeared when I linked the phone to Windows.&nbsp; The Windows camera app is different than the android app, so it seems to be a Windows
 issue.

    <title>How do I add a label page to my existing label document on MAC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbcimages  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add a label page to my existing label document on MAC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>So I can create an Avery Label on word, but it only creates one page. &nbsp;I have over 70 pages of names and addresses I want to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for a 'duplicate' or 'add page' function to my existing label file. But all I can find is to start a new file (and not add a page to the existing file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am explaining right. &nbsp;It's like when you do a simple word doc and when you keep typing it creates a page 2, page 3 and so forth auotmatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't do that when I make Label docs. I can only create 1 page without adding on new pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Sections are becoming corrupted - cannot delete from recycle bin</h2>
                    <p>I have a shared onenote. &nbsp;Some team members edit from desktop clients (windows/mac etc) - some edit from web. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About twice a week, some section in my onenote will become corrupted - much in the same way described here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10/corrupted-section-causes-synch-error-even-after-i/681993d3-9743-44c5-aea9-12346c948386</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"It looks like this section file is corrupted. OneNote might be able to fix it, but you should avoid working here in the meantime. (Error code: 0xE00001AE)"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fix this by copying data from the corrupted section into a new section, and then deleting the old section, but then the old, corrupted section remains corrupted in my Onenote Recycle bin (and I cannot remove it - if I delete it from my onenote recycle
 bin, it comes back.). &nbsp;So there are two bugs here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Onenote section becomes corruped</p>
<p>2) Cannot delete corrupted onenote section from onenote recycle bin - resulting in incomplete sync</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is making Onenote a terrible collaboration tool and we're actively looking for more stable alternatives.</p>

    <title>Word Styles does not change font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watson scott swail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Styles does not change font</h2>
                    <p>I consider myself a master user of Word, so I am a bit mystified by this problem with "Styles."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am editing a document in Word and notice that, within a paragraph that is using the "Report Text" style (that we created), there are two fonts being used: Calibri, and Helvetica. I noticed this issue because the Helvetica, which shouldn't even be there,
 is also a larger font size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select the paragraph and select "Report Text" again. It does not change any of the fonts or sizes. So I select "Clear Formatting," which then changes the paragraph. I then redo the select Report Text, and it is back the way it is. Helvetica is still there
 and still larger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I use the font menu at the top and select Calibri, but it does not change the Helvetica text. I change the font size using the dropdown in the ribbon. No change. WTF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have to go in directly to the words (and even partial words, where only a couple of letters are calibri and a few Helvetica) by font and size to get them to change. NOTE: I just tried it again and I could not get the font to change... AND... I find
 that most of the quotation marks in the document are in helvetica.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm editing an 80-page, single-spaced document. This is a problem. What the heck is going on here? I have seen this in other documents, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Word 2016 for Mac version 15.37. BTW, have also saved this as the older version of Word, but that didn't change anything.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>build 16199 keeps freezing at the 32&#37; level of the final section - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjhaberk  say:</h3>
<h2>            build 16199 keeps freezing at the 32&#37; level of the final section of the install process</h2>
                    I was able to upgrade to version 16193.1000 using a bootable DVD installation disk created with the Windows 10 ISO file I downloaded from Microsoft.&nbsp; Now comes the problem...whenever I try to run the upgrade to version 16199 prerelease I get as far as
 the 32% level of the final installation section and then the system just craps out and freezes.&nbsp; I tried 4 different times with the exact same result.&nbsp; This is exactly the same spot that I originally tried when I was running version 16179 and tried to upgrade
 to 16199.
<p>Is there a bug in the 16199 version?&nbsp; Also, is there an installation log that can be created while the installation is being executed so that I can see exactly what is trying to be installed that is causing my system to freeze?&nbsp; Also, a little suggestion
 the the Windows team, how about a smaller screen inside the installation screen that shows the install progress and what is currently being installed at any point during the install process.</p>
<p>Any help reguarding an install log would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            Did you read any of the other posting from people having the same issue? as some of the posting do have tips on what to do one that I have used and worked on 5 system is where you turn off the internet once the download hits 100% and getting ready to install.

<p>every posting I have found that closely or exactly matches my problem I have read or tried.&nbsp; What I need is some kind of logging utility to track and document the install process.&nbsp; Microsoft should realize that this type of utility would be EXTREMELY useful.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately, I do not possess the coding skills to create such a utiliy.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for asking! As I Understand, you are not able to keep the formatting when copying from MS Word to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I would like to collect some information on the issue.</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changes to the system prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you referring to Modern view of Internet Explorer or Desktop view of Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to copying from MS Word?</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you able to paste other data with the format in Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to specific website?</p>
<p>Please provide more information on the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to check the issue in compatibility view and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Some websites may have been designed for earlier versions of Internet Explorer. Try to view the website in Compatibility View.</p>
<p>If Internet Explorer recognizes that the webpage isn't compatible, you'll see the Compatibility View button on the Address bar. Try clicking it.</p>
<p>In Compatibility View, websites will be displayed as if you were viewing them in a previous version of Internet Explorer, which will often correct display problems.
 You donâ€™t need to click the button for a site after youâ€™ve done it onceâ€”the next time you visit the site, Internet Explorer will automatically show it in Compatibility View.</p>
<p>Reply back with the results, I would be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it's in an SD card, just add it to the new phone. If it's in the cloud, open OneDrive and you'll find the media there. For a complete restore, you have to restore a backup when you set the phone up for the first time or after a reset.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 doesn&#39;t update</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 laptops: HP Pro G4 (2017); HP 15in (2017); Toshiba L775 i5 (2010)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All have Win 10 installed, 2 have Eset AV and the G4 Pro has McAfee.&nbsp; I have installed Office365 on all 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the laptops will update Office365.&nbsp; Every time I boot up I receive a message telling there are updates and I go through the process to update [Select Download Now etc], but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling the AV. I have altered the update settings in Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually connect to the internet via a USB 3/4G Three UK Dongle, so I connected to the internet via WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged on as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing and reinstalling Office365</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked.</p>

            Microsoft is currently in the process of migrating its new servers to new versions of Office for deployment, so this might be affecting users such as yourself. 
<br />
<br />I would wait a couple more weeks then try again.
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try doing:
<br />
<br />Try adding the Google Public DNS to your router then see if you can successfully browse the site:
<br />
<br />Google: Add Public DNS to Your Home Router - groovyPost 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/google-add-public-dns-home-router/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/google-add-pub...</a>
<br />
<br />Then try updating Office again.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<p>I have tried at least two ways of updating.&nbsp; Component/file/account/Office updates and when I open an office component a message appears with a button "update now".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then get a msgbox stating "checking for updates", then a msgbox stating "downloading updates" with a progress bar.&nbsp; I then get a dialog box stating that I might be on a metered connection, do I want to download now?&nbsp; I select "Yes", the message box disappears
 and nothing else happens. I have left Office open for some time, hoping something is working in the background, but no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has lasted over the last 10 months, every time I boot up Windows informs there are Office updates available via an info box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I am on a 3/4G (Three UK) mobile network, I have gone into settings and removed any data limits and any other setting that may restrict downloads.&nbsp; The setting regarding a metered network is grayed as diabled but shows as disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought both the HP laptops during late 2017, one has Win 10 Home, the other Win 10 Pro.&nbsp; They both have the standard installations without alteration.&nbsp; All I have installed are Eset Av on one and McAfee on the other.&nbsp; I installed Office 365 Home via a
 downloaded ISO from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are enabled in my Account.</p>

<p>Your problem seems different to mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved mine by logging on as an Administrator and going into Settings/Network/Data Usage and deselecting Metered Connection.&nbsp; I then ensured there were no Data Limit set for the Mobile network connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I recall correctly, there is no message box stating update complete.</p>

<p>This could be on your domain. </p>
<p>Was the recipient someone within your University?</p>
<p>-If not, then your college email may have settings preventing you to receive from outside your domain/organization.</p>

                    With "Group by conversation and pre-load messages" disabled in settings why can I no longer forward an open message? With a msg opened the "Actions" drop down box no longer appears. I removed "Grouping by conversation" acct. Outlook makes it very confusing
 to keep track of what has been done with that msg. with "Grouping" activated. My&nbsp;preference&nbsp;is to deal with one message individually. Get rid of Outlook, it sucks. &nbsp;

<h2>            Message asking me to log into my Outlook Account- Team Member Services at Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>After entering my first password I get a logo asking me to enter my telephone number. I have tried to use this several before and find that I get a return message that says something like "the quota is full today, try tomorrow".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet been successful in getting passed this barrier, I don't find this amusing. I expect any logging-to on to be straight-forward and not include complicated routines that have a one-in-100 chance of working. This has nothing to do with security,

<h2>            Unable to update my apps from the Store since installing January Technical Preview Build 9926</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping somebody could help me out with this one. I recently upgraded to the most recent Windows 10 Technical Preview Build, but since doing so, I have been unable to install updates to my apps. Currently, there are just two updates for me in the Store (I
 don't have many modern apps installed), which are 'Mail, Calendar and People' and 'Reader'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to install these two updates they both fail with the error code 0x80073cf1, see screenshot http://i.imgur.com/TKPVvmk.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions on how to resolve this, that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could face this issue due to store cache and corrupt apps. You can also face this issue when you use proxy connection to access internet.</p>
<p>

 the apps have been updated. I've listed what I did below. Thanks</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">@BillDavis1964 - I couldn't see a way on the new Store Beta app either, but I'm not using that. I'm still using the normal Store app where you can still manually check for updates etc.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">@vincentw56 - The steps above didn't initially work for me, but they did help in the end with me. Here's what I did, hopefully yours will work afterwards as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried the steps above but the apps still wouldn't update</p>
- Opened Internet Explorer, went into Tools, Internet Options, Advanced tab, then Reset..., then clicked Reset to reset IE to its default settings<br />
- Reopened Internet Explorer, went into Tools, Internet Options, then Lan Settings and Unticked 'Automatically Detect Settings' and then clicked OK<br />
- Rebooted PC<br />
- Went into the normal Store app (not the Beta Store), searched for 'Mail, Calendar and People' and 'Reader' which were the two that were not updating for me and they both successfully installed this time</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Hopefully when some of my apps need updates again, they will install without any issues. Time will tell, but the errors I were getting with those apps have now gone.</p>

            That didn't work for me. I am curious. You reinstalled the apps, but did you get the updated apps. Look in the store beta and see if those are still trying to update. When I opened the old store app, it said this was already installed, bu the store beta
 showed an update for it.<br />

            <p>I presume I got the updated version when I installed from fresh after removing those apps. I've just checked the Store Beta and I can't see anywhere where it indicates that any of my apps are in need of an update or trying to update. Whilst I was in the
 Store Beta I searched for 'Mail, Calendar and People', found it, clicked 'Install' and it says 'This product is installed. Last updated on 01/01/0001'. A little strange as far as the date is concerned but I believe I have the latest version then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, Mail and Calendar still look the same to me. I take it that new Mail and Calendar app that Joe Belfiore demonstrated for Windows 10 has not been released yet?</p>

<h2>            Deleted emails return to Inbox</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my PC which has Windows 10 onto which I reloaded my Office 2007. The email function in Outlook worked fine until a Windows upgrade recently which seemed to create a situation where my deleted emails keep returning to my inbox, no matter
 how many times I delete them. My emails are set up with POP3 and SMTP. Can anybody offer any solution?

I am facing 2 major problem.<br />
My first problem is my memory card.The data on the memory always keep being corrupted.The most a data can last on my memory card is hardly for 2 weeks.Why is that so??<br />
I am using sandisk 4GB micro SD.At first i thought it was the memory card faulty but i hav tried using it on another phone for nearly a mnth a there was no problem at all.<br />
The second problem that i am facing is the phone keeps restarting when i am texting. I hav upgraded the firmware..reset it to factory default but the problem keep rising.<br />
Please help me out...its kinda frustrating...<br />
<br />

    <title>Word 2010 in Windows 2010 is deleting blank lines I have there for a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im2oldforthis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 in Windows 2010 is deleting blank lines I have there for a reason.</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find an answer to this question anywhere, so far, so any help anyone can give would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working in Word 2010.&nbsp; In my various templates I tend to have a lot of standard paragraphs in the body of the document which I just delete if I don't want.&nbsp; I've been working quite happily this way for years and even with Word 2010 under Windows 7 I
 could do this without any problems.&nbsp; But since I've upgraded to Windows 10 I find that when I delete a paragraph the system is also deleting any blank lines I have below that.&nbsp; If I wanted those lines deleted I would select them for deletion.&nbsp; I don't select
 them BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM DELETED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking at the "keep it next" buttons in my options but that is not activated, so that doesn't seem to be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain what is happening and how I can regain control of my document to work it how I want it to be, not the way the Microsoft programmers think is best for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is yet another thing that I have found in my upgrade that to me is a nonsensical "added feature".&nbsp; It's probably a useful tool to have as an option - but why it has suddenly become the default option is beyond me, especially as I can't seem to find
 the answer easily with research.</p>

<p>
</p><p>under Options - Advanced - Cut, copy and paste - Use Smart cut and paste - Settings</p>
<p>there is an option "Adjust paragraph spacing on paste".&nbsp; That was ticked on my computer, but I unticked it and it seems to have fixed the problem.&nbsp; The reason that I didn't click that this was an issue (I have been to this section of options before to see
 if I could work it out) is that I'm not actually pasting anything - I'm simply deleting.&nbsp; So it never would have occurred to me to uncheck this "paste option" box to fix a delete issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will come back if this happens again (so those wonderful helpful people who have tried to work with me on this who may be interested in the solution to this problem will know if it's a false fix), but my fingers are crossed that this is the answer I am
 looking for.</p>

<p>Again my heartfelt thanks to those who have been working with me on this.&nbsp; I really appreciate all your efforts/suggestions.</p>

    <title>Track changes is not showing in Word 2016. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Track changes is not showing in Word 2016.</h2>
                    <p>How do I get Track Changes to show? &nbsp;I was working in Pages earlier. &nbsp;The changes I made i Pages do not show in Word. &nbsp;Nor do the changes I am making now. &nbsp;Track Changes is on in both menu systems, the one on the program window and the one at the top. &nbsp;How
 can I get it to work again? &nbsp; Will the changes I am entering now show later when the display problem is fixed?</p>
<p><br />
I posted this under Office for Window 10 but I do not have Windows; I have a Macintosh. &nbsp;(Operating system El Capitan). &nbsp;The Macintosh and Windows versions of Word are totally different, of course, so if you tell me what the menu options and steps are to fix
 this, it will not work. &nbsp;But the functions are the same, so let's stick with that.</p>

<h2>            Add an outlook email account to a Office 365 non-microsoft email address</h2>
                    <p>I signed up to Office 365 with a non-microsoft email address. I would like to add an outlook address to my account, but I don't seem to be able to do that without creating another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do this without creating another account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You can use any valid email address when you create the MS Acccount, it has no baring on adding an mail account to MS Outlook, if thats what you wish to do.</p>
When you start MS Outlook, on first use you are prompted to add a mail account, the initial setup gives some preset mail account types, if your is not one of those offered just select 'other' then enter the email address and password wnen prompted to do so,
 once verifiied finish the process OL will start and sync mail, do not do anything with outlook until this process completes.
