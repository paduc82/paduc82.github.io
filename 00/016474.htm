<h2>            Lumia 830 music player won&#39;t recognize all songs on phone.</h2>
                    <p>I recently got my Lumia 830 and like it a lot. I got a 64 gig SD card to go with it, so I could play all my music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied all of my music from my PC to my SD card, and opened the music app. Now, about 10 hours later, it still hasn't recognized all of the music I added. I checked with my PC and all the music is there. I checked with the Windows phone Files app and all
 are there. I even downloaded a two third party music apps and they show all the music. When I play a missing song with the third party players, it shows on my original music app as playing and on the proper album, but when I navigate to that album, it's still
 missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to force the built in app to refresh so it can pull up the many songs missing from my library? Or am I just stuck using the third party players? I'd prefer to use the built in.</p>

            Did you add it to the SD card then insert the SD card into the phone, or did you insert the SD card then add it through the windows explorer on the PC?

<p>
</p><p>Like &nbsp;i said, I can use Files to see them on my phone. I can even play them while looking at them with Files. 3rd party players recognize them and play them as well. The problem is clearly the app that came standard with my Lumia.</p>

            I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; I'm an Xbox Music subscriber, used the Windows Phone app to add my music, my file explorer shows the songs are there, but I'm only showing a TINY fraction of the songs I have synced to my phone.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be any
 rhyme or reason for these particular songs to show, but I can't get them to import into my music app.&nbsp; It's really getting old.&nbsp; I've been dealing with it for 3 weeks.

</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you aren't able to play your music files in the Music app on your Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you tell us where the music files are from originally? Ripped from a CD, iTunes, other sources?</p>
<p>

            Mine are a mix of rips and other sources. They are still recognized on other players. The problem with the third party players is they are so slow.

            <p>Thanks for your response Ronnie328,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the first thing I would do, is to indentify the songs that aren't presenting any issues and see where you got those songs from.
<br />
<br />
It would be helpful to focus on which pattern works and which don't. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try giving the missing songs&nbsp;a bit of metadata editing with the PC through "properties" on the music files.
</p>
<p>Please note that songs that don't have metadata will most likely be classified as "Unknow artist". Be sure to check if they haven't ended up in there.</p>

            <p>All of my tags are done exactly the same on every single file. As stated before, multiple 3rd party players recognize every song on every single album. The built in player is the only player that randomly doesn't recognize every song.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as stated above, when i use a 3rd party player, i can then open the built in player and navigate the songs on that album perfectly fine. However, those songs never update on the player itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Metallica's And Justice for All album (ripped on my PC, tags modified by the same app i use for all my files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i open the built-in Music app the track list is</p>
<p>1. Blackened</p>
<p>2. And justice for all</p>
<p>3. Eye of the Beholder</p>
<p>4. One</p>
<p>5. Shortest Straw</p>
<p>6. Harvester of Sorrow</p>
<p>7. The Frayed Ends of Sanity</p>
<p>9. Dyer's Eve</p>
<p>(Missing track 8. To Live is to die)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when i go to the 3rd Party app Music Player, all tracks are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when i go back to the built-in Music App and look at Now Playing, the missing track is playing. Then while that track is currently playing, i navigate to Artist Metallica, then to Album And Justice for All and the track is still missing.</p>

            <p>I've got the same problem but NONE of my music will play from my sandisk ultra 128GB card !</p>
<p>Got my lumia 830 the 20 ofNovember and the card the day after, so it is brand new stuff. Anyway...</p>
<p>I connected my Lumia, with the card formatted by the phone, to my Macbook pro and transferred my music using the downloaded Windovs thing (cannot remember its name right now).</p>
<p>5500 songs, all ripper from my own CDs or bought from iTunes. Took some time!</p>
<p>xbox Music shows all the artists, albums and songs but none can be played, just a message! Error code 80070003 is shown.</p>
<p>If i open "Filer" and go to the sd card and open the music file (about 540files in all) then I can play any song.</p>
<p>i can also play my music library with the app "CoolMusic" from the Store but I don't like all the commercials.!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So . . . What to do ???!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps I have reformatted the sd card, erased and transferred my music 3-4 times now but to no awail !</p>
<p>All this worked just fine on my old Nokia 808 Pureview and before that my Nokia N8.</p>

            <p>I Have some issues as well with music on the sd card. When i check the "datasensor" i can see that i have around 22 gb of data(mostly mp3's) on my SD card, consisting of 3000 songs, witch shows up in windows expolorer on my PC. But the phone only reckognizes
 around 1500 of theese songs on a third party music player. I have tried to find a pattern for witch MP3's are shown in the player, but i cant seem to find anything that would dictate wheter a MP3 is shown or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to feel really sorry for bying a nokia 830. And i would hope that microsoft is doing something to fix this as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

            So, the issue on my phone seems to resolved itself. I don't know if it was constantly playing music with other players or just waiting an obscenely large amount of time (2 weeks?! Really, Microsoft??), but it now shows all my music. Or at least it seems
 that way. 35gb, so I haven't checked every single album.

<br />
Press ctrl+A to select all cells, right-click and click on Format Cells, click on the Fill tab, click on No Color, then click on OK.&nbsp; Do the gridlines return?<br />
<br />
If so, I suspect that Fill is set to the background color (usually white) for all the cells where gridlines are missing.<br />
<br />
You might want to undo the operation above or simply reload the file (without saving), then surgically set the Fill option to No Color wherever that makes sense, if not for all cells.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My windows phone (Lumia 640) does not sync with my live.com account. </p>
<p>I tried to change the password, then did factory reset, then singed in with the new password and initial sync was successful.

    <title>Lumia 650, newest update, so much stuff not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie v...  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 650, newest update, so much stuff not working</h2>
                    <p>Just switched from 640 on denim to 650 on 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much stuff is just not working, is anyone else finding this to be the case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Hot spot is "spotty" on computers, will not work with my Samsung smart TV</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Screen share technically works, sometimes. When my TV does show up on list, it connects half of the time, other half it kicks off. Sharing absolutely will not work when streaming something like HULU. Phone just freezes, as soon as you kill screen share,
 it starts showing video on phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two features worked flawlessly on the 640. There are a lot of little things with 650 running 10 that are not right, but these main things are particularly bad. 10 has been out for so long, how is this stuff not dialed in yet?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if its hardware, anyone having these issues? Is the 650 a lesser phone than the 640? Just don't have the time to learn the hard way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my phone as main source of internet at home and for work, do lots of traveling, so the hotspot is crucial. Screen sharing is a big bonus for meetings. Not being able to show streaming video via sharing is a big let down, so handy in group meeting scenario.</p>
<p>

            <p>I m having countless problems, since I switched to 650 Win 10.&nbsp; I don't know if it is the 650 or Windows 10.&nbsp; My husband is on the 950 and does not seem to have the issues, but then he uses his phone differently then to me.&nbsp; Do I purchase the 950&nbsp;or hope
 the problems get solved on the 650?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give you an example:</p>
<p>Bluetooth constantly&nbsp;drops</p>
<p>Bluetooth in the car drops (Mazda 3 2015), but sometimes I am still talking through the Bluetooth in the car.....go figure</p>
<p>Constantly dropping calls</p>
<p>Constantly drop calls when receiving text messages</p>
<p>Freezing after messages</p>
<p>Notifications do not appear correctly</p>
<p>Unable to define multiple tones per email accounts (MS, Google, and Yahoo)&nbsp; </p>
<p>Refresh is way too slow sometimes locks up</p>
<p>I could go on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ready to go back to my broken 925 Win 8.&nbsp; I have never had this many issues with a phone, like I do now.&nbsp; I almost want to irritate my spouse by switching to IPhone...lol</p>

            <p>Did not work, still same issues, Hotspot will only function about 1 out of every 5 times I try to utilize it. When it does work, it will unexpectedly stop working after a short time (between 10min and one hour of use). How is this even possible? The environment
 and conditions in which it is being utilized never change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact information is being merged between random contacts, this is a new issue and incredibly frustrating. My contacts will assign numbers of a specific contact to another person. For example, i will receive a text from a contact Meri but it will show
 up as Sean, and somehow the contacts are merged or info switched. This happened after last major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a new update available, and like last couple updates, it would not initially download. it would say it was downloading, but stay at 0% for hours, then say that I was using a metered connection, suggest connect to wifi, but give option to download
 anyway. Hitting the button to download anyway does not work, butt shows motion of being hit, but download never starts. This happened with previous versions, but for some reason would eventually work. This time it will not. Another instance of things working
 sometimes, again, how is this possible?</p>
<p>

</p><p>HARD REV &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.0.6.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does the update 10.0.14393.67 address any of these? Are you aware of any attempt to address the mentioned issues? Is it a sub par hardware spec issue?</p>

</p><p>see attached below the screenshot of the view I have of my onedrive account, accessed via Google Chrome&nbsp;Version 68.0.3440.84 (Official Build) (64-bit).&nbsp; This is the same if I access via internet explorer.&nbsp; As you can see the view is different to how it should
 be, as there are no button options highlighted where I have circled in red. I'm unsure what all the options were, but it was things like +folder, upload, file view options, and also there was an icon for my account profile pic.&nbsp; I can also not click on a file
 and right click to bring up options such as "open in excel", Share etc </p>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't work either on explorer or chrome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however logged in again from my home PC and access onedrive the same way.&nbsp; It does not have the same problem, which suggests that it is specific to my work laptop.&nbsp; Perhaps my company IT has added something to change how it works

<h2>            LinkedIn contacts are not visible in Lumia People Hub</h2>
                    <p>I just took Lumia 1520 into use but I cannot see LinkedIn contacts in People Hub. I can even see comments/posts from LinkedIn but not contacts. At the same time I can sync and see contacts in other Lumia device as well as in Live.com. Twitter, Exchange etc.
 contacts are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what might be wrong that just one device does not show LinkedIn contacts? I have tried to delete LinkedIn account from device as well as remove link between Live and LinkedIn accounts.</p>

<p>I cannot find any show contacts or sync contacts from email+accounts settings. Of course Exchange and gmail have that option but those are not related to this case.</p>

            You have to buy Office 2010. Prior to that version only one person can work on a file at a time. It is a fundamental limit of Windows (actually DOS).&nbsp; You will need a "Sharepoint" server as well.&nbsp; Adding "collaboration" or "co-authoring" represents most
 of the work that was done on 2010.<br />

<p>Hello Evelyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know how did you add you as a delegate? Please let me know the details. Based on the description, I understand that you need to schedule meetings for your boss. You just need to let your Boss
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10157/sharing-calendar-and-contacts-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
share the calendar with you</a> and give you the <strong>Delegate</strong> permission. After that, you will receive an email shows that you now have the delegate permission. Add the shared calendar in Outlook and you will be able to schedule meetings for your
 Boss. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still cannot schedule Skype for Business meetings, I need to collect some more information for further troubleshooting:
</p>
<p>1. Sign in <a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App(OWA)</a> and see if you can schedule Skype for Business meetings.
</p>
<p>2. Schedule a normal appointment without Skype meetings to see if it works.
</p>
<p>3. Capture a screenshot of the entire error message. </p>
<p>4. The version number of Outlook. Click File-&gt;Office account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Hi Ravi_ 165,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query. Windows phones will require the recovery key when the reset protection is enabled on the device. When you’ve enabled it, you will be receiving a "<strong>Welcome to Reset Protection</strong>" confirmation sent to the email
 address associated with your Microsoft account. You can try to check your email and see if the recovery key is still available from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in any case that the recovery key is not available from your email, then kindly follow these steps on how to get a recovery key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/devices</a></strong>. (Kindly use your Microsoft account associated to your Windows phone.)</li><li>Check the information under your Windows phone, then click <strong>Get recovery key</strong>.</li><li>Tap the check box for “<strong>I’m ready to get a recovery key</strong>”. </li><li>Then, click <strong>Get key</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also get the recovery key by turning off the Reset Protection online. To do this, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/devices</a></strong>. (Kindly use your Microsoft account associated to your Windows phone.)</li><li>Next to the phone you no longer own, select <strong>Remove phone</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>I'm ready to remove my phone </strong>check box, note the recovery key, and then select
<strong>Remove</strong>. The recovery key will display on the page and will also be emailed to you.</li><li>When you're certain that you have your recovery key saved, select the <strong>
I've kept a copy of the recovery key</strong> check box, and then select <strong>
Okay</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you turn off the Reset Protection, then your phone is no longer listed on
<strong>account.microsoft.com/devices</strong>, and you can remove Reset Protection during phone set up using the
<strong>Disable using recovery key</strong> option.</p>

    <title>Disk Partitioning inconsistencies&#58; Microsoft Docs vs. Clean - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don cuthbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Partitioning inconsistencies&#58; Microsoft Docs vs. Clean install results</h2>
                    <p>As has been noted by others in these forums the default partition layout, after a clean install of Windows 10 from install media, does not follow Microsoft's recommended layout.&nbsp; Below is
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the recommended layout shown in Microsoft Docs</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13e0953-6b7d-45ae-adea-a03511426f7e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a13e0953-6b7d-45ae-adea-a03511426f7e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what the documentation states, as to why to have the Recovery Tools at the end of the disk and rules for the size of the partition:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Recovery tools partition</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This partition must be at least 300 MB.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This partition must have enough space for the Windows Recovery Environment tools image (winre.wim, typically between 250-300MB, depending on base language and customizations added), plus enough free space so that the partition can
 be captured by backup utilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the partition is less than 500 MB, it must have at least 50 MB of free space.</li><li>If the partition is 500 MB or larger, it must have at least 320 MB of free space.</li><li>If the partition is larger than 1 GB, we recommend that it should have at least 1 GB free.</li><li>This partition must use the Type ID: DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC.</li><li>The recovery tools should be in a separate partition than the Windows partition to support automatic failover and to support booting partitions encrypted with Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><em>We recommend that you place this partition immediately after the Windows partitio</em></strong><em><strong>n. This allows Windows to modify and recreate the partition later if future updates require a larger recovery
 image.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install of Windows 10, instead places the Windows RE (Recovery) partition at the beginning of the disk. This poses potential issues for future upgrades, as the upgraded winre.wim file in the Recovery partition may be too large to fit and a new Recovery
 partition instead gets created at the end of the disk, rendering the original Recovery partition redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice also, that the Recovery partition should be kept smaller than 500MB (450MB-499MB) as you would be required to leave
<em>320MB of free space</em> on a 500MB or larger Recovery partition.&nbsp; The Windows 10 winre.wim file would not leave 320MB free space when placed in a 500MB partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the layout that results from a clean-install of Windows 10 to an unallocated hard disk or SSD, after booting from install media:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74a49476-113e-433f-8bc4-7314094dce03?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74a49476-113e-433f-8bc4-7314094dce03?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do we go about getting the Windows 10 clean install results modified to match what Microsoft actually recommends that the partition layout ought to be?</p>

<h2>            My Phone Premium Feature Package</h2>
                    
<p>On the My Phone site, there are premium features that enable the user to locate a lost phone on a map, lock the phone...etc. The trial last for 7 days.</p>
<p>However, I do not see any way to convert the trial to a non-trial package. How much does this cost, and how does one go about doing it?</p>

<h2>            Make query show only records with empty cell in given field</h2>
                    Hi, I'm trying to make a query return only those records where one of the fields is missing an entry. I've tried [table]![field] ="" which gave me a data type mismatch error, (the field is numeric) and I've tried is empty, is null, and is missing. I don't
 know the syntax for them. Seems like is null looks like the way to go, from what I've been able to gather. I'm trying to use an expression to do this. Ideas or links to a page that covers this would be good. Seems like all the links I have are either really
 simple, or they are lost in vba code. Thanks, Jerry

<p>It is possible to buy on the high street to.&nbsp; In Leicester for example "Phonecity" is able to get them both locked to a network and unlocked (only know this because mine passed through there for repairs :smileysad: ).&nbsp; It may take a few phone calls to retailers
 in your area to find one in stock though.</p>

<p>Yes the link works, I did what they asked. And here's the stupid answer I am receiving 48 hours later, after a first message letting me know that I would get an answer 24 hours later (that was 2 days ago). Nice in the circumstances ! I had to share this

            This is not true. Microsoft has made it impossible to delete a dead person's account. I do not understand why. Every other social media company has been extremely helpful but Microsoft just refuses to do it. I guess they do not want to lose the revenue
 from selling/mining people's information. even dead ones. Shame on&nbsp; Microsoft for putting me thru hell as the account they are refusing to close has been hacked and it is attached to our family Xbox membership.&nbsp;

<h2>            Nokia Belle Refresh &#61; massive power drain on N8&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>HUGE problem with the weather widget and Nokia Belle Refresh on N8.</p>
<p>It drains the battery in a matter of a few hours!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried with a new battery - made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When App Stop is used to kill the weater widget the problem goes away - TEMPORARY that is, because the &amp;%¤#/&amp; program starts automatically after some time and drains the battery completely!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Batterytime is <em>beyond</em> miserable now:-((</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing the weather widget from the start screen did NOT solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 % certain it's the weather widget's fault. Nokia either needs to provide an update solution quickly or provide a way to completely remove the widget and NOT have it installed again upon connection to Nokia Suite!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia -please respond quickly.</p>

<p>Hello Dan</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>When I use AppStop the weather process stops, but AppStop does not seem to delete anything. When the phone is rebooted, the weather process starts up again and the problem continues until AppStop is used again.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a more permanent solution, so one doesn't always have to use an app to stop the process.</p>

<p>I tried a hard and a soft reset but my battery still drains quickly!</p>
<p>I also tried closing all my apps including the weather app using App Stop but the battery still drains quickly.</p>
<p>I cannot uninstall the weather app because when I long press it from my apps in the menu it does not give me the option to delete it like it does with my other apps, it is also not listed in my 'Already Installed" app list.</p>
<p>The battery consumption with Belle Refresh is so bad that I have to charge my phone 3 times a day.</p>
<p>I charge my phone while it's off until the battery is full then I put it on and use it for about 5 - 10 minutes then it states &nbsp;"Battery Empty. Recharge" then then phone switches off.</p>
<p>THIS IS SO IRRITATING! I hope that Nokia will release an update to fix this problem or I'll seriously consider getting the iPhone 5.</p>

<p>@WhiteFlair if it's only lasting 5-10 minutes it won't be a firmware issue, either your battery has died or the charger connections are faulty, after 2 years mine are a bit iffy, assume you are on an N8.</p>
<p>Most people are talking about the time reducing from 2 days to under one, not minutes.</p>
<p>Have you tried using the battery monitor available in the Store, it will show if the battery is fully charged.</p>
<p>It may be time for a new battery or a visit to Nokia Care.</p>
<p>Another option is to re-install the firmware using Nokia suite (USB mode) in case the battery monitoring part of the firmware is dodgy, make sure you have a full battery and it is connected firmly.</p>

<p>I downloaded the belle refresh update and i got a <strong>H U G E</strong> loss of battery power...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before update my battery lasted at least 5 days, but after update i loose about 5% power each 30 minutes.</p>
<p>About 10% battery power in 1 hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i recharge my n8 mobile phone before i go to work, and when i get back home after 8 hours my battery power is less than 20% and i have to recharge it again.</p>
<p>Pls fix this or i will throw my phone away and buy a sony or any other phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And btw, how the hell can i uninstall microsoft apps ???</p>
<p>I don't want them !!!!</p>
<p><br />
It was installed even without me accepting it to be installed !</p>

<p>@Sage</p>
<p>I've got an N8 and I doubt it's a battery problem because I never had this problem when I used Symbian Anna.</p>
<p>As soon as I updated my firmware to Belle Refresh my battery consumption depreciated. With Symbian Anna my battery would last about 2 days and I could listen to about 2-3 hours of music, watch movies, play games, log on to Social etc. but with Belle Refresh
 it doesn't even last a full day. When I first got Belle Refresh my battery would last about 4 - 6 hours which I thought was strange but it was not that bad but now the battery is completely useless. I'm even going to start using my N82 until the next firmware
 update for the N8 becomes available. I'll take it to Nokia Care though and see what they say.......</p>

<p>I've been using the battery monitor app for a few months now which I think is useless because the figures given don't reflect my phones true performance. The only thing I like about the app is the fact that you can set the battery saving mode threshold and
 not just have the phone prompt you at 10% to switch the power saving mode. I've also had my N8 for 2 years and another strange thing is that my battery charges quicker than it used to, my phone used to take 2 hours to charge fully now it only takes an hour.
 So I guess it could be a combination of software and battery issues because I read in the manual that if the charging time decreases it could mean that the battery needs replacing.......&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Micrcosoft Surface Pro 3 stuck in boot screen after October 2015 firmware update</h2>
                    <p>My surface pro 3 has latest Insider Preview update (with the offending KB3105208 installed so secure boot is disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing October 2015 firmware update, all went fine for some time.</p>
<p>Then, I lost the trackpad so I decided to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface got stuck in "restarting windows" for at least 10 minutes then I decided to switch it off by holding the power button down for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the surface is stuck in boot screen (i.e. "Surface Pro" with red background) and won't boot or enter UEFI BIOS setup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any steps I can take to solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Jean</p>

</p><p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking my problem into consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have been more specific, I do not get the rolling circle when the surface turns on.</p>
<p>I only get the red screen with the "Surface" word in the middle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks a lot like the system is not booting at all and the machine is stuck in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May be you should redirect my issue to a Surface Pro BIOS update forum?</p>
<p>(I could not find one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

            Try this shut down if running by hard power reset,&nbsp;remove battery, unplug power adapter, hold power button down for 10 -15 sec's, plug power adapter in with out battery and try to boot up, if it boots normal you can reinstall the battery, this works on
 HP's and Dell's not sure on others, but it's worth a try&nbsp;

            <p>I had this same issue and it appeared like nothing was happening when I ended up rebooting my surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to let it sit there for a while and eventually it just booted up properly. I think due to the fact it was a firmware update these surface computers just don't show any indication they are doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine is back to normal after I just let it sit and complete it's update.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>I'm stuck with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Oct15 firmware update and one full reboot later I cannot get past the Surface screen.</p>
<p>It doesnt seem like it even tries to boot windows: as I changed the BIOS setting for secure boot which should trigger the bitlocker password requiry before booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas to do a hard reset or similar?</p>
<p>Apart from that, any ideas to access my data without being able to boot something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks for any ideas,</p>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; My Surface Pro3 did the same thing after the Deadly Update.&nbsp; When it gets into the loop, hold your power button down for longer than usual and it will power off.&nbsp; I tried the "..letting it sit" plan for six hours and it didn't work.&nbsp; I had to do a clean
 install of Windows from a DVD because no matter what I tried it would NOT boot from a USB thumb drive.&nbsp; I had to make a system DVD and boot from that through the USB port.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care,</p>

<p>However, as I mentioned, it is an Exchange Server account.</p>
<p>Not a POP or IMAP account!</p>
<p>Your article is not for Exchange Server.</p>

            <p>Argel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that I appreciate your help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, it is quite obvious that you have lost focus to my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me go through the details again, with an explanation:</p>
<p>1. I have completed the "reconnect" process for my Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft issued a notice to all Outlook.com uses to "Reconnect Outlook 2016 to Outlook.com"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - that means removing my existing (POP) Outlook.com email account in the Outlook 2016 profile</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and then re-add my Outlook.com account to my profile</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the new Outlook.com account is Exchange Server (not POP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - here's the instructions provided to me by Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=UShttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reconnect-Outlook-2016-or-Outlook-2013-to-Outlook-com-for-uninterrupted-email-access-cda1751d-9503-40bf-bf76-e79454ac5eb3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=UShttp://</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. However, the Exchange Server "User Name" appears as my email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I included an image of the server settings, self explanatory</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How can I change that to show my proper name?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the purpose of my post is to find out how to show my name rather than email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot provide a solution, I would appreciate that you find someone who can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have located a solution that will allow you to change the Exchange Server username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to change the name is to use the script in this article: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rename-exchange-mailbox-account-outlook-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/rename-exchange-mailbox-account-outlook-2013/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the article and successfully change my username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others!</p>

<h2>            HTC Touch Pro2 Vista 64 Sync Issues</h2>
                    I have followed the posted suggestions and it has not resolved the problem.&nbsp; I have HTC Touch Pro2, Vista 64-bit.&nbsp;Have&nbsp;uninstalled and reinstalled Windows Mobile Device Center.&nbsp;Have unchecked the Advanced Network Functionality on device. Installed a driver
 for vista 64-bit. I have restarted my computer several times.&nbsp; I have performed a soft reset on the phone.&nbsp;Uninstalled Phone from Device&nbsp;Manager,&nbsp;I have Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.&nbsp;Proxy on computer and phone is vacant.&nbsp;My computer can "see a USB device"
 and open the files on my SD in the phone, however on both phone and computer WMDC both say, "There is a problem with your connection. Please disconnect and reconnect your device and try again.".&nbsp; What else can I do??&nbsp; Thanks!

            You have done a lot htcdude.&nbsp; Run Microsoft update just to see if there is anything that might update that will make a difference.&nbsp; I saw in another post a user did that and all of a sudden it worked.<br />
<br />
I might also try again (with&nbsp;your device connected via USB) opening Device Manager and removing where the device appears.&nbsp; Disconnect the device from the PC and soft reset.&nbsp; Now uninstall WMDC, reboot the PC and reinstall WMDC using<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4F68EB56-7825-43B2-AC89-2030ED98ED95&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 this download</a>.&nbsp; Connect your device and I'll keep my fingers crossed.<br />
<br />
Also, if there are any partnerships on your device or PC, delete them before you reconnect. Soft reset and reboot the PC before you reconnect<br />
