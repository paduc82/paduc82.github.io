            The calendar menue of the E71 is a bit tricky. When you want to delete a single entry, you sometimes mistakenly select "delete all" and the entries are gone for good. It happened to me a few times. It is safer to go to the day view and delete single entries
 there.

<p>I have a problem with my E71 in which my calendar entries disappear automatically after some days. I do not know how they disappear. When I create it, it appears in the claendar and gives me alarm reminders as expected. But my past meeting entries disappears
 without my knowledge.</p>
<p>Is there any setting which comes into play automatically which deletes these calendar entries ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a ton.</p>

    <title>Task bar in Outlook for MAC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task bar in Outlook for MAC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently moved from a PC to a MAC at work. When I was on PC, I was relying a lot on the "To-do bar / Task bar" displayed on the right in Outlook (when on the e-mail interface). Using the functionnality "Follow up", I was able to flag e-mails and assign
 a deadline. Those were showing up in the "To-do bar / Task bar" on the right as a task. The name was the subject of the e-mail, and I was able to rename it.</p>
<p>Ex:&nbsp;<a href="http://officedeveloper.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/outlookdisplayingtodotaskpane1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://officedeveloper.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/outlookdisplayingtodotaskpane1.png</a></p>
<p>Now in Outlook for MAC, I can't find where to display the Task bar. The only option I have is to go on the "Task" tab. Moreover, it seems that I can't rename a task created from an e-mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how to work this out?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Vincent,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task bar is not supported in Outlook for Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While, I agree with you I would be great convenient if we can use it in Outlook for Mac. Besides the link article provided above, you can also influence our product by providing feedback via:

<h2>            Can Windows Mobile 6.1 do &#39;automatic bluetooth&#39; pairing&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently changed to a Samsung Omnia with Windows mobile 6.1, after 2 years of using Nokia's Symbian on N95.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, I love the Windows platform. However, there is one frustration that I suffer, which I did not with Symbian.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Nokia n95 I would pair my bluetooth headset....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the point onwards, each time I want to pair them, I simply switched the bluetooth headset on... within a few seconds the headset and my phone were paired... without me needing to do anything on the phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is different on my Windows Mobile device, where I:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(all this is after setting up the intial pairing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Switch my headset on</p>
<p>2. Click on the wireless indicator on the top bar</p>
<p>3. Select Wireless manager</p>
<p>4. Select menu</p>
<p>5. Select bluetooth settings</p>
<p>6. Hold on the bluetooth device to be prompted with options</p>
<p>7. Select 'Set as Hands-free'...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an incredibly long process... surely I am doing something wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping someone can tell me how to avoid needing to take all these steps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ravi Sandhu</p>

<p>Greetings Ravi Sandhu!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I can tell you about my configuration.&nbsp;I always leave my phone's BT radio on, just as a matter of course.&nbsp; Whenever I need to use my BT headset, I simply turn it on, and my phone detects the Headset and automatically initiates the
 pairing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be that the original "pairing" on your device did not take.&nbsp; Go to your Mobile Device BT manager screen and confirm that you have an existing entry for the headset-to-WM-Device pairing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't, then you'll obviously need to
 recreate one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have a "pairing" entry, can I presume that you generally leave your BT radio turned off on your Mobile Device?&nbsp; My guess is that your pairing would work in the same fashion as mine if you left your BT radio "on" in your mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            this action is not supported while an older version of outlook is running</h2>
                    I setup a new windows 10 computer and office 365 does not show up in Programs and features I installed our corporate copy of office 2013 and installed outlook in the end users profile.&nbsp; &nbsp;When he tries to use a macro to move from excel to outlook he receives
 an error "this action is not supported while an older version of outlook is running".&nbsp; Initially when he tried to run Excel it ran office 365 and not the version of office that i installed even though the only version of office that exists in programs and
 features is the one I installed.&nbsp; In order to make the version of office that I installed work i had to re-associate it with the files.&nbsp; How do i get rid of this unwanted and annoying version of office that has infested this computer.

<p>I found what your were talking about there was App called My Office, there were no other apps with the word desktop or office installed under apps and features.&nbsp; I uninstalled My Office and then rebooted.&nbsp; When the machine came back up i ran the macro again
 this time the windows 10 mail app came up.&nbsp; I loaded Default apps and clicked on email there was Mail, Outlook and, Outlook(Desktop), I clicked on Outlook(Desktop).&nbsp; This time when we ran the Macro the error from my initial post did not appear but the 365
 version of outlook came up again.&nbsp; So i went back&nbsp; to Default apps and clicked on the Outlook entry and tried again, the 365 version of Outlook came up again.&nbsp; I went back to Apps &amp; features My office was still removed there were no other apps with the words
 Office, Desktop, or Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Office 365 is completely different/separate to Office 2013 so if any 365 Component opens it means there is a 365 version, or trial installed on the system.</p>
<p>MS has recently changed/modified the trial entries and it no longer shows in Add/Remove dialogue as Microsoft Office 365 but as Office Desktop Store Apps OR&nbsp;<span>Microsoft Office Desktop Apps</span></p>

<p>When I run a DISM command on the command line of the windows machine in question&nbsp; what comes up is below, the items in bold and underlined are not shown in the GUI programs and apps, this is the problem.&nbsp; I believe they can be remove by using the&nbsp; "dism
 /online /Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage" but I do not believe that they can be removed from Programs and apps as the do not show up.</p>

    <title>Does anyone else have this issue with the Excel 2016 Save As dialog - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael.hutchens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does anyone else have this issue with the Excel 2016 Save As dialog when including periods &#40;full stops&#41; in file names&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10 Pro and Excel 2016, and when I save a workbook with a period (full stop) in its name, then use the Excel Save As command, the Save As dialog displays without the file name in the dialog. It's very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce, open a new Excel workbook and run the Save As command. The Save As dialog will be displayed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed678cec-609e-46ff-a83c-6f70293db8d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed678cec-609e-46ff-a83c-6f70293db8d5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now change the file name to 'Book1.Test.xlsx' and click the Save button. Then run the Save As command again, and the Save As dialog will display with no fille name, as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228a2719-01e4-4048-a829-680ed4301b87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/228a2719-01e4-4048-a829-680ed4301b87" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is VERY annoying, because we save all our Excel workbooks with version numbers (e.g. Workbook-1.0.xlsx, Workbook-2.0.xlsx, etc.) and now the workbook name needs to be manually entered every time the Save As command is used, instead of simply incrementing
 the version number within the existing file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're also seeing this issue, please post here so MS fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, M.</p>

<p>Hi Hans, thanks for the speedy reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also using&nbsp;<span>Excel 2016 version 1708 (Build 8431.2079 Click-to-Run), and have switched off all add-ins, etc., so there's something strange going on here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Interestingly, I don't experience the issue when calling the Save As command using the F12 shortcut, only when I use the mouse and click on the File tab, then Browse in Backstage View. And I'm running Excel 2010 on
 the same machine and that's not having the issue either.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also can't repro it outside of Excel - e.g. Word works fine regardless of the existing file name.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've just tried restarting my computer, but no cigar... Oh well, hopefully it's something specific about my setup, but it's still very annoying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks either way.</span></p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like what you have said, it could be something specific about your setup. For us to effectively assist you, can you tell us if you have checked for any pending updates for your applications and Windows 10? Meanwhile, you can repair the application to

</p><p>I've done an Office Repair and this hasn't resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also uninstalled all my Excel add-ins and this didn't resolve it either.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
At least you have good reason for using FAT32 do not. FAT is faster than FAT32, so FAT32 will make you phone slower.<br />

Don't bother. For capacities of only 1GB there is no advantage to using FAT32 over FAT unless you're a fan of slow filesystem access...

            Over 2GB need to format in Fat32. 1 GB no need. Sometimes non branded 2 GB cards can be damaged by formatting in Fat32.

A memory card behaves exactly like a hard disk. It has a partition table and all. You can format the card how you like with whatever filesystem you want and with whatever partition scheme you want as long as the device you're going to put the card in supports
 it. I've even used miniSD cards with ext2 partitions in a backup system.<br />
<br />
Remember, you're restricted by the device you're putting the card in, not by the card itself. Most devices only know how to use the first primary parition with a FAT or FAT32 filesystem on it.<br />

            so 1GB no bother!<br />
<br />
i'm getting 8GB(ScanDisk) soon, in 2 weeks, when i get pay check :-D<br />
so do i format it in fat32, cause the cluster size can be much higher,i'm planning to make it 32kb...<br />
yes i'll loose a couple of mega's but speed is everything esp with 8GB.<br />
<br />
i defragmented my 1GB last night, i heard that is can speed the read process upto 40%, but i see no difference!<br />
<br />
so do u recommend formating 8GB to fat32?<br />

You have no choice. Mobile devices support FAT and FAT32 only, and FAT will only go up to 2GB. Therefore you
<i>must</i> format your memory FAT32.

    <title>How to fix a corrupted Xbox Music library on Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaronsentell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix a corrupted Xbox Music library on Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I've seen many people asking how to fix a corrupted Xbox Music library on Windows Phone 8.1. Microsoft doesn't provide an option to do this in the app nor can you uninstall it and reinstall like you can on the Windows 8 app. For everyone's edification I
 have included the detailed instructions below. I've tried many other ways, and this is the only sure fire way I've found to fix it. Follow the detailed instructions below very carefully:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Perform a hard reset of your phone. *</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>* Note that all existing apps and data will be deleted from your phone. I highly recommend performing a manual backup of your phone and ensuring all your photos have been backed up to OneDrive before doing this so that as much as possible can be restored
 by Windows Phone's restore process. This won't restore everything, but it will restore your start screen layout and all your applications. Photographs are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not </span>restored.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have found this helpful. This also adds some clarity to the reason that Microsoft does not include an option to rebuild a corrupt music library. After all, all you have to do is wipe out and reinstall everything on your phone and voila! Your music
 library is fixed.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what is going on my Lumia 1020, but the photos it takes are just horrific.&nbsp; I have everything on auto and taking a simple indoor picture results in a blurry image.&nbsp; I was at my sons basketball game and tried to get a shot and everything came
 out grainy, while the iphone 5s was simply great.&nbsp; What could be wrong?&nbsp; I have upload one of the images for review.</p>

<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the camera work perfectly before? Are you using the built-in camera or Lens application? How about when you use the front camera? Does it give the same result? If the issue still remains, you can try to reset the camera settings of your phone by going
 to Settings &gt; swipe left , Applications &gt; Photos+camera &gt; Reset Camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that your phone is running the latest software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us posted.</p>

<p>First, I agree that the Nokia 1020 Camara is not all that it is hyped to be.&nbsp; I am very disappointed with color, softness of pictures, action shots, etc.&nbsp; I have been side by side with an&nbsp;iphone 5 (not s) and had my hat handed to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I think your picture blur because you are zoomed in and trying to take an action shot.&nbsp; At the next game try to get closer ( i know it is hard).&nbsp; Do manual focus to get the basket or another object in focus.&nbsp; Most other things will be close enough focus...
 unless your kid is right infront of you.&nbsp; Then snap the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that you have to think this much, given all the hype about the 1020 - when the iphone guy next to you just takes the picture.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Think if I was you I would press and hold the power button until it cycles off.. then press the power button to turn it back on.... see what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or just remove the power to get it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some hundreds of users have reported win10 fails to shutdown and requires them to hold the power button in for 5 seconds or so to do the hardware reset ..&nbsp; hopefully someday&nbsp;win10 will take the time to come out with a fix.</p>

<p>Hi Zubairahmed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions. Where are you trying to download the said application? You might want to check on this link:&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="http://store.ovi.com/search?q=opera+mini" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/search?q=opera+mini</a>.</em>&nbsp;</strong>You
 may also perform a soft reset on the phone, dial *#7780#. You can also check if the phone is running on the latest software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome. :)&nbsp;</p>

<h3> bnc123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 11099 Internet Explorer forward&#47;back buttons not working</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else experienced a problem with build 11099 Internet Explorer where the&nbsp;forward/back buttons do not consistently&nbsp;work ?</p>
<p>I have this problem on two different systems only after upgrading from build 11082 to build 11099. Clearing IE cache / history and resetting IE did not help.

<p><span>Start Internet Explorer 10 in no add-ons mode</span><span> and check if it helps. Open an elevated CMD (<strong>Windows key + R)</strong> type iexplore<strong>.exe -extoff

            <p>Turn off and Turn on Internet Explorer did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode seems to<strong> temporarily</strong>
<strong>fix</strong> the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I went back to regular add on mode and used the manage add-ons option&nbsp;to try and determine which add-on was the problem, I was not able to narrow it down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran a Windows surface scan (SFC) which came back clean. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI there are multiple reports of this problem in the Insiders Feedback app. It seems this problem started with build 11099.</p>

            I have 3 systems with the same issue. I have tried everything&nbsp; I could find on the issue to no avail.&nbsp; 2 of my systems are running Version 1511(OS Build 10586.63. Only 1 is running Preview Build 11099. However the are networked&nbsp; so maybe that maybe that
 is the issue. Maybe 11099 sent the update to&nbsp;the &nbsp;other computers&nbsp; on the network.

<p>Yes, MSE would detect keylogger too. Which means if user attempt to install keylogger or keylogger attempt to run MSE would detect it.</p>
<p>MSE would detect most of keyloggers but in case that it miss any of them you could report it to:</p>

<p>For more analyze and if it detect as keylogger it would add in signature.</p>

            Hi <strong>APAGLIONE</strong>,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Have you made any recent changes prior to experiencing the issue with OneNote or the same behavior was already observed ever since you've tried the distribute Class Notebooks option? We'd also like to know if there were any error messages that you are getting
 when trying to distribute the pages. If so, can you send us a screenshot?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you may check on this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/distribute-class-notebook-pages-and-sections-96b256dc-8bac-4443-9e9c-4e408c8ada68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as a reference on how to distribute
 Class Notebook pages and sections.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.&nbsp;

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always noticed this behavior, this is my first year using OneNote for my classroom.&nbsp; However, a few other users in my building that began last year, noted that they were able to distribute pages and keep the parent-child, page-subpage relationship
 in the past.&nbsp; This year as we all started to develop our notebooks in late August we noticed that the subpages were all being promoted.&nbsp; Below are screen shots of a test Content Library and the subsequent distribution using the Class NotebookToolbar Addin
 for OneNote.&nbsp; Here you can see a Section called "Test Distribute" from the Content Library and 4 pages are selected for distributing.&nbsp; I named a section "Test Distribute" and distributed the section to all my students in my notebook prior to distributing the
 pages.&nbsp; The second screen shot shows all 4 pages highlighted and the Class Notebook Toolbar Addin being used for distribution.&nbsp; The last screen shot shows a student notebook after distributing.&nbsp; You can see in the Content Library there are pages and subpages
 but in the student notebook everything has been promoted to a full page.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40ee0b99-de95-4d0b-81ef-c8be173d8b94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40ee0b99-de95-4d0b-81ef-c8be173d8b94?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>And if you still can't find it, a recent update may have hidden it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Start then Settings. Go to Apps | Apps and Features. If you don't see Internet Explorer, click on Manage Optional Features then Add A Feature. You should be able to add or enable it. Restart your computer when done so it takes effect.<br />

<h2>            Dragging appointments in Outlook.com Calendar no longer directly shows new date&#47;time</h2>
                    <p>Since I have received the last two Windows Insider fast ring updates, dragging an appointment to a different date or time slot no longer shows the immediate effect of the change (i.e. the appointment is still at the old date/time slot). I have tried both
 Edge and Firefox, and both show the same result: after a minute or so, or after refreshing the page, the change becomes visibile.</p>

<p>Don't have a clue what Microsoft "Version" &nbsp;you have or are using?</p>
<p>That is what I am asked, &nbsp;when I post here and I do about once a week about some problems etc.
</p>
<p>If you have Outlook, OutlookMail, there should be something Called "Junk"</p>
<p>&nbsp;top row&nbsp;&nbsp;middle of the line. </p>
<p>In your Inbox. use the Down Arrow, that will show Phishing.</p>
<p>Hit that button.</p>
<p>I send 5-20 of these Junk Phishing emails&nbsp; to Microsoft every day. </p>

<p>Hi Mk</p>
<p>When I sent the Junk emails to the different addressess&nbsp;I wrote about</p>
<p>I also send the Source Code:</p>
<p>Right click on the message subject.&nbsp;Menu opens at the bottomo of the Menue is: View Source code. I copy everything from the X message info and paste in he FW of the message and send all the addressess I wrote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just sent 7 before I wrote this to you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get a reply from Cert. sometimes &nbsp;from Abuse or Report.<br />
That Reply will vary. It is about the webiste for Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like that 2 inch high blue banner thing. I write about that often. ACD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think the different setting about Exclusive, Sweep or Rules do any good. If you can understand how to apply them. About all they do is send Junk emails to&nbsp; Junk Email that may have gone to Inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Junk keeps on rolling in.</p>
<p>Blocking Domains does not help much because the Junk Sender will use a different with each junk mail and email address.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel date defaults to 1&#47;0&#47;1900</h2>
                    I have copied and pasted various times into an excel document, and changed the formatting to include the date. It defaults to 1/0/1900. I am doing this for many times and dates. How can I quickly fix the date without having to go into each cell?

            Hi Willow
<br />
<br />1/0/1900 is the default date in Excel, when it cannot read a date . . .
<br />
<br />Please provide a sample of the data you are working with, you mention having times, then change the format to include the date, do you want excel to add the date automatically - please explain that . . .
        </p>

<p>I'm copying and pasting data from Weather Underground history. Here's a link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KMIWATER31/table/2019-06-15/2019-06-15/daily</p>
<p>
</p><p>It pastes just the date, since that's what the data includes. But I am moving the data into Flowlink, an outdated and troublesome program. It must be entered in the following format for Flowlink to make sense of it: m/d/yyyy h:mm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that makes sense. Thank you so much for your quick reply!</p>

            You can add the date to the time value. Do as follows after you've pasted the table data:
<br />
<br />Write the date into a separate cell
<br />Copy the cell
<br />Select all cells with the time value
<br />Right-Click on a selected cell and click Pastespecial...
<br />Then choose Values and Add (see screenshot below)
<br />Click Ok
<br />
<br />After that format the cells as m/d/yyyy h:mm and you see the result you want.

            <p>It appears you are getting this error when you select a NEW record. Since an ID has not been generated at the time, the WHERE clause you are trying to use is invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace your strCriteria line with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Me.NewRecord Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;strCriteria = ""</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;StrCriteria = "what you have now"</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should now work.</p>
<p>

            <p>First, you need to learn VBA, not VB. While the two are similar they are not the same. VBA is a superset of VB in that it contains much of the procedural language of VB, but also it contains classes and object specific to the application you are working
 with, which VB doesn't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, what about my suggestion didn't work? I suspect the reason no one else answered was because my solution was the obvious one.. If it didn't work, then something more is going on and we need to know what.</p>

</p><p>After plugging in your suggestion, then running it, it didn't work, so it is obvious to me I do not know **** I'm doing, so unless you are totally bored out of your mind with nothing to do, don't worry about trying to figure out what I'm doing incorrectly...
 &nbsp;But, if you are "bored out of your mind", I'll send the file to you so you can really see how bad it is, then let me know if it is beyond "fixing"...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What means "didn't work"? Remember you can see what is happening, we can't. I took a guess at the cause of your problem, mainly because you didn't give us enough info.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I wasn't annoyed, but Access requires using precise terminology to get things across. So I didn 't know whether you just left of the A or wasn't sure if VB and VBA were interchangeable.&nbsp;</p>
