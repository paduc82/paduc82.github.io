<h2>            Word wish list</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been using Word 2003 to work on a large document with a few other people.&nbsp; We have been editing and revising this document for many months, and I have developed a wish list for features in a word processor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these can done in Word 2003 and I just don't know how, then great, I would like to learn.&nbsp; If these can be done in a newer version of Word, then great, I will upgrade.&nbsp; If these can be done in a different Word processor, then great, I will switch.&nbsp; If
 these features are not available in any product, then I am sad. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're currently using track changes and save-as new versions of the document.&nbsp; It's not a good workflow.&nbsp; Track changes does a decent job of identifying the changes, but it gets unwieldy after a few rounds of revisions.&nbsp; The balloons and changes pile up
 on each other and it quickly becomes tedious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Document revision control<br />
I want something like CVS/SVN for Word documents, I want to be able to make "commits" and have these fully tracked with a history and be comparable, etc.&nbsp; The reason for having "commits" is to be able to reference a document's version at a specific point in
 time.&nbsp; Suppose I work on a document for a day, saving small changes every 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; I want to be able to group / address / reference all of my changes for that day as a complete set, so I would commit it at the end of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Filtering document changes<br />
Once there's commits, then viewing changes can be a lot smarter.&nbsp; I want to be able to filter the document changes shown, so for example show the document's state 2 commits ago.&nbsp; Right now, with track changes, all changes are presented from the beginning of
 the documents creation.&nbsp; I want to be able to see how the document looked like a week ago, a month ago, yesterday, etc, not with all the changes since the beginning of time all stacked on top of each other.&nbsp; But just being able to filter changes by time and
 date isn't enough because of the scenario mentioned above.&nbsp; Suppose there are 50 changes made over the course of a day and they're all supposed to be taken together, and there are 200 total changes.&nbsp; How does a person know at which change to begin showing
 them all?&nbsp; Thus, grouped and commentable changes = commits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-In-place document history<br />
Suppose I'm working on a specific paragraph.&nbsp; I would like to be able to pop up a new window / new split view showing a past version of that paragraph.&nbsp; Bonus if this is repeatable, so there's the main document in one window, then 2 or more smaller windows
 on the side showing different past versions of the same paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Movable / sticky comments<br />
When text is moved, the comments don't move with it.&nbsp; I searched and found the reasoning why this isn't provided, and I agree with it.&nbsp; But it would be good to have an option that allows moving comments if really desired.&nbsp; The comment could be automatically
 annotated that it was moved.&nbsp; A follow-up to this would be considering moving a block of text as a single change rather than representing it as a deletion and an insertion somewhere else.</p>
<p><br />
I could probably get the revision control and filtering document changes by using Latex and plain text documents, but I don't like that it's not WYSIWYG.&nbsp; If I wrote in Latex, then sent a pdf to someone else for review, and the person makes comments / changes
 in the pdf, then I have to manually backport the changes into my plain text?&nbsp; At least with Word they can comment and make changes directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So does my wish list exist?<br />
Thanks!</p>

            Some of what you are looking for are features of document management systems.&nbsp; MS offers one (SharePoint), and there are many more out there. Shopping for one is daunting, and the cost is pretty high, I'm told. But you might find one with&nbsp; many of the
 features you want.<br />

            <p>The feature list you have mentioned will be quite helpful for users who work on documents edited by multiple people.
</p>
<p>I checked it they were available in Word 2010, but unfortunately they donâ€™t exist.
</p>
<p>Currently Word does not seem to keep any kind of history for track changes.
</p>
<p>Office 2010 has an option to recover earlier versions of the document (<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/recover-earlier-versions-of-a-file-in-office-2010-HA010356735.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/recover-earlier-versions-of-a-file-in-office-2010-HA010356735.aspx</span></a>)</p>
<p>If MS could tweak it a bit, I believe it could work with track changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However provide your suggestion in the link below:

<h2>            DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;storahci.sys&#41; BSOD when upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Upgrade from 8.1 to 10 Preview Bootloop </p>
<p>Hi, I'm experiencing a problem from upgrading from Windows 8.1 Pro to the Windows 10 Preview on my Laptop. My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite Pro L750.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Midway running the upgrade through my laptop, the laptop suddenly turned off on around 35-37%. Whenever my computer boots up it attempts to recover installation then shows a BSOD saying: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (storahci.sys). It then restarts thus
 looping it.</p>
<p>The install for the Windows 10 Preview is on my External HD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried F8 and Shift + F8 for safemode but nothing.</p>
<p>I can only access F2 and F12, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option I have right now is to burn the Windows 10 preview onto a disk and insert it into my laptop. (I don't have any spare disks right now, and I don't even know if it will work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help :(</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to remove any external devices connected to the computer(except keyboard and mouse) and check if the&nbsp;Blue screen disappears. If the BSOD disappears then I would request you to install the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>StorAHCi is the MS AHCI driver. Install the AHCI driver from Intel, AMD or nVIDIA depending which chipset you use.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I've taken every thing out of the ports and still nothing.</p>
<p>It still tries to recover installation, then goes into the BSOD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do in the F2 or F12 startup? My HD is first priority in the F2 startup. (I'm sorry, don't</p>
<p>know what they're called.)</p>
<p>Also will having the Windows 10 setup on a disk then inserting it to my laptop work? I might try this when I have blank disks.</p>

            I managed to upgrade a HP laptop when I replaced the MS storACHI with another one (AMD in my case). This had to be done manually using the device manager. The installation packages provided by HP did not update the driver even though it was included in
 the bundle.

            <p>I can think of two reasons why this happens...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Your version of Access is the Runtime and not the full version</p>
<p>2. The Option to open the last file opened is checked and that database has no Start up Form</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I guess there is a third, have you tried running a Repair?</p>

<h2>            6288 - Screen&#47;Screen PCB failure&#63;</h2>
                    I have a 6288 here which i am presuming has a failed screen controller.<br />
<br />
The phone has been showing symptoms of imminent failure as it would flicker, display wrong colours, or display the image in the wrong area. The phone would function normally, make and receive calls etc.<br />
But today the screen is black, wont revive, powering off then on does nothing, still makes start up tone though. Backlight still works as par normal.<br />
<br />
Seeing as the phone is one month out of warranty(13ish months) =( is it worth dumping the phone? How much would a check up at a care center cost?<br />
<br />
Cheers Will,

            If you are in europe you are actually covered by a two year warranty, outside of europe is one year.<br />
<br />
Only your local care point can advise you how much it will cost as prices vary between countries.<br />
<br />
Last time I took an out-of-warranty phone to a care point in the UK for inspection (3 years ago) they only charged Â£10 to look at it.<br />

<p>Hi Hegi KP,</p>
<p>The game Vietcong 2 is not listed in the Windows 7 Compatibility center; hence it may or may not run with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Compatibility center information- <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=vietcong 2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=vietcong%202</strong></a><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>1) Does this happen every time you try to install?</p>
<p>2) Have you already tried reinstalling the game?</p>
<p>If you face the issue every time you try to install then probably the game is not meant for Windows 7.</p>
<p>As a work around you may try playing the game in Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Access the link below for information on installing&nbsp; a program in Compatibility Mode.</p>

<p>If the above steps does not work, you might need to contact the manufacturer of the game to see for any possible updates.</p>

<p>
</p><p>With 16gb ram you probably just like me and&nbsp;hardly use the paging file &amp; doubtful you even need readyboost.&nbsp; The one program I had that showed max paging use .. the most it ever showed was like 300mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set your Memory Dump to small mem dumps (256mb) &amp; your paging to system managed&nbsp;- then&nbsp;take a look at the size of your paging file size after a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ramdisk is just tying up your available ram when you have 16gb if you're not using it for something worthy.&nbsp;

            I use the program "Primo Ramdisk Ultimate Edition v5.6.0" to create the RAMDrive. As the user is setting the parameters for the drive an option to create a TEMP and/or TMP folder(s) is available. Creating it here means that these folders are automatically
 (re)created each time the system is (re)booted.

            <p>Ready Boost would be on the SSD in the&nbsp;default location, "C:\Windows\Prefetch"&nbsp;&nbsp; no need to move it, actually no need to use it&nbsp;on a SSD :)</p>

 Make sure you take a pic or otherwise remember the default paths if you should change it there so someday.. you can hopefully remember why things might not work when your ram drive fails to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest bang I've seen for performance is using a faster
 SSD - and setting your performance options to not slide in and fade stuff&nbsp;should make those selection boxes and&nbsp;menu's and context menu's pop open and &nbsp;scroll&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to keep the Internet Explorer cache in&nbsp;the dataram&nbsp;ram drive.. figure it lowers the use of my ssd writes quite a bit as I'm always online in IE going places&nbsp;-&nbsp;always temped to do temp too but last time I did too many gotcha&nbsp;headaches when not thinking
 or least expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firefox has&nbsp;a built in option to keep cache in ram, wish IE did.</p>

</p><p>The paging file is to handle memory overcommit, not to preload common code and data.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a 64 bit version of Windows there is no reason to use a ram disk, ever unless you have a very slow hard drive and a lot of memory that you never use.</p>

            <p>Here is my opinion of these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) After RAM the most important upgrade you can do is put in an SSD for at least your system files.&nbsp; A SSD in an old laptop can make it feel like a new one.&nbsp; It is especially true of laptops since they have such slow hard drives.</p>
<p>2) If you have an SSD readyboost is not only pointless, it might even slow down your computer.&nbsp; If the readyboost is on an USB drive the SSD will be at least as fast as it.&nbsp; If you try putting it on the SSD (not even sure you can), you are basically not
 changing anything since clearly reading from an SSD is equal to reading from an SSD, unlike what readyboost was for USB drive being faster than a hard drive.</p>
<p>3) RAM usage.&nbsp; If your intent is performance, then I would say 90% of the time the operating system will make better use of the RAM then you will.&nbsp; If your intent is security by clearing the temp files each time you shutdown, that is a different story.&nbsp;
 The only time I can think that the user might possibly do better than the operating system would something like a heavily used database, where the database can fit completely in a RAM disk.&nbsp; And even in this case I would be have to measure the performance
 to be sure, and I would much more likely push for a SSD for it instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my reasons that I think the operating system will do better than you with a RAM disk.</p>
<p>1) In comparison to Unix/Linux, Windows paging system stinks, and everyone knows it.&nbsp; The result is that everyone is using so much RAM, that Windows seldom actually has to page.&nbsp; And as far as I'm concerned, your primary use for RAM should be avoiding paging.&nbsp;
 You do that by simply having enough memory for all the tasks you need to run at a time.</p>
<p>2) If you dedicate RAM to a RAM disk, that is all it can do.&nbsp; If you leave it up to Windows it will use what it needs for programs, and what is left over it will use for disk caching.&nbsp; It does this disk caching based on what you have accessed, and as such
 you can switch from one task that needs to speed up certain disk access to another without having to say move things in and out of a RAM disk.</p>
3) Microsoft is constantly changing the way Windows uses the memory it has and you might just be "pushing against" this.&nbsp; You can see these efforts in things like prefetch, and recently the memory allocation change, that when pressed for memory it will start
 to compress the memory and store it in the System process instead of paging.

            <p>if what you say is true , my paging file seems to go from 80mb to 1.2gb when playing a game</p>
<p>
</p><p>so isnt putting it on a paging file speeding it up?</p>

            <p>Monique, I don't think the answer is helpful for the poster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First he is using Business Essential which doesn't come with Litigation Hold. &nbsp;The user will need to subscribe additional cost Exchange Plan 2 (USD 8 per user per month) or add Exchange Online Archive (USD 3 per user per month) to achieve what you advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternative methods I suggest are</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1 : Convert user mailbox into shared mailbox and attach it to his manager</p>
<p>Option 2 : Use a PC with MS-Outlook, connect to that account, and download the mails as a pst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think as of today there is no feature to download a pst direct from Outlook web.</p>

            <p>Hi. Me.FilterOn = False applies to the form where the button is located. Since you said the button is on the main form but want to reset the filter on the subform, you are just resetting the filter on the main form. To reset the filter on the subform, you'll
 have to add the subform control's name. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.SubformControlName.Form.FilterOn = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps...</p>

            <p>Yes, you would need to put the image into the primary footer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do that before selecting the Different First Page Box.&nbsp; The image will disappear when you do select that box, but when a second page is added to the document, it will appear.</p>

                    <p>Hello so yesterday i randomly turned on avast antivirus to do a clean check on my pc. 10 Minutes later i got a windows script host error saying,&nbsp;Can not find script file "C:/Users/Public/Libraries/Checks.vbs". Since then it has been popping up every 2 minutes
 and did research on how to fix it but nothing is working. I tried to turn of avast, go into regedit and clean stuff in there that might have to do with it, etc. Please help me as soon as possible on how to disable it or how to fix it!</p>

            Hi bastiaanbijen, that is the remnants of malware that has been removed from your system by Defender or your chosen Anti-virus package 
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this errror message . . . 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />If that does not remove this annoyance, here is a way to stop the popup
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />
<br />Go to C:/Users/Public/Libraries/
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon make sure you can see file name extensions
<br />
<br />Create a new text file and add this text to that file:
<br />
<br />WScript.Quit
<br />
<br />Save that text file, then rename it to (change the txt files extension to vbs):
<br />
<br />Checks.vbs 
<br />
<br />That's it, restart your PC and that annoyance will be gone . . .

            I'm getting the exact same thing.&nbsp; It started happening last Saturday but until now, I hadn't heard of anyone having the same problem.&nbsp; It's so bizarre, because the Print Preview looks fine.&nbsp; Really aggravating.&nbsp; Maybe Google made some kind of upgrade
 and there was a bug in it?

<p>
</p><p>The Language in Skype will always use the default Language set up on your computer. Make sure to use Mandarin as the&nbsp;Language on your computer so it will be detected by Skype. In the website, you can change the Language as well. Simply sign in on your account,

                    I've just updated microsoft office suite as instructed by automatic updates and the hover button over the comments has stopped working. did the usual - excel\preferences\view and the" indicators only, and comments on rollover" is on but still doesn't work.
 Other buttons work i.e. "no comments or indicators" and "comments and indicators" but the rollover one isn't working. Any ideas?

                    <p>Office 2016 creates telemetry files (evt.tbl, sln.tbl, user.tbl) with telemetry information. I want to view what's in these files, but I don't know how to parse these files. Notepad / hex editor does not reveal all the data, because I do not know the file-format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you I parse the evt.tbl, sln.tbl and user.tbl files so they reveals all the information it contains? (I'm specially interested in the sln.tbl file)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Any update on whether this issue will be resolved? This is a feature that I use all the time and the inability to delete preceding searches is more than a minor annoyance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

            &nbsp;Thanks for the post CK.&nbsp; Too bad, but at least we got a fast build this week.&nbsp; It's a shame to see Buildfeed dying, but I guess these things happen.&nbsp; Maybe somebody else will come up with a replacement one day.
