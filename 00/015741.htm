<span>I joined the bidding function in my company a couple of months ago after ten years in technical writing. So, I am professional user of Microsoft templates and styles
 and I try to enforce the same on teams I work with. With proposals emerges the need for simultaneous multi-authoring. I relied on Microsoft Word through our SharePoint portal. It worked so fine we had a maximum of four editors on left-to-right (LTR) protected
 template. My current proposal has two different variables:</span><br />
<span>1. The template is bilingual (RTL and LTR).</span><br />

 the shared document in Word Desktop and it was a total loss. I checked it out, reattached the template, fixed all style issues, but once I had one team member open it, it went all corrupted again. I am not sure about the root cause of the problem. Is it an
 issue in SharePoint and MS Word collaboration; they cannot afford bilingual templates? Is it the team count? Do I just need to have the team clear their Upload Center cache and try again?</span>

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview in November 2014 (upgraded from Windows 7/7). &nbsp;I have installed each build with no problem. &nbsp;I have the product keys for both Windows 7 and 8. &nbsp;I recently purchased a new computer, and moved my hard drive from
 old to new. &nbsp;On the old computer, windows was activated. &nbsp;I have tried to active using the windows 7 key, windows 8 key, and the default key provided by Microsoft. &nbsp;I have also tried running slui.exe 4, but it will not run. &nbsp;I have also tried chatting with
 Microsoft, but they could not help. &nbsp;The error code I get is 0x80070057. &nbsp; I need to get Windows activated. &nbsp;The latest build I had was Build 11099.rs1, but reverted to Build 11082. &nbsp;I cannot get eith build activated. &nbsp;Can anyone help??

            Moving the hard drive to a new system is a "new" system and it won't activate, only way to activate now for "free" is to install Win7 or 8 and activate them and then you can upgrade to win10 &nbsp;this &nbsp;all changed on July 2015 when the RTM was released, now
 the Win 7,8 keys are they retail or OEM? and what is the default key from MS as the only keys for win10 are the ones with retail versions.

<p>I tried this, downloaded ISO and ran the Setup.exe file. After the process, computer rebooted and finally the Installation was failed.</p>

<p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clean install would be the simplest solution. This would mean creating a bootable USB stick (or DVD) from the 15002 ISO, booting the PC with that; deleting all hard disk partitions and then installing Windows 10 to the empty disk. It will create the default
 partition layout on the disk. Obviously, this would mean backing up any data and software install files that you would need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it may be possible to troubleshoot why it is failing in the SAFE_OS phase and resolve that. There should be some logs that were written to during the upgrade attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But first, here is a list of things to try that might enable the upgrade to succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely uninstall any non-Microsoft anti-virus software.</li><li>Perform a clean boot before upgrading. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a> </li><li>Disconnect any unneeded peripherals, such as devices connected via USB and SD cards.</li><li>Disable all network adapters after the build has downloaded but before it Restarts, or before running setup.exe, if you are upgrading via a mounted ISO or Windows 10 install media.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes just disconnecting the Internet, such as unplugging the Ethernet cable, will enable a stalled upgrade to complete.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>I had to do all of the above to get my wife's PC to upgrade to the "Anniversary Update" version last August, even though I was installing it from ISO, as you are.</p>

    <title>Searching in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janezkranjski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    One of painful thing in Outlook 2013 is searching. I search a lot in my Outlook and this really like a gunshot wound.
<br />
<br />
1. I can't understand why default searching is in Current Mailbox. Hey, user usually wants to search throw the whole database of mails. Can someone suggest any way to change this behavior?<br />
<br />
2. After I change the behavior from issue 1, I write a search string. After some seconds, I get "We couldn't find what you were looking for. Find more on the server.". After this message is displayed, I have to click to a link to get (more) results.
<br />
<br />
Like I described - in this version I have to click a lot more then before. And yes, I have a lot to search, so this is very annoying.<br />
<br />
Any idea? Ok - beside downgrade.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I understand there are some modifications made to the Outlook 2013 “Search” feature. But this is done in order to
<b>increase performance</b>; Outlook 2013 now limits search results to 30 items. However there is an option to "show all results."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. To
<b>address the issue of search defaults to ‘Current Mailbox’</b>, when searching the Inbox within Microsoft Outlook 2013, the search defaults to the Current Mailbox.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>But you have an option to
<b>change the default search folder to the required folder</b>. <br />
To do so open Outlook &gt; Click on ‘Options’ &gt; Click on ‘Search’ &gt; Under ‘Results’, in ‘Include results only from:’ you can check the appropriate option required. This change remains same even after you close and reopens Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Regarding an issue of
<b>‘search not finding the items’</b>, provide us the below details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. What type of email account s setup in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange and Outlook Connector)?</p>
<p>b. Could you provide the exact message about the link you click on to get more results.</p>
<p>c. After you click on the link, are you able to find the search results?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply with the required details and we are here to help you.</p>
<p>Thank You.
</p>

            Thank you for your tip where to change default search settings. <br />
<br />
It looks very promising for my issue. But - after I set "Include results from All Folders" (and restart Outlook), the upper right search field still have "Search current mailbox".
<br />
I will follow the behavior of searching.<br />
<br />
I also uncheck "Improve search speed by limiting the number of results shown". Looks like this helps with second issue.<br />

<p>Does the ‘Current Mailbox’ shows the default even after changing other option in Outlook?</p>
<p>Choose the option
<b>‘All Mailboxes’</b> under File &gt; Search. The <b>‘All Mailboxes’</b> sets the search default to search all mailboxes associated with this profile.</p>

            If I create a new profile - can I loose something? Or can I go back to current profile via "Control Panel/Mail/Profile"?<br />
<br />
I also noticed that searching (even in "All Mailboxes") sometime simply don't find all messages. But I can find a particular message if i use different search conditions.<br />

            I am having somewhat of a similar issue. When I do a search in just the folder it works well, however if I chose search "Current Mailbox" then it misses a large amount of the results that were returned from just the "current folder settings"

            Hi Nayana,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your inputs, this is all clear. I like the option that searches are limited, but 30 is a number too low. Can I change this number to a different value??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help!<br />

<h2>            Multiple filters on the same page</h2>
                    Hi there!
<div>Here is my Problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to put Filters on several Ranges in one Worksheet. It seems, that Excel supports only one Auto-filter on each sheet, so when i Filter lets say Rows 2-13 and after that try to filter rows from 20 to 25, the first Filter is gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next thing i try is to insert table, but in one of the columns, that should act as header is a formula and the table wants to convert it to plane text. I cannot create 2 Tables left and right from that column, because i need the insert row to works simple
 and i am not allowed to add VBA code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So..given this state of things, is there a possibility to insert multiple filters on my sheet?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BR,</div>

            No - one filter per sheet.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>1) Move your other tables to other sheets</div>
<div>2) Move the table to columns to the right and line up the headers - but you will still have to show all data before filtering the second.</div>
<div>3) Use another column of table identifiers, and filter on that column first - works only if your headers for the multiple tables are the same and are lined up.</div>

<h2>            Optional Features fails</h2>
                    <p>Build 17711 has just been reset after several failed updates to 17713.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps trying to install the optional feature of US Speech, US Typing and US OCR, none of which do I want as I have the GB version already and I live in England.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop this?</p>

<p>Hi Silverpulser,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Settings </strong>app includes a section to manage optional features.&nbsp;To manage optional features using the Settings app on Windows 10, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Manage optional features</strong> link.</li><li>Select the feature you want, and you'll notice a button to <strong>Uninstall </strong>
or <strong>Manage</strong>, which will redirect you to the settings page where the feature is located.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Optional features I mentioned in my OP are not yet installed. That is why I cannot manage them. The system kept telling me that it had tried to install the features but failed. I think it may have been because under language it had both English GB and
 English US. I have now removed the English US language and hope that works.</p>

    <title>Combining Frequency with Countif - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr steve cox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combining Frequency with Countif</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning</p>
<p>I have imported text from a PDF in col AA. &nbsp;In col BB I have formulas to strip out the data I need; essentially a list of employee #s and dates (plus some blank cells due to original text formatting). &nbsp;In col AC and AE I have helpers that repeat the employee
 # and convert the date to a datecode. &nbsp;What I need to count is unique dates for each employee number. &nbsp;All of this is very dynamic; 200 employee #s that may or may not be on each report, widely varying number of entries per employee/date and the blank cells
 aren't consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a few combinations of Countif, Frequency, Sumproduct, etc. with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bonus points :-D If I could remove the helper columns and reduce size/complexity of this workbook...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<h2>            Desired &#58; GoDaddy as Registrar, o365 as Nameserver</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to take &nbsp;domain I have purchased from GoDaddy (independently, outside of o365) and have that domain use o365 nameservers. When I run the add domain wizard in o365 panel it greys out the option "<strong>Yes, I want to transfer DNS management in
 the next step</strong>" and won't let me select it. This is after I have verified domain ownership either way (i.e., via GD login or via TXT record). I have also tried to just go ahead and set my NS records for the domain/zone to the bdm.mi***line.com nameservers,
 but when I do that the o365 wizard just acts like it has no idea who my DNS host org and NS hosts are. I get the feeling that o365 is treating GoDaddy special and if I were hosting *anywhere* else that I wouldn't be having this issue, but I have admittedly
 no evidence to back that up. I specifically want my nameservers in o365/Azure so that I have an API to manage my record with.</p>
<p>Anybody know why the wizard won't allow me to transfer management and how to get around this?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jay,<br />
<br />
Where do you purchase the Office 365 tenant? If it is purchased from GoDaddy, you could contact them for dedicated support.<br />
<br />
If your tenant is purchased from Microsoft, you can follow the Change DNS management to Office 365 section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-how-DNS-records-are-managed-with-Office-365-b20af3e9-f5fe-4235-a4eb-3edca5b2ab10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to let Office 365 manage your DNS records.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim<br />

<p>I tried to post this once but it is not showing up. The tenant was purchased through the Ingram Micro CSP program. I have already reached out to them for support but they are not very quick to respond. I can't follow the steps in the article because "Yes,
 I want to transfer DNS management in the next step" is greyed out.</p>

<p>Respectfully, yes, I understand that I can't use Office 365 features to manage a DNS domain *hosted* at GoDaddy. That is why I want to transfer the *hosting* to Office 365/Azure. GoDaddy would remain the registrar only. That's the whole point of this post,
 figuring out how to do that.</p>

<p>Hi Jay,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Could you try this method: <br />
Go to GoDaddy and change the nameserver to point to another DNS hosting provider (You could use a free 3rd party DNS hosting provider), then add the domain to Office 365 and update the nameserver to point to Office 365 if you can choose the option.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jared</p>

<p>hi jay,</p>
<p>from the following article, please understand that you can't set up a godaddy domain to have office 365 manage your dns records for you by default:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-nameservers-to-office-365-a46bec33-2c78-4f45-a96c-b64b2a5bae22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">change nameservers to office 365</a></p>
<p>as a workaround, you can follow the steps below to manually change the name servers at godaddy to office 365:</p>
<p>1. add your domain to office 365 and verify it.<br />
2. when it prompts you the following page which doesn’t let you select <b>yes</b>, click the cross to close the page.</p>
<p>3. sign into godaddy and manually change the name servers to <b>ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com</b> and
<b>ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6c7fac24-d1a6-44e6-937a-a75e27e82c7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6c7fac24-d1a6-44e6-937a-a75e27e82c7b" /></a></p>
<p>4. after it’s updated, back to the office 365 domains management page and click
<b>complete setup</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ddae7784-975f-478d-ac5b-0efc99ff38fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dddae7784-975f-478d-ac5b-0efc99ff38fd" /></a></p>
<p>5. click <b>next</b> and you’ll be able to select <b>yes, i want to transfer dns management in the next step</b>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5e49c539-f7d9-4ee8-9bf1-105dfcb4bb0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5e49c539-f7d9-4ee8-9bf1-105dfcb4bb0d" /></a></p>
<p>6. click <b>okay, i’ve changed the nameservers</b> &gt; <b>finish</b>.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Corrupts files &#40;Word &#38; PDF&#41; when sent out</h2>
                    I have been using MS Office 2013 for over a year. Just recently Outlook 2013 has been corrupting files that are sent out as attachments, or it does not send out the email at all. This means both Word and PDF files. I have repaired MS Office multiple times
 to no avail. I have created a new Outlook profile and set up the email account again and this did not solve the problem. I can send the email through our web based platform that is part of our mail server and the files go through fine. Is there anything that
 can be done to resolve this problem?

            <p>Hi again all, hi Charlie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too tried all those recommendations to start in reboot and clean and create new profile and NONE worked. Speaking to various people, the common assumption was that there was software malfunction which affected the 'registry' which in turn screwed up everything
 working from Windows to Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I could not wait any longer and took the bold and scary move to wipe and re-install windows and then Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has gone away. I have reinstalled all the PST files and gone back to open, send and fwd those same emails with PDF and Word and Jpeg attachments that would not work or claimed to be corrupted and everything is working normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore it was as we said at the very beginning, this was an Office &gt; Outlook software problem which was not running properly due to some event that started the issues.... &nbsp;!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is running like new again which is nice, but have to say that this process of discussing with a Microsoft Support Engineer was 'painful' to say the least, especially when they clearly did not read what we had written as they kept on recommending
 things that we stated had failed... frustrating !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charlie, if you have your discs from the box on purchase, I would back up everything in a fresh external HD and reload Windows and Office again, at least you will be starting afresh again. exporting and importing all your outlook accounts and contacts were
 very easy, just google it and there are loads of step by step guides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Charlie for you input on this journey, hope you find a solution as I do not think you will find one from this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Craig</p>

            <p>Craig,</p>
<p>I agree that the Microsoft support has been really lacking. I seemed to have solved the problem by creating a new user on the laptop and recreating my outlook accounts. So far (I will keep my fingers crossed) it is working properly. I can send emails both
 with and without attachments (word and PDF). It obviously was a pain in the neck. Had to copy all the files in Documents over and then back up the .PST to get my contacts transferred to the new user as well as download all the email from the server. At leaset
 it seems to work, not thanks to Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Synched emails deleting from my phone AND desktop computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The company I work with recently changed our email server to Office 365. I managed to set up the email sync with my mobile phone and the Office 365 email account just fine. However, when I delete an email from my phone now it is also deleted from my email
 on my desktop computer.</p>
<p>This is very annoying as I really do not need to keep all these emails on my mobile, however I do need to keep them in my Office 365 email account.</p>
<p>I have searched for days to find a solution for this.</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Samsung Galaxy S7.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the right forum to post this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<br />
If you would like your email apps to not affect one another if you delete an email message, you will need to set up your email account on both of your devices as a POP (Post Office Protocol) email account.<br />
<br />
Please note that you will have to remove your email account on both devices for you re-add them as a POP email account. You do not have to worry about losing your messages that are still stored on your email server. The email apps that you are using will automatically
 download the messages from the server after successfully setting it up again.<br />
<br />
You will need to use the following incoming mail server settings:<br />
<br />
Incoming mail server for POP: <strong>outlook.office365.com</strong><br />
Port: <strong>995</strong><br />
Encryption method: <strong>S</strong><strong>SL</strong><br />
<br />
For sending email messages, use the following email server settings:<br />
<br />
Outgoing mail server settings SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): <strong>smtp.office365.com</strong><br />
Port: <strong>587</strong><br />
Encryption method: <strong>TLS</strong> or <strong>STARTTLS</strong><br />
<br />
You may also ask your company's email administrator for assistance on how you can set up your email as a POP acount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to reply if you have further questions.

</p>
<p>but when I go into Hot Mail I can send but there is an abbreviated screen so can't add attachments etc. When I go into Outlook, there is nothing in the inbox etc. I would like my e-mails from Hot Mail etc. to be transferred to Outlook so I can use Outlook.
 I also want my e-mails to go to Outlook and not to Hot Mail. How can I get this done? Help please.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The FormulaArray property has a limit of 255 characters (see VBA Help for that property).&nbsp; Your formula exceeds that limit.&nbsp; The R1C1 formula type is not an issue in more recent versions of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest either splitting things up, or using a Name.&nbsp; Here is an example of using a Name:&nbsp; Note that I also changed the references to absolute instead of relative.&nbsp; This will ensure they remain the same when you enter them using the Name.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Sending Accepted Meetings to Calendar in Deleted Items - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickmn_402  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Sending Accepted Meetings to Calendar in Deleted Items Folder</h2>
                    <p>A month ago I was running Windows 10 Home and Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I had outlook configured to use 4 different pop mail accounts. &nbsp;My calendar worked fine, but some of my email messages would get hung up in the out going email folder. &nbsp;So I upgraded to Outlook
 2016 (Office 365). &nbsp;I simplified down to 2 email accounts, but one of them is iCloud. &nbsp;I had to install an iCloud extension to get Outlook to work with my iCloud email. &nbsp;Around the same time I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before upgrading, my calendar worked fine. &nbsp;It was not synched with iCloud, but that was OK, I used the outlook calendar for work, iCloud for personal and manually synched them if I needed to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I upgraded (and installed iCloud extension) my calendar doesn't work. &nbsp;If I get a meeting invitation through email, I can click "accept" but the meeting disappears. &nbsp;After some digging, I realized that the meetings were being added to a "calendar"
 in my deleted items folder. &nbsp;It is awkward to navigate to this folder. &nbsp;I "copied" the entire calendar to a new calendar outside the deleted items folder. &nbsp;All of the old meetings came forward, but new meetings are still going to the deleted items folder.</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your iCloud has a two-way verification? If yes, we suggest turning it off. We also suggest uninstalling the iCloud extension to check if it's the one causing the issue. After uninstalling the extension, we recommend that you remove and then add your
 Outlook profile again. To remove your profile, please click <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-a-profile-d5f0f365-c10d-4a97-aa74-3b38e40e7cdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Please make sure to backup your PST files before removing your Outlook profile. Please click this

link</a> to backup your PST files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            it&#39;s amazingly easy to make Nokia-format themes using Notepad</h2>
                    Maybe this is old hat to some readers, but...<br />
<br />
Take a Nokia theme file, which will have suffix ".nth".<br />
Change the suffix to ".zip", and you will find a commonpor-garden zipped folder.<br />
<br />
When you extract or view, you'll find a load of .jpg files, and an .xml file called a "theme descriptor".<br />
You can just open the latter with a text editor such as Notepad and alter to your heart's content; and of course insert different .jpg files<br />
<br />
Then zip the whole lot and change the suffix back to .nth<br />
<br />
(Would love to hear from anyone else with simple info like this on how to do stuff).<br />
<br />
Mike

            I did that when I had my 6280 about 2 years back. Themes for Sony-Ericsson phones are similar, I did a couple of those about 3 years ago.

                    <p>Is there anyone out there having this problem :RECIEVING E-MAILS WITH YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting e-mails using my address, I can not reply to these e-mails because they only use their names example: Military.com(my e-mail address), ReverseMortgagecalculator(e-mail address), Thank you-Facebook Survey(e-mail address), *FederalGrantFunding(e-mail
 address), VydoxPlusTrial(e-mail address). because these people somehow have been able to use my e-mail address I can not block them from coming into my account because Our own e-mail addresses can not be blocked.&nbsp; Is there anyone out there having the same
 problem and come up with a way of stopping them from using this method of unwanted advertisement?
</p>
<p>Any help on this issue will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
