    <title>Profile picture resolution reduced - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jweb80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile picture resolution reduced</h2>
                    When I add a high resolution profile picture via outlook.com or on the phone directly via the stored pictures, then the resolution is reduced. This then leaves the "Me" tile with a horrible looking blurry picture.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some of my skype contacts have low resolution pictures as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How to solve this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

<h2>            Is calendar synchronization between Office 2013 and Outlook.com capped by spam or bandwidth limits&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>My set-up:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>I am using&nbsp;<strong>Outlook 2013 (32-bit) on Windows 8.1</strong>.</li><li>I have an&nbsp;<strong>Outlook.com</strong>&nbsp;account (for mail, contacts and calendar), all of which are synchronized via the Exchange ActiveSync protocol.</li><li>My Outlook.com calendar is set as the default calendar in Outlook 2013.</li><li>My Outlook.com data file is set as the default data file in Outlook 2013.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<span>The issue:</span></p>
<span>The issue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When I add a single appointment to my calendar in Outlook 2013, it&nbsp;usually appears at&nbsp;once and correctly on the online&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;on the Outlook.com website.</span></li><li><span>When I add multiple appointments to my calendar in Outlook 2013, and I leave enough time between adding them to the calendar,&nbsp;</span><span>they usually synchronize at once and correctly with the online&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;on the&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook.com website.</span></li><li><strong><span>However, when I add multiple appointments to the calendar, in quite rapid succession (i.e. with only some seconds between adding each appointment, for example when adding appointments with a number of my customers for the next day), it often
 happens that only the first few&nbsp;appointments&nbsp;I added in Outlook 2013 are synchronized correctly to the Outlook.com calendar, but not the remaining ones. These latter ones are indeed added&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Outlook 2013 calendar, but they are NOT&nbsp;synchronized&nbsp;to the Calendar
 on the Outlook.com website.</span></strong></li></ul>
<p><br />
<span>Questions:</span></p>
<span>Questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Is this normal behavior?</li><li><strong>I am suspecting that there is some sort of synchronization issue between Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com via EAS protocol.</strong></li><li>Could it be that the Outlook.com calendar servers cannot handle synchronizing multiple appointments in rapid succession?</li><li>Could it be that the EAS protocol cannot handle synchronizing multiple appointments in rapid succession?</li><li>Could it be that this is some sort of "spam protection" control on the Outlook.com servers: e.g. the connection between the Outlook 2013 client software and the Outlook.com calendar server is cut off when the number of added items during a certain time
 frame exceeds a certain limit)? I know that there are spam protection limits for mail messages on Outlook.com: one cannot send more than a certain number of messages during a certain time; if one does: sending of mails is halted for a while, messages remain
 in the Outbox until the "delay period" is over.</li></ul>

            <p>Here is an example of a test I just did, which re-produces the problem:</p>

<li>Open&nbsp;<strong>Outlook 2013</strong>&nbsp;application, and open its&nbsp;<strong>Calendar&nbsp;</strong>window</li><li>Open&nbsp;<strong>Chrome</strong>&nbsp;web browser, go to&nbsp;<strong>www.outlook.com</strong>, go to its&nbsp;<strong>Calendar-</strong>window.</li><li>In Outlook 2013, put the cursor at the 9:00 am time, type the letter "<strong>a</strong>" to add a 30-minute appointment.</li><li>In Chrome, refresh the web page. Notice that the appointment is indeed there, so synchronization was for the first appointment "a" was fine.</li><li>In Outlook 2013, put the cursor at the 9:30 am time, type the letter "<strong>b</strong>" to add a 30-minute appointment.</li><li>In Chrome, refresh the web page. Notice that the appointment is indeed there, so synchronization was for the second appointment "b" was fine.</li><li>In Outlook 2013, put the cursor at the 10:00 am time, type the letter "<strong>c</strong>" to add a 30-minute appointment.</li><li>In Chrome, refresh the web page.

 that this "DISCONNECTED"-warning only appears when I add a number of appointments in succession, as outlined above. The EAS-connection does not disconnect by itself in any other circumstances.</span></li><li>So, the first 4 appointments synchronized correctly, but as of the 5th they were no longer synchronized to Outlook.com. From then onward, anything that I add does not synchronize any more. I have to wait for a certain amount of time (I have not been able
 to determine how long I need to wait), after which synchronization will work again for newly added appointments. However, making changes to the appointments that were NOT synchronized will not work. I will have to delete those and enter them again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IMPORTANT</span></strong>: in the example, the synchronization failed as of the fifth added appointment. However, this is not always the case, sometimes it happens as soon as after the second addition,
 sometimes only after ten or more. <strong>I cannot predict after how many additions&nbsp;synchronization&nbsp;will fail</strong>&nbsp;for a certain duration, after which it will just start&nbsp;working again.</em></p>

            Same problem here, tho I hadn't been able to see the pattern that determined why some items sync and some don't.&nbsp; Right now about half my calendar items make it out of my Outlook 2013 and up to my outlook.com account.&nbsp; At first I thought my mobile devices
 were having sync trouble but once I realized the info never made it to outlook.com I could see that wasn't the case.&nbsp; Any solutions out there?&nbsp; Please, please, please?<br />

            <p>I am having the exact same issue. I've posted on this forum multiple times looking for a solution and never once got an answer. This was months ago. I've quite literally existed without a calendar on my phone ever since. I don't even bother trying to synchronize
 any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disappointing thing was that when i began to post about this topic no one else jumped on board. It's as if no one else was having the issue. I would love to see this thread grow and hopefully it be given some importance by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the bandwidth comment: I don't think that it's limited. I can copy and paste my entire outlook 2013 contact list of over 1000 contacts and it shows up on outlook.com within a matter of seconds. Yet i can't copy and paste 5 calendar items from Outlook
 2013 calendar to Outlook.com calendar running within outlook because it's incapable of syncing. It makes no sense to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Removing the account from Outlook 2013 does nothing. &nbsp;I've probably done this 20 times in the last few months.&nbsp;</p>

 if altered on either device in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Deleting Custom Theme in Powerpoint 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am at my wit's end trying to delete a custom I created in Powerpoint 2011 for Mac. I can find references to how to delete a customer theme for Powerpoint 2007 for PC; for Powerpoint for Mac assuming I am using Lion (didn't work); or other combinations.
 I am running Yosemite and Powerpoint for Mac 2011 version 14.4.7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else? I probably made a mistake by creating a "theme" instead of&nbsp; a "template", but now I have the theme from hell.</p>
<p>

<p>I am running 8.1 pro on my desktop, Nokia Lumia 521 with cyan update. I have followed all instructions for remote users setup.&nbsp; I allowed remote connections, selected my account for access (did not have a remote desktop users) yet still get error 0x204.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also having issues installing Office 365.<br />
I've just formatted my ASUS laptop and installed WIN 8.1.</p>
<p>I've purchased the Office 365 (not impressed that I have to DL it and not have a CD to install for this either) and followed instructions to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot stream Office 365 </p>
<p>Error 404-4 </p>
<p>
</p><p>is the message.</p>
<p>I've downloaded the fixit tool and run it, rebooted. </p>
<p>Same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked for Office 2015 and deleted the folder.</p>
<p>I've even looked under Windows.Old and deleted the Office folder from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no further instances of Office on the laptop and I am STILL unable to install the wretched program.
<br />
<br />
very not happy.</p>

                    <p>Hello please post or reply with specific how to or when users might be able to merge or combine two seperate Skype accounts? And MS Support please do not reply to this post with your generic go to: support.skype.com/en
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That response just leads users down a rabbithole in the forum where this specific question is not answered and can be perceived MS support as being sadistic to its users. Just be honest, if you cannot combine please post so and if you can please let us know
 how to. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

            I get to my email through msn.&nbsp; I have checked my junk email features an set to exclusive.&nbsp; 5 days ago, my junk email was in the junk email folder and all the sudden a ton of junk email started showing up in my inbox .&nbsp; Junk email in my inbox I mark as
 junk then block after transferring to junk email.&nbsp; I haven't created rule but from my understanding, it only applies to that email when the each junk email is being sent from a different sender that have crazy, long email address.&nbsp; I add them to the blocked
 list.

            <p>My email was just fine until it was upgraded to "Outlook Mail"....now I'm inundated with junk mail in my Inbox also. I move the mail to my junk mail box and then click on it to "block senders". &nbsp;I've noticed that a fair amount of junk mail I've been getting
 is from senders I have unsubscribed from or blocked in the past. I'm kind of figuring that when Microsoft switched me to "Outlook Mail" it undid all the email subscriptions (or rather, unsubscribing) I had done with anyone I had email contact with in the past.
 I'm also noticing that even though I block email addresses/senders I am still getting emails from them - so obviously that feature isn't working very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be much happier switching back to my old email system. The only emails I received in my Inbox, then, were from people who were actually in my contact list and all other mail was automatically put in my junkmail folder. Seems these features don't
 work in the new email system.</p>

            Help, I have a similar problem. &nbsp;I have suddenly received over 20,000 (!!!) junk emails in the last few days in my Outlook/Hotmail account, which I generally access on the web! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
However, using the Exclusive filter is problematic for these reasons:<br />
1) I cannot get emails in my Inbox &nbsp;from people I do not know, and I cannot be sorting through 20,000 junk emails to add the senders/domain to the Blocked sender's list!&nbsp;<br />
2) This is especially a problem because I am a freelancer, and new clients often write to me about potential jobs.<br />
3) Perhaps I will not receive a reply in my Inbox to support queries like this one, and I cannot be sorting through 20,000 junk emails to find the reply.<br />
<br />
So<br />
1) Why am I suddenly getting all of these junk email?<br />
2) Why &nbsp;isn't Outlook properly screening these Junk emails in Standard mode or even before they reach my email account? &nbsp;I cannot spend the time to block thousands of senders!<br />
3) How can I stop all these junk emails from flooding my account?<br />
<br />
If this does not improve, I will have to switch to gmail.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>I have the same issue. I get atleast 30 - 40 junk emails on daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to mark them junk in 2 ways.</p>
<p>1. clicking on junk button</p>
<p>2. Go to options, junk filter and add the domain in the junk list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprising part is even after blocking the domain itself or the email, I have see junk still coming in the "inbox" from blocked domain/email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really annoying.</p>

<h2>            Minor Irratents&#58; Taskbar-Hide Problem Returns&#59; Unstable Screen Saver Persists</h2>
                    <p>Build 10066 has resurrected the Taskbar no-hide problem once more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the PC is shut down and later started, the screen saver resets to 1 minute wait.&nbsp; That shouldn't happen, but it has for several Builds.&nbsp; While these are rather minor problems, over time they become an annoyance.</p>

<p><span><span>Hey Kurtz77zap,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Another tool you could use is the AutoComplete function in Internet Explorer. This will remember the log in and/or password for your sign-in information. You can activate
 this by:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Tools</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Internet Options</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Content</strong> tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Settings</strong> under <strong>AutoComplete</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check the boxes for the areas you would like to use AutoComplete in</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also find third party tools that can type/paste this information in for you.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for your replay.</p>
<p>In mean time, before 2 weeks,&nbsp;I recovered completely Windows 10 and Office too.</p>
<p>Also, I followed your recommendation and today once again updated Office.</p>
<p>Now I have Office 2016 version 1702, Build 7870.2031.</p>
<p>I am glad that now there is not the subject problem.</p>
<p>It seems that problem is solved.</p>

    <title>rules icon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m in lajolla  say:</h3>
<h2>            rules icon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I set up the rule to forward a copy of certain incoming emails to an outside email and ran the rule for all messages already in the folder - received confirmed receipt.&nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; Thank you for your help setting this up.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BUT further emails were received into
 the specified account after and I'm told were not copied to the outside email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I note the icon in the rules line -&nbsp; "Actions" section - is a crossed hammer and ?(plunger?) with 3 dots under it - what's this mean?&nbsp; Is my rule not good?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also note that I already have a rule set up to take emails sent to this address account in my inbox&nbsp; to a specific folder to segregate these incoming messages.&nbsp; Could this be interferring with my "copy this message to outside email address"?&nbsp; If so, how
 do I fix?&nbsp; If not, any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The crossed hammer and wrench means that the rule has an action.</p>
<p>Rules can have effects on subsequent rules depending on the definition of the rule and the order of the rules.&nbsp; When a message arrives (or leaves) Outlook attempts to apply all rules to that message.&nbsp; Only if a preceeding rules contains the "stop processing
 more rules" action will that application of subsequentrules not happen.&nbsp; So, for example, if you have a rule that copies a message to a folder when you send it and another rule that Ccs the message to another address, both will happen when you send a message
 that matches whatever condition you specified on each rule; the message will be copied to the folder and also sent to the other address.&nbsp; However, if you have the "stop processing more rules" action on the first, the second rule won't happen and the message
 will be copied to the folder but the message won't be sent to the other person.</p>

            Your phone goes online to access map data. This is what you stop when you selelct not to go online<br />
<br />
However, it also goes online to access the AGPS server if you have ASPS activated. To disable AGPS, goto Tools&gt;Settings&gt;General&gt;Positioning&gt;Positioning Methods, untick Assisted GPS. The downside of disabliong AGPS is slower position fix when you start Nokia
 Maps.

            <p>WPS Office previously known as Kingsoft Office is not a Microsoft program. You should look to WPS for support and answers about how to use their programs. Don't confuse the WPS Writer for MS Works word processor files with *.wps file extensions.<br />
<br />
In case you did not know the personal basic version of WPS Office is free to use, but a watermark is printed on all printed output after the 30 day trial ends. You might want to consider these two alternatives if you don't want to use MS Works or Office:<br />
<br />
LibreOffice: <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.libreoffice.org/</a><br />
OpenOffice: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.openoffice.org/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Works and are talking about a Works word processing file then please explain in more detail what you are trying to do.

<p>
</p><p>I believe one of the limitations with editing the Timeline view is that you cannot change the date formatting for the timescale tick marks at the top of the timeline.&nbsp; You can modify the date format for the bars and callouts using the Date Format pick list
 button on the Format ribbon, but this setting does not change the timescale tick marks.&nbsp; I personally prefer to hide the timescale tick marks because of this limitation.&nbsp; The same limitation exists in Microsoft Project 2013 as well, by the way.&nbsp; Hope this
 helps.</p>

<h2>            Senders &#34;Display name&#34; is incorrect since Office365 migration</h2>
                    Hi there.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As per subject, ALL emails sent does so with a different "Display name" at the receiving end.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This happened since we migrated over to Office365 a few days ago.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Our standard is to only have the first name displayed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since the migration, this display name has completely gone haywire.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whereas before I received an email from Tom as only "Tom". Now, I'm receiving an email from "Tom Pollock &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;" Another user is receiving an email from Tom as "Thomas" so there is even a disconnect at the disconnect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How to I address this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing this is NOT going to be a client side issue and that the problem lies with Office365 but how do I address the problem there?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not that it matters but to follow is some details...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Lenovo laptops running Windows 7, 32 AND 64-bit.</div>
<div>- Outlook 2010 and Office365</div>
<div>- All laptops have up to date updates and Service Pack 1 installed for the OS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for reading</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            OneNote 2016&#58; Suddenly can&#39;t scroll in the sidebar.</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote 2016 for almost a year now, and everything has been fine. But recently I noticed I can't scroll in the sidebar/navigation anymore by using the mouse (I can scroll with the mouse in other applications). Arrow keys don't work either.
 Searched the options but did not find a setting. I also disabled all my add-ins and eventually did a full uninstall/reinstall with no changes. I've also run a manual OneNote update but that did not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on a fix? I can still use the scroll bar but the mouse scroll does not scroll through the navigation. I am on Windows 7 and I have always been.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I tried going back to my old mouse and still no difference. If I click in the sidebar then scroll it just scrolls the current note, not in the sidebar, but I swear this used to scroll in the sidebar.

</p><p>Please provide the following information so that we can isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Does the issue also occur in other Office 2016 applications (e.g. Word, Excel, etc.) on your computer?</li><li>Does the application freeze, which causes scrolling impossible?</li><li>Are there any error messages shown? </li><li>Were there any changes made on your computer before the issue started?</li></ol>

            <p>Hi JohnRod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Nope, I can scroll with the mouse just fine in Word and Excel. Also, in OneNote, scrolling works fine in notes themselves, but the right sidebar where it shows all your notes does not scroll when I use the mouse scroll wheel.</p>
<p>2. No freezing is happening.</p>
<p>3. No error messages.</p>
<p>4. None that I'm aware of. OneNote might have updated because I think automatic updates are probably turned on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note, I actually use Office 2010 applications with OneNote2016. I have been doing so without this issue occurring for many months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my OneNote version number in case it helps: 2016 MSO (16.0.7127.1026) 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>Hi JohnRod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I tried the quick repair to not avail. I was not able to start the online repair option. Microsoft said I had no internet connection despite having a perfectly fine internet connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did a sfc /scannow, it apparently repaired a bunch of corrupt files, searched log but nothing found for office or onenote, restarted and re-opened OneNote and the same problem is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get an older version of OneNote for free? I can't find anything online.
</p>
<p>

<p>I fixed it.</p>
<p>I went into the options area and put the "page tabs" on the left and voila, scroll is no problem now.</p>

<p>My OneNote 2013 has been recently upgraded to OneNote 2016 in Windows 7 environment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this has resulted in a non-working scroll bar for page tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue also occur in other Office 2016 applications (e.g. Word, Excel, etc.) on your computer? &nbsp;No, only OneNote 2016 (32-bit)</li><li>Does the application freeze, which causes scrolling impossible? No</li><li>Are there any error messages shown? No</li><li>Were there any changes made on your computer before the issue started? Yes, since successful upgrade from OneNote 2013 to OneNote 2016 in Windows 7 environment. No repair action needed.</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few factors why the scrolling sidebar on OneNote is not working as expected. For us to be able to isolate what is the cause of your error, kindly provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occur right after you upgraded OneNote 2013 to 2016?</li><li>Are you using any add-ins?</li><li>Have you tried to launch OneNote in safe mode and check if you will encounter the same issue?
<span>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application, press and hold the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> key and then double-click the application shortcut. </span>
<span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Yes</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in Safe Mode.</span></li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, we suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair the Office application</a></strong>. This will help

</p><p>I have not experienced this 'bug' for the first time in Windows 7 (64-bit). A clean Office 2016 installation also gives same scroll problems in page tabs. In my previous post with (GIF) animation, you could see that this 'bug' is also reproduced by others
 in x64 virtual environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my view, this scroll-issue should be reported as bug to the Outlook team.</p>
<p>Can you arrange that? Feedback hub is not available in Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Question&#58; How does OneDrive sync with multiple shared copies&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limitedwisdom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question&#58; How does OneDrive sync with multiple shared copies&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If a OneDrive for business user has shared a document with many people, and all of those people have sync'd that document to their PCs/Macs. What happens when two people make a change locally. OR what happens when someone makes a change online and someone
 else has made a change offline and then syncs the document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, my question is which copy takes precedence? Does it just refuse to sync the documents or is one of the two just overwritten?</p>

<p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>I would like to answer the scenario you describe about. All the Office files stored in OneDrive/ SharePoint will have a published version as a major version. In this scenario, the files stored in
 OneDrive for Business cloud will be consider as a major version. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, if any user have made conflict changes to the major version as you described. This user will be prompt to<span style="font-weight: bold"> save his file as a local copy</span> or<span style="font-weight: bold">
 discard the changes</span> he have made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have further concern regarding to this question. We will be here for help.</p>

<h2>            Disable Download in Excel Online &#40;or other Office Online apps&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We're trying to build an set-up in which employees can use Excel Online to work on spreadsheets that are located in the cloud, but the options for 'download a copy' are disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course a user could cut and paste and take screenshots- but we want to make it extraordinary for them to get local copies of the files. We want to keep all the files in the cloud and have users use Office Online to work on them/edit them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any reference to administration that lets us limit this ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there know how we could do this/can help solve this use case?</p>
<p>

<p>The setup has a choice to upgrade or new install. Be very careful. I suggest unplugging or current OS to install. I've seen to many that has lost their OS. Just a heads up. What&nbsp;U do is what yOu will do. I have&nbsp;said I told U&nbsp;so, lots in this preview.</p>

<h2>            Unable to download Quickoffice Premier V4.5 from N73</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am unable to purchase the Quickoffice Premier V4.5 via my N73.<br />
The download process bar does not show any sign of downloading.<br />
I want to get it via the HP instead of downloading it online cos<br />
its much cheaper via the phone.<br />
<br />
Anybody know how I can go about getting it?<br />
Can I get it installed at the service centers?

            The size of the file you are trying to download must be considered into account. Some network operators do not allow large files for downloads. You can check up with your operator regarding this issue.

    <title>Fix for Oops&#33; when calling on Windows 10 PHONE and UWP Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fix for Oops&#33; when calling on Windows 10 PHONE and UWP Windows 10 Desktop as of 01&#47;26&#47;2019</h2>
                    <p>This is a partial workaround for Skype on Windows 10 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>PHONE and UWP Windows 10 Desktop </strong></span>for crashing or Oops! We have detected an issue. Please exit and restart Skype.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e6604e5-d7d8-4c69-9666-c01bec472eac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e6604e5-d7d8-4c69-9666-c01bec472eac?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The issue: </p>
<ul>
<li>This issue is version independent and has been reported by many users here and in the Feedback App. It started for everyone after 01/26/2019. The cause seems to have nothing to do with a bug in the app itself. It seems to be caused when Skype<span>
</span>attempts to load lengthy call history. The crash occurs on incoming calls to a Skype Number, manually dialed calls to a phone number, selecting a contact or call history if there is more than one call in history. The app does not seem to crash for Skype
 to Skype contacts, chat or call history, or when making a Skype to Skype call.</li></ul>
<p>The workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>After you first open the app, select a call you know has a very short call history to a phone number. If you don't have one, make a call to a phone number elsewhere on a platform Microsoft cares about like your PC, IOS, or Android. This call history will
 load without a crash. All call histories after that will also load without a crash. Incoming and outgoing manually dialed calls will also continue to work. This seems to carry over even from day to day.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have passed this along to a T3 Support tech in Ticket SRX<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1459413974id</span> but I don't expect a fix as they seem to be unable to read ticket notes, have any knowledge about what Windows 10 Phone is, or follow along with what's
 said in a email. We're on our own after all, people</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 02/17/19</p>
<p>
</p><p>While trying to stop the crashing this morning, I found new information. I had to load a call made before 12/27/2018 to get the crashing to stop. When I checked my Skype 8.33.0.41 for Windows 10 Desktop, there is NO CALL HISTORY before this date. This version
 of Skype 8 has no call history before 12/27/2018 and calls since that date crash not only Skype 12.1815.210.0 UWP for Windows 10 Phone but also Skype UWP versions on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Oops! crashing is not a Windows Phone issue. It's a Skype UWP issue. I am aware the current version as of today is Skype 8.39.0.180 Application version 14.39.180.0. I installed it as a test. Call history is missing all over the place on this version.
 For example, it shows no calls between 12/23/2018 and 12/30/2018 on my account. I made 7 calls during that time and I can verify this not only on my phone but on my Skype Account call activity log.</p>

<p>I found this workaround to be hit and miss. I have found one that works every time. It only works for a few phone calls instead working around the bug until Skype is restarted.</p>
<ul>
<li>After opening Skype, take the device offline so cloud data is unavailable.</li><li>Click call history for the number or numbers you want to dial.</li><li>The call history will load and Skype will not crash.</li><li>Put the device back online and you can open those numbers successfully and call them.</li></ul>
<p>I'm not sure about answering calls that you've fixed in this way. I'll have to do some testing. The issue looks to involve something Microsoft changed on 01/26/2019 with Skype Number calling data. The app seems to hang when you click to view any chat or
 call data from history. After the first chat is loaded, consecutive chats load quickly. However, when the app loads Skype Number data, the app hangs after some or all the data is loaded and then crashes with the Opps! error or sometimes no error at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've submitted this via the Feedback Hub with step recording enabled but I don't think the Devs or Support will look at it since so few people are complaining that the only paid feature of Skype isn't working for all UWP users. It's the sad state of affairs
 that us users are swept under the rug. I say this because the call tracking bug for Skype Numbers still goes unfixed since November of 2017. That's right! 20 17!</p>
