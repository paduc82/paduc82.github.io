            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand you are facing issue in downloading pictures in Outlook. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we start with the trouble shooting steps, I have couple of questions for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say 'changed all of my settings to allow graphics and pictures to download' what are the settings that you made changes to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the following steps are tried in Outlook:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Open the Outlook window, click on File, Options, Trust Center, Trust Center Settings, Automatic Download and ensure that
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">"Don't download pictures automatically in HTML e-mail messages or RSS items"</span><span> is
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">not checked</span><span>.</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Open a message window in outlook (double-click a message to open a message window) and in that window repeat steps in #1 above</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Also from the opened message window, go to File, Options, Mail, Editor Options, Advanced and ensure that "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Show picture placeholders"</span><span> is
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">not checked.</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the pictures are showing as Red X in Outlook, then you may follow the steps from the below article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638687</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. If you need any further assistance reply and we will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Signing out of hotmail redirects to the wrong MSN page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ylwguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing out of hotmail redirects to the wrong MSN page</h2>
                    <p>When I sign out of Hotmail/outlook my IE11 browser used to go to the Canadian MSN web sit, ca.msn.com.&nbsp; For the last few weeks it always goes to the American MSN site.&nbsp; On my computer at work where I have IE10 when I sign out of Hotmail/outlook I still am
 redirected to the Canadian MSN site.&nbsp; Why does the IE11 browser redirect me to the American MSN site?&nbsp; How can I change this?<br />
</p>
<p>I submitted this thread on the Windows Live ID where a similar problem was posted but the Microsoft reply said to submit under IE11.&nbsp; I'm not convinced this is just an IE11 problem as others have posted about the problem stated above with other versions
 of windows and IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to being asked to resubmit my question&nbsp;in another Microsoft thread&nbsp;any reason why Microsoft couldn't resubmit my thread for me?&nbsp; It's like calling a help line and the operator transfers my call to the correct department.&nbsp; They don't ask you to
 hang up and call again.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue description and my research it seems that you have set home page as American MSN site, that’s why when you sign out from Hotmail account it takes you to American MSN page. So I would suggest you to set Canadian MSN site as your home page
 and check if it helps. You may refer to the steps provided below to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Internet Explorer.</li><li>Open the following link <a href="http://t.ca.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://t.ca.msn.com/</a></li><li>Click on Gear icon (Setting icon) at the right top.</li><li>Now click on Internet Options.</li><li>Then under General tab, click on Use current.</li><li>And under Start Up, select Start with home page.</li><li>Finally click on Apply and then OK.</li><li>Close the box and Internet Explorer.</li><li>Now try to open Hotmail account and then sign out and check the status.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have seen this suggestion posted in other threads when searching with google.&nbsp; In all of those other threads it was reported that this suggestion is not the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had more than one hotmail account for several years.&nbsp; My default Internet page has always been
<a href="http://www.google.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.ca</a>.&nbsp; Until recently when I signed out of hotmail I was always redirected to ca.msn.com even though my default IE home page was
<a href="http://www.google.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.ca</a>.&nbsp; I should not have to change my default IE home page in order for MSN to redirect to ca.msn.com as it was never required before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My default IE page at work is our local intranet site.&nbsp; For whatever reason, when I sign out of hotmail at work I am redirected to ca.msn.com.&nbsp; What changed with MSN so that my IE11 browser on my home laptop wants to direct me to
<a href="http://www.msn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.msn.com</a> when I sign out of the same hotmail account?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying and sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issue description it appears that your current location is Canada. msn.ca ("MSN Canada") is a domain controlled by five name servers at msft.net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MSN homepage is dependent on your current location. If you are browsing the Internet in Canada the default webpage for MSN will be MSN Canada.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when you log out of Hotmail.com, the web browser will automatically redirect you to local server which is MSN Canada.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I visited Hawaii last year but since that time I have only been using my computer in Canada so my original question is why Hotmail redirected me to the USA MSN page when I logged out instead of to the Canadian MSN page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange part is last week when I logged out of Hotmail I was redirected to the&nbsp;"MSN Canada&nbsp;for Windows 8" page &lt;<a href="http://t.ca.msn.com/?rd=1&amp;ucc=CA&amp;dcc=CA&amp;opt=1&amp;ocid=mailsignout&amp;tc=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://t.ca.msn.com/?rd=1&amp;ucc=CA&amp;dcc=CA&amp;opt=1&amp;ocid=mailsignout&amp;tc=0</a>&gt;.&nbsp;
 This is the page with the "tiled" look. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 on my laptop but am using IE11.&nbsp; When I click on a link it takes me to the news article.&nbsp; When I use the back arrow in the upper left corner it returns me to the MSN Canada page similar to the one&nbsp;that
 I used to get &lt;<a href="http://ca.msn.com/?rd=1&amp;ocid=mailsignout&amp;tc=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ca.msn.com/?rd=1&amp;ocid=mailsignout&amp;tc=0</a>&gt;.&nbsp; For reference, the page that I used to get is &lt;<a href="http://ca.msn.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ca.msn.com/default.aspx</a>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least Hotmail redirects me to some kind of Canadian MSN page now.&nbsp; No idea why it wants to take me the Windows 8 version of MSN Canada.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is good to know that now hotmail redirects to some canada MSN webpage. However, you may try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Close all Internet explorer windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Click Start and type regedit in the start search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click regedit in the programs list and click yes when user account control message appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In registry editor, navigate to the following registry key: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Interne Explorer\Main</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>e. On the right hand pane, right click "<strong>Default_Page_URL</strong>" and select "<strong>Delete</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>f. Similarly, <strong>delete "Start_Page_URL".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>g. Close registry editor and restart Internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

            I have been having this exact same issue for a couple of months now. It is happening on both Windows 8.1 AND my Win7 netbook.
<br />
<br />
Before whatever change happened in Outlook/Hotmail both of my computers were going to ca.msn.com when I signed out of my email. Now both are going to the American MSN page.<br />
<br />
I can tell through the little weather tab on the page that at least something on your system is detecting that indeed my computers are in Canada. (I have never traveled to the U.S.).
<br />
<br />
There used to be an option on the MSN.com page to set it so that ca.msn.com whenever you log out, but this option no longer exists.
<br />
<br />
I refuse to change my homepage to something I don't want it to be, and I am not going to go messing around in my registry. I don't think that is the issue. With so many people having this problem, I think it has more to do with your coding and the option to
 go to ca.msn.com being removed than it has to do with their computers. <br />
<br />
This also happening in both Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. <br />

            I found this thread as we have the same problem. I just wanted to add my comments about the above 'solution'. We are in Australia with the same problem, except instead of ninemsn.com.au it is now going to msn.com (ie US) when logging off from the Outlook
 account. I went into the Registers as per your post above. I found and deleted "Start_Page_URL", but I did not have one called "Start_Page_URL". There is one called "Start_Page" and given the warnings and it not being exactly as stated I wasn't brave enough
 to delete it. Please just confirm if this is the one I can delete. (Note: It is not on the computer I am using here, it is on the desktop). Thanks, CHW

<h2>            VBA code to copy Master worksheet Values and rename to current date then hide &#47; protect the sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm entirely new to VBA coding I'm creating a my first macro. This file is designed to keep track of 100+ individuals historical data. all work will be completed on one sheet called "Master"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the macro to copy values from "Master" and rename the copy with the current date. The following macro does just that although without any protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub BackupMaster()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worksheets("Master").Copy Before:=Worksheets("Master")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveSheet.UsedRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Value = .Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Name = Format(Date, "MMM-DD-YYYY")<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>I am unsure how to set up error protection, any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 other Quality of Life features I would like but are entirely optional.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Everyone knows that Excel has a 15 digit limitation when it comes to numbers, and that after 15 digits, it simply replaces everything with 0's. Most people should also know that changing the cell format to text alleviates this problem nicely. However,
 this is a patch, not a cure, and I'm having a big issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a list of product codes that are 20-25 digits long, and an inventory company that requires our inventory lists to be sent to them in a Tab Delimited format. This is the rub. I can view and manipulate our product codes in Excel by changing
 the formatting to Text, but when you convert to a Tab Delimited file, it strips all formatting. &nbsp;The numbers are no longer seen as text, and are converted to the 15 digit cut-off.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone know a work-around?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It's not the process of saving the data as a tab delimited file that does the<br />
damage.</p>
<p>If you open that text file in Notepad or your favorite text editor, you'll see<br />
the data is still very nice.</p>
<p>But depending on how you open the file in excel, you may see the damage.</p>
<p>I'd make sure that the tab delimited file is named *.txt (anything but *.CSV)<br />
and then open excel.</p>
<p>Then use File|open to open the text file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You'll see a wizard where you can specify the type for each field.&nbsp; Don't use<br />
General for these long numeric entries -- use Text.</p>

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics driver breaks Metro apps</h2>
                    The latest intel HD drivers (4098) that get installed through Windows Update make all Metro apps crash. Has anyone else noticed the issue? I can only fix it by going to the previous version, but Windows Update will update the derivers again on the next
 occasion.

 with build 9926 on SP3 and SP2 that I have been unsuccessful at fixing (rollback does not fix on those platforms).

<p>They should stop that driver coming through WU. As it stands it makes the computer unusable but there is no way to stop WU from reinstalling it.</p>

    <title>PowerPoint Slide Show - is it possible to show full screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthurfletcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Slide Show - is it possible to show full screen &#40;width&#41; with a page which is &#40;too&#41; long</h2>
                    <p>I am using PowerPoint to develop a design for my new website (I am not a web designer!) and I have set the page length to be longer than the width. &nbsp;When I use Slide Show, it shows the whole page with black borders at the sides. &nbsp;Ideally I want it to show
 full width so that you have to scroll to see all of the page. &nbsp;I have added hyperlinks etc. which emulates the way the web pages would work so it would be great if this were possible in Slide Show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to explain - this work process allows me to configure the navigation and functionality the way I want it so that the web designer can then do their thing and make it work as a website!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            If you have a rotatable monitor (not common, but they do exist), you can flip it 90 degrees and the show should fill the screen width. Otherwise, since this is just a mockup for the designer, I wouldn't worry about the slide show display, which you can't
 change anyway.&nbsp;

            How about outputting as a PDF? Viewing in a PDF reader you can set the window dimensions &amp; the zoom as you wish to emulate almost any behavior you want. The one consideration is whether the hyperlinks would be active.

            <p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's an interesting idea (and as a consequence I looked around for software which could do that) but you still need to view in 'edit' mode rather than full screen to get the full width long page effect that I was looking for. &nbsp;PowerPoint also allows me
 to add some animations (for example to emulate the mini slide show that many modern websites have on the home page, with hyperlinks).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I will just have to accept the limitation on page length/width - this has only become an issue since websites went from page-by-page to the long scrolling page which is now quite common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, much appreciated!</p>

    <title>iCloud and syncing worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colytonboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            iCloud and syncing worksheets</h2>
                    Given the issues people relate about calendars and iCloud I guess my question is redundant but just in case...................
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use and iMac at home and Macbook when travelling. Ideally I'd like my spreadsheets and documents up to date with each other and be able to use either machine to work on - with the syncing happening via iCloud. Is this a pipe dream? And does anyone have
 any easy work around suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            Well, so far it's a pipe dream even for Apple applications...
<div><br />
<div>Automatic sync'g via iCloud happens only between iOS devices. To sync an iWork (e.g., Numbers, Keynote) file with your Mac(s) via iCloud, you need to do it manually via the iCloud website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>MacOffice is not iCloud enabled, and AFAIK, MS hasn't announced its intentions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, you can certainly continue to automatically sync files between your iMac and MacBook via DropBox, SugarSync, SkyDrive, or iDisk.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Are you getting any error message or code? There have been reports similar to this with an error code of 0x1900101 or the Green Screen of Death (GSOD).</p>
<p>If this is what you are experiencing - Some people are having luck installing after an initial GSOD if they remove their SD card and other USB peripherals. Others turned off device installation settings to NO and the install completed.</p>

<p>No GSOD, only keyboard and mouse on USB, no 1900101 error code. This happens on 3 of my PCs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to post logs from the other 2 PCs as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: device driver installation is off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sidenote: since build 17025 Windows Update always tries to install Gen6 Intel VGA driver for my Gen4 CPUs (i5 4690K, i5 4200H, i3 4170), but the correct/same version drivers (for Gen4) are already installed. But I don't think that's causing the upgrade to
 fail.</p>

<p>All my posts are, only the screenshot is in Hungarian, but that doesn't add anything to this problem (the error code is the same).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I should mention that I can't switch to English language Feedback Hub while using Hungarian as the main language in Windows. Only links like above can I follow to write replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I tried an in-place upgrade from a self-made ISO, the exact error code is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xC1900101 - 0x40017</p>
<p>The update failed at SECOND BOOT phase during a BOOT operation. (that's a rough translation from Hungarian)</p>

 to IE. I can't explain it any simpler than that.&nbsp; How can I receive an error message when the program does&nbsp; not launch? Your last 2 fixes&nbsp; didn't work either.&nbsp; I am going to uninstall IE and reinstall and see if I can use it. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has been a while. Are you still experiencing the issue? If so, let's try to reset Internet Explorer and check if it will make a difference. Press
<strong>Windows key </strong>then type <strong>Internet Options</strong>. Click <strong>
Advanced </strong>tab &gt; <strong>Reset. </strong>Then<strong>, </strong>follow the prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Resetting Internet Explorer will remove all your favorites and customized settings.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            The error is caused by the Avery Label Wizard, which contains a programming error. You must remove the template that it installed. The template is typically named AVWiz12s.dotm, although the number may be different depending on which version of the wizard
 you installed.<br />
<br />
There are three possible locations to find the template:<br />
<br />
%appdata%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\STARTUP<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\STARTUP<br />
<br />
For the first one, paste the path into the address bar of the file explorer and press Enter, so the %appdata% part gets expanded to the proper place in your user profile.<br />
<br />
The last of the locations will exist only if you're running 32-bit Office on 64-bit Windows.<br />
<br />
Look in each place and delete the AVWiz file wherever you find it. Then restart Word.<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me give you some Tips to resolve the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Please note down the email settings first.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>**Note: Take the back up for the whole Registry by clicking on file and export it and keep the back up on the desktop.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>1.Open Regedit from Run(Window+R)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Locate outlook from all over the place.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Delete all Registry hives for outlook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Do a Full online repair from Control panel--&gt;Click on change on Microsoft Office Icon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            I am not aware of any way to prevent the prompt from displaying. If you want to try to convince a Microsoft product manager that there is a secure way to open a workbook with data connections so that the prompt becomes unnessary, please send a suggestion
 to Microsoft.

            It isn't that so much as the idea of keeping a data connection open to the server that isn't connected to anything. When you close the workbook, the server isn't connected to anything. There's no point in keeping server connections open on the odd chance
 that the connection will be re-used someday.

<p>I think you are missing the context of the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>whenever I open a spreadsheet which has a live data connection, Excel disables the connection and requires me to click on an "Enable Connections" button below the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I NEVER want to open the spreadsheet without refreshing the data - the whole purpose of the spreadsheet is to view the
<strong>latest</strong> data - there is no good reason I can see to NOT enable the connection automatically for me. MS obviously had a reason for NOT doing this, but it escapes me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You intimated in your original reply that you too felt it unlikely they could be persuaded to change, but you didnt explain why. But your 2nd reply talked about closing connections when the spreadsheet was closed. Which was not the original point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do you know why they have disabled the connections as the file is opened?</p>

<p>Enabling connections and refreshing data are independent actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing a workbook closes the data connection. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open a workbook that has a built-in connection you get the yellow Security Warning band about Enabling data connections to alert you that the workbook has a query that wants to connect to an external data source. Because Microsoft has been criticized
 in the past regarding security issues, they now display this warning and there's nothing you can do or say that will get them to change this behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to maintain the data connection, don't close the workbook. The connection will stay open as long as the workbook is open, at least as far as Excel is concerned. Network or other policies on your data source can terminate the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refreshing the data on open is controlled in the Data Connection properties. There's a Properties button in the dialog that asks where on the worksheet you want to place the data when you first bring your data to the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your data is in an Excel Table, convert it to a range. Then, right-click on your data set and choose connection Properties. You'll get a dialog where you can specify to refresh the data on open, set a schedule for refreshing the data, or choose to not
 refresh data on open.</p>

<p>Are you saying that even if I move my laptop outside the realms of the domain, the connection will remain open so long as I don't close the workbook?</p>

<p>But with my laptop thats unlikely to be the case. I work on workbook in my work environment during the day, go home and open my device there, and return to work the following day, and work on the workbook it is going to want to ask me the question again,
 isnt it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I dont understand why it thinks that it needs to. Other than the connection has been broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my point is that if I open that workbook, the act of opening it contains an implicit "and I want to reconnect to the data source"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what would be so wrong with embedding an explicit "And dont ask me again about reconnection" in the workbook?</p>

            The subform's record source doesn't allow edits. If you remove the PODetail table, it should work but that might not meet your needs. Your tables are joined by GRN and the GRN field is blank for all records in the PODetail table.

            I think you can display values from other tables using combo box columns. This would keep the form's record source editable with display of fields from other tables.

            I think your model is wrong.&nbsp; I think the GRNDetail table should model a many-to-many relationship type between PODetail and GRNEntry like this:<br />
<br />
POEntry---&lt;PoDetail----&lt;GRNDetail&gt;---GRNEntry<br />
<br />
The definitions of the latter two tables would be:<br />
<br />
GRNEntry<br />
….PO&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….GRNDate<br />
<br />
The table is 'all key', i.e. its primary is a composite one of the PO and GRNDate columns.&nbsp; You might wish to add an additional candidate key of GRNNumber or similar for administrative purposes.&nbsp; If so this column should be uniquely indexed.<br />
<br />
GRNDetail<br />
….PO&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….GRNDate&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….POD&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….QtyRec<br />
<br />
The primary key of the table is a composite one of the three columns made up of the two foreign keys, PO/GRNDate and POD, the former being a composite foreign key referencing the composite primary key of GRNEntry .<br />
<br />
A GRN can thus be raised in relation to quantities of one or more products per purchase order received on the same date.&nbsp; For data entry into GRNEntry and GRNDetail I would recommend that it be done independently of the purchase order form by means of a parent
 from based on GRNEntry, within which is a subform based onGRNDetails, linked to the parent form on PO;GRNDate.&nbsp; The controls in the subform would be a combo box bound to the POD column, set up to hide the bound column&nbsp; and show the Product name in the usual
 way, and a text box bound to the QTRyRec column.<br />
<br />
To raise a new GRN in relation to a purchase order a button could be added to the POEntry form to open the GRNEntry form at an empty new record, passing the current PO value to it as the OpenArgs argument of the OpenForm method.&nbsp; In the GRNEntry form's BeforeInsert
 event procedure the value of its OpenArgs property would then be assigned to a control bound to the PO column.<br />
