            Hi. djjjblawson 
<br />My name is Kyle and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />To Open files in Excel using Macros
<br />
<br />The macro that we will create will allow us to open excel files and if you do not remember the exact name the macro will give you a message and open the file explorer to look for it
<br />
<br />* First we must enable the developer tab and open the Visual Basic.
<br />
<br />* Then we will create a module, by right clicking on the toolbox in Visual Basic.
<br />
<br />* Next we will create our Macro which we will name as "open external file", then we will define two variables: file consulted and file open. The first variable will store the name of the file and therefore we will define it as String while the second variable will be the excel file to open and therefore we will define it as Excel.Workbook.
<br />
<br />Sub abrirarchivoexterno()
<br />
<br />       Dim archivoconsultado As String
<br />       Dim archivoabrir As Excel.workbook
<br />
<br />
<br />* The name of the file (the complete path of the file) will be written in cell C2 of the Excel sheet. That is why we will add to our Macro the location of the cell using Cells: consulted file = Cells (2, 3)
<br />
<br />* Then we will use the If function, so that if the path indicated in C2 exists, the file can be opened.
<br />
<br />
<br />* Now we will place the next part of the exercise, What would happen if the file we placed does not exist? In that case, we will use the if explained in the previous point so that if the file does not exist, we are asked if we want to search the file by ourselves. With this, the macro would look like this:
<br />
<br />
<br />archivoconsultado = cells (2,3)
<br />If Len (archivoconsultado) &gt; 0 Then
<br />         'Set archivoabrir =Workbooks.Open (''c:\Archivo1.xlsx'')
<br />         Set archivoabrir = Workbooks.Open ( srchivoconsultado)
<br />Else
<br />         responde = MsgBox (''El archivo no existe en esta carpeta'')
<br />         If responde = vbYes Then
<br />         miarchivo =Application.GetOpenFilename
<br />         Worksbooks.Open Miarchivo
<br />         End If
<br />En If 
<br />
<br />* As we see, we will add the variable "respond" which will be a message box. We will use Chr (13) to give a line break. In addition, the message will indicate the options Yes / No and an alert sign. If the answer is "No" the message will be closed. If "Yes" a window will open to choose the file you want.
<br />
<br />* Finally, in case there is an error when trying to open a file, we will add the line:
<br />
<br /> On Error Resume Next
<br />
<br />that add a line more which will avoid an error in case we give cancel the box

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/83e46b32-94c3-473c-917b-2cd84cbec489" title="muhammad.omer331">

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong><em> I want to change my Skype account's email address and remove all other accounts using that email. How can I do that?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A: You can change the primary email address of the second account to the email address you want by following the suggested steps&nbsp;below.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to <strong>My Account </strong>on the Skype website. </li><li>&nbsp;Scroll down to <strong>Account details </strong>and click<strong> Edit Profile</strong>.
</li><li>Under <strong>Contact details </strong>click <strong>Edit </strong>and make your changes.
</li><li>Select <strong>Set as primary email</strong> next to the address you want to set as your primary email</li><li>Do not forget to click <strong>Save</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this FAQ for additional details. <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA96/how-do-i-add-or-change-my-primary-email-address-in-my-skype-profile?q=change+email+address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>How do I add or change my primary email address in my Skype profile?</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong> that you have to close the accounts one by one. Closing a Skype&nbsp;account will close the associated Microsoft account as well, so be sure to check the things you need to consider before you proceed. You'll find the list on this FAQ.
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-account-for-skype?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>How do I close my account for Skype?</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp;an account has been marked for closure, there is still a <strong>60-day waiting period
</strong>before the account is completely removed from Skype's database. During this period, the account is still searchable on the directory but is considered inactive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this &nbsp;helps! Let us know if you need additional information or assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

 reply.<br />
<br />
I've already done that process mentioned above by you. The problem is when I try to login with&nbsp;<span>"</span><span>abc</span><span>" email address, following the example given in my
 question, it asks me of password for my previous account and not accepts the password of the latest account. Will it accept the password after deleting the old account? Another thing here just based on my curiosity, what will happen if I change the password
 of my previous account to latest account's password? With which account will I be logged in after providing same credentials associated with 2 different accounts?<br />
Thanks for your assistance.<br />

</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The scenario is&nbsp;two&nbsp;Skype accounts were created using two different email addresses, correct? Remember that the login credentials of a Skype account is the credential used to
<strong>initially </strong>create the account. With this in mind, even if you change the primary email address of the second account to the email address used by the first account, this will not change the way how you log in to the accounts. You will only change
 where the email notifications will be sent. This will not change even if you delete the first account, unless you'll change the sign-in preference of the second account to the email address of the first account.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><em>what will happen if I change the password of my previous account to latest account's password? With which account will I be logged in after providing same credentials associated with 2 different accounts?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Technically, even if you use the same password for the two accounts, they are still considered as two different accounts.

<h2>            Duplicate forwards from shared mailbox &#91;Solved&#93;</h2>
                    Hi everyone<br />
<br />
<p>We have a weird issue here with a shared mailbox.&nbsp;<br />
The mailbox (creditcontrol@) is accessible to 1 user internally, and has a forwarding rule on it.&nbsp;<br />
Each incoming mail is stored in the mailbox itself and is forwarded to an external partner (Icontroller).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is working fine when<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>external</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>mails come in.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
But when sending from an<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>internal</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>mail address to that creditcontrol shared mailbox, the mail gets forwarded twice.&nbsp;<br />
This happens only from internal addresses and both from Outlook and OWA.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>We are using Exchange 365 in the cloud and Messagelabs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other people experiencing the same problem? <br />
---------</p>
<p>Remark: I created a "test forward" shared mailbox on purpose, to duplicate the issue. Same problem with that one. So it is NOT related to the mailbox.
</p>

<p>Hi Sylvie. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for following up. <br />
However I'm happy to say that the problem is solved. <br />
Someone gave me the hint to check Message Trace in EAC. <br />
There I noticed all mails were sent to Exclaimer Cloud (signing). In Exclaimer Cloud mails to internal people were excluded.
<br />
I changed the Mail Flow Rule so mails to internal users are no longer sent to Exclaimer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason that did the trick. </p>
<p>No idea why this only affected forwarded mails, but... problem solved. Me happy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            How to specify the Global Address List as the &#34;default&#34; location to search in &#34;Contacts search&#34;</h2>
                    <div>
When you click on the Contacts Search button in Exchange, the drop down list for "in" should includes the global address list &nbsp;(example: "Default Global Address List (LDAP)". &nbsp; Unfortunately, Outlook 2011 defaults to using something called "&lt;my Account name&gt;
 Directory" that is not the same as the GAL (maybe it is a cached copy of it?/ &nbsp;In any case, for our site it returns fewer people than the GAL. &nbsp;I can't discern a pattern as to why unless my theory that is a cached copy of the GAL is correct.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Ideally if MS would actually allow a person to SET the default contacts search "in", I could at least have a work-around.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
We are using Exchange Server 2007.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts on this. &nbsp;Also why is there NO documentation on "Suggested Contacts" in Outlook 2011? &nbsp;It gives me the option to delete that folder but i've not tried because I'm concerned about how might get it back if I wanted it. &nbsp;Suggested Contacts is
 some type of "remember addresses" process. &nbsp;It does seem to be remembering anything in it (See Contacts and Suggested Contacts folder).</div>

            Discovered that another identity works. &nbsp; However, this is worse because the default is "All Folders" which as I learned should be more accurately stated as "All local Folders" (or this is a bug as well).
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Seems to be the solution for too many issues.
<div><br />
<div>Also I see that whatever "&lt;account name&gt; Directory" is in the drop down list to search "in, the name is NOT dynamically updated when the user changes the account name in the Tools / Accounts window.</div>

<h2>            Setup Error&#58; uninstall Office Single Image 2010 32-bit...</h2>
                    How can I uninstall Microsoft Office Single Image 2010 32-bit without affecting any other Office 2010 program performance (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, etc)?
<div>I am trying to install an evaluation version of 64-bit Office Professional 2013, but a setup error message states that I must uninstall the Microsoft Office Single Image 2010 32-bit program before Office Professional 2013 64-bit will install... &nbsp;I have
 gone through control panel/uninstall, search C:/, program file, and cannot locate a file by that name to "delete" it. &nbsp;Since I use my PC to work, I do not want to lose my current Microsoft Office Professional 2010 programs (The 2010 suite was pre-installed
 on my PC when purchased. &nbsp;I activated the suite with a key code; therefore, I do not have software to correct/re-install my current version if I lose critical files.)</div>
<div>I contacted support, but the program is in development stage and no phone support exists yet. &nbsp;I was instructed to post this inquiry.</div>
<div>Thank you in advance for your help.</div>

            Thank you for your insight. &nbsp;I did not save a data disc of the 2010 since I was able to access the entire download with my key code; I also backup regularly on my external hard drive. &nbsp;That eased my concerns about losing critical files - thanks again for
 that one.
<div>I had hoped the two (32-bit and 64-bit) could coexist, but I have had to install the 32-bit version of the program like you mentioned. &nbsp;I was able to customize the install to keep the previous version of Office, but I did lose 2010 Outlook. &nbsp;I did not,
 however, lose my calendar, which I updated earlier today without saving a backup. &nbsp;That was a relief! &nbsp;Kudos Microsoft!</div>
<div>I am already enjoying the updated interface and aesthetics of the 2013 suite and look forward to exploring them more. &nbsp;Once again, thanks.</div>

<p>Are you pressing the power button and selecting "lock phone" if so that is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not need to press the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the little slide switch on top of your phone to lock and unlock your keypad.</p>

            <p><strong><span>Well for everyone out there that has been trying to fix a no print or print preview problem with Internet Explorer I have found the answer to the problem. It’s a totally different fix not
 mentioned in any of the 100s of webpages I have been researching for over a month now. The most common fixs that DON’T work are listed below at least they didn’t work for me. Below them is how I fix it. I can’t believe that even Microsoft has no suggestions
 about this. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The dosen’t work section:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Scenario 1:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Your video card or video driver is outdated or corrupt.&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Note</span></strong></span><span>&nbsp;Outdated
 or corrupted printer drivers can also cause script errors when printing from Internet Explorer
<br />
</span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Scenario 2:</span></strong></span><span> You may not have printer permissions assigned<br />
</span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Scenario 3:</span></strong></span><span> Protected Mode is enabled for the Internet security zone of the web page<br />
</span><span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Scenario 4:</span></strong><span> There is an issue with temporary folders on your user account and the Low folder under the %TEMP% location has been
 deleted</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My long awaited fix for no printing on Explorer. This is for Win 7 32 bit but should work with 64 bit Explorer too. Finally something different to try. It just so happens that when Explorer installs
 it often fails to resister some of it’s DLL files. There are complicated ways to register DLL files but I and going to give you a simple way to do it. First open My Computer and go to “C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer” open up the folder “Internet Explorer”
 and click “type” to arrange the files by type. This puts all the DLLs together. Now double click on the first DLL. You will get an “open with” box. Click on “Browse” and go to “C:\windows\system32” and find the file called “regsvr32.exe”. Choose that file
 to open all DLL files. Now go back to the first DLL in the “C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer” folder and double click on it. You will probably get an error message that it can’t be found. This only means it’s already registered and operating. Double click
 each DLL one by one and you will start to notice that some will say “registration successful”. Finish them all in that folder. This may not work for everyone but for Gods sake, its something new to try and it worked great for me.</span></p>

                    <p>&lt;<em>Moved from Windows 7 | Programs</em>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Negative integers on the vertical axis to create a bar graph. &nbsp;However I need the lower integers to appear at the top of the graph and the higher integers on the bottom. &nbsp;I know I can reverse order but I would like the bar graph to be upright
 and not upside down ( I know this is the native way excel would like to display this) I am wondering if there is a simple way to do this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>then in the options for the Vertical axis, you can set where the horizontal axis crosses.&nbsp;&nbsp; I specified -120 for this Chart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can control what the top and bottom y axis values are with the min and max settings I would imagine although I didn't try changing those. &nbsp; I didn't alter anything but where the horizontal axis crossed so I would expect other settings to work as designed.&nbsp;

    <title>Page numbering screwed up in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindleyf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page numbering screwed up in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I have a long technical document. I have a very simple desire: I want the pages to be numbered, with the number in the center at the bottom of each page, starting from 1 and counting up.</p>
<p>However, this appears to be too much for Word. Despite my best efforts----and I'm usually pretty good at coercing software into doing my bidding----Word cannot seem to figure out how to count. It has the first page marked as 1, and then several more pages
 marked as 1, and then a page marked as 3.....I stopped reading at that point.</p>
<p>Under Insert -&gt; Page Numbers, I tried adjusting the formatting to say "continue from previous section", but that didn't help.</p>
<p>I suspect it has something to do with the "Sections". The first page's footer is marked as "Footer - Section 1". The second page's footer is marked as "Footer - Section 5". I have no idea why the second page is suddenly Section 5 or how to change that, but
 it seems likely that's related to the numbering problems. None of the intuitive things like right-clicking on the words "section 5" have allowed me to do anything about the section number.</p>
<p>Any insights would be greatly appreciated. And Microsoft-----please stop trying to cram features into your programs to the point where simple tasks become difficult.</p>

            <div>Section breaks can be "Continuous," which means that a new section begins in the middle of a page. The headers and footers for these sections are not accessible, but the Page Number Format settings within the sections can affect the headers/footers in
 subsequent sections. You need to correct the page numbering problems where they start, which is in those "landlocked" sections.

<h3> wozzum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages not showing in my inbox for Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2010. I have 3 separate email addresses linked to it. Since 2 days ago I have never had an issue with Outlook but all of a sudden one of the email accounts is not showing any incoming messages. I have checked on the hotmail account and
 the messages are going into the inbox but they are not showing in Outlook. The other 2 email accounts linked with the address are working fine. I have just tried sending a message from the account that is not showing inbox messages and it sent without a problem
 so it is only incoming mail that seems to be the problem. Also, strangely, 3 emails come through on it in a 10 minute spell yesterday morning but there were about 50 emails before that didn't come through and there have been about 100 since. Any help would
 be appreciated.

            <p>Alas, I don't know what to suggest.&nbsp; The Outlook Hotmail Connector is arcana and no one but the developers knows what may go wrong and how to address it.</p>
<p>If I were in your shoes, I might try posting a comment on the Hotmail Facebook page (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/Hotmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/Hotmail</a>) and on the Outlook blog (<a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/default.aspx</a>).&nbsp;
 The developers do see the latter.&nbsp; I'd probably comment on this post: <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2011/07/07/https-support-added-to-outlook-hotmail-connector.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We appreciate your time responding back to us with the information that we need. Using Outlook at the same time on different platforms or devices could cause this error message to pop up since you also mentioned that you've configured your account with POP.
 Make sure that your account is not being logged in on a different device while you're using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to log into Outlook.com through a web browser. Once successful, you can add your SingNet account from there and try to log into Outlook 2016 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed. </p>

<h2>            Windows Phone disabled for 137 853 minutes...</h2>
                    Hi community,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I currently facing a very annoying problem.</div>
<div>Few minutes ago, I tried several wrong passwords combinations on the unlock screen.</div>
<div>So, in a result, my Lumia 925 has been disabled for a minute (after 5 wrong combinations).</div>
<div>One minute later, I tried another wrong combination (don't ask me why, I typed numbers so mechanically), and my phone has been disabled for 2 minutes this time (1 min, then 2, 4, 8, .... geek stuff :D).</div>
<div>So I decided to shut down my phone and turn it on again.</div>
<div>But surprise here, the date has changed !!</div>
<div>Actually, we were October 23rd 2013, and then my phone's date moved to July 20th, so mysteriously...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d8447df-1743-4b11-854c-8aa2fea1cb40" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Phone's disabled, try again in 137853 minutes (and see how sad I am) !</div>
<div>So now, as you can see, my phone is locked and disabled for a long long time (until October 23rd in fact).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm wondering about this issue, if there is any solution (get back to the right date for example) avoiding me to hard reset the phone (and reconfigure all applications and parameters...)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for reading this special situation, and hopefully for your help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />

            Hi again !
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your replies, but unfortunately, I had no choice, I had to do a restore of my phone...</div>
<div>The good point is that's not a full factory reset, so I quickly recovered all my parameters, contacts, applications and others settings with my Microsoft account :)</div>

    <title>Freaked Out With Inability to Sign in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielnwagugbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freaked Out With Inability to Sign in</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, I must say I am not happy at all with&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;or maybe its&nbsp;not&nbsp;from them.</p>
<p>I had an email account I made use of with skype, and for two hours now I have been trying to&nbsp;log in&nbsp;with that account, but it says the account is not&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with any&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;account.&nbsp;Meanwhile, this was the account I normally used for signing in for
 years now. Secondly, I tried logging in with my username which almost all my friends have, and t keeps telling me that the password is wrong. I had to try all the passwords I use for logging in to my online accounts yet all to no avail.&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;the email is not
 related to any&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;account, but since when did it become a must to use a&nbsp;microsoft&nbsp;account to&nbsp;login&nbsp;to&nbsp;skype.&nbsp;Okay&nbsp;I finally opened a new&nbsp;microsoft&nbsp;account with that email, and logged in, only for them to show me a new skype account. This is quite infuriating
 and very annoying. I almost broke my PC out of annoyance just now. What the hell is wrong with&nbsp;skype&nbsp;for crying out loud? or was my account&nbsp;hacekd&nbsp;and email removed? I am yet to understand all this nonsense. Please if you have experienced this before kindly
 let me know as I am very angry at this whole system. WOuldn't make sense having a new account coz that's my business line and most of my clients are there. Any&nbsp;remedy&nbsp;please? Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi there, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I know how you feel about this. There are ways to recover your Skype account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before the migration, users can customize Skype Name. If you have one, please sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For password issues, please reset your Skype account password on this <a href="https://login.skype.com/recovery?application=account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>In the event that you do not have access to the registered email address needed for password reset, please answer the online recovery form on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>. The information that you’re going to provide will be reviewed by Microsoft accounts specialist and will be sending you a reply within 24 hours.

</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>My device is Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE, updated to Windows Phone 10.</p>
<p>Is there any option to set the correct volume level of my bluetooth handsfree?</p>
<p>The headset is Nokia BH-112U and there are not hardware button to set the volume level that I want.</p>
<p>When I'm talking, I can't hear almost nothing. I need to set the volume up, but on WP10 I can't see that option.</p>
<p>When I press the volume up button on the phone it displays "In call - 10" (volume max).When I'm using Windows Maps navigation and when the voice navigator is talking, if I press the volume up button then the option is avaliable - on the phone screen "bluetooth
 volume level". When I set it to max avaliable then I can hear better when talking with someone and everything is OK.</p>
<p>The bad thing is when I disconnect the Nokia BH-112U device, and connect it again later the sound setting is not saved and volume level is low.</p>
<p>Can someone to give me advice what can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>May be Microsoft developers must add this option on the sound menu, when bluetooth headset is paired to device?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excuse me if my english is not good :)</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue in regards to getting my Lumia 640 LTE upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 version 1607. Now the sound via Bluetooth headset is so low I can not even hear music or phone calls. The problem appears to be the equalizer. When Bluetooth
 headsets are paired the equalizer is turned off and set to a default low volume and can NOT be changed until blue tooth is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All sounds are low and completely inaudible from volume setting 1-24 is impossible to hear. Only when you get to volume setting 25-30 can you hear any music. This was not a problem running Windows 8.1 two days ago!!! It is not my headset and it is not the
 phone itself <strong>IT IS THE NEW VERSION OF WINDOWS 10 v1607 for Mobile!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Millions of Lumia's will need to get patched now that the Mobile version of Windows 10 is available for them. The OS for mobile looks great but if I can't hear my calls or music while with a Bluetooth headset&nbsp;(80% of what I use this darn thing for) then
 what is the point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Equalizer is under Extras &gt; Equalizer. I believe this to be the culprit and we need a software patch ASAP!!!</p>

            <p>Hello, similar issue with L950 using Maps App with Bluetooth media playing at normal volume. The sound apparently is nowhere to be heard when the Directions are supposed to come through. However, if I am listening to radio rather then Bluetooth, on the car
 audio, the sound for directions comes, through, albeit a bit too quiet. It does have to be adjusted compared to Bluetooth audio level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please resolve the levelling in the different situations. Thank you.</p>

            The bluetooth volume can be set at maximum 19/30. &nbsp;I want 11/30 of the money I spent for this, ehm, "phone" &nbsp;back.

            Uninstall the equalizer app and volume returns to normal.
