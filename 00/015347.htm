<h2>            URGENT - Nested Vlookup If multiple conditions and multiple sheets</h2>
                    <p>I have a data column B&nbsp;for which I am looking the values in 2 other sheets. I need to create a Vlook up table that goes to the first sheet (E), and only if it cannot find the value then go to the second sheet (R); If the value is not found in either sheet
 then leave blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the following formula and it seemed to be working but I have realised that the values the values that&nbsp;I am receiving do not match the values on the other sheet.
</p>
<p>=IF(VLOOKUP(B2:B43,E!A3:C795,2)&lt;&gt;" ",VLOOKUP(B2:B43,E!A3:C795,2),VLOOKUP(B2:B43,'R'!A3:C1555,2))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!! Many thanks in advance!</p>

            Well... seeing as how its urgent, try,
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP($B2,E!$A$3:$C$795,2,0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP($B2,'R'!$A$3:$C$1555,2,0),""))</div>
<div><br />
<div>... which looks up B2 in the current sheet within the <i>E</i>&nbsp;sheet's A3:A795 range&nbsp;and&nbsp;returns the&nbsp;corresponding&nbsp;value in the B column (exact match required). If it is not found, it tries again in Sheet
<i>R</i>'s A3:A1555 range and returns the corresponding value &nbsp;from column B if an exact match has been met. If neither have been accomplished, an empty string (e.g.
<i>nothing</i>) is returned.<br />
<br />
That formula can be <i>filled down</i>&nbsp;as necessary.<br />
<br />
If only columns A and B are to be considered, I don't know why you are referencing column C, but perhaps you need the the static range reference for an additional lookup.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Addendum:</i>&nbsp;if you were planning to use a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;formula to pickup the values in column C, use this instead:<br />
<br />
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP($B2,E!$A$3:$C$795,COLUMNS($A:B),0),IFERROR(VLOOKUP($B2,'R'!$A$3:$C$1555,COLUMNS($A:B),0),""))</div>
<div>... which can be <i>filled</i>&nbsp;both <i>right</i>&nbsp;and <i>down</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It may be of worth to note that the supplied formula uses IFERROR() which is proprietary to Excel 2007/2010. If the workbook needs to be used in previous versions of Excel then an IF(ISERROR())&nbsp;conversion&nbsp;should be used. Post back if this is required.</div>

<h2>            Outlook.com keeps moving all emails from one person to junk incorrectly</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope someone can help as this is so annoying. Outlook.com keeps moving all emails from a single person to junk, over and over again. His domain is gmail. I keep marking the emails as not junk, I have added him to the safe senders list, I have checked
 my blocked senders filters and rules and there is nothing that should move his emails to junk but it keeps happening. I even made a rule to move his emails to the inbox but it doesn't work. Every single time I move his emails manually outlook.com will have
 moved them back into junk again next time I check.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why? How do I stop this?</div>
                </div>

<p>It can be confusing to figure out the reason why the emails&nbsp;from a safe sender with whom you have specifically created a rule to automatically move the messages to your Inbox are still moved to your Junk folder. We'll assist you on this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to ask for you and your contact's email address&nbsp;that was affected by the issue so we can start an investigation on our end. We have initiated a private message tab where you can post the information requested.
The red link for the private message should be found above your post after you have signed in to this page. Only you and the moderators of this forum can access that private message tab so you need not to worry about your account‚Äôs security.</span></p>

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/SmartScreen-Filter-frequently-asked-questions-IE9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SmartScreen filter</a> is not contributing the issue. Try turning it off then ask your contact to send you a test email to see if the issue will persist. Don't forget to turn it back on afterwards, to avoid any security issues.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have replied to your message with the two email addresses.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have found that if I move the emails into a folder within the inbox manually then outlook.com no longer moves them back into junk. Obviously this step is not ideal as I need to keep moving them myself and keep checking junk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I don't think I have Smartscreen as I don't use IE.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<div>I see that you've tried moving them to your Inbox manually and you mentioned it was not longer being moved back to your junk folder. I've also made some adjustments in your account. You should be able to receive emails from the said sender or any of your

 to NOT decide what is junk, and what isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an email asking me to verify my email, and another email from same business. The verification email was sent to junk, but the other wasn't. This has been happening frequently. I just want all mail to go to inbox, I can train Outlook on my pc to

<p><span>Hi Kishore Anbu,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your post, there might be some corruption on the user‚Äôs mailbox, to further look into the issue, please check following methods.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Because a user who use an Exchange mailbox will synchronize their mobile device to &nbsp;the Microsoft Exchange server, to test if the problem is a potential server-side issues, I suggest that we first try disconnecting
 the issue account in all applications and device(such as Outlook client\Windows email applications\ Outlook mobile client) , then use the issue account sign in</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span><span>the Exchange online mailbox via <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?realm=M365x287790.onmicrosoft.com#exsvurl=1&amp;ll-cc=1033&amp;modurl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 again in Outlook client. </span></p>
<p><span>2.Please check whether the corrupted emails persists in OWA light version:
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/?layout=light" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://outlook.office.com/owa/?layout=light</span></a>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to understand the issue more deeply, we need to confirm the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span>1.When did the problem occur and how long did it last?</span></p>
<p><span>2.Which kind of server does the user use, on premises Exchange server or O365 server?</span></p>
<p><span>3.May I ask if the issue happens to all emails the user wanted to delete or just a particular ones?
</span></p>
<p><span>4.What specific steps did the user do to delete these messages? For example, delete form Inbox but it returned, delete from Deleted Items but it returned again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to your reply.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hello Jennifer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to move the Email from Deleted Folder to another Folder even the same issue. After the refresh the screen the deleted items are back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have enabled the Litigation Hold enabled for all the user in the organization. But only to particular user this issue is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Delete Items total 400 emails are there. If I have deleted 100 email from the OWA / After I have refreshed the page the deleted items count is increased to 400 items.</p>

<p><span>Hi Kishore Anbu,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, please double check if you have disconnected all device before you try to delete emails from OWA.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I need to confirm with you again: Do you see any error message when you delete the affected emails?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my research, if you receive a "Message store has reached its maximum size" error, it is caused when the Recoverable Items folder of user‚Äô mailbox have exceeded the default quota about 30GB, which
 may prevent user form deleting items. If you received this error, please try following steps: Open Outlook client &gt; click Deleted Items &gt; under Home click Recover Deleted Items form Server button &gt; choose Purge Selected Items.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, please kindly provide us following information for us to further analysis your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1.Please check if there any retention policy applied to the user mailbox?</span></p>
<p><span>2.Provide us a screenshot of error message if you received.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>Skype for Business Status not showing up when display is scaling to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iancarlson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business Status not showing up when display is scaling to 175&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Recently received a new machine, running Windows 10 (HP Spectre X360) and I am having a problem with the display scaling and Office 2016, specifically Skype status in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine has the QHD display, so I usually have it set to 175% for easy reading. Everything works great, except the scaling screws up the Skype status inside Outlook when opening an email. The names show up, and if you hover over them you can see the status,
 but for names that are on the to: line for example, no color boxes showing status at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch down to 150% it works great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Know issue/bug - workaround other than set at 150%?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi JY8866,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to modify the name of the default channel "General" in Teams. Regarding this feature, you may submit feedback in
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/18968953-rename-general-channel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rename General channel of Teams UserVoice</a> where the product team monitor the request of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create a new channel as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

    <title>Cannot leave Insider Program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biofan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot leave Insider Program</h2>
                    <p>I'm have a Surface Pro 3 and am on Insider Preview build 14986.rs_prelelease.161202-1928.</p>
<p>First I could not update the preview build to the next one, 150xx. I tried to update 3 times, and both 3 times the install (not the download) was stuck at 22%. I left it overnight and it will just not go past 22%. So I'm so tired of this insider build and
 am trying to leave it.</p>
<p>But Microsoft won't let me. I did as suggested by the forum, I went to settings - update &amp; security - windows insider program - stop insider preview build - and click "Need to stop getting insider build completely?" and it just went to a forum of how to
 leave the insider program, which also is just telling me to do what I just did.</p>
<p>There is no option for me to confirm to leave the insider program, nothing.</p>
<p>This is getting frustrating, since I can't upgrade the insider preview but also can't stop the insider preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to insider.windows.com and choose to leave the program from there. But is it enough? Will my SP3 restore to the next production build?<br />
</p>
<p>Anyone please help.</p>

<p>There is a well published method on how to leave Insiders.&nbsp; You must do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Microsoft and download the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; You will lose your installed apps but will have the option to keep your personal files/folders and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; do this often.&nbsp; Just download to Drive C and hit Setup.</p>

            <p>It looks like you are in a tight spot but&nbsp; Insiders with Surface Pro devices have had this problem more than any other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution has always been to remove the SD card for Surface Pro devices that stop the update at 22% and then the &nbsp;install would finish the way it is supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may have changed with the later builds. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It also sounds like you might have so many apps on your device that there is not enough free space on the internal drive so it might not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders should know how to create a backup of there device on something like an external SSD. They cost much less than your&nbsp;Surface Pro did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could remove enough stuff to make room for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a simple search for your problem in the search box on this Page all I typed in the search was Surface Pro 22% and this is the first link that came up.</p>

<p>No, you can stop Insiders and just sit on the side lines until the next major public build.&nbsp; That is how we did it with the Anniversary build.&nbsp; I&nbsp;dropped 1 of my 2 insiders at that time.&nbsp; I also used the Insider ISO to feed the other members of the fleet&nbsp;with
 what was really the Anniversary build. &nbsp; Let's hope history repeats itself here too.</p>

<p>That's the issue, I can't find the setting to "sit out". It only let me stop receiving for 7 days or less, then it will resume back on it's own. There is no option to let me stop the build completely.</p>

            Surface devices have been a big issue since people have been installing Preview/Builds on them, it is all over the forums about removing the SD card and anything else plugged in a USB or media slot even undocking if you are using a docking device and I
 agree about it being a MS device not sure if it was designed by MS or it just has MS as a name.

<p>Is this what you are referring too?&nbsp; You can down grade to Slow and there should be a setting that keeps&nbsp;you not too far beyond public build.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just not aware of the time frames allotted when you want to "sit out".</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert object causes documents to freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to insert an object into both powerpoint and word, and I have issues I have not seen before with previous versions of word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In word, sometimes I would have the document freeze. Sometimes I would be able to insert the document as an embedded object, but it somehow would not recognize it was a word document, and it would insert that goofy looking generic box symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a powerpoint I am working on, I was trying to insert an object, and the powerpoint completely froze. I restarted my computer, and when I went to open the file, I received a message that said I needed to repair the file. I clicked repair. The next message
 stated that Powerpoint could not read some of the file. The entire 2nd slide where I inserted the object was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Help is no help, because it is telling me to insert the object as I have just done. It doesn't suggest that I am doing anything wrong.
</p>

<p>Hi Erica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We need to determine the reason why you are having issues inserting objects into your PowerPoint and Word application. With that said, we would be gathering additional information to have a better view on this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this concern?</li><li>Aside from repairing the file, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>When did you notice this issue?</li><li>Is this happening on a single object that you are trying to insert?</li><li>Have you tried inserting different objects?</li><li>Have you tried inserting objects in other Office applications aside from Word and PowerPoint? If so, did you experience the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we advise performing an online repair via <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Kindly follow the instructions found on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Desiree</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the responses to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I did not make any changes to my computer</li><li>I did not do any other troubleshooting steps</li><li>I noticed this issue happening in the past week or two on powerpoint and in word. I have tried inserting a different document in powerpoint and I had to try to insert multiple different documents (usually pdf format) into a word document. I was getting
 freezing while doing this in word as well, but eventually the object showed up, but it showed up as a very weird icon.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I will repair office later when I am not at work, and I will let you know how that goes.

    <title>Login freezing using Chrome browser and Yammer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markkaizik6353  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login freezing using Chrome browser and Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having issues with using Chrome browser and Yammer online. &nbsp;When I log out of an account on a computer, it still recognises me as logged in when I next want to open Yammer on that computer. &nbsp;Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, but we have a few different
 people that use the same computer so this is a big issue for privacy of course as they are being logged into my home screen immediately. &nbsp;Sometimes, the [age freezes and tries to connect to yammer (you can see the template of the home screen in the background
 so I'm assuming it's about to go back to my login but it doesn't get that far).</p>
<p>I never choose to have Chrome save my password for Yammer online, so it's not something I'm prompting it to do; however, the only way to clean up the error is to close the window, open a new window for another site, go to Chrome Settings and clear all browsing
 data (which includes saved logins and passwords). &nbsp;Only then will yammer allow a login as another user. &nbsp;Once logged in, however, the same issue of not being able to properly log out occurs so I need to clear browsing data again.</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark.</p>

<p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>If there are multiple users on a single computer, I recommend using incognito mode in Chrome (InPrivate browsing when using IE). This should prevent the browser from storing information including login credentials. You can access incognito mode by launching
 Chrome then hitting Ctrl+Shift+N.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I force deploy a custom template and color palette to all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpalmedo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I force deploy a custom template and color palette to all PowerPoint users on Mac&#39;s and PC&#39;s&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently created a custom PowerPoint template in Office 2016 using custom color palettes and custom chart and pie templates. In order for all of the settings to work without issues it's important for all employees to install the proper files on both Mac
 and PC. This includes the listed files below, which need to be installed in very specific places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Color chart.xml</p>
<p>Column chart.crtx</p>
<p>Pie chart.crtx</p>
<p>Template.pptx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easy way to deploy these across an entire enterprise and have the custom template be the default? If not what would be the solution to ensure that no matter who uses the template on any OS the formatting and color palette will remain the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I would put custom colors into a color theme (if the colors will be applied to Excel or Word documents) or in the presentation theme if they will only be used in PowerPoint. If you have up to 10 colors, you can use PowerPoint to create the colors theme.
 If you have more than 10 colors, please see my tutorial at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2015/06/xml-hacking-custom-colors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XML Hacking: Custom Colors</a>&nbsp;to add extra colors to the palette.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if your users are on earlier versions of Office than you, you must test your files on those earlier versions before distributing them. New versions can always open files from older versions, but the reverse is not always true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve Rindsberg's page tells you how to set a presentation as the default:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ01010_Create_your_own_default_presentation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create your own default presentation</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have multiple files, I create an installer using PowerPoint VBA. The advantage to creating an Office installer using an Office program is that it's easy to find the locations on any computer for the templates and chart templates, even if they've been
 customized by the user. However, creating such an installer from scratch is not a trivial task, so I reserve that for the big clients with deep pockets. Without using an installer, you'll need to write comprehensive installation instructions that include file
 locations for all the different versions your users are on.</p>

<p>morning,</p>

<p>we have an issue with a client today that has problems with the below screenshot;</p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c8c04989-d609-4df7-bdec-a15cfee34274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc8c04989-d609-4df7-bdec-a15cfee34274" /></a></p>

<p>i have ran through the forums and uninstalled the kb3114504 as instructed in another thread. after restarting the machine the kb no longer exists but we are still receiving the error. upon clicking ok - excel loads fine and appears to work ok, however, this
 is not a solution that can continue.</p>
<p>can you please let me know of a timescale on a resolution to this and whether anything can be actioned in the interim to stop it happening?</p>
<p>safe mode does not initiate the message, however we require add-ins so this is not workable.</p>
<p>this relates to office updates that installed today, so is a direct relation to your updates.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<h2>            Adding Outlook 365 Account to Outlook 2016 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I recently updated to Outlook 2016 and Windows 10. Also my email provider recently migrated from Apptix - Exchange 2010 to GoDaddy - Outlook 365. (GoDaddy bought Aptix)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging into outlook 365 all emails appear correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed all account profiles through control panel mail. I then re-added the email account through auto-discovery (this took quite some time, longer than on other machines.) Once the account information was confirmed, I started up outlook. Once it loaded
 it continued to display information from the old email account, which stopped receiving new emails earlier in the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done these same steps on 3 machines running outlook 2013 on windows 7 and one machine running outlook 2013 on Windows 8.1, they worked perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on performing a fix for this? I saw some stuff on editing the registry to speed up the auto-discovery, but not sure if that is the right route to take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information or tips would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3> tex from texas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best Practices for sharing graphics using Onedrive&#47;Sharepoint for external websites</h2>
                    <p>We have a need to host images that are used by our company for various social media sites.&nbsp; Basically, we need to link to images stored internally, but hosted externally with anonymous view permissions using a link directly to an image.<br />
<br />
Basically, if I have a bunch of images in a graphics repository on a sharepoint site, how would I make that accessible using a link to anyone externally?&nbsp; I've turned on anonymous access using the SharePoint Admin on the portal, but still don't see an easy
 way to just have a link to the image that I can easily share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at Onedrive as well and have made anonymous access available but don't see an way to make those images accessible from sites using just a link to each image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I maybe barking up the wrong tree here, but it seems like this should be an easy thing and viable thing to do with SharePoint or OneDrive via Office 365.</p>

<p>Hi Tex from texas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume your requirement is to share items with external users using guest link. So, they can see the item without signing Microsoft or work/school account. If my assumption is correct, below are several articles for your reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-external-sharing-on-or-off-for-SharePoint-Online-6288296a-b6b7-4ea4-b4ed-c297bf833e30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn external sharing on or off for SharePoint Online</a>&nbsp; (This article is for
 turning on external sharing. The key steps are 1. turn on external sharing in tenant level 2. Turn on external sharing for site collection level. If it's a site related to Office 365 group, you may need to user SharePoint Online PowerShell to change the sharing
 ability)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-sites-or-documents-with-people-outside-your-organization-80e49744-e30f-44db-8d51-16661b1d4232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Share sites or documents with people outside your organization</a></p>
<p>(The key steps here are selecting the image, click Share&gt;Copy the link for guest link)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5422d9ed-0a3a-4b9f-81a1-b4615ef639b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5422d9ed-0a3a-4b9f-81a1-b4615ef639b1" /></a></p>
<p>If you already use these steps and the requirement is to open the image directly in browser, based on my test, the behavior is related to browsers. Edge can directly open the image in it, but IE, Chrome will download the image rather than directly open it.
</p>
<p>

            The ability to conference call is a network feature.<br />
<br />
Contact your network and they will enable the service on your phone, if the network supports it. Make sure you check out the call costs before using it.<br />
<br />
Googling your network and conference call may give you some info too.

            Ask them how to make the call or google it. Surprised they enabled it without telling you how to make the call!<br />
<br />
It's a network function, not a phone feature so you'll need your network to tell you what number to call to set up the conference call.<br />
<br />
Chances are the details will be on your networks website.

<p>I'm not sure which version you're accustomed to using (Microsoft never produced an "Office 2014"), but the basic procedure for creating Labels really hasn't changed in recent history, regardless of whether printing a single label or doing a merge to labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your brief description it sounds like the problem simply may be that you do not have a document open. With a document displayed you should be able to use either
<strong>Tools&gt; Labels</strong> or click the <strong>Labels</strong> button on the
<strong>Mailings</strong> tab of the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the case, please provide a more detailed description of the problem as well as your Office 2016

    <title>Office Programs Repeatedly Crashing after Cleaning my Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office Programs Repeatedly Crashing after Cleaning my Mac</h2>
                    <p>I used the CleanMyMac software today to erase a bunch of old files. &nbsp;The program also recommends a variety of system cleanup files/applications that can be deleted, citing that the user hasn't opened the file in months. &nbsp;I went ahead and deleted some that
 appeared not to have been used for months, one of which had Office365 in the title. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Word, Excel, Outlook and Powerpoint crash after I open a file and try to do stuff. &nbsp;If I just open a file and let it sit there, the document/program will stay open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CleanMyMac won't show me what exactly was deleted. &nbsp;Is there a way I can just troubleshoot which file(s) are missing so I can download them individually? Or will I have to reinstall Office altogether?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help much appreciated.</p>

<p>call recording apps are not possible on wp8. Don't bother looking for apps. On w10 mobile it might be possible to record calls if the device was one of the newer ones (upgraded phones will not work) and if it has the capability unlocked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That "work-around" has security implications and whilst it's useful for the Office team in understanding the bug, i'm not sure recommending introducing a security hole as a "fix" for clipart is&nbsp;appropriate.<br />
<br />
On the Group Policy for "Do not save encrypted pages to disk", MS warns:<br />
This policy setting allows you to manage whether internet explorer will save encrypted pages that contain secure (HTTPS) information such as passwords and credit cards numbers to the internet explorer cache, which may be insecure."<br />
<br />
Can we un-mark this as an answer and get it escalated to the dev team? For my part, the issue is present in Windows 10 Education x64 v1809 running both Office 2016 (latest general release patches) AND Office 365 client (Version 1808).<br />

<p>
</p><p>Unlimited is not really correct. It is limited to 255 entries but a range is considered as 1 entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say that your worksheet formula is: =AVERAGE(A1:A1048576), you can use EVALUATE("AVERAGE(A1:A1048576)"). Preferrable with a reference to the worksheet. Activesheet.Evaluate.</p>

            <p>For the second part of your question, you can set up a variable number of parameters by using the OPTIONAL declaration.&nbsp; It would go something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function MyFunction(P1 As Range, Optional P2 As Variant, Optional P3 As Variant) As Double</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check Help for the requirements for Optional arguments - one, as indicated is that they must be type Variant (naturally there are exceptions to this 'rule').</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check Help for IsMissing </p>
<p>
</p><p>A good place to start is probably on this page at Chip Pearson's site:</p>

</p><p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using the&nbsp;ParamArray parameter type in your function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See Chip Pearson's <strong>ParamArray Parameter Type</strong> discussion, below his
<strong>Optional Variants</strong>&nbsp;section at:</p>

<h2>            Unable to download MS Office files from email attachments</h2>
                    Hi:<br />
I am unable to download MS Word, Exel files from email attachments because I am getting an error. When I try again, a prompt appears and it tells me that I have to repair. Has anybody here had any problems similar to this? I am also having problems with Mathtype
 equation editor and it is also crashing Office365. It seems to be incompatible with O365 for some reason or the other. Mathtype tells me that their product is more stable with the desktop version O365 rather than the downloaded version of O365 Anyone had any
 issues with this as well?<br />
