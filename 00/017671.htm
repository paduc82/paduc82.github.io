<h2>            mailing list  host  not recognised</h2>
                    <p>As an Outlook user of long date I have rather for the first time drafted a mail list with about 36 addressees - almost all having the host&nbsp; @spiegel.de.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had copied these addresses out of the Cc of&nbsp;previously sent mail and pasted them into the setup of the mailer list. - But after sending a mail with this mail list inserted into the Cc&nbsp;&nbsp;I get almost immediately a Mailer Daemon failure notice in which appear
 al the addresse of the list individually - each followed by the comment "</p>
<p>Sorry, I couldn't find any host named spiegel.de'. (#5.1.2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the host "spiegel.de" is well existing and when I had inserted those addresses manually into the Cc all the receivers got the messages without problem. All these addresses are btw in the address collection of Outlook and I can pick them out from the
 collected addresses after typing just the first letter of them. But inserting them all individually is still some chore that I would like to avoid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could be the hitch in this?</p>

Remove the specific email addresses mentioned in the Mailer Daemon failure notice and send mail to rest of the receipients and verify if it&nbsp;works. If&nbsp;yes,&nbsp;issue could&nbsp;be only&nbsp;with those specific contacts .

Did you check whether issue occurs&nbsp;with the Distribution List?</div>

            <p>Sorry if I was not clear enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mailer Daemon has rejecetd <strong><u>each and every one</u></strong> of the addresses - about 30 to @spiegel.de, one @tagesschau.de and one - included by mistake - @interlingua.aol.</p>
<p>The Distributtion List is neatly seated - in bold print and marked as such - in the Contacts. On opening it I see all the adresses as I had copied them, arranged in two columns. When I drafted the mail I had clicked on To and picked the Mail out of the Contacts.</p>

            <p>Hello Mr Jackson!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could have taken it from me that I read the Outook Help and that I set up the Distribution list according to the Help procedure - which you are replicating.</p>
<p>Though there are unclear points. What do you mean, in the third paragraph of your descriiotion, by "In the Show names from the list"?</p>
<p>If&nbsp; I click on "Select Members" there is no &nbsp;"Show names from the list".&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is only what you call the&nbsp;"Type name or select from list box". </p>
<p>And I have to admit&nbsp;that I&nbsp;do not know what this means.</p>
<p>For the right box there is already the option "Contacts" selected. - And I am not using special Address Books - just the automatic contact proposals-</p>
<p>On that same screen there are already the three lists that I have created. What sort of a "name" should I include there? - The whole screen looks to me as unnecessary.
</p>
<p>I did what is said in Outook Help</p>
<p>But what I did was to copy below&nbsp;into the box "Member" all the addresses from a previously sent mail.</p>
<p>_______________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The longer I am busying myself with this matter the more question marks there&nbsp;arise. The procedure seems to be overly complicated and the descriptions thereof in the Help are also unclear.</p>
<p>If you would like to spend some more time on this I would readily give you access to my system over Skype /&nbsp;TeamViewer for some better explanations. - Skype asakana12 and TeamViewer ID 287 796 985.</p>

            <p>Added. -</p>
<p>Looking again into it in Google I see that your description of the screens applies to Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>You see on top of this thread that I had carefully selected Outook 2003 - for that is what I am here referring to. - And the second&nbsp;screen, the one&nbsp;that opens after clicking on "Select Members" on the Distribution List start screen, is diffetent in&nbsp;2007
 -&nbsp;wich you refer to - and in 2003, that I am using.</p>
<p>Such misunderstanding make things extremely complicated, because one gets the feeling that the whole thing is baloney - while in reality there is talk about to different verrsion of a program.
</p>
<p>I had copied the addresses into the&nbsp;"Members" box at the bottom of that second screen according to this -</p>

    <title>Sorting mail by category in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikefedryk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting mail by category in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Does anybody know if there is a way to sort mail by category in Office 365? I have my mail in Outlook 2010 sorted by default in this way, but cannot see a way to do it on the Office 365 web client. It kind of defeats the purpose of categorizing if you can't
 look up categories. I even opened a live chat with Microsoft but wasn't able to get an answer that way, so I suspect the answer is you can't but it seems like a major oversight...</p>

<h3> mike198534  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not get NZ function to work on a crosstab query</h2>
                    <p>I have created a crosstab query based on data from tables.&nbsp; The query runs fine and the results are correct, but there are null (empty) values in some of the cells returned.&nbsp; I would like to replace the null values with zero's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added the Nz function to my query.&nbsp; I have tried several iterations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. TRANSFORM Sum(Nz([ANumber],0)) AS Expr1 </p>
<p>The query works, but still returns null values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>2. TRANSFORM Nz(Sum([ANumber]),0) AS Expr1</p>
<p>This also returns null values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My last attempt was based on a web search:</p>
<p>3. TRANSFORM CSng(Nz(Sum([ANumber]),0)) AS Expr1</p>
<p>This returns an error message, "Invalid use of null".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other ideas?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>I took out the "like"'s but it doesn't seem to have much impact on the query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your other question, "Are there any Nulls in [AllDatabyOneCol]![FY Yr] or [AllDatabyOneCol]![FY00Mo]?"&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; There are no null values in these fields.</p>
<div><br />
There are null values in [AllDatabyOneCol]![anumber].&nbsp; I created a simple select query and used
<div>Nz([AllDatabyOneCol]![anumber],0) and this returned zero's in place of the null values, but it changed all of the returned values to text instead of numeric field, which seems like a strange thing to do.&nbsp; Does that provide any clues?</div>

            <p>Well I got it to work finally, but not sure why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run this crosstab query and then manually copy the results into an Excel file that is set up to generate charts and that Excel file needs to have a certain number of columns.&nbsp; The Access query did not contain the correct number of columns so I created
 some dummy columns by creating expressions that simply contained the numerical value 0.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to debug my crosstab query by removing one field after another to see if the NZ function would finally start working correctly.&nbsp; After I deleted the 3 dummy columns, the NZ function returned zeros instead of nulls.&nbsp; So I replaced the value in the
 dummy columns with "0".&nbsp; The difference is, that I placed quotations marks around the 0 instead of just entering the 0 without quotation marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT AllDatabyOneCol.SAPDate, "0" AS [MIF Expr01], "0" AS [Sort Order], "0" AS [MIF Expr02],</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i do this, the&nbsp;NZ function in the crosstab query returns&nbsp;zero's instead of null values.&nbsp; I don't why this now works, but it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate everyone who contributed and spent time on helping to find the resolution.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Nz() returns a data type of variant. You can force a numeric with:

    <title>Setting individual vertices of a line in VBA for Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting individual vertices of a line in VBA for Excel</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm working on a program to do calculations for a four-bar linkage. I need to be able to display all the bars of the linkage and set their positions and angles.</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e3e0cd-556d-49e7-b05e-641b4f0caa17" /></div>
<div>I've spent a good while trying to figure out a way to set positions of these lines dynamically using VBA, and I can't find anything! The closest I can find is setting the Top, Left, Width, Height and Rotation properties, which is probably the worst way
 possible to manipulate a line and completely unusable in a practical application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd be happy to be able to either set the position of both vertices of the line, or alternatively to be able to set the position of one vertex, along with the radius and angle of the line relative to that one vertice.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I stuck? Or is there anything I can do? Seems like a rather large feature hole in the Excel drawing system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Daniel</div>

<h2>            Excel power map China - road level not available</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Excel Power Map draws its data from Bing maps and on your website (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd435699.aspx) you write that the geographical coverage for China regarding road data is 'Good'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when using Excel Power Map, the geographical coverage for China is limited to County level, despite the road information is available on your Chinese Bing website? Can I update Excel Power Map to include road level in Excel Power Maps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            I've reached out to one of the PM's on the Power Map team with your question. My initial thought is that there isn't enough general coverage for China at the street level yet, so Power Map defaults to what it can reliably return to Excel.

            <p>Thanks for your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked out the website. My problem however, relates to China in Power Map basically appearing blank as opposed to your Chinese Bing website (https://cn.bing.com/ditu/) which is rich with street names, stores, and other info. I have yet to encounter
 problems and streets not found on Bing maps. This goes for English and Chinese street search queries. I was just curious if it was possible to update Power Map to reflect the data on the your website, because I would very much like to run some visual analysis
 through Power Map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<h2>            Excel Document in OneDrive Reverts to Older Version</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel file that I periodically add new data that is stored on Onedrive. I add data 2-3x per week. My last entry into the file was 3 days ago. When I re-opened the file from Onedrive today, it did not include any of the changes from the last 8 weeks.
 Somehow, it reverted to a version two months old and I cannot find any other versions in Onedrive. I am hyper paranoid about saving my work, and usually save everything about every 10 minutes or so. There is no way I went 2 months without hitting save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to recover the last 2 months of changes? How does Onedrive do this?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the Outlook add-ins is one of the possible reasons why your Outlook crashes upon opening. We suggest that you try to run Outlook in safe mode. This is useful when you need to open a file that you can't under normal mode because the application
 is crashing or if you need help in identifying an add-in or extension that may be causing a problem on startup. To start Outlook in safe mode, you can follow the steps in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we recommend that you repair Office from the Control Panel. To do this, you can follow the steps from this

<h2>            Understanding the 5,000 list</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my company we are approaching the 5,000 files/ folder view limit in Sharepoint. To avoid sync issues or creating custom view,I am thinking of creating either another document library or a new sub site. Though, I have gone through numerous websites to
 understand the differentiation between document workspace and sub sites, I have not come across the one that explains what works for a SME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, we are a small company, the information is available to everyone, except the one stored on One Drive. In such a situation which is a better option- a new document library or a new sub site. Does a sub site have its own 5,000 files/ folder limit or
 the files stored in a sub site count towards the document library in the parent site?</p>
<p>I am not at all familiar with Sharepoint and since the company does not have IT person, I need to ask such questions, which might seem basic. If the information is available somewhere else, can you please guide me to it and if that is the case, apologies
 for double posting.</p>

<p>Hi Raghav,</p>
<p>Each SharePoint library has a view limit of 5,000 items, composed of files and folders. This limitation is only related to the list/library and you can create new libraries/lists in the same site to store items when the item numbers approach the view limit.
 A list/library created in the subsite doesn’t affect or count in the parent library.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

Hi</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
-&nbsp;Up to now I only typed notes with keyboard and all looked fine, &nbsp;i recently started handwriting (with Pencil)&nbsp;and thats when the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
-&nbsp;No changes were made on the device.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
- I deleted and reinstalled the app on my ipad and it did not work, i also made sure there are no add-ins on my one note.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
- I also tried the "use all handwriting as drawing" function as i saw that some suggested it in microsoft help communities but it did not work.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
From what I see online others had this issue too but a solution has been suggested yet.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Also w<span>hen i log in to Onenote online all my handwriting notes appear all over the place.</span></p>
<br />
<span>I am using Windows 8.1 with OneNote 2013 on Ipad Pro 10.5 with Apple Pencil.</span>
<div>
<div>
Thanks&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Dann</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you referred me to - Connect us support, I already were chatting several times with help desk contact by using that link and every time i got bounced from link to link and person to person until in the end they referred me to this community- now
 you are referring me back to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating to me that no one from Microsoft team can follow up all the way and instead just sending me to other places to look for help.</p>

<h2>            Exporting Screen Recordings in Powerpoint</h2>
                    I am a teacher and was using PowerPoint to create videos to post to my website.&nbsp; I was using the screen recorder and then would export the video using the options on under the Mix tab.&nbsp; Today I went to make a video and the Mix tab was gone.&nbsp; I found the
 screen recorder and was able to make my video, but when I went to export it, it was barely 5 seconds of a 16 minute video.&nbsp; How do I make it export the whole video into mp4 format?

<p>Hi jhumphre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just had the same problem and came across your post looking for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've eventually found that if you right click on the video in Powerpoint and then click 'Save Media As' then you can export the video as a separate file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!&nbsp;<br />

            You can extract the video from any PowerPoint file by adding <strong>.zip</strong> to the end of the name. Click on
<strong>OK</strong> when Windows asks if you want to make that change. Right-click on the file and choose
<strong>Extract All</strong>. Look in the <strong>ppt/media</strong> folder for the original video file(s).

<br />
This is way too document specific to be answered without looking at the document.
<br />
<br />
Most resumes are in tables. <br />
<br />
If you click on the resume where you would want to add text if you look at the ribbon do you have access to the Table Tools? If so, click on the Layout tab and click the option on the left to view gridlines.<br />
<br />
This should help you get an idea of what is going on.<br />
<br />
Here is a reference to Tables. <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/tables.htm#Modifying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Illegal MAC address on 5800 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> touriga---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Illegal MAC address on 5800</h2>
                    
<p>I have just taken delivery of 2 Nokia 5800s, one form Orange and one from Three. The wifi network I will be connecting to most often controls connectivity via a list of approved MAC adresses (the access point is a cisco WAP4410N).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When entering the 5800 MAC addresses in the WAP4410N's configuration the phone from Orange presented no problem, but the one from Three resulted in an error "MAC address must be 12&nbsp; Hex characters (0-9 and A-F) with optional delimiters (: or -),
<strong>and the second bit is not a odd number</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the MAC address of the Three supplied phone disobeys this rule. It's MAC address is EC:9B:5B:xx:xx:xx. The Orange supplied 5800 has a more standard address starting 00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calls to Three technical support were fruitless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could of course disable the wifi MAC connectivity control without compromising the security too much, but this would be a last resort.</p>

<li>What standards does Nokia use to assign MAC addresses?</li><li>Is there something special about MAC address assigning in relation to Three supplied phones?</li><li>Am I just unlucky? If I sent my phone back to Three for a replacement would the replacement possibly have a more "standard" MAC address?</li><li>Is there any way the MAC address can changed, spoofed etc.?</li></ol>

<p>Update: There was something else wrong with this phone (radio didn't work) so I had to return it to my service provider anyway. The replacement phone had a legal MAC address so all is now well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would still be interested in the answers to my questions though if anyone has any wisdom in these matters.</p>

<h2>            Call History Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>In the last month I lost most of my call history which used to go back several months. I have reset the phone three times, the last time I first deleted my phone backup from One Drive. It still keeps losing history. I have discovered that when starting the
 search function from history the missing history (since resetting the phone) comes back but is gone when I come back to call history then I need to start the search again to see all calls.</p>
<p>Microsoft has no support except for Nokia and Lumia phones, Alcatel says it's not a hardware issue, T-Mobile has no answer. I don't know if this is due to an update to Windows 10 mobile, the phone memory, or my service provider.</p>

            If your using Lion (OSX.7.x), Mountain Lion (OSX.8.x), or Mavericks (OSX.9.x) The Yes. You will either have&nbsp; purchase Office2011, or subscribe to Office 365 I would the Office 365 Premium that allows 5 licenses per household (if your using at Home). Will
 allow you to install on up to 5 computers Mac, or PC or possibly in the future an iPad.<br />
<br />
Note you will have to have a great Internet connection. Forget dailup (PPP) or DSL. And it must be reliable else you will have minor issues with having to re-sign in every few days.

<h2>            Is Microsoft lying to us</h2>
                    I had a fully licensed and activated copy of Windows 8.1 which I upgraded to Windows 10 on July 29. The upgrade went very well and I had a fully activated copy of Windows 10 for 2 days. Today on July 31 I decided to do a clean install as according to Microsoft
 I can now do and it will activate automatically (no hardware changes at all). Well I am now sitting here with an un-activated copy of Windows 10. Any help from Microsoft would be appreciated at this time.

<p>From what I saw on <strong>The Defrag Show</strong> that SFC will produce error messages, but it's best to ignore them as they are caused by the references not being in the software database.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any connected drive is suspect to corruption when booting another operating system while the Windows 8/10 kernel is in hibernation due to Fast Startup being enabled.&nbsp; The OSes being on separate drives and having their own bootloaders does not help that
 much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fast Startup option I am referring to is in Windows Power Options (as <strong>
