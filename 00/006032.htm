<h2>            IE10 does not remember scroll position after pressing back to return to original page.</h2>
                    When leaving a webpage via a link I return to the original page by clicking the back button.&nbsp; I used to return to the same horizontal scroll position, now the page loads to the top as a new refreshed page.&nbsp;

That would depend on the page you were returning to and has never been a reliable technique for doing what you want.&nbsp;&nbsp; A better technique is to open links a new tab (e.g. use Middleclick) and then close the tab to "go back" to the (usually) unchanged originating
 tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another advantage of this alternative technique is that you can leave the new tab open if you want and "go back" simply by switching tabs.

Thank you for your response. I understand the use of tabs as an alternate method But using the back arrow is convenient plus it has worked for a long time across several versions of IE. &nbsp;I really would like to understand why it has stopped functioning.

I disagree. This is not an acceptable solution. <br />
<br />
Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and previous version of IE don't have this issue. You press the back button/key they take you back a page and display the page at the same location which you left it.<br />

<p>That would depend on the page and on the cache-checking setting.&nbsp; E.g. if you stay in a Working Online state and use Cache-checking: Every...visit...&nbsp; and the site sends back a new page (e.g. with new advertising) there would not be a good reason to stay
 in the same position.&nbsp; In IE9 Work Offline is no longer respected; otherwise, provided the page was in the TIF,&nbsp;being in a Working Offline state could be a workaround for this case--as it used to be.</p>

            <p>I still disagree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if there were page updates since you've been there, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc. will take you back to same position. If something has changed, just refresh the browser (there is a button to refresh in the IE10 app and program, let me decide to&nbsp;refresh
 the page)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've mentioned in other threads vBulletin discussion forums is a good place to experience this.&nbsp;A public web site you can try it on, is
<a href="http://www.advrider.com/forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.advrider.com/forums</a> or forums.wpcentral.com or Go there, scroll down to&nbsp;a subsections, go read some stuff, then go back. Firefox, Chrome, etc. will take you back to where you were on the page. IE10 when you go
 back, it takes you back to the top of the page. Rather frustrating when you are going through discussion forums, reading various threads down on the page. You have to scroll back down to get to the next thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, I now have to eat crow. For some reason, today IE10 on my Surface RT&nbsp;is behaving as I think it should, but not on my W8 laptop.&nbsp;This is really confusing and frustrating.</p>

            <p>As I described I used to be able to return to my previous location on the page I had left. Obviously something has changed and from a user's perspective MS should address as a matter of convenience.</p>

<p>I realized that I've been using the dedicated back button on my keyboard (Lenovo Thinkpad T400) that wasn't working.</p>

<p>If I use the "backspace" key, or the onscreen back arrow, it works properly.</p>

                    <p>Microsoft Office 365 &nbsp;Error 0X80000003. I see a few other threads but none are relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue started suddenly with Office 2010 outlook which would not run and prompted the error above. The issue was briefly resolved after microsoft office's debug tool. From there it spread to MS word and the MS suite and outlook once again would not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded to office 365 and the newly installed office suite would not work. 2 Tier 1 sessions with Microsoft went to naught.</p>
<p>Clean boot has been tried time and time again. All old MS products are now uninstalled. Office 365 has been repeatedly uninstalled and installed.</p>
<p>Still no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"The application was unable to start correctly (0x80000003). Click OK to close the application".</p>

            <p>Thanks Stefan. &nbsp;I had already uninstalled and tried augmenting with some manual steps fr;om the manual link. Unfortunately still no luck. There may be some lingering traces? I couldn't access this path:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">%appdata%\microsoft\templates</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>By all accounts MS 2010 is completely uninstalled. Are there any lingering files I should be hunting for? I just tried another repair wizard for Office 365, still no luck. All other windows applications are working well.</p>
<p>I tried a restore point but unfortunately the earliest it goes back to is October 2nd evening, after the problems started. Have also cross-referenced against recent windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help</p>

    <title>Nokia 6300 battery life - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkranger---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6300 battery life</h2>
                    I've bought a brand new 6300...warranty and everything. BUT there's a problem with the battery. I have to charge the phone every two days :-S<br />
I've used Nokias all my life and never had this problem. I don't use the music player (bec. I have one), radio or the camera (all of these eat the battery life) much. My bluetooth isn't on either. But still this problem. I've been told that the cover is aluminium/steel
 whatever and the lithium battery causes this problem. It's the same case with the 8800 Sirocco edition.<br />
<br />
I was so annoyed when I had the battery problem, I was this close to going back to the store and throwing the phone on the guy's face!<br />
<br />
Anyone have the same problem?

            Many people have faced this problem including me. Nokia's 6300 has a very poor battery performance. I have to charge it evry alternate days.<br />
<br />
Anyway i like the features and the look of 6300 and i'm happy with it.

            it is not the aluminium cover that's the problem, but the slim size because of which Nokia have put BL-4C battery. 16M colours and 4C battery... silly, nokia, really silly!!

Every 2 days you say? You're lucky. I had to charge mine 6300 every day, otherwise it would die till noon (comparing to my 6230 or Samsung E250, I charge them every 3rd-4th day). You can blame unwise Nokia's design, apparently they were after an attempt to
 release a slim gadget to gain up popular competitors' models. They're offering you a magnificent display, but forgot to tell you that the phone's battery cannot feed it on. As I guess, there's nothing to be done to prolong the battery life. Hopefully in future
 Nokia will be able to offer a new battery with extended capacity that would fit.<br />

I appreciate your calling out for Nokia to help, but pls don't develop hopes, dude. There're some threads on this board that count nearly 200 messages each and are full of urging Nokia to react, at least, verbally. And guess what, none reaction so far.

            Normally it's a lie what is writing in 6300's brochure: standby time=14 days. I've tried to see if is so and didn't succeed more than 3days. My brother has same problem. Nobody from Nokia explain that... should be possible to return this phone for misleading
 information?

Thanks for the reply Mr Democles. Perhaps mostly in this forum customers believe that their problems can be solved by suggessions given by proffessionals from Nokia. But i and many other like me did not find any answers to their problems.<br />
<br />
Anyway this answer clears my doubts regarding the Discussion Forum. Thanks.

            Today I got to know that I am not the only person suffering the problems in 6300. The ringer volume and the battery life. I fail to understand why Nokia is silent on this matter. How can we trust Nokia's products.<br />
<br />
Till date I have sent many mails to Nokia in this regard. But they never apply. My brand new handset lying at their repair centre.... but I don't think they will be able to repair.<br />
<br />
Anyway when they have committed on specifications they will have to honour or face it in the court.

            Ringing is not too loud and battery life is not too long.<br />
<br />
Vibro is felt only if in hand (maybe elsewhere, but not in a pocket).<br />
<br />
Others things are more or less good.

<h2>            Repaired Office 2016 now asking for license that I don&#39;t have.</h2>
                    <p>After Excel kept crashing multiple times a day (20+ times a day) for one of our users. Tried a few things but ended up having to run a repair of Office 2016. Now its asking for a license to activate Office. The problem is the install was done by someone
 who no longer works for the company so I have no idea what email address or license key was used, is there anyway to find out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>I've contacted support but they told me to contact the company that sold the license. Its my fault we don't have the license card anymore but its annoying that there's no warning (that I saw at least) that I'll need to re-activate Office after repairing

            The Company that sold you the license cannot help, with a license that has been previously installed/activated. The support person you spoke with was passing the buck or did not understand your problem.<br />

    <title>Access to Netgear D7000 Router Following Insider Updates&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. jonathan hughes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access to Netgear D7000 Router Following Insider Updates&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am frustrated and suspect I am missing something obvious but this is a problem that started with the update of both my Insider PC's to 18342 (19H1), (now 18434), then in the case of one of them, to 18841 (20H1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the PC's are on different systems, (both with an identical router as above). The desktop is connected by Ethernet cable, the Laptop by Wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In each case using ipconfig I see that the Router IP address is 192.168.0.1 but in each case if I try to access the router I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(95, 99, 104, 1)">
<strong>192.168.0.1</strong>&nbsp;sent an invalid response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE</span><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked through the Firewall and Windows Defender settings, (I have no third party AV software running), I can see that Netgear is in the "exceptions" lists and have even temporarily disabled each and all elements of the Firewall and Defender protection
 but am still unable to access the router(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made no overt changes to any security settings but am now rather stuck as to how to solve this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An guidance here would be most helpful as I suspect this is a matter of the OS Build update inclusions rather than anything that I have inadvertently toggled within Settings, (or the ever diminishing Control Panel)</p>

<p>I have a somewhat similar router (Netgear R7000P). Netgear has some unusual methods of access, probably relevant to remote access and for increased security. Do you have web services management enabled? That might give you another avenue of access, or you
 could use the reset button to restore factory settings if it won't be too difficult to reconfigure it the way you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use mine primarily for Wi-Fi, so its only Ethernet connection is to another router that was supplied by my ISP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried connecting to it via a web browser on a smartphone? I find that I can connect to it that way, or if I enable Wi-Fi on my desktop PC (on which I normally use only wired Ethernet). Mine is using the address
<strong>192.168.1.1</strong>, which is a bit different than you mentioned. Below is from my ipconfig command. Is there any chance you mistyped the router IP?&nbsp; When I connect to mine, I get a Netgear Genie homepage on the router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the feedback. I did, subsequent to my initial question, try and access the router via my smartphone and ended up in the same position with the same message so this is almost certainly not a Windows issue but in fact&nbsp; a Netgear issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Netgear for a very long time through various of their routers and always been able to get access to them via their own software interface, (Genie). This all stopped recently!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the ipconfig bit and the Default Gateway was showing as 192.168.0.1 which on my system does make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the routers I use only with Wi-Fi, the other I use a combination of both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now utterly puzzled but don't think this thread should be here as already said .. it seems to be Netgear not Windows related .. apologies to anyone annoyed by this post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having multiple routers can sometimes cause some network configuration issues. A reset to factory settings might work best in your case. Maybe there is a firmware upgrade for it too. But try unplugging power first, to see if that resets it enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also be worth checking if a neighbor has hacked in, if your password was not strong enough.</p>

<p>Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your thoughts all sensible .. been doing some focussed searching and actively engaging this problem this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two routers are located in two separate locations so no conflicts in that case and in both cases the Netgear Firmware is up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the problem is with recent updates to security within Chrome, Edge and IE 11 all of which now stop any IP addresses that are seen as being less secure than their minimum expected levels.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Edge within the Microsoft Sandbox, (current Build OS 18343 on one PC and 18841 on the other), then I can access each router with no complication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to find the appropriate "exception" settings in any of the three browsers, it would seem that they all now only allow https:// and anything less is considered open and therefore unsafe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reality leaps to the fore here and as I can gain access through Microsoft Sandbox, though perhaps not elegant, the solution is available.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a different router, but I remember something about the standard IP address being changed...</p>
<p>Whether that is because I also use a ISP provided modem\router as well as my personal TrendNet router, I'm not sure..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my connection through Control Panel... Network and Sharing... I am seeing a 192.168.10.1...</p>
<p>This is now the address to access my personal router...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I need to connect to the ISP's supplied modem\router, I need to physically disconnect my router and connect directly to theirs...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the thought .. it looked a possibility though I had checked through ipconfig and seen 192.168.0.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed your route to the data via Control Panel and confirmed that the PC is seeing my Netgear on 192.168.0.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per earlier post the matter seems to be associated with the security settings now in place in Chrome, Edge and IE 11. I have added the IP to the "Safe Connections" listing in each but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank goodness for the 19H1 Sandbox now working fine and allowing me to gain access simply because the security issues are disabled within the Sandbox itself.</p>

<p>suat.cini's approach looks good to me, as Edge uses those Internet Control Panel settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that my router's web page came up as insecure (not https://) plus it might use Flash, which is considered another security weakness on its own. I used Chrome to access mine. But there are settings within Chrome browser to allow the connection,
 or you can normally allow it on a per-site basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on where it says Not secure at the left of the address in Chrome to get the site settings page for 192.168.0.1. Using the Site settings gear icon, you can change what is required to allow the router's web page to be accessed. I did not have to go this
 way though. I think at some point I just told the browser to go to the site anyway and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, because this is a non-routable IP address, behind your firewall and is a NAT address, your only insecurity re: this router web page ought to be from other devices on the same Local Area Network.</p>

<p>Thanks Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All sounded fine but sadly not the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the Gear Icon and adjusted all of the necessary to reflect "Allow" where perhaps before it had been Ask or Block. (Some things were greyed out but otherwise everything allowed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The site asked if it should re-load with the new settings but no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only became an issue within the last few week so is either Chrome, Edge and IE based or my pre-release versions of Windows; I am on 18343 on one PC and 18841 on the other both exhibiting the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you I was under the impression on all of the browsers that you could simply add a site as an exception to overcome the "security" but this does not now seem to be the case as I have approached this from the Windows OS end and put the exception in there
 care of Control Panel and pretty much done the same with the browsers but still that annoying message:</p>
<p>

<p>I just had a thought that you mentioned Windows Sandbox. Launching Sandbox creates a virtual switch and enables NAT networking and routing on your host PC.&nbsp; So in ipconfig you will see these extra network adapters and they often use those same addresses
 as our home networks. So that may change the routing on your host PC in a way that it sees the non-routable network connection to your Sandbox, but not to the router. Also, the Sandbox may be on the same subnet (numerically) as the router, so it sees the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no expert in IP addressing and routing, but you get the idea. Could Sandbox be the cause of the issue connecting to the router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed Sandbox on my build 18346 and after activating Wi-Fi on my host PC, I have 3 different non-routable networks going.&nbsp; I have to activate Wi-Fi to get onto the same subnet as my Netgear router. The vEthernet (Default Switch) was auto-created
 for Sandbox.&nbsp; If I were to install Hyper-V also, it could get even more interesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe one of the original Replies here suggested to do a network reset, which forces a restart and resets all adapters,&nbsp; and networking protocols to default.&nbsp; That might be a good idea to try.</p>

<p>It really does sound like a hard reset will need to be done to try and resolve this issue, based on the information you've provided.&nbsp; There's not a way to back up all of your text messages with Windows Phone 7, but if there are important ones you want to
 keep you can copy the text from the message into OneNote and save it to SkyDrive, or email it to yourself.&nbsp; I suppose it's up to you as to which is a larger inconvenience, the problem with the date on the phone, or your text history being cleared.&nbsp; You don't
 have to do it, but that's the only thing we've come up with as a possible resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to have this issue after doing a hard reset, definitely let us know.&nbsp;

<h2>            Word doc &#40;assignment&#41; recovery</h2>
                    <p>I had been diligently working on an assignment for hours and I&nbsp;closed my laptop without properly saving my&nbsp;Word doc. When I accessed it later from a school computer it was only a few pages. I did not work on it and waited until I got home. When I got home
 I opened my computer and it had defaulted to what I had on the other computer. I closed but it did not ask me to save it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea if or how I will be able to recover all the pages I had written?</p>

            Hi Shirley.  It's probably a good idea to work on the  Word Web App which has the built-in Auto-save feature. No more worries about unsaved changes....

            Hello Shirley,
<br />
<br />Do you know what version you currently runnig?
<br />In case you re not up to date try updating office version.
<br />
<br />Try following the next steps to update latest version available

            Please, try this. In Word, go to File, Open, Recover unsaved documents. The path is like this one: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles
<br />There is a possibility that an unsaved document version is there<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43d93070-4ded-421b-b868-3b64fed7ecea?upload=true" />

            <p>Hi Benoit,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Apologies for the delayed response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the suggestion to disable anti-virus software was to check if there was a conflict between the update and the Anti-virus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you <span>to manually <span>reset the Windows Updates Components</span>. Refer to the steps below to
<span>reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the menu.</span></li><li><span>Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer
</strong>and the <strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and
<strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type <strong>Exit </strong>in the <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For further reference, you can refer to the link:</span></p>

    <title>Access export to CSV - formatting problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> floydrturbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access export to CSV - formatting problem</h2>
                    <p>I have created a macro that exports a query from Access to a csv file. &nbsp;Within the csv file, I need some of the columns to be formatted as "General" and some to be formatted as "Text".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, every time I run the macro, all columns are formatted as "General". &nbsp;Is there a way to set it up so I don't have to manually charge the formats for each column each time I run the macro? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

            A CSV file is a plain text file. There is no formatting. Even if you select General and Text. Once it gets into the CSV its not formatted. When you import the CSV to something else, that's where you need to set formatting.

            hi,<br />
<br />
I tried that but it didn't change. &nbsp;The only difference is that it says my language is in U.S English (but written in Gaeilge) at the bottom of the screen of outlook.com inbox.<br />
<br />
After making the change, saving, logging out and logging back in - the language in language settings is still on English (United States)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas ?<br />

<p>Hi. Just got a x2, with swedish as chosen language in the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being dumb I thought that a update of the phone never hurts. To my suprise the choice of swedish is now gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I return to previous settings or update to a language pack containing swedish?</p>

            Hi, have you bought the phone from a reseller?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there are resellers that buy phones from other countries intended for the country or region of purchase. It's often a bit cheaper. The problem now is that the phone does not have the language required for the country they intend to resell them
 in.<br />
<br />
What they do is to install the lanugage required, but unfortunately what happens when you update the device is that you will update the device with an update intended for the device in that region, hence your language will be gone again.<br />
<br />
However, you can take your device with you to a Nokia care point and make them install swedish on it as a language pack. This might cost, but likely not not much at all.<br />
<br />
If you update your device again later, the language will be gone and you have to visit the care point another time.<br />
<br />
It's not Nokias fault. It's the reseller that you bought it of.<br />
<br />
If it's brand new, as I understand it is, I would contact them and make them send you a new device intended for scandinavia if that is what you thought or were promised you bought!

            Can we install a language pack without passing by a Nokia care point? (No care care point where I live !) If yes, how can I do that?

<p>It it worth all users noting that if a retailer does provide you with a device not intended for your country, there may be an issue with warranty.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Models intended for sale in the EU plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey will have a European warranty valid in all of those countries, but outside this area phones have a warranty valid in one country; so it is always worth making sure that you
 purchase from a reputable dealer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to the other question, no - there is no method provided by Nokia for the end user to add languages.

            Good point about the warranty michaels!<br />
<br />
I suggest the OP does contact the reseller and make them 1, send you a device ment for your region or country, or 2, make them give you your money back.<br />
<br />
I've had this experience with internet store which make you believe that you buy a Norwegian (in my case) phone when youre actually buying a device without norwegian language. - At least that's what you get after updating it.<br />
<br />
I called back and made them give me my money back. It worked out;)

            I have Nokia X2-00 and has English, Filipino, Chinese languages.... These languages are my needs, but I need Thai and Korean as well.... Nokia Care Point is very far and I could not done it by myself where I really could not, except hack my phone and void
 my warranty which i do not want to happen.... Why it is so Nokia limits the language packs and why it is not possible to choose what languages you want to be installed to your phone and deal with the limited languages in packs? It's the multi-language world
 today, a Filipino that could speak Filipino, English, Spanish, Chinese, learning Thai, Korean and Indonesian, or an Italian learning Spanish and Russian and Korean, or any other, and why Nokia could not find some solutions about it? Or would they say that
 Nokia is not the right phone that suites their needs? Come'on.... Your Symbian SMARTPHONES could do the solutions for it, for sure.... A SMART CELLPHONES that can speak the languages of the world is what we're lOoking for....

<h2>            Poor Reception on Nokia Lumia 525 after updating from Windows 8.0 to 8.1</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;Vodafone India and I am facing some issues with network connectivity.&nbsp;Infact in areas of low signal availability( relatively low signal availability- 4 points and 2g is available) the phones network bar switches off and then it freezez to 1 point(some
 times stays as zero bars of coverage). &nbsp;Also there is problems with calls being dropped and network browsing issues.&nbsp;Even if I move to an area with good signal still it shows only 1 point. I have to turn on flight mode and again return to normal mode to get
 connectivity.</p>
<p>I replaced my sim twice but still the problem exists. So I tried using a different sim in my phone and then also problem persists. I also tried my sim on a different set(Lumia 520) and it was showing full network coverage(Where as it shows 0 or 1 bars in
 my phone).</p>
<p>I went to Microsoft service centre and they did a reset and said issue was software related. But again when I moved to low coverage area same issue started again :(.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also from what I remember, this problem started after I update my mobile from windows 8.0 to 8.1</p>

</p><p>Hi all, up until recently this has not been an issue and I have been able to attach pictures to emails no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are hundreds of photos currently stored on my handset and viewable, on going to outlook and selecting attach I get the usual "Choose Picture" option and normally all picture are displayed to select and attach, however all I get is a blank screen with
 no photo gallery images as ususlly would&nbsp;so cannot attach anything. It will not let me select albums or favourites tabs either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can go via the photo if&nbsp;needed and share that way, but I am using a&nbsp;website that has sent me a unique link for me to attach required images to.</p>

<p>Hi Glen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It sounds like that this issue on your Lumia 640 LTE phone is software-related. To resolve this, we strongly suggest that you perform a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove
 any applications or files on your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Unable to login into office 365</h2>
                    I have the free student office 365 program on my macbook. Every time I try to save a document, it asks me to log into my office 365 account, which I don't have, so I log into my microsoft account instead, but it still will not let me save anything. What
 do I need to do? I have to turn in research papers soon online and really need this to work!

    <title>bullets &#38; numbering on right click menu - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            bullets &#38; numbering on right click menu</h2>
                    on previous PCs running word 2007, right click menu-&gt;bullets allows me to choose multi-level bullets. However on the current PC I'm using that choice is not showing up. I must go to the ribbon to define a multi-level bullet. Is there a way to add it to
 the right click menu?

            <p>There is no easy way to add or remove commands from the context menus in Word 2007 and 2010, unfortunately. You can add the Multilevel List command to the Quick Access Toolbar, if that helps.</p>
<p>However, note that the best long-term solution is to set up numbering using styles; see

    <title>Excel 2007 vba to change chartarea backcolor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dhookom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 vba to change chartarea backcolor</h2>
                    I've been spending too much time searching with little or no luck. I want to be able to create some Excel 2007 charts on-the-fly setting various properties.
<br />
<br />
I can get various properties with code like:<br />
worksheets("Charts&amp;Pivot").chartobjects("Chart 2").left<br />
<br />
How do I set the chartarea's background color?<br />

            <p>Look at the ChartObject's .Chart property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim cht As Chart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set cht = ActiveSheet.ChartObjects("Chart 1")<strong>.Chart</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With cht<strong>.PlotArea.Format.Fill</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Visible = msoTrue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ForeColor.RGB = RGB(221, 221, 221)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Transparency = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Solid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope that helps.</p>

<div>
<p>This could be a temporary problem while your room is being synced. If that's the case, the Tile should return to normal after the sync completes. If the problem persists, it could be because you've deleted the contact from your phone or unfriended the contact
 on Messenger. In that case, you'll need to invite that person to your room again.</p>
