Use this tutorial : How to always have the internet explorer 9 menu bar turned on by default<br />
Note : The tutorial is under Win7 forum. It's OK. It works for Vista machine as well. I&nbsp;used it myself until I uninstalled IE9.</p>

<h2>            How can I postion a table and a excel chart side by side on the page</h2>
                    I am currently doing my economics homework and I have to create a table and a chart for the data which I have done without any issues but they aren't all that big and I want to position them side by side on the page and Word will not allow that to happen.
 I have taken a course on using office at school and I am pretty proficient at using it but I can not figure out how to do this and I can imagine how it would look on paper and the answer is much better taking up less sheets of paper because yes even though
 we have a elearning system and some teacher expect you to submit all of your work online there are still some dinosaurs that want you to print out and hand in the assignments. (Not a very economical policy from an economics teacher wasting paper and ink physical
 resources when we could all submit electronically and save both). If anyone know how to do this let me know I would appreciate it since having my document not looking professional is bugging me.<br />

            <p>You could set the properties of the table so that the text wraps around the table, which should then allow you to position the chart to the side of it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could perhaps insert a two cell table and insert your existing table into one of the cells and the chart into the other.</p>

<h2>            Forms Limiting Number of Questions</h2>
                    I have a survey with 46 questions (mix of text, multiple choice, and Likert) and cannot add anymore questions! Based on the help data, I should be able to have up to 100 questions, correct?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried editing the survey in another browser, clearing the cache in both browsers, nothing seems to work.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Claire,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, the number of the questions you could add in your survey is related to the type of the questions. For example, per my tests, I can add 100 questions when only text and multiple choice questions are included.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be672ee7-e0ab-4d2b-96a8-4ed98ec3dd84?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be672ee7-e0ab-4d2b-96a8-4ed98ec3dd84?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>But when I select only Likert, I can only add 34 questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4327faca-8b98-49d0-a17d-3939f4168c03?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4327faca-8b98-49d0-a17d-3939f4168c03?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As a work around, you may try reducing the number of Likert questions to lift the limit of the total number of questions. Meanwhile, you may also click the ellipses button in the top right of Microsoft Forms and select Feedback to post your suggestion about
 the limit of Likert questions so that the Microsoft Forms team could read your requirement. Meanwhile, please also kindly note that the number of the questions in Microsoft Teams is actually increasing by time due to the efforts of our Microsoft Forms team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>After installing Office 365/Outlook on my Mac (Outlook -&gt; 15.17.1, Mac OS -&gt; El Capitan 10.11) everything synced with our Exchange 2011 server at work initially, but no new messages were received. &nbsp;I am able to send fine. &nbsp;The only new way to get new messages

<p>Hi Albert，</p>
<p>From your description, I realized that a sync issue occurred when you were using Outlook for mac.</p>
<p>To clearly understand the sync issue, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.Does "our Exchange 2011 server"mean an on-premise server?<br />
2.Did anyone else in your organization encounter this issue?<br />
3.How did you configure your account? Please give me the steps in detail.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

    <title>Best way to format report with lots of data&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maureen59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best way to format report with lots of data&#63;</h2>
                    I have a couple of reports that I've designed - one is an emergency fact sheet, the other a transportation information sheet. Each report contains several fields. While the page layout for each of these reports is a single column, I have set it up so that
 there is data printing on both the left and right sides of the form. It works "ok" except for one thing. There is a lot of wasted space due to some of the data on the right side taking up more room than the data on the left. What this causes is a lot of "empty"
 space which is not corrected by using "can shrink=yes". So the question is... should I use "subreports" for the data on the right side of these reports or should the report be set up as two columns? Thanks for any input.

<p>Thanks Marshall - sorry I didn't think to include that info for you :)</p>
<p>In the emergency fact sheet there is a page header: Simply has a text box with "Emergency Fact Sheet" and a place for the current date</p>
<p>Grouped by header under participant.participantID. Under that header is all the contact (i.e., one time)&nbsp;information for that person - name, photo, address, phone numbers, date of birth, SSN, date of admission, a check box for whether they have a living
 will, their medicare number and&nbsp;medicaid number. Then there is an area with Case managment contact info - name, phone, vna affiliation and vna phone number. Following this area is another area which contains basic medical info - physician type, primary physician
 name, address, phone, fax, health concerns description (can be a fair amount of text) and allergies description (which can also be a fair amount of text.</p>
<p>Under the "detail" section is Caregiver information (this information is typically two per participant, hence including it in the detail section). It includes Caregiver type, name, address, contact phone numbers (3 spots), caregiver relationship and three
 checkboxes for POA, Guardian and DHPOA designations.</p>
<p>Footer - None.</p>
<p>As for what it should look like... I don't see any way to include a screenshot. Basically the format is pretty much good as is. I would just like to tidy it up and remove extra spaces between areas of the report where space isn't needed. Essentially I have
 tried to set it up as two columns - just didn't realize that there was a way to do this with the page setup. The column format in the page setup sounds a little confusing and I wasn't sure how that would work.</p>
<p>The Transportation Information form is very similar - with similar information about the participant included, just has transportation details instead of medicaid/medicare numbers on the right side of the report. These transportation details - directions,
 etc. are creating somewhat large text areas on the right side of the page which is what I think is throwing off the alignment of items on the left side. It is set up exactly like the emergency form as far as the participant header and details section, again
 with caregiver information in the details part of the report.</p>

<p>That's good info, but where are these "extra spaces between areas"?</p>
<p>I'm not seeing how all that stuff can be arranged in two columns.&nbsp; Maybe with the descriptions on the right and everything else on the left???&nbsp; Or maybe some other horizontal arrangement of your "areas".</p>
<p>You did not mention, but I assume that the description text boxes have their CanGrow and/or CanShrink properties set to Yes with the same settings for their section (medical info group header??).&nbsp; If that's so, does it have anything to do with the "extra
 spaces"?</p>

<h2>            Internet Sound bady Distorted</h2>
                    Sound works perfect whenever I play files stored on my computer but whenever I try to play sound from the Internet ie YouTube or iTunes stores that the sound is badly distorted.<br />
<br />
I am running Vista with IE8 and I have uninstalled and reinstalled Flash and have made sure that all my sound drivers are updated.<br />

            Hi Toye Girl,<br />
<br />
Does it sound like it is comming from the bathroom and swirling around?<br />
<br />
That is just an issue with broadband capactiy at the time you are viewing the videos and should only be intermittant. You can right-click on 'Flash' videos and select 'Settings' from the context menu and then increase your storage allowed for buffering of Flash.<br />
<br />
Adobe is working on a new version of Flash that has improved hardware acceleration to address the issue. Sun has released a new router that has the capacity to stream a simultaneous broadcast to the entire Chinese Population! (I think.... these assumptions
 are just web chatter I have read).<br />
<br />
Actually, Google, who owns Youtube may already be using this new equipment... maybe thats the issue, but I have the same issue sometimes on other sites.<br />
<br />
If on any sites you are offered either Flash or Silverlight videos, choose the Silverlight version (especially for High fidelity videos). Its quality is far supperior in my opinion (subjective).<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            how do you un-embbed a file</h2>
                    <p>I created an excel workbook with 3 sheets (excel 2003) the document has been worked on by several people.&nbsp; We have upgraded to 2010 and now my document has =EMBED("Excel.Sheet.8","") in the center sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the people who have accessed this workbook are savy enough to embed anything - nor would they want to in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need to know is 1) how did this happen, and 2) how do I make it un-happen?</p>

            <p>Just like GillesLabelle has writen,</p>
<p>Only use official downloads from the Microsoft servers. </p>
<p>Any other source is not save and those unofficial sources can and will often contain viruses and other unwanted stuff.</p>
<p>The official releases ISO and downloads are virus free</p>

    <title>Excel files read-only even after check out online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin hamers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel files read-only even after check out online</h2>
                    <p>We have the issue that for libraries where check-out and check-in is forced and the user syncs this library to OneDrive the offline files get a lock. This on itself is not an issue. What is the conflict is that Excel now keeps trying to open the offline
 file in stead of the online version and keeps the file read-only even after checking it out online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution it seems is to remove this library from the offline sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for me a big bug. The option to offline sync should not conflict with opening and editing in excel the online version.</p>

<h2>            Classroom integration - forms&#47;tests</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote and Classroom with my groups, but I wanted to try to integrate some of the things I do. &nbsp;So far, I can't find answers for how to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If I give tests using Forms, is there any way to automatically integrate this with Classroom to record the marks? &nbsp;If I create the test as an assignment in Classroom, students need to upload a document: can that be changed so I could just put the Form link
 in the assignment box, and it updates/students tick when it has been completed?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is it possible to view all grades for a class over multiple assignments, or just the spreadsheet showing the grades for a single assignment?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is it possible to create future assignments, so that students can look at the calendar for the year, but some assignements won't 'open' until a future submission start date?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>(edit) I remembered one final thing - can you download all assignments at once? &nbsp;At the moment, students submit their pieces and as far as I can see, I am forced to click on each name, then each piece, and then if I want to download it I have to do so from
 the Word web app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can give!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Arron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your questions:</p>
<p>1) After assignments are submitted by students, you can view their works and grades. Then, all the marks can be viewed in Detains under the assignment.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8829c96-c8e1-4617-bb6e-812672560de9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8829c96-c8e1-4617-bb6e-812672560de9" /></a></p>
<p>Regarding the form in the assignment, I suggest you first create the form and copy the form link, then, go to the assignment where you want to insert the form and click
<strong>Attach </strong>to insert the form via <strong>Link</strong>. After students submitted the form, you need to go to the assignment and click the hyperlink of the form to view the responses.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdbbd4d2-bf90-4a72-976c-9aa3476980f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdbbd4d2-bf90-4a72-976c-9aa3476980f2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The grades in each assignment shows individually. For your requirement, however, you can choose to export all grades from different assignments and combine them in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) It's not possible to create future assignments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Classroom doesn't support downloading all assignments and works. I suggest you submit&nbsp; feedback on the

<h2>            Recording a macro to insert a footer with text in Word 2010</h2>
                    I have always taught students how to record a macro inserting a footer into a document that displays their name and the file name.&nbsp; When I run the macro, information is inserted into the document - and not into the footer.&nbsp; This worked in 2007 - what do
 we need to do differently?

            In addition to what Stefan said, I'll note that you aren't doing your students any favors by teaching them to use macros for creating a footer -- it's a WordPerfect habit that shouldn't be carried over to Word. It's more in the Word way of things to create
 a template for a specific type of document, and to include the footer information in the template so it automatically appears in each document based on the template.<br />
<br />
If you want to use a simple task just to teach how to record macros, I can applaud that, but the task should be one that's more appropriate. Maybe a Replace operation that they would want to run against several documents would make a good candidate.<br />
<br />
Also, refer to <a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/ModifyRecordedMacro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/MacrosVBA/ModifyRecordedMacro.htm</a> for some useful information about the recorder.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If the task is to be able to start new documents with this information, teach them how to create a
<a href="http://addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">template</a> that has the information in the footer. Here they would want to use a DocProperty Title field or a StyleRef field referencing the Title Style and a Docproperty Author field.
 If they wanted to be able to insert that in any footer, they could save an AutoText entry with all of these for future use.<br />
<br />
These will give your students permanent skills to produce documents.<br />
<br />
Please note that macros can be written to put information into a header footer but each document has at least three spots for header/footer information. They can have many more!<br />
<br />
A really good exercise might be to have them create a letterhead following instructions at http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/Letterhead.htm. Have them set up a template for multiple page letters. Perhaps have them use a StyleRef field to pull information into
 the continuation header/footr from the body of the letter template like the date or addressee name.&nbsp; Then have them set one up with a list of the board of directors in one of the margins on the first page. Then have them do the same thing to accommodate preprinted
 letterhead.<br />
<br />
Your students will wow their employers.<br />
