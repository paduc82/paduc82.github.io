<h2>            Outlook.com settings for BlackBerry 8900 Curve - share Calendar</h2>
                    I have a BlackBerry 8900 that I would like to access the Calendar from my outlook.com account. I need the server settings to add my Outlook.com e-mail address and cannot find them, though I have searched and searched and tried various settings from the
 internet that do not work. I can add the outlook.com account but get synchronization options for Contacts only and not Calendar.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have reviewed the article from Outlook.com re mobile access (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook-to-go?woldogcb=0#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook-to-go?woldogcb=0#1TC=t1</a>) but my phone is not listed
 there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please provide the settings so that I can access the Calendar for outlook.com on my BlackBerry 8900 Curve.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi josephc55,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back. The settings cannot be found on the links that were already provided by this thread because Exchange Active Sync is currently not supported by your phone. As you can see in the link that you gave (initial post), we recommend users
 to use their mobile's web browser to access their accounts&nbsp;if their device is not available in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we suggest, as stated by the previous moderator, is that you contact your mobile manufacturer for instructions/settings on how to set up or sync your account and access your calendar on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have clarifications related to this topic, please post back. We'll be more than happy to help you.</span></p>

            I use BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) on my BlackBerry rather than BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). BIS does not support wireless synchronization for calendars other than Google Calendar. &nbsp;See BlackBerry article KB03652.
<div>There are paid third party subscription services that support it rather than the paid BES service.</div>

            My original question has been ANSWERED by myself. My last post was for information in the event someone else had the same issue. BlackBerry does not support wireless sync for Calendar for BIS, so I cannot get Outlook.com Calendar service for my phone.
<div>I understand that this forum cannot help me further. &nbsp;Thank you for your assistance.</div>

            If you expect to import a CSV file into Outlook, you'll need to have the Importers and Exporters installed.&nbsp; If they're not installed now, this requires that you have the installation source either on your hard drive or on a CD so you can install them.&nbsp;
 If you don't have your installation kit any more, then you'll have to buy or borrow one.&nbsp; They're not available for downloading legitimately and I think it unwise to truest any illegitimate download.

    <title>How do I set up multiple Contacts lists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lexus567  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up multiple Contacts lists</h2>
                    <p>Just finished importing my Outlook Express Address book entries into Outlook 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; The names, addresses etc now appear in the Outlook 2003 Address Book under&nbsp; the "Contacts" drop down selection. (The other selection is Outlook Address Book, but that is
 empty).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to sort my addresses (contacts) into more than one long listing, perhaps 2 or 3 groupings such as business, personnal, all other.&nbsp; However I dont see any way to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An internet seach let me to an article that claims you can create additional&nbsp; contacts lists as follows:&nbsp; open existing Contacts folder, on File menu select New and click Folder.&nbsp; Enter a Name and click OK to have a new Contacts folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is when I open my Address Book and click on the File menu, my selections are New Entry or New Message.&nbsp;There is no option for New Folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is&nbsp;there something wrong here&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pls advise if I am missing this option and what I need to do to set up multiple contacts folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            There is no address book in Outlook. The address book is just a view of your Contacts. Accordingly, you never use the address book view to create folders or edit Contact data in any way. You only do this in Outlook, following the directions you already
 posted.

            <p>Thanks but I think you missed the question/problem.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is set up multiple Contact folders.</p>
<p>However, if the instructions that I iterated above are correct, I can't because I do not have a File&gt;New&gt;Folder option within my Outlook Address Book. (I know they are Contacts, but the Outlook menu and Icon show Address Book and the window that opens says
 Address Book at the top).</p>
<p>So did something go wrong when I imported these addresses from OE into Outlook, or am I looking in the wrong place to do what I want?</p>
<p>The Contacts function fine and I can add/delete from the list, but I cant find a way to make any more Contact lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            I think you missed the answer. Reread the part where I clearly told you that you do not do this activity in the address book view. You do it in one of the Outlook views. To get the new folder to appear in your address book view you enable it as an emial
 address book in its properties.

            <p>For thread viewers, here is the answer to my question.</p>
<p>My Contacts were already appearing in my Address Book view, but they were all in 1 big listing called Contacts.&nbsp; What I wanted to know was how to created additonal Contact folders so I could separate my list into user type groupings such as business, personnel,
 school, etc.</p>
<p>I thought this was to be done via the opened Address Book window, but the File menu for a New Folder does not exist there.</p>
<p>What I found out was that your the Contacts that show up in the Address Book reside in a Contacts Folder that resides on the lower left hand side of the Outlook Mail pane.&nbsp; Mine was minimized to a small icon at the bottom of the pane so I did not readily
 see it.</p>
<p>So, simply click this Contacts icon and it will replace the Mail window with a Contacts window.&nbsp;Click (highlight) the Contacts folder under My Contacts, go up to File menu &gt; New &gt; Folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the folder a name, click OK and you now have another Contacts
 folder !</p>
<p>This folder will appear in the Address Book drop down and you can populate it with you contacts.</p>

            You're welcome. But you left out the important step of enabling a new Contacts Folder as an email address book so it will appear in your address book view. I included that step&nbsp;in&nbsp;my answer to your post.&nbsp;Moreover, you can create a new&nbsp;Contact folder from
 any Outlook view. You don't have to be in the Contacts view just to create a Contacts Folder as long as you specify the folder type when you create the new folder. If you're going to repeat&nbsp;my answer for "thread viewers"&nbsp;as if it was something you "found out"
 on your own,&nbsp;it would be better if you did so accurately.

            <p>You told what not to do, but not how to do what I requested (until your answer above and&nbsp;I still don't understand&nbsp;how to&nbsp;create a Contacts folder "as long as you specify the folder type when you create the new folder").&nbsp; Be that as it may:</p>
<p>Hopefully others needing to know how to "create additional Contact folders" will be helped by the information provided in this thread.</p>
<p>And, if they want to know how "to make addresses appear in the&nbsp;Address Book" once they create a Contact folder, your info will be helpful also.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Pls note, however;&nbsp;that if you create the additional Contacts Folder the way I outlined, the new Contact folder is already automatically checked as an email address book so that important step was not left out - it is not needed.</p>

<p>In most Outlook versions, only the default Contacts folder is enabled for display as an email address book by default.&nbsp;Additional Contact&nbsp;folders you create are not and must be enabled as such in their Properties.</p>

            <p>Hi Don and thanks for your help so far. I have made a recoverydrive USB on the 'other' computer as you instructed. I'm not sure exactly how to use it!! I have plugged it into the PC with the problems, switched on, and&nbsp; am able to get to the 'troubleshoot'
 menu. Not sure where to go from there, any ideas please? I have tried various troubleshoot options, but, without any joy - drives locked etc.</p>

            <p>Sorry, your reply came around 5:00 AM in my time zone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is showing drive is locked, it needs to have the System &amp; boot environment repaired.&nbsp; That can be difficult to fix, but it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer set to UEFI BIOS mode or Legacy BIOS mode?&nbsp; This affects the partition layout and hard disk initialization (GPT for UEFI or MBR for Legacy).&nbsp; Windows 7 or below needs an MBR disk to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the BIOS mode gets shifted from UEFI to Legacy or the hard disk type from AHCI to RAID or vice versa.&nbsp; Switching it back might be all you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a video that helped me when I had the "drive is locked" error.&nbsp; He has&nbsp;separate videos for UEFI and for Legacy BIOS mode.&nbsp; He goes through various things that don't work that are suggested when you look online and then shows how to fix it.</p>

    <title>Why do some programs not rescale when moving across monitors on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thedavez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do some programs not rescale when moving across monitors on Surface 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of the nice features of the Surface 3 Pro is that in a multiple monitor setup (which I use a lot), windows will scale when I drag them from my primary display to the external one(s). That is, the scaling that is done to increase the size on the high
 DPI Surface screen is removed when I drag to en external monitor with a lower DPI. Very nice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, while this is nice, it doesn't work for all windows programs. Why? My example is, of all things, PowerPoint. Word is fine. Excel is fine, Firefox is fine, so is Thunderbird, Windows Explorer, etc. But when I use PowerPoint on my external monitor, the
 ribbon bar takes up 10-15% of the screen! Add to that the menu and such and I have less than 75% of my screen for actual work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything one can do to fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for this pointer. Seems that this does, indeed, fix the problem (for me, at least).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my setup (Windows 8.1, Surface Pro 3, Office 365 - Office 15) the specific instructions are few and simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15</p>
<p>2) Right-click on powerpnt.exe.manifest and change the permission so you can modify the file</p>
<p>3) Right-click on powerpnt.exe.manifest and open with Wordpad</p>
<p>4) Change the line</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dpiAware&gt;True/PM&lt;/dpiAware&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dpiAware&gt;False/PM&lt;/dpiAware&gt;<br />
5) Save file</p>
<p>
</p><p>(at least with Office 365, you don't need to do anything in the registry as it's already looking at the external manifest file.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, line 4 seems counter-intuitive, but it's correct. Once you change this to False, Powerpoint will scale moving from high to lower DPI monitors. I've not encountered any other issues, but I've not used it for very long, yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the previous pointers/authors for this tip.</p>

<p>Hi Raoul42,</p>
<p>This issue was reported at Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident <b>EX43992</b> starting at Saturday, March 5, 2016, at 1:30 AM UTC. The user&nbsp;experience of this incident is: End users are not affected by this issue. Affected admins are unable to delegate
 mailbox permissions while using the Exchange Control Panel (ECP). A suggested workaround is: Admins may be able to use remote PowerShell to delegate mailbox permissions. Additional information and instructions can be found here. Tenant administrators can view

<p>Hey missashy, i had the same problem with the actual phone font size. It took me awhile to work out how&nbsp;to change it. Sp, here you go...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Search</strong>... then type <strong>Font Magnifier</strong>... then just use the scale (press left or right) to change the size of the font you require... then&nbsp;<strong>Option</strong> to apply.&nbsp;It'll then re-boot itself and the size of the
 font should be corrected to the one you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if it works, ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h3> stevendnorton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embed a Video in Microsoft Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to embed a tutorial video into an excel file for the user. After reading several articles, I've tried the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Developer tab --&gt; Controls --&gt; More Controls. I select Shockwave Flash Object and insert into worksheet. I then right click, select properties, and insert the MODIFIED URL per
<a href="https://trumpexcel.com/embed-youtube-video-in-excel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. The result is either a black box that is not interactive OR the YouTube preview with a caption that basically says that embedded videos are no longer allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to Insert tab --&gt; Object --&gt; Browse to file. But this leaves the video without a nice screen preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a good way to embed a video from either YouTube or my computer? I've read articles that say it's no longer supported and other articles that point to one of the two methods outlined above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Making a new pst file the default for Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Making a new pst file the default for Outlook 2013</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<p>I have installed Outlook 2013 on a new PC running Windows 7 64 bit.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It created a pst file under My Documents and sub-folder Outlook Files….. which for this conversation i will refer to as Outlook1.pst
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then made a mistake of Importing my old Outlook 2007 pst files from my old laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After I had done so, I discovered that Import leaves out some information as explained in</p>
<p>http://www.msoutlook.info/question/666</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from Windows Control Panel I added a new mail data file called Outlook2.pst and selected that pst file as the default mail data file.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into Outlook 2013, I can see the two data files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it looks like Outlook still is using the original Outlook1.pst as the default data file. &nbsp;&nbsp; All new emails are still going into the Outlook1.pst even though I specified Outlook2.pst as the default using Windows Control Panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get Outlook to use this new Outlook2.pst as the default
<span>&nbsp;</span>mail data file, and then allow me to delete the Outlook1.pst ?</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>mail data file, and then allow me to delete the Outlook1.pst ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

            <p>This is a POP3 account I assume?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the E-mail tab in Account Settings, select your account and then set the Inbox folder of Outlook2.pst as the delivery location.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After restarting Outlook, you can then safely remove the Outlook1.pst file from your mail profile.</p>

            <p>Hi AnnaP777, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum and it's my pleasure to assist you to day.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We perfectly understand how important for you to access your Microsoft account using Google Chrome without any problem. We will definitely do our best to help you in rectifying this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for us to properly address your concern, please provide an answer to the following questions that I have outlined below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you encounter any error after an attempt to to open an email or folder? If yes, can you please provide us the exact error message that you received?</li><li>Have you tried to access your Microsoft account using different computer and different web browser to see if the problem still persists?</li><li>Do other Hotmail accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer? </li><li>Did you make any changes to your account prior to this incident?</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, as our initial troubleshooting process, I highly suggest that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue. This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For assistance in clearing cache and cookies on various browsers refer to the link provided below:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also recommend that you keep your web browser up to date to get the most out of Outlook. If you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work and it might not display properly. For more information about this, please visit the
 help article below:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See below the answers to your questions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Did you encounter any error after an attempt to to open an email or folder? If yes, can you please provide us the exact error message that you received?
<p>No error displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>Have you tried to access your Microsoft account using different computer and different web browser to see if the problem still persists?
<p>Accessing from a different computer is OK. The only other browser installed on a problem computer is&nbsp; IE7 and it doesn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>Do other Hotmail accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer?
<p>Accounts that use Hotmail all work OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>Did you make any changes to your account prior to this incident?
<p>No, the problem is happening only in Outlook.com ans started because my account was upgraded from Hotmail to Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue?
<p>Yes, tried to clear temp internet files etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if it's relevant, the computer runs Windows XP.</p>
</li>

            <p>Hi AnnaP777,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information you have provided. Just to clarify, have you tried using your account on an updated browser? If not,
<span>
<font color="#000000">it is possible that you're experiencing this issue because of the version of the browser that&nbsp;you are using. We recommend that you keep your web browsers up to date to get the most out of Outlook.com. If you’re not using an updated browser,
 some parts of Outlook.com might not work and it might not display properly. Refer to this&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/supported-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for more information.<br />
<br />
</font></span>After updating your browsers, try to access your account again to&nbsp;check if the issue persists.&nbsp;You can also&nbsp;try to use a different updated browser to isolate the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, if you're using a firewall or antivirus, kindly disable it temporarily for us to determine if this is causing the problem on your account. Don't forget to enable it once you are done with the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I too cannot access the new outlook in Chrome. Everything else is perfect. When I try to open Outlook al I get is a part of the top banner but then the rest is blank. If I select calendar (as I know where it is on the menu bar) then that works - it is just
 Outlook mail that gives a blank screen???&nbsp;</p>

            Having exactly the same problem - when I log on to outlook only part of the top banner is displayed; the rest of the screen is blank. If I click refresh then the emails/menus briefly appear, but quickly disappear!!! I am using Chrome (on Windows 8.1) and
 the problem has only just occurred. This combination has worked fine in the past, the only changes have been a MS update.

                    <p>When I turn on my Lumia 520 I get this error message: "Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down". I've tried to reset phone with Nokia Software Recovery Tool, but after downloading 1,5gb package I get error that tells me my Lumia 520
 is not supported. I tried the same thing with "NSU for Retail", but I get the same error.</p>

                    I tried to access my gmail account through the trial version of outlook 365 that i downloaded, i followed the gmail directions but it will not work. i sent a question to gmail and the response was that it does not consider outlook to be a safe enough recipient
 for it's email and refuses to allow the outlook program to receive the emails from my account. have you had this comment before and are you able to convince gmail that your program is suitable and safe.

<p>This is still an issue for me, even after I updated to the latest version of Outlook (15.13.1). It is not the only calendar issue for me, either. I have also reported (through the "smiley face") that calendar invitations which I receive are always marked
 as follows "The organizer has not requested a response to this meeting", and there is no way to accept/reject the meeting invitaton without switching to calendar view, finding the meeting, and accepting it by right clicking.</p>

            This new Outlook is such a step backwards. I have the same issues. I have a rule that copes the mail locally, and once it is local I have no ability to "Accept" a calendar invite! I have to open the calendar event on the actual calendar to accept it. This
 is unacceptable and is an major bug.

    <title>Is there a maximum excel file size&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crmsa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a maximum excel file size&#63;</h2>
                    I have a document that is 315 MB and it crashes my computer every time I try to open it. I have a quad-core i5 iMac with 8 gigs of RAM. When I look at the Activity Monitor, Excel appears to use 200% of my CPU (it doesn't use all 4 cores, is that also a
 limitation of Excel??) but I still have essentially 2 more free cores and at least 4 gigs of RAM free yet Excel still hangs up. Are these limitations to Excel for Mac 2011? The file itself is large but it is mostly just plain text.

            Issues such as what you describe are typically related more to the nature of the content rather than to the volume. There are&nbsp;<a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/excel/item/91494e14-1fd0-44ff-8e76-74f3d92cfffd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Specifications
 and limits for Excel 2011</a> which you may want to examine, but File Size isn't among the specs... that's pretty much dependent on system resources.<br />
<br />
Updates, of course, are always a consideration, so confirm that Office is at 14.2.3 &amp; that your version of OS X is completely current as well.<br />
<br />
What you're encountering could be font related, though. Follow the procedure described here to address potential font conflicts then repair disk permissions &amp; restart afterwards:<br />
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Font Weeding.</strong></a><br />
<br />
I'm not technically qualified to answer about the CPU usage, etc. but at this point I doubt that there are very many programs which take full advantage of multi-core processors.<br />

            Yes, the file is in fact 313.5 MB. There are 383,000 rows and 112 columns. It is plain text, the font is the default Calibri. There are no other colors or formatting. There are no formulas, which is why I do not understand why it takes 3-5 minutes to open
 the file, and is very difficult to work with. Excel will freeze while working on the file. The issue appears to be isolated to Excel. If any other programs are open, they still work like normal when Excel is freezing. I haven't had a crash since you asked,
 it will just freeze for 10-30 seconds at a time before allowing me to continue working.&nbsp;

<div>Yes Office and Mac OS are both completely up to date. (Well I am running Lion, not Mountain Lion, but it is the latest version).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Although the file itself only uses the default font, Calibri, I went ahead and followed the steps in the Font Weeding document. Indeed, I had about 100 "Duplicated Fonts" but after finishing all the steps and restarting, it did not appear to alleviate
 my issue with Excel.</div>

            I have Excel 2010, I found yesterday that as my Excel Workbook size reaches around 400 kb the sheet I am working on locks up, and I can no longer use the vertical scroll bar to scroll up &amp; down the sheet.&nbsp; Once I deleted a few tabs and deleted that tab
 to get it below 400 kb it worked fine.

<p>
</p><p>All I can tell you is that 400k really is not a large Excel file. I have workbooks which exceed 20MB &amp; present no such problem.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to be a known problem in Ubuntu 12.04 (at least), due to switching from the video system V4L to the more recent V4L2. Many applications, like webcams, doesn't seem to work well (or at all) with V4L2. Try installing and loading some libraries
 with backward-compatibility with V4L, so that Flash sees again your Webcam, as it used to do until Ubuntu Hardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do it,&nbsp;you need to shut down any application that might be doing some use of the video: editors, instant messengers or even the internet browser, and in a terminal we'll type:
<strong>sudo apt-get install ld.so.preload-manager&nbsp;</strong>after that, execute: <strong>
sudo ld.so.preload-manager /usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so</strong>&nbsp;then, you have to switch the video mode to V4L from the multimedia systems selector, through executing:
<strong>gstreamer-properties&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Video tab, and change the default value to V4L. Check if this will work for you!</p>

<p>If you bought a new laptop it should have Office 2010 on it, not 2007. Or is this a "new" reconditioned computer.</p>
<p>Did you get an Office installation disk and plastic box? The Office product key will be on it, look on the back side for a yellow label with black text.</p>
<p>Go back to the computer vendor and ask them where the product key is. It may be on your receipt. They will&nbsp;probably tell you that you&nbsp;only have a trial version and will have to pay to buy a product key.</p>
<p>If you do have to buy a product key, make sure it is a full "FPP" version. Read this article that describes the differences between full and media less versions:</p>

    <title>multiple fonts in one style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loveps  say:</h3>
<h2>            multiple fonts in one style</h2>
                    I`m developing a template for my client`s user manuals. They want the beginning of each chapter to appear on 3 lines as<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Lesson</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">1</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Objective</span><br />
<br />
then for the Table of Contents to appear on 2 lines as<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Lesson 1<br />
Objective&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Lesson 2<br />
Objective&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</span><br />
<br />
The crux of my problem is that they want each line of the chapter heading to be in a different font (different colour and size). There`s also the question about splitting the Table of contents entry into the 2 lines.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me how to do this without a macro­?<br />

            <p>You can include the word "Lesson" as part of the numbering. For an example, see the multilevel list that has "Chapter 1" as the first level. You can type a limited (but fairly generous) amount of text before or after an auto number in the "Enter formatting
 for number" box.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, however, it will definitely be tricky because you've already got "Lesson" as the text of the first line and a number (either auto or manual) as the content of the second. (BTW, I wouldn't advise wasting built-in headings on all
 of these paragraphs unless you've just got plenty to spare.)</p>
<p>Perhaps someone else can suggest another approach, but the only options that occur to me are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don't have lower-level numbering based on the lesson number, then type this number manually instead of using auto numbering. The "1" will then be plain text, and you can add "Lesson" and a space as "numbering" without any actual number ("Number style"
 set to "(none)"). </li><li>You could use a TC field to supply the content for that TOC entry. Since you could include the word "Lesson" in the TC field, you wouldn't even have to bother adding "numbering" to the TOC style. One approach would be to type the number in the TC field
 manually (continuing to use an auto number for the actual paragraph). Another would be to use a REF or StyleRef field to pick up the autonumber in the TC field. Note that if you choose a StyleRef field, you have to put the TC field in the following paragraph
 (assumed to be in a different style); otherwise you'll get an error message.</li></ol>
<p>The second option would require a lot of monkeying with the TOC field to fine-tune it. At the very least you'd need to ensure that the TOC includes TC fields (represented by checking the "Table entry fields" box in the Table of Contents Options dialog) and
 otherwise&nbsp;omits the entry for that particular style (not a problem if it's not a built-in heading style and has an outline level of "Body text").</p>
<p>I'm sorry if that all sounds very confusing. It <strong>is</strong> very confusing, and there will doubtless be a good bit of trial and error involved, but if you conquer this challenge, I assure you you will feel a terrific sense of accomplishment!</p>

<h2>            program&#47;protocol association</h2>
                    We're running into an interesting (and frustrating) problem. &nbsp;We have IE9 installed on Windows 7, and I also have IE9 installed on Windows Server 2008 R2. &nbsp;We have an installer that creates an association for the ssh:// protocol. &nbsp;This installer inserts
 a key into the registry for the protocol.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Specifically, it sets the default open action (REG_SZ) for the ssh protocol.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Windows 7, entering a URL in IE9 like: ssh://admin:password@somehost will open Tera Term and connect to the specified host. &nbsp;However, in IE9 on Windows 2008 R2, despite an identical registry key (and Tera Term installed in said referenced location),
 IE9 displays the message (as if it is not reading the registry key at all):</div>

<h2>            Migrate Office 2013 &#40;VLK&#41; Settings to O365 ProPlus Installation</h2>
                    
<p>We have a number of machines that currently have Office 2013 Pro (VLK) on them and I'm looking to install Office 365 (2016) on them, but I'm running into an inconvenience, more than a problem.</p>
<p>I've tried a number of different ways to deploy O365 while uninstalling Office 2013 to these machines and no matter which way I do it Outlook does not retain its settings unless O365 is installed side-by-sdie and Outlook is opened (to migrate settings) prior
 to Office 2013 being uninstalled.</p>
<p>Is there a way to either:<br />
1) Uninstall Office 2013 and retain the settings for the O365 installation, or<br />
2) Install O365 and instruct it to use the existing settings during installation?</p>
<p>I'd like to install O365 and uninstall Office 2013 in one fell swoop while keeping the existing settings, but I'm trying to avoid having a bunch of users re-sync thier Outlook profiles.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
