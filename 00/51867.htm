<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF on Windows 10 defaults to Documents to save PDF when printing a web page</h2>
                    I don't get the dialogue box asking where I want to save the PDF.&nbsp; It goes right to Documents.&nbsp; Is there a fix?

</p><p><span><span>Hi Merrilee, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest in Windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We apologize for the inconvenience caused. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I'd be glad to help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In Windows 10, there is an easy way to change the default save locations for your files under Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Just search from the Start Menu for "default save locations" and then click/tap the top search result:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>That will open the settings page for the system storage and default save locations:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The top half of the page shows the connected hard drives on your system and below it you can use the drop down menu to select a new storage location for your personal files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can choose just one of them or all of them although only saving certain types to the secondary hard drive defeats the purpose of saving files on a separate hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Unfortunately, the change default save locations in Windows 10 does not prompt you to move the files from one location to the other. This means you can end up with files in two different locations.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow these steps in the links, given in the Microsoft KB articles, mentioned below:</span></span></p>

            <p>I also have this problem.&nbsp; If I select the Microsoft PDF or XPS or any print to file, the resulting file ends up in c:\Documents.&nbsp; If I save a file down to my PC from the internet, it saves it to C:\Downloads.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not open up a window that allows me to save the document to the directory of my choice or to even name the file.&nbsp; This causes me to have to find the new file, change the name by doing a Rename and then cut and pasting it to the directory
 of my choice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go back to the way it was in every other edition of Windows.&nbsp; Whoever assumed that customers would want the default save locations predetermined was wrong.&nbsp; I tried changing the "default save locations" for windows 10 and it does not give me any other
 choice except for C:\.&nbsp; It does not allow me to choose a directory.&nbsp; Please return this feature to the old way of opening a window, specifying a location and a file name in one of the next update releases.</p>
<p>

            <p>The problem is not with being able to print.&nbsp; It does print.&nbsp; What it doesn't do is allow you to choose where you want the print file to end up; it defaults to documents.&nbsp; Than you have to go search for the file and move it to where you want it.&nbsp; I know
 you can change the default by going into settings, but to have to do this BEFORE you print each time is efficient.&nbsp; Bring back the dialog box that allows you to choose where the file lands.&nbsp; This is only an issue with Edge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forced me to go back to using IE as my default browser.</p>

Are you kidding me? This has nothing to do with the problem user is describing. Microsoft Default Storage location is the issue.

    <title>DVI cables&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graeme4637  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVI cables&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to connect my Xbox 360 to my TV so that I can get an HD picture. The TV is HD ready but does not have HDMI ports or component ports. It does however have a DVI in port also described as PC/HD. I ordered a HDMI to DVI cable that arrived today and
 having fitted it I now have a cracking picture but no sound.</p>
<p>Has anyone been here and done this or is there someone out there who can help?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>If the TV is HD ready it would have Comp or HDMI not just DVI.</p>
<p>If it is a monitor that is more believable. </p>
<p>DVI does not transfer sound, HDMI does - you will not be able to get sound out of your current setup.</p>
<p>IF you use a xbox VGA cable, and get an adapter from VGA to DVI then you will have the AV cables for sound that you can plug in.

<p>On a 360 S console, you can use the optical port for audio out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the original 360 console a thin AV port audio breakout is required for optical. This breakout also provides left/right analog audio out and works with the 360 S console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thin AV adapter comes with the older HDMI AV kit. Not sure if it's still bundled with the new kit. You can also find it on eBay.</p>

<p>Thanks people.</p>
<p>Cables are fine sagers</p>
<p>Juan, it is an early HD ready TV that has scart and composite for TV or DVI for PCs and consoles.</p>
<p>Ice storm, I think you've come closest. I did get the thin optical/av adapter but the problem was getting the sound to the TV as the only audio in seemed to be the red and white composite sockets. Unfortunatly the TV would not recognise the input from these
 when the signal was coming through the DVI port. I have just found a DVI audio socket tucked away underneath that seems to take a 3.5mm stereo jack.</p>
<p>My solution is this - Video feed now runs from HDMI on the back of the xbox to the DVI port (HDMI to DVI cable £2 on amazon) on the Telly and above that I've used the thin optical xbox adapter with 2 x RCA cable running to a 2xRCA to 3.5mm stereo jack into
 the DVI audio in on the telly.</p>
<p>Just ordered the jack converter of amazon for 60p and will let you know if it all works when it arrives.</p>
<p>Ps. The obvious answer of optical to DVI doesn't seem to exist.</p>

<p>I used the HDMI to DVI Cable. &nbsp;Then modified the cable that came with my 360 so I could plug it in at the same time as the HDMI. To carry the sound. &nbsp; Everything works great picture is very good for an older HDTV with only the component or DVI input for
 HD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a hack saw and cut the plastic barrier off then taped around the audio/video cable that my 360 came with. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this can damage the console? &nbsp;I figure they must block thier cable off with all that plastic either so you have to buy thier component cable package or your not supposed to plug both thier cable and a &nbsp;HDMI cable in at the same time.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>My TV is to old so I don't think S/PDIF is an option. </p>

<p>If you check on eBay you can typically find used or OEM HDMI AV adapters for $5 - $10. The HDMI AV adapter has one end that is thin enough to fit into the AV port alongside the HDMI port. The other end has a breakout with left/right RCA jacks for analog
 audio and an optical audio port.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Other than that, you'll need an RCA to &lt;something&gt; audio cable. Usually it's an RCA to stero mini-plug adapter cable. They're pretty cheap and can be found on Amazon, Monoprice, and other cabling sites.</p>

    <title>Cannot ping server or default gateway Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevorpast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot ping server or default gateway Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So over the past couple of weeks my DSL connection keeps dropping. Well, actually, to be clear the connection remains stable, but it fails to "ping primary domain name server" and "ping default gateway." I've done a ton of troubleshooting and changing settings,
 ip's MAC adresses, etc. What I have discovered is that this problem only occurs when this specific PC is connected to the internet (it is via powerline adapter, but the adapter is perfectly fine). It does not happen when I boot the PC in safe mode. I tried
 reinstalling network adapters and editing my antivirus programs, and I even disabled windows firewall. Nothing works but safemode with networking. Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the assistance required to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided, I suspect that the issue might be&nbsp;due to&nbsp;a third party application causing conflict in your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you try connecting your PC directly to the Ethernet cable and check if the issue replicates. If so, I suggest that you place your PC in Clean Boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To learn how to place your
 PC in&nbsp;Clean Boot click&nbsp;on the link below</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1. In Clean Boot, your internet services and drivers will be disabled. In the step where you have to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft&nbsp;services, I suggest that you choose the drivers and services related to your Network drivers and uncheck them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>DISCLIAMER:</span></strong></span><strong><span><span>Please go through the section:
 How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps</span></span></p>

<p>I have the same issue: I cannot install build 1803 as I have an Intel 600p SSD, however I've seen that in update&nbsp;kb4100403 the problem of compatibility has been resolved so I wonder why it's still impossible to perform the update.<br />
<br />
What's even more hilarious on this issue (at least for what it concerns myself) is that I had build 1803 previously (before the check was adopted) and I was one of those having no problems whatsoever, however I had to reinstall the OS for another reason and
 now I'm stuck with build 1709.<br />
<br />
Any idea on when this issue will be fixed? Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:<br />
<br />
It seems I didn't read everything in&nbsp;kb4100403 as it seems that 1803 with the correction will be available tomorrow (25th of May) on Windows Update. Fingers' crossed....</p>

<h2>            Sorry, we are unable to complete your realm purchase. Maybe check your internet connection&#63;</h2>
                    I get this error message every time I try and use my 30 day free trial of realms that is advertised on the home screen of Minecraft. Ive checked my internet, switched internets, and it dtiks doesn't work. I am on a college campus so that may make a difference.
 Ive used thebpiblic wifi and the gaming wifi.

<p>Hey so I'm here with the same issue .I had 3 other friends try to use their free 30 day Realm trial and none of them could.&nbsp; We are all met with the same prompt .Would be really nice to have because we are considering playing long term, but aren't settled
 on the idea of paying for a Realm.&nbsp; We came to the conclusion that we would try it to see if it's even worth it vs.us just scheduling a time we can all play so that way we don't have to pay anything.&nbsp; But we can't even do that.&nbsp; Can this be fixed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; Just to see if it would work, I tried purchasing a 2-Player Realm and that didn't even work. I literally can't buy a Realm.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Community for advice on how to handle this issue.

<p>I can understand how not being able get a realm started could be frustrating. </p>
<p>This more than likely would be due to the Xbox Live Service outage that our services are currently experiencing. Though our engineers are aware&nbsp; of the situation and currently working on it, there is no expected time of resolution at the moment, although
 it's best for you to keep updated at our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>As stated before, several of our customers are experiencing similar issues due to the Service Alert.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, currently the only thing that can be done is to wait for the service alert with Minecraft to be resolved on our end.

            After multiple tries, my online friends and I are still recieving the same prompt when attempting to purchase either kind of realm on Xbox One: “Unable to connect to Realms and complete your purchase at this time. Please try again later.” Is this issue
 unrelated? How’s that service fix going?

<h2>            Enabling SendKeys</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need SendKeys to work in Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; It is being invoked by a VBA application and I am unable to change the source code, it needs to be made to work.</p>
<p>I have a number of customers for whom it is not working but on my Win 7 desktop and laptop it is working (using same application as customer), and I can't remember what I did to make it work.&nbsp; If my customers disable UAC it works, but this is not an acceptable
 solution and it isn't disabled in my configuration where it is working.</p>
<p>Plrase help. TIA.</p>

<p>Get rid of McAfee and replace it with a less intrusive virus scanner, e.g. Microsoft Security Essentials (http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/).</p>
<p>You can modify any registry key if you first seize ownership. The process can be tedious: You often have to start at the deepest level: Seize ownership, change the permissions, move up one level, seize ownership etc. etc.</p>

<p>The SendKeys method does work in Windows 7. If it does not work on your customers' machines then there is something else causing the problem. I recommend you repost your question in a VBA forum.</p>
<p>You can test the SendKeys method like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a folder c:\Scripts. </li><li>Use notepad.exe to create the file c:\Scripts\Test.vbs. </li><li>Make sure this file has a .vbs extension instead of a .txt extension. </li><li>Copy and paste the lines below into Test.vbs. </li><li>Save and close Test.vbs. </li><li>Open a Command Prompt. </li><li>Type this command and press enter:<br />
cscript //nologo&nbsp; c:\Scripts\Test.vbs </li></ol>
<p>Set oWshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")<br />
oWshShell.sendkeys("Hello World")<br />

<h2>            XBOX original plays on XBOX ONE X</h2>
                    <p>Thank you so much "Phil Spencer" for making sure "XBOX original games" will play on XBOX&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;X (the original XBOX&nbsp;had DVD tray/lazer issues &amp; the console was pulled of the market to soon, making it rare to find&nbsp;a new one).&nbsp;The original XBOX had some of the greatest video games of all time (I hope we see the entire XBOX original library &amp;&nbsp;all of the games XBOXLIVE multi-player features &amp;&nbsp;DLC available again). I myself would buy the original XBOX&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;if it was made available again (I also would like to play original XBOX games on XBOXLIVE again as well).&nbsp;Thanks again Microsoft from JAZENOX! P.S. all interest in Playstation is gone now!</p>

                    Anyone have any ideas on how to fix the user account picture on the lock screen. Does not show at all. Tried redoing the picture in the Program Data folder. That did not work. When I try to change the picture I get this message: Setting the Account Picture
 failed. Please try again. Any ideas would be helpful.&nbsp; I'm thinking it might be a setting in the Registry file but cannot find any settings.

<p>Hi Sifu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error typically occurs if your copy of Windows is not activated or is non-genuine. If Windows is genuine and activated, I suggest that you follow the steps provided below to rectify the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Navigate to the following folder in the <strong>File Explorer</strong> window:
<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures</strong></li><li>In the <strong>User Accounts Pictures</strong> folder, you’ll see the default user account pictures. You’ll just need to replace these pictures with your desired picture for user account. There are
<strong>guest.bmp</strong> (<em>448×448</em>&nbsp;px.), <strong>guest.png</strong> (<em>448×448</em>&nbsp;px.),
<strong>user.bmp</strong> (<em>448×448</em>&nbsp;px.), <strong>user.png</strong> (<em>448×448</em>&nbsp;px.),
<strong>user-40.png</strong> (<em>40×40</em>&nbsp;px.) and <strong>user-200.png</strong> (<em>200×200</em>&nbsp;px.) pictures.</li><li>Replace the default ones with the image you want to use as user account picture using the same format and size.</li><li>Restart your PC and see if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p><br />
Let us know how it turns out. </p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Since replacing the photos in the <strong>User Accounts Pictures</strong> folder didn't make any difference, another suggestion is to rename the
<strong>SystemData</strong> folder. This step will require you to take ownership of the files and folders in order to make modifications. This is because system files and folders are owned by the
<strong>TrustedInstaller</strong>. By default, almost all system files, system folders and even registry keys in Windows 10 are owned by a special built-in user account called TrustedInstaller.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To take ownership of the files and folders:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the file or folder and go to <strong>Properties</strong> window. Under
<strong>Properties</strong>, click on <strong>Security </strong>tab.</li><li>In the next window, you will see that you don’t have any permission to change it. In such cases, you need to take ownership of the file or folder. To do so click on
<strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change </strong>and enter the object name. You should type your
<strong>Windows username</strong> as the object name, then click <strong>OK</strong>. You should then be able to see that the owner has changed.</li><li>Click on <strong><span>Replace owner on <span>subcontainers</span> and object</span></strong> and click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Once you click on <strong>Apply</strong>, you’ll see a warning message. Just click on
<strong>Yes </strong>to proceed. Then, you will need to click <strong>OK</strong> twice.</li><li>Now, under the <strong>Advanced permissions</strong>, you will see a change, and you will see the option to add Multiple Objects. To add multiple objects and to inherit permission you can click on
<strong>Change</strong> <strong>Permissions</strong>.</li><li>To inherit permissions, click on <strong>Enable inheritance</strong>. To add a new object, click on
<strong>Add</strong>, and click on <strong>Select a Principal</strong> and type in the object name.</li><li>Now,&nbsp; you can enable the <strong>Basic Permission</strong>. If you want to enable advanced permission, click&nbsp;on
<strong>Show advanced permissions</strong>.</li><li>Once you complete everything,&nbsp;click <strong>OK </strong>and close the window. You should be able to delete the particular folder or file.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After taking ownership of the files and folders, proceed with the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong> and go to <strong>View</strong> tab. Make sure
<strong>Hidden items</strong> option is checked.</li><li>Navigate to following folder in the <strong>File Explorer</strong> window <em>
(Substitute <strong>C:</strong> with your system root drive. <strong>ProgramData</strong> folder is hidden folder by default.)</em>:&nbsp;<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows</strong>
</li><li>Scroll down and look for <strong>SystemData</strong> folder. Rename this folder to something else, so that we can fix the account picture error – as this folder is root cause.
<br />
</li><li>Restart your system and try to setup account picture.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the results. </p>

<h2>            Huge saved seaches folder</h2>
                    I discovered a 60Gb saved searches folder in my netbook (Windows 7 Starter). After careful consideration, I deleted it and emptied the recycle bin, but when it told me how much it was deleting it didn't seem the folder was there. I found no more room available
 after this. I have a feeling I only deleted the folder itself but not the contents, which I am now unable to locate and get rid of. Thanks in advance for your suggestions...&nbsp;

            Search folders don't take up any space, they just show where files are.&nbsp; So if you deleted it, all the files are still in the original location (such as inside your Music, Video, or Downloads folders).

            Thank you, Shawn. I'm trying to make space, and other info generated by me does not amount to 60Gb. The system does not tell me about anything else I can safely delete. Can system files (i.e., files that my activity generates that I am not aware of) get
 that big/numerous? Do you have any cleanup suggestions? Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>Sure thing.&nbsp; My best recommendation is to use the built-in Cleanup tool.&nbsp; It can identify and safely remove unnecessary files.&nbsp; You have to run it twice to do a full clean (once in normal mode to clean up files from your account, and then again to clean
 up system files).&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open your Start menu, type <strong>clean</strong> and choose the cleanup option that appears:<br />
<em>(this works on Windows 8 also, just type 'clean" into the Start screen and results will appear)</em><br />

    <title>Corrupted Display Driver&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoe lee ly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted Display Driver&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using this desktop (Dell Optiplex 9020) for nearly 4 years now and there have been no problems with it until the display started glitching at around April this year. The display adapter is AMD Radeon HD 8490. (Results from the DirectX Diagnostic
 Tool are available through the link attached at the bottom of this post)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display would be filled with opaque squares alternatively showing red or light blue color (sometimes other colors would appear but rare) and the original color/text&nbsp;whenever I enabled my display adapter in the device manager. There were also cases where
 red or light blue squares appear only sparsely and randomly on screen. Further, sometimes the entire screen would turn black for a couple of seconds before going back to normal, and it could be repeated multiple times. Notifications saying that the display
 adapter has fully recovered would appear many times afterwards. Sometimes the squares would even appear in the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't really care about the problem until it got progressively worse. The &nbsp;squares on the screen began to appear more and more frequently until the entire display would freeze and not respond for 5~10 minutes. Thereafter the display would still continue
 to glitch. On some occasions the computer notified me that it has to be restarted due to some fatal errors (such only happened when the display driver was enabled). Once there was a Blue Screen Error. However I cannot remember the error code written on it
 (my impression is that it is "TDR timeout" though).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago, there were times when the machine appeared to be perfectly normal when I started it, meaning no dots would appear. But when I tried to play games such as World of Tanks and League of Legends, the game would crash after 5-7 minutes. However,
 since about one or two months ago, there has never been an instance that the glitch never happens until I switch off the machine, even when I do not play any game at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I have done trying to fix the problem:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;I've tried uninstalling the driver in device manager and reinstalling it automatically by restarting the computer.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>I've tried installing the latest version of the AMD drivers from their website.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>I've tried installing recommended drivers for my computer model from the Dell website. I also updated all my drivers using the Dell update manager.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>I've tried updating the driver manually via device manager.</p>
<p>I've used the Dell Support Assist app to check for any system issues but all devices/drivers were reported to be normal. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool also stated that no problems have been found in the system</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read from the AMD support website that I could do a clean installation of the OS and clean the system registry for any corrupted files. But that is the last thing I want to do because I have a lot of files on my desktop that I would need to backup. I'm
 scared that I may mess up the process. So I am trying to fine whether there are any other alternative solutions to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading my lengthy email!</p>

<p>I'm currently using the Microsoft Basic Display Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> The Blue Screen Error happened again today and the error message was VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE(atikmpag.sys).</p>

<p>Hi Zoe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heat could be part of the issue. Even normal levels of heat could cause a single component to fail, which results in a Blue Screen error. Games pushes the system and graphics to probably beyond its limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>VIDEO_TDR timeouts</strong> have 2 different bug checks if the video driver resets in an alloted time (</span><span>30000ms or 30 seconds)
</span><span>and we believe you experienced both.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">0x117</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> - the video driver ultimately does recover</span></span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><span><em>"</em></span><em> Thereafter the display would still continue to glitch. On some occasions the computer notified me that it has to be restarted due to some fatal errors (such only happened when the display driver was enabled).

<ul>
<li><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">0x116</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> - video driver was unable to recover. Thus, BSOD occurs.</span></span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>"The Blue Screen Error happened again today and the error message was VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE(atikmpag.sys)."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest running the system in Safe Mode (F8 before Windows loads). If the Blue Screen ceased, you likely have a video card or chip that's beginning to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>forgetting to turn off your xbox won't mess up the disk unless you left it on for weeks, if you moved the xbox while it was playing the disk it can be ringed and break.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>chances are you just need to clear your cache.</p>

<p>not 100% sure, google it, but I think game cache clears when you switch games, put a new game in the tray, play it for 10 mins then go back to it.. &nbsp;there is other ways, but google it, plus you can clear system cache from the settings menu under storage,
 but this wipes ALL game updates, which means every game you put in you will have an update.</p>

/RestoreHealth</strong>, you will notice the process will seem stuck at 20% or 40%, but it's normal behavior depending on the severity of any possible broken components of the operating system. After few minutes, the operation will finish as expected and will
 provide you the results. Once the process is complete, restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If method 1 does not resolve your concern, we suggest you to create a new user account (Local account to Microsoft account) as the current profile might have broken components. You can do the following:</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>Menu</strong>, click <strong>Settings
</strong>and then<strong> Accounts.<br />
</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Family &amp; other users</strong>, click on <strong>Add someone else to this computer.</strong></li><li>A new window will appear that says <strong>How will this person sign in?</strong>, select
<strong>I don't have this person's sign-in information</strong> at the bottom part of the window.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Let's create your account window</strong>, select <strong>Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong> option at the bottom part of the window to have an option to create a Local account.<br />
</li><li>Under Create an account for this PC windows, enter your preferred temporary user name on the textbox
<strong>Who's going to use this PC?</strong> and click Next button.</li><li>Sign out from the user profile which that has a problem, then select and sign in to the user you've just created. Wait for a while to complete the preparation of the new account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete the old User Profile:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step is we need to delete the old profile. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> <strong>Menu</strong>, click <strong>Settings
</strong>and then<strong> Accounts.<br />
</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Family &amp; other users</strong>, left click the old user account to have the options appear.</li><li>Select <strong>Remove</strong>, select <strong>Yes</strong> if prompted by <strong>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having an issue with signing in to <strong>Feedback</strong> <strong>Hub</strong> app, there's a possibility that the app has a corrupted component. We can resolve it by following the two methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 - Fixing broken system component using </strong><strong>Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM)</strong>
<strong>tool:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Resolving it by using the built-in&nbsp;<strong>Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM)</strong> tool. It is a tool to&nbsp;update the system files and correct the problem on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the command, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Windows key + X</strong> keyboard shortcut to open the <strong>
Power User</strong> menu and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></li><li>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While the running <strong>DISM</strong> using the <strong>
/RestoreHealth</strong>, you will notice the process will seem stuck at 20% or 40%, but it's normal behavior depending on the severity of any possible broken components of the operating system. After few minutes, the operation will finish as expected and will

<p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>Thank you for trying to help but neither DISM /RestoreHealth nor a new user Account solves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I modified your "Method 2"&nbsp;steps to simply create a new user account so that, from that new account, I could simply try Feedback Hub without having to delete the original account. Your "Method 2" is quite drastic for me to do exactly because you are asking
 me to completely delete an existing user account before even seeing if the new user account solves the issue. I cannot be certain, but I don't believe you mean to do that specifically, but can you clarify? Anyway, I approached "Method 2" by skipping deleting
 the original profile/account, and just testing Feedback Hub from a newly created account. Is that an OK test?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While logged into the new profile/account, Feedback Hub exhibited the same issues (details below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feeling is that this is an app issue with Feedback Hub or something it interacts with... I have no other issues with any other apps. The nature of this failure is that Feedback Hub apparently wants to log in so it lets me enter credentials or select
 an account and after I choose/enter an account, something fails and drops back to "Please sign in page." Is there a way to extract diagnostic information so that we can see what error codes/messages are causing the login failure?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I took:</p>
<p>Method #1: Exactly as you specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method #2: </p>
<ol>
<li>I did everything in the "<strong>Create new Local User account</strong>" section.</li><li>I skipped everything in the "<strong>Delete the old User Profile</strong>" ... let me know if this step is essential to testing the new account... I cannot imagine how deleting the old profile would be required but that's
 a guess of mine. It is not an option for me to delete my primary admin user account in a situation like this where I depend on that account daily and there seems to be no apparent user profile or account issue, rather there is only a single app failing to
 accomplish one thing (authentication).&nbsp;</li><li>Without deleting the old user account, I "Switch Users" to log into the newly created account.&nbsp;</li><li>I see the usual "let's get started" or "setting up..." sort of messages.&nbsp;</li><li>Once at desktop, I see a balloon which I think is unrelated but in case you want to know... it says "An app default was reset ... An app caused a problem with the default app setting for .pdf files, so it was reset to Microsoft Edge."&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ebdec93-1576-47b6-924c-00d8858d4a1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ebdec93-1576-47b6-924c-00d8858d4a1a" /><br />
</a></li><li>I start Feedback Hub, enter credentials for my live.com account, and since I have dual-auth setup, my cellphone receives the Microsoft approval query which I accept.&nbsp;</li><li>I select "Sign in to just this app."&nbsp;</li><li>It bounces back to the "Please sign in" screen. The endless loop described in my first post occurs (see screenshots there).&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any knowledge on what event logs might contain helpful diagnostic information regarding Feedback Hub and the facilities it uses to accomplish authentication? I see nothing interesting in the usual App, System, Security logs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically I'm using a live.com account which two-step verification active. I assume Feedback Hub works with such accounts. I'm thinking it might be helpful if there were a way to find out why Feedback Hub is failing, like an error it receives when trying
 to do something, or perhaps an error some subsystem logs while doing an operation on behalf of Feedback Hub. Right now Feedback Hub isn't showing any specific error messages... is there a way perhaps to get Feedback Hub to provide more info?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Thanks for the suggestion but I see no change after performing those steps. Sign in fails as described in my prior posts. I should mention, when I ran the Get-AppXPackage...Register command from an elevated console, it seemed many
 of the register operations succeeded just fine, but there were a few error messages such as the following...</p>

            <p>Windows 10 Insider build 14955 has just been published and one of the fixes listed in the release notes is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We fixed the issue causing you to be unable to sign into apps such as Feedback Hub, Groove, MSN News, etc. with your Microsoft Account if you sign out or get signed out of these apps."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would say this is indeed a general problem and not a issue with corrupted apps.</p>

    <title>Random app crash and black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rafa korpak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random app crash and black screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm lately encountering alarming issue. I'm having (rather old) Dell Inspiron N5010. While using it for daily tasks such as: browsing the internet, watching videos on youtube, facebook, nothing that would have major 'influence' on the available resources.<br />
For no apparent reason my browser likes to crash (like, a lot - I've tried re-launching it but firefox crashes again and till next reboot I'm not able to do anything).<br />
Sometimes just before browser crashing, my screen goes black for about 1 second and goes back to normal, but firefox crashes anyways. Same thing happens while using discord (and pretty much anything else)<br />
<br />
about week before I have updated Windows with windows update (one of the updates was KB4100347 - Issues started appearing after I've got it installed)<br />
unfortunately uninstalling it didn't really help and I have rushed to reinstall ( I think) all of the drivers. (not with windows update, it is blocked right now - I'm not going to let it install that update again, I've read it is known to cause some issues)<br />
After reinstalling drivers regarding GPU (I've got dedicated AMD GPU) I was hoping it would stop, but it didn't of course.<br />
<br />
At this point when screen goes black (sometimes it goes for a second and apps are crashing at the same time, sometimes it stays for a looong time and I am forced to shutdown my laptop with power button (I tried putting it into sleep and wake it up afterwards
 but it behaves like I'd literally turn the monitor off) and sometimes - as I've said before - apps are crashing, just like that.<br />
<br />
I have been reinstalling Firefox, I've tried using Chrome - same thing happened with other apps.<br />
<br />
I am looking for any suggestions on what could be the issue/how to fix it, I was considering reinstalling windows completely but I cannot afford losing all of my data (I'm not having storage with enough space to back up everything)
<br />
<br />
Some information about my laptop:<br />
Dell Inspiron N5010<br />
i5 430M<br />
AMD mobility Radeon HD 5000 series<br />
8GB RAM<br />
1TB HDD<br />
<br />
Hopefully that's enough and I've presented it in a clear way - I can provide more information if needed, just tell me what to do.<br />
I'm sorry for my English, it's not my primary language and I can make some mistakes here and there.<br />

            Hi Rafal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.

<br />Check the Flash Players on each browser with this tool:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hello  Rafał.
<br />
<br />Thank for good explanations.
<br />
<br />The issue could be deeper that just apps issue. Your device model is not supported by Windows 10. You can check this on the manufacturer website -&gt; <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/uk/en/ukbsdt1/product-support/product/inspiron-15-intel-n5010/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/uk/en/ukbsdt1...</a>
<br />
<br />This was developed only for Vista and Windows 7, for other OS unfortunately there are no any drivers. 
<br />
<br />You mentioned hat you had some issue before and blocked updates, new updates required new drivers and without them no one could say how device would work or would be in general.
<br />
<br />In this case I can suggest you better to come to Windows 7, it has all drivers and should work fine. In other way you should come back to Windows 10 build (last one, where your device was working fine), but for this you should have ISO (on official resources we can find only newest one) and always find a way to block updates, because they will bring an issue back (options to block updates are not recommended via security reason).
<br />
<br />Best choice to use OS supported by your manufacturer.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions

            Yes, I am aware that my device is (kinda) not supported if it comes to Windows 10 (though a while back when I was having W7 which was happening few years back I believe - application for updating to W10 did show no errors and that my device will work well,
 and it did work with no issues)<br />
<br />
Everything started to fall apart after installing that one update from WU (and as I've mentioned in my main post, uninstalling it didn't help)<br />
<br />
After deleting it - I'm back at build 1803 (W10 home) <br />
I think it will be necessary to reinstall whole windows to that build or just go back to W7 I guess :/ (if nothing will help, the thought of installing everything is overwhelming)

            I have checked the Flash Player and it seems like I'm having the latest version of it (though I have re-installed it just in case).<br />
<br />
I have also checked drivers in device manager and downloaded them from DELL's website, didn't see any difference but installed them anyways (I was not able to install new BIOS - I've already got latest version - which btw is quite old)<br />
<br />
I have also looked at everything in startup (there are only few apps in there, tray icons - for antivirus and 2 apps regarding my mouse and headphones)<br />
I've also scanned my laptop with Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, Adwcleaner with no issues found, now I'm waiting for "sfc /scannow" scan in cmd to finish.<br />
<br />
EDIT: sfc /scannow said there is nothing wrong<br />
"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
I'm gonna test the laptop for today to check if the issue still persists - if it will happen again I'll continue with other tests (maybe drivers I've installed helped in some way)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if I'd use media creation tool to update windows - will I be able to rollback to current version/uninstall that cursed update if anything goes wrong? Will I lose my applications? (if that's important I've got only 1 partition, with system and
 everything else in it)<br />

            If you're referring to October Version 1809 it was withdrawn and is now released to the Windows Insider Program Slow Ring for more testing.  So you would be upgrading to version 1803 which is latest stable version.  If you already have it then running it would be a Repair install which does solve most problems.  
<br />
<br />For an older PC you might have driver problems.  If you're receiving Blue Screen crashes see if you can locate the crash file to post it back for analysis:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Will repair install delete any of my files? (programs, apps from store, documents, just making sure because I haven't tried that before)<br />
So far I have never got BSOD while using Windows 10. I guess that could be a good thing?<br />
Yes, I have tried before resetting browsers (I have restarted firefox the same way as described on mentioned by you website, with no positive results)<br />
Chrome on the other hand was clear installation, I didn't have it previously - got it only to check if it will also crash like Firefox (yes, it was crashing)<br />
<br />
I am 100% sure that this is either problem with Windows or drivers - I have booted into Linux just to check if I'll encounter any problems (from my usb stick) and it works well, nothing is crashing, no errors<br />

            Repair install will save your files, apps and most settings in place while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />But Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can copy or drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can buy additional space for cheap.
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>I'll definitely take care of the backups, I am aware that if (or rather, when) my HDD will fail - I'm gonna lose everything.<br />
<br />
I have just "upgraded" my laptop, though it was rather difficult because of the issue I was having (not sure if it still exists)<br />
<br />
I have downloaded media creation tool and run it to do it's job - but while it was finishing getting the updates (I had no option to disable it while going through the updating process) - monitor went black and I couldn't do anything - It was not installing
 yet, if that would happen during installation process, some damage would be done.<br />
<br />
<em>That's why I've downloaded ISO file from other laptop that I have at home and got it into my USB stick. I managed to install it without any interference and/or data loss.</em><br />
<br />
I'll post new reply in this thread, if the issue will appear once again, hopefully it went away.<br />
My new question is, should I let it download updates? I have installed it without downloading them (because I was sure that it would once again throw black screen at me during download process)<br />
Would it be best to disable windows update for a while or just let it download everything?<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank you (all of you in this thread) for the support so far!<br />

            What I'd do is set a System Restore point, making sure System Protection is enabled for C with 5-15% disk space apportioned, so you can go back from within Windows or Repair Mode if necessary.
<br />
<br />Then to be extra safe save a System Image backup externally so you can restore Windows in 20 minutes if it ever becomes irreparable.  Use this free app which works best:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>  This can also serve as your file backup since the image file can be mounted in it's App to extract files if need be.
<br />
<br />Then go ahead and turn on Updates to see if the problem repeats which it doesn't in most cases.  But if it does you can System Restore, if necessary from the Repair Mode, or use the System Image to restore. 
<br />
<br />Then you can install Hide Updates tool to catch the Updates which caused the problem and block them.  The prime suspect will be drivers but I would block any that show up after rolling back because those will include the ones causing the problem.  Hide Updates Tool download:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

            I have just created restore point, C drive was already having protection enabled, I've assigned probably more than enough space for restore points, but I'm sure it will be handy (10% = about 100GB)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it is impossible for now to make System Image, since I'm having only 1 partition (which I'm considering a bad mistake on my end) it would have to make copy of pretty much whole HDD.<br />
I don't have external hard drive that big right now, but I'll definitely get one in the future!<br />
<br />
For now I have disabled windows update completely and I'll check out if the problem still occurs - if everything will work nice, I'll try to get updates and check again.<br />
If anything will happen, I'll definitely post an update here ^^

            I am sick and tired of hello, pin requirements, Microsoft authenticator ,multiple passwords for windows 10 not too mention Microsoft account sign in. this is **** to recover my account I had to hand over very sensitive personal credit ,birthdate emails
 etc, if Microsoft is concerned about my privacy and pseudo protecting me. asking me to verify repeatedly despite selecting remember this device is over kill. I have pulled all info access from my phone for a similar issue with Samsung. I no longer use their
 services. I should not have to be constantly wasting time by verification processes on a recognized device. Microsoft tracks my IP address so what gives, I am also privy to the supposed dead program files that windows downloads and supplies its OS with, one
 of the programs is a 2.0 version despite 7.0 being in operation. What's my point Me think thou protests too much Microsoft. My question is yes or no I want to opt out of all verification process with Microsoft pin, password, dual verificati

<p>You rant.&nbsp; I have 9 computers that have the same Microsoft account and password and PIN.&nbsp; My email is not with Microsoft but it is used for the Microsoft account.&nbsp; Note; I have only one password and one PIN for all these computers.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I have to verify my account when some thing new comes along but it is not often and the verify is simple.&nbsp; I like that Microsoft wants to make sure it is me and not someone else.</p>

<p>Hi gersalv,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Which web browser or program are you referring too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to the toolbars on the Windows Internet explorer browser we can only make changes to the command bar toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Internet Explorer toolbars</strong><br />

<p>If you are referring to any third party browser or program you may contact the vendor for more information.</p>

<h2>            Games on Windows 8.1 have a black border &#40;not fullscreen&#41;</h2>
                    Hi there
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the other day I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and noticed that whenever I try to run a game, instead of appearing fullscreen, a black border will appear around it. &nbsp;I have had this issue in the past but it has always been resolved on previous operating systems
 by upgrading my video drivers. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My graphics are <b>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M / Intel HD4000</b><font color="#000000"><span><i>&nbsp;</i>and I have tried updating the video drivers, however, it doesn't seem to be resolving the problem. &nbsp;Any ideas on how this can be fixed
 or if it's even fixable at this point in time with Windows 8.1?</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>Thanks.</span></font></div>

<div>2) Yes. &nbsp;I mentioned however, that this has been resolved several times in the past by simply updating drivers, but this no longer seems to be the case.</div>

<br />
<div>Yeah, so what I did was:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Updated my video drivers (not sure if this helped or not but it's still a good idea)</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) Right-clicked on my Desktop</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) Clicked on 'Screen resolution'</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) Changed the resolution setting to 'Low' (1024 x 768 in my situation)</div>
<div><br />
<div>5) Applied settings and then clicked on 'Advanced Settings'</div>
<div><br />
<div>6) The tabs on the top include; Adapter, Monitor, Color Management, and the control center of whatever graphics card you have (in my case it was labeled 'Intel(R) HD Graphics Control Panel')</div>
<div><br />
<div>7) Selected the graphic card control panel tab</div>
<div><br />
<div>8) Next to the text 'Scaling', the option will be set to 'Maintain Display Scaling'. &nbsp;I changed the option to 'Scale Full Screen'.</div>
<div><br />
<div>9) Applied the setting and then reverted back to my original resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>10) Resolved.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Let me know how it works out or if you have any questions!</div>

                    Since my original description of my frustrations was too much for people to handle, let me "re-word" it more simply.&nbsp; Windows 10 is broken, broken to a point that trying to fix it would mean nearly creating an entirely new Operating System.&nbsp; Microsoft,
 in my experience, doesn't really care one bit about anyone or how well Windows 10 works.&nbsp; The only thing they care about is how much money can they siphon from you while using Windows 10.&nbsp; The less you are aware of what they are doing, the happier they are.&nbsp;

            <p>With over 400 Million successful install world wide-including mine, I just don't buy into your premise. Windows 10 has room for improvement and Microsoft is working on it. No one is forcing you to use it there are other choices&nbsp; such as Windows 7, Linux,
 but in my opinion you would be better off solving your issue and learning how to use Windows 10. It takes a little effort but I am sure all your issues can be resolved.

            <p>Let see, I will list them in the order I remember them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows Games</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - In Windows 7 they were free, ad free, and simple</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, looks like a toddler with a crayon "designed" them, shove advertisements in your face constantly, have to pay to get rid of the ads (sort of).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Start Menu</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, simple, easily organized, separated folders from icons, made sense</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, loosely based alphabetical organization, randomly create folders for some "applications" and others scatter icons across the entire start menu, no way to re-organize anything, forced to do it the "Microsoft way".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3) Tiles in the start menu</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, doesn't even exist. &nbsp;Start Menu works as it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Windows 10, ADVERTISEMENTS </p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Windows search</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, type into search, looks on your computer to find what you are looking for</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, Cortana has hijacked your computer and is acting as a government agent. &nbsp;Sends all your private information to Microsoft and Government owned servers for "safe keeping". &nbsp;Trying to search for a file on your computer: "let me look on Bing
 for you".</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Screen Resolution (especially ultra wide screen)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, handled things perfectly, let Graphics card do what it was created to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, I can do graphics better than any $1000 graphics card, I am going to auto-zoom your desktop to 300% because you must be 90+ years old and have horrible eye sight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Notepad</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, easy to find on the start menu, could right click and open most any file with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, let me hide that for you. &nbsp;Not in the "start menu" anywhere, need to use search to find it (but Cortana insists it is on Bing and not your computer). &nbsp;Can't right click a file and use that to open it, only can use "apps" that are purchased
 from Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Microsoft Store (seriously??)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, didn't exist, OS ran perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, your $6000 computer is just an over powered cell phone, I am going to only allow you to install mobile apps from the "superior" Windows store. &nbsp;You want actual desktop applications... hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Built in Microsoft email, calendar, and other "apps"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 7, didn't exist, use Google mail and calendar (excellent) or purchase Microsoft Office with Outlook (also excellent)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Windows 10, I can do this better than those plebes. &nbsp;My built in mail and calendar "apps" will never work properly, auto open any and all spam emails to install viruses on your computer ASAP, totally screw up your OS's files so you need to reinstall
 Windows at least 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on forever, but I have a life to live. &nbsp;I even called support for an issue once and they were not able to fix it. &nbsp;The Documents, Music, etc. folders had somehow become corrupted. &nbsp;They even had a remote desktop connection into my computer and
 said to me over the phone "I have never seen anything like this before". &nbsp;Their "fix" was to create another "local profile" and have my log into that as my account... I couldn't even change the name of it because they called it "test". &nbsp;I reinstalled Windows
 10 again for the 4th time after that and was able to actually fix it myself. &nbsp;This OS is the biggest piece of garbage ever thrust upon this world. &nbsp; I could really create a list of hundreds of items of where this OS totally fails in comparison to Linux and
 previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't I have Windows 7? &nbsp;Well I do have Windows 7. &nbsp;I have multiple Windows 7 keys from when Technet subscriptions were still a thing. &nbsp;However, Microsoft, in their infinite wisdom, decided to inundate Windows 7 with pointless updates that the only reason
 for them is to actually fill your hard drive and make Windows 7 unusable. &nbsp;I actually called and brought this up with a Microsoft representative, they didn't even disagree with me, they didn't even argue that it was false, that didn't have anything to say.
 &nbsp;I must have nailed it on the head. &nbsp;Literally a week after Windows 10 stopped being "free", my Windows 7 downloaded so many "critical updates" that it filled an entire 256GB SSD. &nbsp;Windows 7 started crashing every minute or so, even trying to "right click"
 with the mouse caused the OS to freeze and blue screen. &nbsp;The "fix" was to install Windows 10.... right.... a "fix" my ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you read the license agreement when you install Windows 10? &nbsp;There is specifically a section that states you are agreeing to not sue Microsoft for any reason regarding the use of Windows 10 and that if you do have any issue to contact their legal department
 and they will settle out of court. &nbsp;What does that tell you? &nbsp;They are hiding something and don't want it to make it into the media. &nbsp;Microsoft is spying on all of us, send that data to private servers both in their network and government "copies" to store
 for "safe keeping". &nbsp;Why do you think "Cortana" has total control of your PC? &nbsp;She isn't just helping you out, she is sending everything you do to servers owned by people you shouldn't be trusting.</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; Not fully true.&nbsp; you can find free and simple games.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; You can arrange yoir tiles on the Start screen in groups the way you want them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Tiles are shortcuts to Apps.&nbsp; You can turn off the active part.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Do not use Cortans but search for files on File Explorer.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; My graphics work like they are supposed to.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Note Pad is an app and can be found in All apps under Windows Accessories and can be pinned to the taskbar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will open files in File Explorer.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; All of my downloaded programs are working properly.&nbsp; Use Thunderbird for mail like I have for years.&nbsp; Others that I have had for years also work because they are updated.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; My calendar in Thunderbird works great along with Google Calendar and Microsoft's Calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why pay $6000 for a computer when you can get many very good computers and laptops for less that $2500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you do not have to use Cortana.&nbsp; I do not.</p>

            <p>[<strong>tldr; agree with most of the gripes in varying degrees; you can mostly make the OS useable; apparently Win7 can be fresh installed, then fully updated without a thousand individual updates; I hope you used a napkin after the last paragraph, and
 most definitely what <em>b53gunr</em> said about your choice of analogies.&nbsp; **** dude, I'm not a very PC person but that's plain offensive</strong>]<br />
<br />
1) yeah, pretty much, the UI is designed to be smartphone friendly.&nbsp; Finding the "make taskbar and start menu transparent" setting restores a bit of the prettiness. I think substitutes for most of the traditional games are in the Store, and there's a bunch
 of new ones.&nbsp; No idea about ads since I killed most of the games off - Minecraft is supposed to be ridiculously addictive.<br />
<br />
2) right-click on the Start button if you want to do more techie stuff, scroll on your mouse to scroll the list, play with Start Options and the "hamburger" (three-horizontal-lines icon up at the top left) to customize a bit.&nbsp; Explore; you had to do the same
 thing when you went from XP to 7 (just not near as much, and the machine wasn't yelling at you while you were doing it)<br />
<br />
3) Most Recently Used and New programs are still there and (obviously) the long rambling list is just "Programs" from the old one, stretched out... and a bunch of crap added from Settings. Ads can be easily squashed.<br />
<br />
4) There's a third party program or two that will (among other things if you like) kill the automatic "web search" thing from Search.<br />
<br />
5) no clue what you're talking about.&nbsp; The little messing around I've done with font sizes, I don't see it as being any worse (or, sadly any better) than Win7<br />
<br />
6) Yup, there should be (perhaps is, haven't checked) an option to flatten the list, as there is in the Linuxes they probably stole the look and feel from in the first place. per Search (cortana) I hit the Windows key then type in 'N' and Notepad comes up right
 away (but I use it alot).&nbsp; I've killed off the Bing search, using an aforementioned 3rd party program.<br />
<br />
7) Thinking of it as Stores or Storehouse helps control the indignation (seriously).&nbsp; You can install any program you want, doesn't have to be an "app" thing.&nbsp; (note that there's a setting in the Insider builds to allow non-Store app installations, I'm not
 entirely sure what the difference between an "app" and a "program" is).<br />
<br />
8) yup, crap - crudely written as far as I can tell with little regard for people who don't fit their one-perfect-customer profile.&nbsp; More of a showcase for the Edge-based graphics tools than an actually useful program.&nbsp; Probably deletable, definitely replaceable.&nbsp;
 Note that (almost definitely) Defender gets first crack at any e-mails, before they're displayed.<br />
<br />
Tech Support<br />
Could use more integration with the rest of M$.&nbsp; Presumably there's a couple guys, easily findable, which could have told the tech rep exactly what was wrong and how to fix it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently overloaded as **** and boosting several nations' economies immensely, which shouldn't be a customer (notice I didn't say "consumer") concern.
<br />
<br />
Windows 7<br />
I vaguely recall reading where Win7 updating is now done with monthly cumulative updates, and that if you fresh install, you only have to run 3 update packages to bring your SP1 as far as May 2016, instead of the thousand or so individual updates otherwise
 required.&nbsp; I've a Win7 partition (as well as 10) and that's definitely on the todo list.<br />
<br />
License Agreement<br />
I read one awhile back and had a good laugh.&nbsp; Apparently Microsoft was claiming ownership of any and all material that passed through their programs and OSes... which would make them the biggest **** company in the world.&nbsp; I think they changed it in the next
 rev.<br />
<br />
Telemetry<br />
Yup, ridiculous.&nbsp; And you get to pay for the Internet and processor/disk activity it uses, directly out of your pocket to make their business more profitable.&nbsp; Turnable-downable and even offable if you want to take the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently my system has Bing autosearch off, ads off, and Telemetry set to Basic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that Basic transmits windows and windows program performance, also my interactions solely in the form of ergonomics measurements: mouse movement and number of keystrokes pressed between actions.&nbsp; Despite M$ not having an inherent right to such data,
 it's no skin off my nose as long as it doesn't mess up my proc/disk/bandwidth too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously they need hardware details for driver installation and updates. (and probably use it for other things, as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously they want to know what software I have installed, both for performance sake and marketing nefariousity.&nbsp; That, I'm still on the fence about.&nbsp; Not that it causes me much harm, but that I don't reap any rewards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you're off the rails with "to government"(barring due process), and "private servers" beyond the metadata. However I'm open to explicitly fact-backed enlightenment.<br />
<br />
<strong>Right this minute I'd settle for the asterisk string used to censor cusswords on this forum be the same length as the original word/phrase, for easier readability.</strong></p>

            <p>1) I have Cortana as disabled as possible, even deleting registry keys that are safe to delete.&nbsp; Yet, Cortana still somehow manages to keep track of what I am doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My "$6000" computer wasn't purchased at some Bestbuy or from some over priced company like Dell.&nbsp; There are people, like me, who realize that when you spend even $1000 on a "Dell Desktop" that you are only getting a significantly cheaper PC in parts.&nbsp;
 The "extra cost" is the "service" they offer, which in my opinion is not worth the cost.&nbsp; My $6000 (the cost of parts if you were to buy it today) only cost me actually $2000 but will out perform even the most expensive Alienware $6000 (which I have owned,
 and they are way over priced).&nbsp; But, that is enough of the digression.</p>

            <p>So, we will have to disagree on the "government" stuff, but there was evidence showing that Window 10 was explicitly trying to connect with known government controlled servers that act as "data repositories".&nbsp; I would be able to show this, but, recently
 Wireshark is unable to work in Windows 10.... hmmm... they are explicitly blocking a packet capture program..... yeah, they aren't hiding anything.&nbsp; Windows 10 explicitly blocks the winpcap service from being installed even when running the installer with
 admin privileges.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know (or are "frightened" by the name "Wireshark") Wireshark is a packet capture software that is used pretty much everywhere.&nbsp; I have used it to find network issues, track down security breaches, troubleshoot
 application issues across networks, etc.&nbsp; It just lets you look at the traffic flowing across an interface.&nbsp; Microsoft knows and uses this (if they have a competent network department) all the time internally.&nbsp; So, they know that it can look at individual
 packets and give a ton of information about where they are going, what they contain, etc.&nbsp; They are blocking this from running on Windows 10 because they don't want you to know what they are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Minecraft, I played it long before Microsoft bought it, is incredibly boring.&nbsp; Unless you enjoy moving virtual dirt from one area to another.&nbsp; The fact that Microsoft has decided to make things that were/are free into subscription services is an insult.&nbsp;
 Generally people are too dumb to care and get taken advantage of because of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The changes made to the start menu were unneeded, uncalled for, and totally stupid.&nbsp; The Start Menu was the primary reason EVERYONE HATED WINDOWS 8.&nbsp; So, what do they do... keep it in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The fact that you need to install a "3rd party program" in order to get Windows 10 to function like an operating system instead of an advertisement just goes to show how bad this "operating system" really is.&nbsp; It is plainly evident that Microsoft doesn't
 give a rat's a$$ about anyone and even though it was "free" they are raking in more money with Windows 10 than any prior operating system.&nbsp; All at the expense of your privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) That license agreement hasn't changed one bit, they still claim they own everything you do on your computer.</p>
