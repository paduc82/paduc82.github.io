                    I installed Windows 8 Pro x64 in October and I had a couple of problems with my games and my driver was renamed and I checked with system requirements lab on a couple of games such as the games which didn't work like Minecraft, Worms Reloaded, Worms Crazy
 Golf, Doom 3, Doom 3 Ressurection of evil, Sauerbraten and Marble Arena 1&amp;2 I checked all of the requirements for those games and it said the video card was unknown the video card is : Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporations WDDM 1.1)
 and I've downgraded it to see what happens and it made all of the games work with Windows 8 but I got the drivers from an Acer website... Because I have an Acer laptop -_-... and I seem to now get blue screens when I play on the games I couldnt play... The
 error code is at the title... Here are my Specifications:

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Overclocking may cause your computer to crash. I would suggest load your default settings in BIOS or run an OC stability tool to see if your system is stable with your settings. Overclocking may cause permanent damage if done incorrectly. Check your ram,
 PSU and mobo's specs for their limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 constantly closes window while playing PC game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonia_hdez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 constantly closes window while playing PC game</h2>
                    <p>We recently bought a new PC desktop and created two new accounts that are both administrators. Each time that I play a PC game, after a few minutes of playing am error message pops up saying the program had to be unexpectedly stopped. I've tried troubleshooting
 the issue by making sure the PC is up-to-date and making sure the latest versions of the games are installed but the problem still persists on my account (my sister has no issues with this while playing games, such as the sims 4, when logged on her account).
 Normally a Mac-user, I'm a little out of my depth here and would greatly appreciate any help and instructions to fix this problem.</p>

<h2>            Computer doesn&#39;t recognize larger capacity hard drive.</h2>
                    I installed a larger capacity hard drive in my Dell laptop (Vista) from 100 gb to 500 gb. I used EaseUs Todo v4 to clone the hard drive and then put the new 500 gb in the laptop. All is working well but the system still says my OS has only 100 gb instead
 of 500 gb. The system does recognize the new hd (it calls it by its right name). I have rebooted and pressed "Esc", "F1", and "F8" all to now avail. I'm sure that this is an easy fix (hopefully) but I'm at a loss. Your help will be appreciated.<br />

<h3> jessebdsr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child Account online gaming options</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I suggest a 'friends only' or friends of friends only' option for online gaming in the privacy settings.&nbsp; I have set the family controls on the console and privacy setting for my 8 yr old son's child account, but there are certain games with lobbies
 that he is still able to play with random strangers.&nbsp; I have his profile blocked, but he is getting friend requests from strangers because they see his gamertag in the lobby.&nbsp; At least he can't communicate with them in there (that I know of anyway).&nbsp; I wanted
 him to be able to play with friends of families that I know and have met the parents, where we would exchange our child's gamertags and I would approve these friends.&nbsp; For awhile he was not getting random requests for friends, but now he is because the online
 gaming option is only 'allowed' or 'blocked' only.&nbsp; I thought it would be nice to let him have an online account and play with school and family friend's kids especially during the cold winter days,&nbsp;but now causing problems.</p>
<p>I appreciate how xbox does have parental controls (not the easiest thing to figure out), but seems to be a gap in the online gaming lobbies.</p>

<p><span><strong>Hello JesseBDsr,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I see and understand the concern about random strangers on the Xbox LIVE Servers and Games<strong>.
 and only his friends, in a Multiplayer game,&nbsp;he will need to do Private Matches or Games. This will restrict any uninvited player to join his game, (which he is hosting) only the people he invites can play.
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">He may also get an option to "Kick" the player if&nbsp;a stranger&nbsp;does become present in his Private lobby</span></strong> (Kick will remove the player and the player may not be able to join back.) REMEMBER: This may be different
 for any game, this Game mode may be labeled: &nbsp;Private Lobby, Private Game, Private Match, and Invite Only Match. Your son can also
 the player and it will unlock it. Also <span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>Submitting a Player Review</strong>
</span>will determine if he will ever see that player on Xbox LIVE again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helped you! Stay Safe!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you ArmyRanger149 for the suggestion and I shall inform son to only choose the private lobbies. &nbsp;This is a good work-a-round but not the permanent solution I was hoping to find. &nbsp;Will someone from xbox support/programing continue to look into the xbox
 LIVE (the "network") privacy setting for online gaming and add a friends only option that will override the various game lobbies? &nbsp;Or are they considering this problem solved? &nbsp;It sort of defeats the purpose of having an option to accept and deny friends for
 my son with communicating over the "network" (text, voice, video), when the online gaming options don't have the same choices for friends only to override gaming lobbies over the "network". &nbsp;The xbox support folks I talked to agreed there seems to be a gap
 with the lobbies and told me to post the issue to the forums and try to gain more people to support the change to the "network" controls.
</p>
<p>Thanks again for the suggestion (I will start using), but hopefully I can get more people to look into this and ask for the control setting over the system.</p>

    <title>Editing the subject line of an email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillipgraf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing the subject line of an email</h2>
                    I am currently using Thunderbird for my emails and I am trying to edit the subject line of emails that I have already received.&nbsp; The problem is I have to edit it as a new email and when it resends the email to me, it changes the original sender's email
 address, it shows it came from me since I edited the email and the date it was received.&nbsp; I want to be able to edit the subject line without changing anything else.&nbsp; I don't want to tag the email, I want to add something to the subject line.<br />
<br />
Is this possible with Windows Live Mail?&nbsp; If not, is there an email program that will allow me to do this?&nbsp; I am running Windows 7.<br />

<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
In Windows Live Mail, each message is an individual text file. Without knowing why you might want to change the subject line of a message, it's difficult to suggest the best method of doing this. One way is simply to drag a message from the message list out
 to the desktop, where a new .eml file will be created with the subject line as the file name. This file can be opened with a text editor like Notepad and edited at will. The edited file can then be dragged back into its place in Windows Live Mail. This will
 leave the original message intact; if this is not the intention, then the original message can be deleted.<br />
<br />
Please explain your reasons for wanting to edit the subject line. There may be other ways of achieving your aim.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Youll want to make a call to xbox support so they can give you a master password that will reset it and allow you to make a new one. That is the suggested way of doing it so that they can verify securities and whatnot.

<h2>            XP installation on HP Pavilion G4-2049TX notebook PC.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am trying to install Windows XP on my newly purchased Notebook but not able to install win XP on this machine and I need it to install some software which yet support XP and Vista only.<br />
please suggest. the machine configuration Processor:- Intel i5 3rd generation , 4 Gb Ram , 1 GB Radion Graphic card, 500GB Graphics.<br />
While I am running the boot from CD its giving blue screen error just before the license agreement (F8).<br />
Is there any way to install it? or I have to use it only on virtual environment (Don't want to go for virtual as it must need to extend the RAM)<br />
Regards| <br />

Hi Stuart,<br />
Thanks for your quick reply. I am trying to install SP3 but the main problem is its not allowing me to inter on HDD. while we press f8 to accept license agreement just before that I am getting Blue screen error.<br />
its ok to run it without driver as I need it to work with my application only.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 &#126; Update Not Working Due to Missing Registry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tank99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 &#126; Update Not Working Due to Missing Registry Item&#40;s&#41; and Missing AU.INF File</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I am running a 64-Bit Windows 7, Build 7100 system with an Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.4GHz, and 4 Gigs of ram.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I first installed the new OS I could run Windows update with no problem, but now for whatever reason when I try to run Windows update I get error code 80070424 every single time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I searched the Microsoft database for help it suggested I check to see if two registry keys are present.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first one is there “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv” with two sub entries “Parameters” and “Security”, but the second one is NOT “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_WUAUSERV”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I followed the instructions on the support webpage </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916261</span></a><span>, to try and fix the missing registry
 item.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am supposed to install the file “AU.INF” found in the in the INF directory, but I cannot find this file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think the reason is that the solution is based on Windows XP SP2 and I am running Windows 7, Build 7100, so I am not sure how to get that registry item repaired.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have checked my Windows 7 disk and could not find the file “AU.INF” there either.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p><span><span>In addition, I am not sure if this is related to the same problem or not, but I keep getting a window titled Software
 Licensing, “The computer is not running genuine Windows”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
When I click the option to go online and resolve the issue it takes me to a Microsoft search page
</span><a href="http://search.microsoft.com/?mkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://search.microsoft.com/?mkt=en-US</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is another window that pops up frequently titled “Optional update delivery is not working” and says “You may be a victim of software counterfeiting”, which I think this one is due to the Windows update not working or the error code 80070424.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am using Bullguard antivirus software, but uninstalled it and reinstalled it since then, problem persisted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How can I fix this issue with the missing registry items and could there be others missing registry items related to
 Windows update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for any help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3> cescal  say:</h3>
<h2>            wininet.dll file not found in win xp pro</h2>
                    I was doing a system restore on my dell pc that has win xp pro. cuz the machine was running very slow. a message came up after a long time of the restore , saying that the machine does not have enough memory to run system restore. I shut down the machine
 by pressing the power button. when I tried to start the machine again I get a message say the system could not start because wininet.dll file is missing. reinstalling it may fix the problem.<br />
I can only get into task manager , went to windows, system 32 and found several wininet. dll files listed . like this wininet.dll (2) and wininet .dll (2) (2) and so on up to wininet.dll (6). why do I have so many of the wininet.dll file all with the same date
 and time ? I tried to copy and paste , I get a window <br />
saying windows cannot open this file because dont know which program created it or something like that. click a program to open it with. what do I do? I only use my pc for the web. dont know how they work or why they dont. :)&nbsp; Can someone Please help?<br />

            <p>here are instructions to burn a cd with Hiren's boot cd, through which you can run the checkdisk:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Courtesy of Jose Ibarra</font></font></span></p>
<p><b><u><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
</font></span></u></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</font></a><br />
<br />
<font>The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
</font><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.imgburn.com/</font></a><br />

<br />
<font><font>It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction
 to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            Why is my system crashing now i&#39;ve upgraded the ram&#63;</h2>
                    [EDIT]<br />
looked into it, possibly found the root of the problem:<br />
here's the cards i started with: RAM:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dual channel memory architecture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four 240-pin DDR2 DIMM sockets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported DIMM types:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC2-5300 (667 MHz)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC2-6400 (800 MHz)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-ECC memory only, unbuffered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports 2GB DDR2 DIMMs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports up to 8 GB on 64 bit PCs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supports up to 4 GB* on 32 bit PCs<br />
<br />
and i replaced two of the 1 GB cards with: <br />
KOMPUTERBAY 8GB ( 2 X 4GB ) DDR2 DIMM (240 PIN) 800Mhz PC2 6400 PC2 6300 8 GB - CL 5<br />
<br />
I hope i'm wrong... but this is telling me that i have basically got a computer that can run 8 GB ram TOPS because the slots only run up to a 2 gig chip... someone please tell me i just need to install a patch or something because, if so, i won't have wasted
 my last £100<br />
<br />
[ORIGINAL MESSAGE FOLLOWS]<br />
Hello Microsoft.<br />
I'm using a HP computer with Windows Vista home premium<br />
here's the original stats:<br />
HP<br />
M9351.UK<br />
4 GIG ram<br />
Intel core 2 quad core Q6600 2.40 GHz<br />
64 bit OS<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, this is the first real hardware problem i've ever had... so bear with me...<br />
Because my quad-core didn't have the torque i needed to run the 3D animation software i'm currently using, i decided to upgrade two of my four cores to 4 Gig chips, making it a 10 gig machine.<br />
i know they're DDR2 and installing them was no issue... but, since then, my system seems to be even SLOWER!<br />
my computer recognises all four cores, they're linked to the apropriate pair (two of the slots are black, two are blue. these chips are in the one colour)<br />
i've been getting repeated blue-screen of death crashes where it's got to dump the memory.<br />
I can't re-install windows because i wasn't supplied with a disc (Staples gave it as-is with no monitor or software discs...) not to mention all the software i've purchased in the last four or so years :S<br />
<br />
sorry if i'm missing some amature flaw (the chips ARE installed properly, they're not loose or anything) but i'm out of options...
<br />

            Will try that... if you're right then i've got 8 gig of useless silicone i've spent a heap on!<br />
how can i tell what kinds of memory will be compatable?<br />
I thought just getting the right kind would be sufficient and if it fit it would work because there's no drivers or anything else to put with them :S<br />

            <p>I trust also that your Vista is the 64bit version, not 32bit.</p>
<p>Also it only supports a total of 8gb, assuming its the 64bit version of Vista.</p>

i'm a little dissapointed in Vista now... not only has it been the source of a LOT of grief, now i find out that it's... never mind. you don't want to hear my ranting...<br />
Thank you a lot for this.<br />
that said, would taking out the two one-gig cards help?<br />
going to try it some time...<br />
<br />
What does 7 support? i've been looking for an excuse to upgrade for a while but i don't want to loose all my data...<br />

            <p>Nope, it isn't quite that simple.&nbsp; Memory comes in various speeds and capacities, as well as different timing requirements even within the same speed family.&nbsp; Also, seeing your further respones to Palcouk, the issue of 32-bit versus 64-bit isn't a Vista thing, it's a Windows thing, period.&nbsp; No 32-bit version of Windows has ever supported more then 4gb of memory because it physically cannot.&nbsp; A 64-bit version of Windows is required.&nbsp; Vista comes in both 32-and 64-bit flavors but when it was released the 32-bit was more popular.&nbsp; Now the 64-bit is the more popular and 32-bit difficult to find except on very low-end computers. </p>

<p>Vista Home Premium 64bit (which you say you have)&nbsp;supports 16GBs of RAM, not 8Gbs as you have been advised..</p>

            Thank you very much! that is extremley helpful... but this also means i'm back to square one with why my PC is blue-screening and sometimes just flash-restarting :S<br />
<br />
thanks for the link though. that's excellent info!<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other infomation i may not know about this? the chips are identical other than their size and i can't believe that it 'just won't accept anything over 2GB'<br />

                    <p>I thought of using Windows Security Essentials as my Windows 8 security package, but during the download I got a message saying that similar functions were handled by Windows Defender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is it safe to use Windows 8 without an extra security package? Very convenient if so!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials is now built into Windows 8 and is now called 'Windows Defender'. It provides the same level of malware protection that it does on its previous Operating Systems.<br />
<br />

            <div>I don't think it's safe to use any Windows without any anti-virus</div>
Well it all depends on what you run in your computer
<div>If you are likely to run executable files from untrusted sources regularly you definitely need an antivirus software</div>
<div>It doesn't have to be paid by the way, free antivirus software do the work 100%<br />
<div>If you don't run files from untrusted sources you would be safe in Windows 7 too because web is more secure now, 8-10 years ago web pages were able to directly run a virus in your computer without any notification, browsers today don't allow that</div>

In addition:

<div>If you install another AV package Defender will automatically turn off.</div>

The question was about Windows 8 which has an AV built in.

Windows 8 comes with its own built in Antivirus utility in addition to other security technologies. Of course, if you are not comfortable using Windows Defender, you can use a third party utility such as AVG, ESET and many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Secure Boot/Trusted Boot - operating system cannot be tampered with</p>
<p>- Early Anti-Malware Scanning</p>
<p>- Antivirus/Anti-Spyware - Windows Defender</p>
<p>- Windows Smart Screen Filter</p>
<p>- Address Space Layout Randomization (moves around operating system code on start up fooling malware).</p>
<p>- Kernel Patch Guard - kernel cannot be tampered with</p>
<p>- User Account Control - can't accidentally install unwanted programs</p>
<p>- HeapStack protection - prevents buffer overflows</p>
<p>- Device Driver signing</p>
<p>- Protected Mode in IE</p>
<p><br />
Add these with a little common sense and you should have an even more secure system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a detail of my experience using Windows Defender:</p>
<p>One of the core features now built into Windows 8 is early Anti-malware scanning. Windows 8 now includes Windows Defender, built up on the foundations of its successful Antivirus and AntiSpyware utility Microsoft Security Essentials. Due to the changing
 landscape of security, having Antivirus built into the Operating System is a logical move that guarantees a safer environment for users who either refuse to pay for commercial Antivirus utilities or do not do a sufficient job at keeping their Antivirus updated.

<p>Recently, a student came by my office informing me her thumb drive was infected with viruses. She knew this because all of her files were hidden. This sounds like the infamous
<em>shortcut virus</em> which hides the attributes of a file. It tends to be mischievous not damaging. Luckily, I had Windows 8 on my system, but I was a bit hesitant since this is pre-release software. I also had a bit of issues removing the same virus earlier
 this year when I had the Developer Preview installed. Anyway, lets see how it goes.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wd-win-8-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fwd-win-8-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d457%26amp%3bh%3d130" /></a></p>
<p>The minute I plugged in the thumb drive, a notification pops up on screen indicating it had detected malware and began taking action by cleaning the infection. The notification is very informative and alerts the user immediately of the problem.
 You can click the notification for further details which will open the Windows Defender utility:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wd-win-8-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fwd-win-8-3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d477%26amp%3bh%3d311" /></a></p>
<p>From here you can click ‘Show details’ to see what was detected and proceed to apply an action, in this case I chose remove.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wd-win-8-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fwd-win-8-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d447%26amp%3bh%3d250" /></a></p>
<p>If it turns out that you had the shortcut virus, you might have to open a command prompt with Admin privileges and type the following command:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image20.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb20.png%3fw%3d448%26amp%3bh%3d172" /></a></p>
<p>This will allow you to restore the file attributes. And that’s it. </p>
