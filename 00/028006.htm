<h2>            Login and setup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having alot of trouble logging into my account. It looks as though I had two accounts associated with the same email address. I went through the process to merge the accounts. It said this will allow me to use either login, username or email address,
 to get access to my account. It is not letting me do that, even after attempting to change my password 4 times. Now I have finally successfully changed my password for the one account that I remember, and it seems correct but I cannot login through my Skype
 app on my Mac. Despite even downloading the new Skype. So, I don't know what to do. How do I login and get access?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an HP IPAQ 2795b that has been my constant companion since I bought it.&nbsp; Currently, it has Mobile 5.0 build 14366.1.0.1 (came installed).&nbsp; I have two questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Is there any advantage for upgrading to Mobile 6?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If so, how can that be accomplished?</p>

<p>Upgrades are made available (if they want to) through your provider or manufacturer (HP).</p>

    <title>Maps 3.08 - how to roll back to 3.06&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Maps 3.08 - how to roll back to 3.06&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I updated Maps on my C6-01 (Anna updated) to version 3.08, which appeared on Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did like some of the new features of this new version, namely:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) it's possible to zoom and pan the map while viewing a saved routes;</p>
<p>b) life traffic information is now available for my city (Porto Alegre, Brazil), although strangely it's only available while viewing a saved route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I really hated the fact that Nokia have removed some features which are available on every Sat Nav system, even on the cheapest ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Maps 3.08 can only navigate from the current position to a saved or searched point, or to any point on the map. There's no way to plan a route with several way points. That simple makes the system useless for me, as it definetily is not a GPS Sat Nav
 system at all! Of course I know that I allways can plan routes on Nokia Maps website and sync them to my phone. But what happens when I'm travelling abroad and I don't have access to a PC, or simply I don't want to? Its very bad having to allways rely on a
 PC for planing routes for a phone Nav system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) The new map view on the drive or walk mode is terrible. I allways use the phone on portrait mode during car navigation, as I have a Nokia car holder which is safer if the phone is used on that position. During navigation, Maps 3.08 shows a huge black
 vertical bar at the left of the screen, which shows the next turn information. The result is that the screen area left for the map is very small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I'd like to ask two questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Is it possible to have both Maps 3.08 and 3.06 on the phone? It would be nice to use traffic information and being able to zoom and pan the map while viewing a saved route.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If that's not possible, how do I revert Maps to version 3.06?</p>
<p>update: I just found out that Maps 3.06 is still available on Nokia Store and I already had the installer for the latest release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards!</p>

<p>Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed Maps 3.06 withouyt uninstalling 3.08 and the result was as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the Map icon now opens Maps 3.06 again and everything is working fine; back to planning and saving routes with intermediate points :smileyhappy:;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the Check-in icon is gone; I didn't use it anyway, as I don't like to "check-in" myself wherever I go&nbsp;:smileywink:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the Weather and Guides icons were kept and the apps are working fine;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the Drive icon was kept but now it just opens Maps 3.06, so I'll remove this icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know which Maps 3.08 apps can I uninstall from the App Manager, whithout removing Weather and Guides?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Ive just rolled back to maps 3.06 also just downloaded it straight on top of maps 3.08 from nokia store, cant honestly see the point of the upgrade b3.08 looks nicer but its no better to use in fact its worse, mind you just about sums up nokia,s upgrades,
 took me 3 attempts to download the upgrade and afterwards it didnt work properly, finally got it working only to find out its more awkward to use than version 3.06, cant for the life of me work out what the hell nokia is up to with the inept software and firmware
 upgrades for the N8, never mind got the N8 working ok for now, i wont bother with symbian belle when that eventually rolls out because all my family av since chuked their nokia,s and got a tidy smartphone, i will follow suit after the end of my contract, well
 done nokia another loyal nokia family ditching ur inept software N8, camera is the only good thing about the N8, its a pity another manufacturer hadnt invented the N8 we might av got the software it desserves then, instead of try

<p>Thanks! It works!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to do a report for those that hestitate to downgrade. When install the file, it will warn about deleting old maps, just click on confirm. As Anna phone have the new v2 map, it won't delete any maps. All the new extra garbage shortcut created by 3.08
 will reduce to only 3 icon. &nbsp;Guide, Weather and drive. Guide and Weather will still be functional, while drive will only route to the original Map 3.06 main screen. The only hiccups I notice is when you click on the info/detail bar on top, a slight lag with
 a white splash screen flash. I'm not sure if this exist in the orginal 3.06, since it wasn't giveing me problem, I didn't pay any close attenetion. The Anna Map widget shortcut will be still avaialbe. The shortcut will be Map, Drive (essentially the same after
 rollback to 3.06), Here and Now, Guide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, gone with the 4MB stay in RAM program (total 20MB), and the battery drain issue. This will take effect immediately after overwrite with 3.06.</p>

<p>You mean address within the contact? I don't use that. I keep my contact simple with only numbers, since I back-up my contact using my SIM. Though I don't have Map 3.08 embedded on my N8 V24, I don't have any option for uninstall. I only got two componet
 to uninstall as described in your post:&nbsp; uninstall was the first option I check and found no core program to uninstall. That why I've come on the forum and ask for link to the installer to 3.06. I suppose I can do a restore firmware on my phone, but that way
 too much of effort. The real solution here is for those idot at Nokia and MS dog Mr. Elop here to wake-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I did read thorugh the post, but thanks for bring it up. But I believe different situation have different problem and solution, much like I have no method of uninstalling 3.08.</p>

<p>Yes, I like to keep the adresses of some of my contacts whithin the contacts book itself. That way, I don't need to need to keep many Favourites on Nokia Maps :smileywink:. I tend to keep only the Favourites I need for routing and travelling,&nbsp;on Maps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't back up by using the SIM card. As a matter of fact, I don't store anything on the SIM card. I just backup via Nokia Suite and also by sincyng my phone to my Nokia account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't back up by using the SIM card. As a matter of fact, I don't store anything on the SIM card. I just backup via Nokia Suite and also by sincyng my phone to my Nokia account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I input an address in one of my contact and try to locate on the map - it works!</p>

<p>Hi <font color="#000000"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4574A2C9-0C95-408B-B5F9-1CD3E673340F"><font color="#000000"><span>aspergerguy</span></font>,</a></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I really appreciate your link to the 3.06 installation program. It will bring back the 3.06 application, however not in the way I prefer. Installing that program will not end up in erasing (all) the old 3.08 files. There are many, what
 I call, left overs from 3.08. To get rid of these left overs I need to install/flash the C: partition with my&nbsp;Anna version at new. The common procedure of formatting and re-installing Anna will not result in a clean installment, but in the last known&nbsp;configuration,
 thus including the&nbsp;3.08 left overs. Anyone, who owns a computer can install and re-install&nbsp;his or her OS&nbsp;as much as they want. However, this option is not&nbsp;well done for&nbsp;a simple handheld computer with phone capabilities (or the other way around) like a smartphone.
 Officially, big brother Nokia Care Point will help us. I merely want to share my feelings with the Nokia community. I'm not waiting for that parental supervision of any phone company, including Nokia.﻿</font></p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I have the same problem and find it extremely annoying! I also noticed that this behaviour started mid 2018. I'm using Office 365 on a macbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open an existing office file from my HD and want to save the new version with a new name with the 'save as...' function, it doesn't suggest the folder where the original file resides. Instead it suggest a folder which I at some point earlier selected
 for saving or opening another file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the result is, that I often just press save without noticing that the folder is different to the one where I opened the file from, with the effect that I don't find the file anymore or find it later in &nbsp;a wrong folder ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disturbing!</p>

</p>
<p>If ScanPST doesn't recognize the file as a valid PST file then likely that it's not recoverable but you can always do a search of PST repair tools to see if any of them have more success than ScanPST (would do &lt;due diligence&gt; and test any option before &lt;purchasing&gt;
 anything to ensure that the file can be recognized).</p>

<h2>            Resizing the ApproveIt Digital Signature in Word&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was sent a Word document requiring a digtial signature.&nbsp; Here's my problem; when signed, it altered the document by expanding the width of it all to match that of the signature, rather than the signature just adjusting to the size of the box.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?&nbsp; The only way I can find is to drag the lines over (from right to left), but then it cuts of the signature...?</p>

            <p>The only means of containing a digital signature is within a table. The document can be prepared with a single cell table . A group of signature blocks can use a multicell table formated to the look and feel you desire.</p>
<p>All formating must be done prior to any signatures. </p>

<h2>            Unable to update PowerPivot KPI status indicators with Excel 2013 &#40;64-bit&#41; and Windows 7 &#40;64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem for months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, when I create a KPI on my Pivot Report, it shows the value (i.e. 1 or 0) instead of the Status icon.</p>
<p>And in all cases, if a Status icon shows up, it cannot be changed (i.e. it's always the red/green/yellow ball).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a bug and someday, Microsoft will fix, but in the meantime, does anyone know of a sure fire workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen posts about dragging on/off the results grid but that doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried rendering the pivot report on SharePoint 2013 web part using Excel Services and it doesn't resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:&nbsp; Windows 7 (64-bit - latest updates) and Office 2013 Pro (64-bit&nbsp;- latest updates).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why is it that all the moderators try to pass the buck on these types of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly a defect in the product (Excel or Windows or both).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway you could find it within yourself to report this to the product team?&nbsp; It will never get fixed if it's not reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's 100% reproducible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you sincerely for your support,</p>

            Randy, I have my frustrations with PowerPivot too but this a new feature in Microsoft Excel. Microsoft has already released 3 versions of it since its inception and they have made significant improvements. However, I believe they are yet to achieve more
 on this. I am hopeful that many of it would be addressed in its future releases.

            <p>Clearly it's just a bug.&nbsp; This functionality works using conditional formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just need to make sure the bug gets into the product development queue so someday it gets fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having work in MS Product Development in the past...we always welcomed bug reports - especially on hot features like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the product has telemetry to capture some problems (i.e. like crashing), this one isn't being trapped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus I'm counting on the moderator to help get this passed along to the product team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerest regards,</p>

</p><p>It's possible that the location settings for the Camera app has been turned off. We suggest that you toggle it off and on by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>Privacy.</strong></li><li>Tap <strong>Location.</strong></li><li>Scroll down and search for the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</li><li>Tap the <strong>On/Off</strong> slider to toggle the location service for the app.</li><li>Use the Camera app again to check if the changes have applied.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>Performing a soft reset is not that complicated.&nbsp; It will only clear memory, terminate all apps and reload the OS. It won’t erase or access any user data. If you have a phone with a removable battery, just remove the battery and reboot after replacing the
 battery. That will also clear the memory, and terminate the apps and reload. There will be nothing erased.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 only. Finding and insert &#34;Page x of y&#34; -- it used to be simple, easy, and efficient.</h2>
                    
<p>Pardom me, folks, but I am <strong>so tired</strong> tired of reading something to the effect of "Oh, I guess you are new to the Ribbon..." or "I didn't like it either, but after I got used to it, I couldn't live without it..."</p>
<p>Well, there are plenty of new, great, terrific enhancements in 2010. But, as with<em>so many</em> people, it is
<em>so</em> exasperating to no longer being able to do really simple stuff as inserting a "Page x of y" or other "Auto Content."</p>
<p>I finally did find it under "Quick Parts" but the amount of wasting space in graphics was exceeded by my frustration is seeing my entire footer disappear after inserting the "Page x of y" -- yes, I know, something to do with templates, etc.</p>
<p>Again, it used to be very straight-forward, simple, and efficient.</p>
<p>Now that I've vented, is there a straight-forward, simple, and efficient was to simply insert "Page x of y"?</p>
<p>Thank you. I realize "You" are not Microsoft, that this is a peer-to-peer forum, but HopeFully, SomeOne will have some input directly to Microsoft developer/software people to give us the option to again use the File Menu, and Standard and Formatting toolbars.</p>

<p>Mine looks like this too. Simple has only a single number in, then lots of things with Accent Bars next, then Page X of Y with numbers in bold (and no option without bold, it seems).</p>
<p>Same for docs with one or more pages.</p>
<p>However, once I have added them in and formatted them the way I want, I can select them then go to Quick Parts and save this as a new building block, in the page numbers section, create a category called "Adam's numbers" and save it.</p>
<p>Now I can insert these easily in any document at the insertion point.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Thanks Adam,</p>
<p>Good (in a way) to see someone else with the same configuration.</p>
<p>I'll look into the customization as you indicated.</p>
<p>So, the short answer is: No, there is not a straightforward, easy, simple, and efficient way to do the above.</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate your feedback.</p>

<p><span>Hi Samad<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You have to update the windows 8 and Microsoft software. For this you connect to internet through Wi-Fi or through subscription. Go to settings on the phone and click phone update.&nbsp;It will look for the latest update and&nbsp;start updating the software. Don't interrupt
 or disconnect or&nbsp;switch off the phone. This will take upto 30 minutes and the phone will reset with updated software on which the other app run. This is happening may be because of mismatch between the windows / Microsoft software and the app software. Once
 the phone is fully updated the this problems will be automatically fixed and in between you have to check for windows / Microsoft updates for phone and update it. I have done the same and&nbsp;since then&nbsp;I am not having&nbsp;this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            How to delete old duplicate Skype accounts&#63;</h2>
                    A few years ago I must've signed up for Skype through my Facebook and Windows Live accounts, because when I search my name, 3 different profiles appear, all with my personal info. &nbsp;I want to delete the duplicates, but when I try to log in with the skype
 usernames associated with the duplicates it keeps telling me "That Microsoft account doesn't exist"... how can I access these old profiles to delete them? It gets confusing when people try to search for my actual profile.

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete a Skype account created using your Facebook credentials, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><a href="http://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Sign in to your account on the Skype website</span></a>.
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Account settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Unlink</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that after performing the process, you'll be automatically&nbsp; logged out and your Skype account will be considered deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you want to close your Skype account created using your Windows Live account, we need to undergo Microsoft account deletion process, and&nbsp;the process also deletes your Microsoft account. Keep in mind all the services that will be affected when you
 close your Microsoft account. Closing a Microsoft account deletes your Outlook mailbox, your Skype ID&nbsp;and contacts, your files saved in OneDrive, and your Xbox Live data and GamerTag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're ready to delete your Microsoft account, please refer to this link for the steps:

<h3> sailor_pete  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading Office 2000 to Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I currently run Office 2000 Standard on a PC with Windows XP, Home Edition, Version 2002, Service Pack 3. As Outlook, in particular, is geting a bit clunky, and Office 2000 is no longer supported, I have bought Office&nbsp;2010, Home and Business. I wish to preserve
 the&nbsp;existing e-mails, contacts and Calendar entries in the 2010 version, but the instructions offer no guidance on this, particularly as I understand that Office 2003 and later use a different file type to store these data. Would you please offer some guidance,
 including whether I should uninstall Office 2000 before attempting toinstall Office 2010? Thanks in anticipation.

<p>I currently run Office 2000 Standard on a PC with Windows XP, Home Edition, Version 2002, Service Pack 3. As Outlook, in particular, is geting a bit clunky, and Office 2000 is no longer supported, I have bought Office&nbsp;2010, Home and Business. I wish to preserve
 the&nbsp;existing e-mails, contacts and Calendar entries in the 2010 version, but the instructions offer no guidance on this, particularly as I understand that Office 2003 and later use a different file type to store these data. Would you please offer some guidance,
 including whether I should uninstall Office 2000 before attempting toinstall Office 2010? Thanks in anticipation.

    <title>Error trying to install 2013 Office Professional Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> becktaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error trying to install 2013 Office Professional Plus</h2>
                    I purchased the 2013 via the Microsoft Home Use program through our work &amp; have tried to install it on my PC but keep getting an error. I have downloaded the setup file but everytime I try to install I get the error "windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft
 Office15\ClientX64\integratedoffice.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again." then when I click ok on that error another message comes up saying "We're sorry, we had a problem installing your office program(s). Is your internet connection
 working? Do you have enough free space on your main hard drive? Please try installing again after you've checked the above." My internet is connected &amp; running perfectly, I have 451GB free space on my hard drive so I have no idea why I can't install this program.
 Please help. PS. Am not a wiz on a PC so suggestions to fix suitable for a 'dummy'. Many thanks&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error may occur if the Click-To-Run registry key is corrupted. In order to fix this issue, you will have to delete this registry key using Registry Editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>On the keyboard, press the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows key + R</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">regedit</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span> box, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>In the Registry Editor, go to the following registry location and delete the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Click-to-Run</span><span> registry key.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Click-To-Run</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once this key is deleted, you may start the installation of Office 2013, check if the installation completes successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Ensure to backup the registry before editing or deleting any key from the registry.</p>

<p>Benjamin, did you mean Windows 10? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Windows 8.1 was rolled out towards the end of 2014, and the 520 should have received the update at that time. If I remember rightly, it was the "Cyan" update version. You should be able to check your software version within the "About" menu on
 your handset settings. It would also be prudent to check for updates, and see what comes back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
i just got the update to windows mobile 6.1 on my mogul and i activesync it and everythings fine but my contacts aren't there.. i believe it's because when you save a contact it asks whether you want to add that contact to outlook or hotmail, and i chose hotmail
 for all my contacts..i have checked my hotmail and all my contacts are there because they went the when i activesynced but now when i activesync after the update they dont come back, anyone know how to solve this

<h2>            Random folders in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I logged in to my outlook account this week only to notice that there had been several folders added that appear to have generated random numerical and alphabetical names.</p>
<p>I was reading posts from other users who have experienced the same issue, however I have not made any changes to my account recently and have not synced with any new devices.</p>
<p>When I try to delete one folder, not only does another appear but outlook freezes for about 20 - 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>Hi @crystacurry, did Microsoft ever fix this for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it's been two weeks, and Microsoft just keeps asking for more information every few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They've done nothing to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
