<h2>            Rockwell font is a theme font in PowerPoint, but is not in the list of installed fonts</h2>
                    <p>I am using the PowerPoint "Gallery" theme, and the default font is Rockwell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to draw some objects in Visio to export as an image and then insert into my PowerPoint slide, and I would like to be able to compare the size of the drawings to the size of three lines of single-spaced Rockwell while I am drawing them. &nbsp;However, Rockwell
 does not show up in the font list in any Office product, including PowerPoint. &nbsp;It only shows up as a "Theme Font" in PowerPoint and does not show up in the list of "All Fonts". &nbsp;Is there some way I can access this font in Visio?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see here that you want to add some fonts on your Office application. Here's a
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-custom-fonts-to-use-with-office-0ee09e74-edc1-480c-81c2-5cf9537c70ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I went to the link and followed various link trees from there. &nbsp;I found Rockwell, but some links from that particular font were broken, particularly for personal use. &nbsp;The only download link that worked was for web fonts, which are not available on the desktop
 unless I spend $40/month or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I apparently already have this font installed - otherwise, PowerPoint wouldn't be able to use it. &nbsp;The problem is to get some of that text out of PowerPoint and into Visio.</p>

Thanks for your quick response! I'm glad it's not just that I didn't know where to look for the instructions.&nbsp; But I guess I will not&nbsp;leave Outlook open while I do other things, as I used to do with Hotmail.

 Facebook ever did this to me before, though. I was able to find a way to turn that off on my Facebook account.&nbsp; Now there will be more peace in my home. :o)</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I have had the same problem, except:&nbsp; 1) I don't have Facebook; and 2) I close all open programs and the alert sounds stops, and then when I only open Outlook, it starts again, so I think it's fairly safe to assume it is related to Outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, the sounds occurs periodically whether or not a message is being received (it also sounds for messages, but also sounds randomly when no message is coming in).&nbsp; Highly annoying, and there is no other explanation in my case, this started after the involuntary
 "upgrade" from Hotmail to Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I have to choose between having the volume turned on my computer or having Outlook open -- something that is tedious and inconvenient and never happened when we still had Hotmail.

            <p>Hi arabesqueandpirouette,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. In addition to the post of ZigZag3143 and JMH3143, the sound notification feature is not present in the web based Outlook.com so, it will not be making any sound. However, what I am seeing is that perhaps your
 antivirus or firewall&nbsp;is the one causing the sound notification. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not wise to disable both protection while connected to the Internet, but to isolate and determine what's causing the&nbsp;issue, you might as well try to disable them and sign in to your Microsoft account without having to browse any websites just to be
 sure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please continue to monitor if the sound notification is still occurring and inform us about the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just logged into my hotmail account and found my entire account of emails and folders have disappeared (since the 90's). I do have important information that I need to recover and wonder if you're able to provide advice as to how I'd do this?

<p>
</p><p>Info to date:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been unable to restore via delete folder</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Unsure as to the date my account was switched to outlook, have not logged in for a long time</li><li>This is the first time I have logged in with the new outlook interface</li><li><span>I have not re-set any account passwords and this is the first time I have noticed data is missing.</span></li><li><span>I have not clicked on any links, I have followed the login process that re-directed me to the outlook login and provided a verification code.</span></li><li><span>I have not attempted to d</span>eactivate/close before the issue occurred</li><li><span>I believe the last time I logged into this account would be approx 2012 or 2013, unsure.</span></li><li><span>I seem to have lost all emails since the creation of the account in the 90's. Thousands of emails.</span></li><li><span>All folders have also disappeared. All emails are gone from all folders and also inbox.</span></li><li>I have never accessed this account via a mobile device, only via PC's. It is not configured to any smart devices.</li></ul>

    <title>Hiding Parent Form when calling Child Forms and Grandchild Forms&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engrattny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding Parent Form when calling Child Forms and Grandchild Forms&#59; Access 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a quirk I can not account for.&nbsp; I am using this sequence on a parent form's buttonClick, to call a child form:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub ButtonChild_Click()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Visible = False</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmChild",,,,,acDialog</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Visible = true</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, that child calls on a grandchild:</p>
<p>Private Sub ButtonGrandChild_Click()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Visible = false</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmGrandChild",,,,,acDialog</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Visible = true</p>
<p>end sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the effort to figure out how to make it work, I have also set Popup and Modal as YES on each of the three forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going from parent --&gt; child --&gt; parent, works as I expect.</p>
<p>when I go from Parent --&gt; Child --&gt; Granchild --&gt; Child, a weird thing happens...</p>
<p>Just before returning from Child--&gt;Grandchild, the Parent form is not visible, nor is the Child.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Close GrandChildButton push, the GChild closes, and the the Child becomes visible, as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then, at the end of the Button subroutine, after the EndSUb is executed, rather than behaving as a modal [since the child IS still open], the execution falls through<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and code executes in the parent's code module<em>.</em></span><em>&nbsp;
</em>At that point, the Me.Visible is executed, but nothing happens, [it's stays not-visible] and the parent form is gone.&nbsp; The child form stays.&nbsp; If I close it, it disappears, and the parent remains gone.</p>
<p>Each of the child and grandchild use a button to close the form, using this code:</p>
<p>Private Sub butCloseForm_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
On Error GoTo Err_cmdCloseForm_Click<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.RunCommand acCmdSaveRecord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Name<br />
<br />
Exit_cmdCloseForm_Click:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
<br />
Err_cmdCloseForm_Click:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_cmdCloseForm_Click<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>'Commenting out the RunCommand does not change this odd behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would expect that Parent window would persist, but for some reason, it is either closing, or closed on the move from GChild ---&gt;Child.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, the fact that it is not visible confuses access.</p>
<p>If I comment out the first Me.Visible=False in the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Parent's</span> code, just before it calls the child, as expected the Parent window hangs visibly in the background, and can not be accessed [modal], until the child closes properly.</p>
<p>The Child &amp; GChild close buttons are both not set to cancel.&nbsp; I can't see if any Macro code is running, but if it were, ON TOP OF MY PROCEDURE code, I would have no idea how to fathom it out -- I mention it as it behaves AS IF there is a macro being executed
 behind my back.&nbsp;&nbsp; All buttons show execute code on the click event.</p>
<p>Ideas???</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>I think the first problem here is yours very much misunderstanding the difference between a popup form, a modal form, and that of a dialog form. They are VERY different
 kinds of forms in how they function.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So when you say that you're opening the form as dialog, that is VERY much different then setting a form as model.<span>&nbsp;</span>This also explains why you're
 stating that a modal form is behaving different than that of a dialog form. In fact, they are VERY different and are supposed behave differently.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you set a form as modal, and open the form in code as normal then modal setting will be respected. Modal means that the current form open will keep the focus, and
 you can either have that form open another form, or close the current form and return to the previous one (a high portion of my forms are thus set model since I want the user to return back the way they came). However a modal form still permits you to move
 the focus to things like a popup form, or even to the menu bar or in your case the ribbon. Another significant difference of a modal form is that it does NOT halt the calling code as a dialog form does.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, the calling code continues
 to run.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A dialog form on the other hand again behaves VERY much different. First, dialog forms DO HALT the calling code UNLTIL YOU SET VISIBLE = FALSE! (this allows the calling
 to continue and explains your apparent bug). Also dialog forms do NOT permit the focus to move to the ribbon or even a popup form. So model forms allow both of these change in focus actions, dialog forms allow none. The difference between dialog and moral
 forms is thus rather large here and you want to choose the appropriate type of form for the appropriate type of the action and user interface.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Setting the call to acWindowNormal on the parent, with both modal and popup set</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now you are mentioning a popup form and that's a third type of form. Again<span>&nbsp;</span>pop up form has different behaviors then the above two forms. For
 starters, a popup form can stay on top of model forms, but NOT HAVE to receive the focus. So, for help type screens or information boxes that a user needs to be on top, but allow the person to continue data entry in a form is a good example for popup forms.
 So, popup forms can be displayed on top of other forms, but NOT have to get the focus. And, you can move focus from a model form to either the ribbon or a popup form. They really are best suited for wizard or info type boxes. However, just out of the blue
 setting forms as popup can really mess up your ability to control what form is on top. So don't just start clicking on a whole bunch of options without giving them thought or you make a real mess of things.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would not suggest using dialog forms for you goal here as they are rather severe in terms of restricting user actions. However, the issue here is calling code is
 halted UNTILL the form is closed OR you set visible = false. So, here what happens:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Form A code-&gt;form B code</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, form A code waits until form b is closed OR VISIBLE = FALSE (note the visible = false is 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; way for the form A code to run!)</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Form B-&gt;form C</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In the above call B form was JUST SET visible = false. This means that NOW form B code will return to form A code! (the visible = false). Now, things are still halted
 up by the fact that form C is in dialog mode. However, the instant you close C, then that code in A will run. Since form B was set visible = false.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So, just remember that setting a form visible = false permists the CALLLING code to run.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I explain the above detail in the following article of mine in which I use this "feature" to return code values from dialog forms to the calling form. So, setting
 visible = false kicks a dialog form OUT of dialog mode and permits the calling code to run.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/Dialog/Index.html</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>As a general rule, dialog forms are quite restricted user interface approach and design choice on your part (you can't even use the ribbon edit or print a report for
 example). </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A dialog form is really only for yes/no type prompts and it DOES halt the calling code. In fact, it halts so very much of everything, that it can even halts the ability
 of access to often do house keeping and re-plot screens .</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If I were writing this, I would advoid dialog forms. I would control the visible in the forms close event.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In each form I would declare</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Dim frmPrevious<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as form</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Then, in the forms on-load event, I would go</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Set frmPrevious = screen.ActiveForm</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, in the forms close event, you can go:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>frmPrevious.Visible = true</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The above trick also allows you to also reference features and values of the previous form such as frmPrevous.Requery etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note that you code to launch a form must be changed from</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>DoCmd.OpenForm "form1"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Me.Visible = False</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason why we set visible = false AFTER the openform command is because in each forms on-load event we setting up form previous, and that fails if the form is
 not visible.</span></span></p>

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:<br />
http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html<br />
Make sure you run the script as an administrator.<br />

<h2>            Nokia lumia &#40;WP8.1&#41; calendar reminder ringtone duration</h2>
                    <p>In my Nokia Lumia 530 I set the calendar reminder to a music with 1 minute length but, unfortunately, the reminder plays that music for 10 seconds only and then shows&nbsp;the snooze/dismiss options.</p>
<p>This does not make sense to me, the tone should be played untill the user press the dismiss or snooze buttons, just like an wakeup clock. Is there a setting to make the tone to be played until the user dismiss or snooze it. Or to be played&nbsp;more time, say
 1 minute?</p>

<h2>            Mailing pdf from Word for Mac</h2>
                    When I mail a pdf from Word for Mac, it sends it with '.docx.pdf' file extension, which is often rejected by mail servers. Why does this happen and how can I stop it? I want the document to have '.pdf' file extension.

            This always happens if you create a PDF through Word's Save As... PDF, or going through Print Menu &gt; PDF &gt;Adobe PDF.
<br />
<br />
The advantage of using the Print menu way is that you get the opportunity to change the name. Of course You need Acrobat X (You might be able to if you have installed Adobe Reader).<br />
<br />
I don't know why Offiice does this , since this is not good form. If you save an Excel file as PDF&nbsp; it’s the same thing. "workbook.xlsx.pdf"&nbsp; To me that is a bug.&nbsp; But MS thinks it’s a feature obviously.<br />

            I'm seeing exactly the opposite of what Phillip asserts re converting Word documents to PDF. Contrary to what his experience may be, the only time I see a Word document retain the .doc/.docx with .pdf appended is if I use
<br />
Word, itself, doesn't create PDFs, nor does it "mail" a PDF or anything else. It's a word processing program, not a PDF generator or an email client. At your command it calls for those services to be made available. That's the case when using either Save As&gt;
 PDF or Print&gt; PDF...Even when using the File&gt; Share options, Word simply contacts your email client which then takes over &amp; encodes the document file as an attachment or as HTML content.<br />
<br />
If you'll fully describe the specific steps you're taking to generate the PDF, including what update levels of Office &amp; OS X you're using we may be able to at least help identify the cause. Indicate at what exact point the file name extension becomes compounded.
 It would be helpful to know what email program &amp; service you're using, too.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Bob J.<br />

            Hi ... this exact same problem has just started to happen to us. &nbsp;Want to send a word/excel page as a pdf attachment on an email so we :
<div><br />
<div>- select print</div>
<div>- select pdf</div>
<div>- mail as pdf ... this opens email and attaches the pdf item automatically, ready to email ... all as usual and normal .... except ... it has not removed the .doc or .xls .... and just added the .pdf to the end of the file name ....&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>this file name is not accepted by servers and it bounces back !</div>
<div><br />
<div>it never did this before&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>any suggestions ??</div>

            This is very basic. In the Create ribbon you select Query Design mode. You will be prompted to select the tables and/or queries you want in your query. You then drag the OrderNumber from one query to the other to create the Join.
<br />
<br />I'm sure you can find a video showing this process.

            <blockquote>I use Rules / Alerts extensively. Over time, some get duplicated, people change roles, I add a domain rule and want to delete the individual rule, etc.&nbsp; But to find the 'duplicate' or 'old' rule is painful!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an easy way to sort them for
 the cleansing and then have the remaining ones return to original order?</blockquote>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Outlook does not have a convenient way to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My company, Sperry Software, is&nbsp;releasing a new&nbsp;Outlook add-in&nbsp;that will do this.&nbsp; There are buttons to help you find duplicate rules, find rules that move messages but don't have a Stop Processing More Rules action (which can lead to duplicate messages),
 and validates all the folders and people involved in your rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp; You can also sort your rules alphabetically, save them to a human readable format, and print them all from a convenient grid format.&nbsp; You can find out more at
</p>
<p>*Removed* </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this helps!</p>

</p><p>#1 - So to understand this, you have been encountering PST corruption on this file on a regular basis - is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Ignoring all else, any PST file with 0 bytes is toast so hopefully you have a backup (ScanPST makes a backup of the original by default but if the original file became corrupted beyond repair - you're going to need some other copy of it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Was this PST file migrated from an earlier version of Outlook?</p>

                    I don't know what smart folders are and — anyway, how to get rid of this nuisance?<br />
<br />
In high priority, you click on it it loads up hundreds of emails. Are these copies from elsewhere? What the point?<br />

            Smart folders are searches based on criteria in the search. High priority is showing all emails you have marked as high priority over the years and never removed making it a pretty useless feature.<br />
<br />
Control-Click (Right-click) on the Smart folder and select Delete.<br />
<br />
Personalty, I find them very useful. YMMV<br />

            Yes, the sender could have marked them as high priority.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Mail Received today Unread<br />
Mail Received this week<br />
Mail received from category "Clients"<br />
Mail in category "followup"<br />
Date Sent &gt; Any Date (this shows me all messages regardless of folder. I can do several things with this list like assign a category by year for messages. Then I can do a File &gt; Export by category "Year 2011" to save all data as .olm file for one year. All
 messages would be in their original folders.<br />

            <p>Hi Sasuke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Internet Explorer 11 on Windows&nbsp;7. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could occur if certain file type is not configured properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to manually Configuring Open/Save for a File Type.</p>
<p>1. In Internet Explorer 10 or 11 you will first have to click on a file of the type you want to open automatically next time.</p>
<p>2. This will give you the Open/Save prompt.</p>
<p>3. Select the Save option.</p>
<p>4. Then in Internet Explorer click Tools</p>
<p>5. Under Tools click the View Downloads option</p>
<p>6. You will see a popup containing the file that you just downloaded.</p>
<p>7. Right-click on the file.</p>
<p>8. In the options presented, make sure to un-check the option labeled: Always ask before opening this type of file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know&nbsp;</span>if you need any further assistance on Windows related issues and we will be glad to help.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>This option disappeared, probably for security reasons, from IE 9, 10 and 11 a year or two ago.&nbsp;I don't know about IE8.

            <p>Hi, any update on this?</p>
<p>It is really frustrating for all our 4000 customers that try to open .ICA files&nbsp;which always wants to be opened or saved.</p>
<p>Is there a way of ending the question "Do you want to open or save this file?" or is it taken away by design?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Potential DirectX Issue with CS&#58;GO Mouse does not take focus - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Potential DirectX Issue with CS&#58;GO Mouse does not take focus</h2>
                    When attempting to play CS:GO on build 15002, the game does not seem to have focus even though it's in fullscreen mode. The system cursor displays over top the game and the in game cursor is not able to move, only the system cursor moves. Any ideas as
 to how to fix this?&nbsp;

            Same with GuildWars2. In Windowed Fullscreen the mouse works just fine. Switching back to real fullscreen a click with the mouse brings me back to the desktop.

<p><span><span>Hi Carlos,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Quick question, does this happen for any website that you try to access?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Do you have an 3 party programs running in the background of Vista?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Do you have any Anti-virus program that’s monitoring while you’re browsing the web? Let's try clean booting the system to remove 3rd party software and see if that clears up the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>. <span>&nbsp;</span>Is IE still crashing?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.
<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to set your computer back,&nbsp;to boot normal:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box. Type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;<br />
Click the General tab.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> - <strong>load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart to
<strong>restart the computer</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this will fix it for you. Please post back and let us know.

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/33404f6a-8989-4e7c-8101-1895b5b6cdc7" title="Branko147">
Branko147.</a> It's possible that your not getting data from your internet provider or your WiFi router is having a problem. To isolate this, try connecting another device to your WiFi. If still no data received, try contacting your internet provider.

            I saw the only way to fix it was phone reset and offline backup. I have lost some good apps from my phone and all data from them but my internet is now working normally

<h2>            Apps can&#39;t open on lumia 550</h2>
                    I've tried opening some apps on my phone but they can't open. I've performed almost 5 soft resets but still to no avail. Also, updating them can't make them open. Don't want to uninstall bec, lots of documents have been stored on them. Please anyone to
 help me??

            Hi Dominic,<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes apps don't open because the phone's OS build version is not updated, or it's corrupted. To check if it's updated, go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates</strong>.
<br />
<br />
If that wouldn't make any difference, please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up</a></strong> your files, then perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong>. This will reset your device to factory settings.
<br />
<br />
Get back to us with the outcome so we can help you out further. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Adding Domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickcampbell1477  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Domain</h2>
                    <p>I'm doing the walk through with the wizard and it gave me&nbsp;msXXXXXXX.msv1.invalid for the MX record.</p>
<p>The ISP I'm using won't accept this entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked with my other domain names and the MX records are completely different.</p>
<p>I set them up five years ago, so I'm guessing Microsoft has made changes with the servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BTW )</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the other entries in my Office 365 setup which has the .management entry, is telling me there are possible service issues.</p>
<p>I've not noticed any problems with the domain and our office is working fine, including email</p>

<p>Yeah, I already knew all of that, but the record being given to me is being rejected.</p>
<p>The domain is a .management and it was registered through a 3rd party.</p>
<p>I went to the wizard within Office 365 and it told me what information I should put in to TXT, CNAMES, MX</p>
<p>When I tried to do the MX, it was rejected by the 3rd party.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 is telling me to use&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>msXXXXXXX.msv1.invalid</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3rd party is rejecting this extension</p>
<p>I can't use it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I resolved the problem. It seems that Microsoft has some repairs to make to their automatic wizard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't copy and paste the information exactly as it is given.</p>
<p>You have to make some adjustments to the information given as the .msc1.invalid is not correct.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks for your posting, since MX record is used to route email so that email for your domain will come to Office 365 if you verified your domain in Office 365. so every domain verified
 in Office 365 will have the different MX record since they are different domains.</p>
