<h2>            Scroll bar moves by itself, gets stuck on bottom, can&#39;t control</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sometimes scroll bar moves by itself, it goes down and stuck on bottom. It happens in any browser and folder. Format the pc and reinstall OS, but couldn't solve the problem. Ran Antivirus and Defender, but couldn't find any virus. Now I am using only Windows
 defender, no antivirus, still same problem. I am using same Window 10 I had before, but last 2/3 months I am getting this problem. Sometimes if press number 1 or 2 key in keyboard, it fixes the problem, but after few min it starts again. Any one please tell
 me how can I solve this problem. What is the cause of this problem and solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?

Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?

Awaiting your reply.

<p>I have only one user, so I didn't check with other user accounts on the pc. I have windows 10 pro. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 when new Windows 10 came. But after getting this problem I reinstall Windows 10 and did live update. What should I do now to fix
 this issue.</p>

This issue seems to be related to your graphics adapter.

            There was a bug in Windows a while back that caused this to happen, do you have your Desktop background set to Slideshow or your theme colour set to 'Automatically pick an accent colour' 

Go to Settings - Personalisation - Background and if necessary change your Background to Picture

Then click on Colours on the left side and again if necessary set your colour to a set colour

            Well the bug that used be in Windows 10 was that every time the background changed Windows file explorer would refresh and the scrollbar would move.

The only other explanation for this behaviour is that your Down Arrow on your keyboard is stuck . . .

<p>Thanks for your reply. I think its a bug in Windows 10. My keyboard is fine. So, should I update windows 10 or what should I do. I changed the background setting. Am I going to get back the same problem?</p>

            I don't see the Acer V3-571 as a supported model for the Windows 10 1703 update, so that might be why:
https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/windows10-creators-update

Downgrading to an older release might be the only solution, such as the Anniversary Update.

            Some applications go into "autoscroll" mode when you press and hold the mouse scroll wheel. Could you be doing something like that?

<h2>            Internet is very slow after upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>It is now taking as long as 15 minutes to load a webpage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I avoided like the plague the "free" offer of upgrading to Windows 10 and then one day, my computer went blank and I got a small window with the message that Windows 10 was being installed.&nbsp; I couldn't
 stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my internet connectivity is destroyed.&nbsp; Thank you Microsoft for damaging my computer.&nbsp; It worked beautifully with Windows 8 until you forced fed the upgrade into my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped at Staples and conferred with their computer technician who told me he had the same problems.&nbsp; He said, contrary to the Microsoft "expert" who responded to my initial posting, that it was not a "cookie" problem but rather&nbsp;a "driver" problem.&nbsp; The
 technician told me he could fix it for me, but it will cost money.&nbsp; Should I&nbsp;have to pay to have my computer fixed after Microsoft damaged it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to have better computer support than a posting board.&nbsp; Try and send an email to Microsoft tech support.&nbsp; It's impossible.&nbsp; I tried to even access an email option and after an hour I gave up.&nbsp; So much for customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is undoubtedly making huge money by destroying the functional capability of people's computes.</p>
<p>

<p>I am very frustrated with the "help" I am getting from Microsoft after Microsoft ruined my computer by force feeding Windows 10 into my computer, replacing Windows 7.&nbsp; Ever since this occurred, I have extremely poor Internet speed.&nbsp; I can connect.&nbsp; BUT THE
 SPEED is ridiculously slow.&nbsp; Sometimes, it takes as long as 10 minutes to access my email page.&nbsp; Downloading websites can take me up toe 8 minutes and then if you click on something to take you to another webpage, it takes forever.&nbsp; I stopped by the Microsoft
 store and I was told it was probably the drivers.&nbsp; I UPDATED THE DRIVERS.&nbsp; In fact, they were marked as being up to date, but I went ahead and checked for the most recent ones.&nbsp; No problems surfaced.&nbsp; What am I supposed to do to have this corrected??&nbsp; I certainly
 do not intend to pay someone at Microsoft to repair my computer when it was Microsoft who ruined my computer.&nbsp; I want someone from Microsoft to contact me to fix this problem.&nbsp; I am sick of trying to address why
</p>
<p>Windows 10 did this to my computer.</p>

    <title>Monitor Flashing On Off Win XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joefromsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor Flashing On Off Win XP</h2>
                    <p>So this happened a week or so ago and also this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the morning I wake up the computer and open my email. Almost immediately the screen starts flashing on off, too quick to quite make out and read what's on the screen. I wait a few minutes hoping it'll stop, but end up having to do a hard shutdown. When
 it boots up again the screen issues is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got some great help here in the past, with BSODs mainly, and hope for some good advice again :-) Need to coax this old XP machine along for awhile longer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been reading up on this a bit, and might the problem be due to my BIOS? </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?<br />
Intel Pentium 4CPU?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
XP ver 2002 SP III<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
Firefox 36.0.4<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
Sorry don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have AVG Free and windows firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help Folks!</p>

<h3> alexdeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            CLR error 80070005 when trying to run a MAMP on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed MAMP on my PC and try to run it but see this error:</p>
<p><em>CLR error&nbsp;80070005. The program will now terminate.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it's something related to Windows User permissions.</p>
<p>When I restart my PC and try to launch MAMP first seconds after login it runs. But after this if I close it I can't open it again.</p>
<p>I guess some Windows service that's loaded is blocking it. I disabled firewall and tried to check permissions but the problem still not solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it on other PC and it launches without problem. So it's something with my Windows user permissions I guess.</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Keycode for Play&#47;Pause key on Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve rothkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keycode for Play&#47;Pause key on Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1 on a Toshiba laptop with a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my own music shuffle program that randomly chooses songs from my database and uses the windows media player control to play them.</p>
<p>The play/pause key on the MS keyboard works for windows media player whether it has focus or not, and it works for VLC media player though only when VLC has focus. It doesn't work for my program regardless of whether it had focus or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added a RegisterHotKey call in my program to install a handler for VK_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE&nbsp; (0xB3). After doing that, the play/pause key on the laptop's built-in keyboard correctly pauses/resumes playback in my program. But the play/pause key on the MS keyboard
 still isn't affecting my program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume the problem is that the MS keyboard is generating some other keycode (instead of the "standard" 0xB3) and I just need to hook that keycode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is, what is the keycode? I've tried other keycodes that I've found searching on the web -- 207 (decimal, which might be specific only to Ubuntu), 22H (which might be specific to another keyboard and only Windows ME, and when I hooked that it
 activated on the PageDown key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the code from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/gg153546%28v=vs.85%29.aspx to display keycodes, and it reports the internal keyboard generating 0xB3 but it doesn't show any key being pressed at all when I press the play/pause
 button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I programatically hook the play/pause key from the MS keyboard?</p>

    <title>Office 365 Applications uninstall after 1903 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garethdoherty1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Applications uninstall after 1903 update</h2>
                    <p>MM laptop had all office products installed on it which come with my Office 365 Subscription, and last night i installed the 1903 update. After the restart, all my office products were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experience this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only quirky thing i can think of is that i had Excel and Outlook open when the update downloaded and installed, and maybe that affected it somehow.</p>

            Hi Gareth
<br />
<br />I have not heard of this happening with the 1903 update, however it has happened in the past with other large Windows 10 Updates . . .
<br />
<br />It may well be a bug which happens as you say, if those applications are open when that update is being applied . . .
<br />

<p>A DLL file is an important system file needed for an application or program to run.&nbsp; It seems that there was an issue with the program itself and it would be best to contact the developer(HP) for the fix. This way, they can address the issue and resolve
 it for you. </p>

<p>Hey there Lilly, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. Have you had any problems in the past with this message appearing?
</p>
<p>Go ahead and take a look at the following link. It will take you to a list of some helpful resources that you can look at. Specifically the Minecraft Forum, this should be a great place to get more information on the authentication message appearing on your

<p>Hey Lilly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for keeping us updated. To elaborate further on what Ronin was mentioning, you may need to log into
<a href="https://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a>. After logging in, I'm thinking the website is going to have you verify your account information. Afterwards, you should be able to log into Minecraft and join your friends' games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results!</p>

<p>Hey there Lilly thanks for keeping us in the loop,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested by fellow XBFs try updating the password on the account from our website. Go to
<a href="https://account.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account.Xbox.com</a>&nbsp;since it could be that its been a while since it was last updated.&nbsp;Also try to delete and re-download the app since it could be on that end&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;Give it a shot and
 let us know how it goes. </p>

            <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began having problems with Chrome after build 10525, but a slightly different vein. While Chrome itself was responsive, it would lose internet connectivity. This would then filter over to any other program reaching out to the e.g. Outlook. After exiting
 Chrome and trying to restart the PC, the reboot would stall and I'd have to hit it in the head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I would open System Internals Process Explorer there would be an image of Chrome hung in memory. Could not Task kill it or kill it with Process Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not remove Chrome but went back to Firefox and these problem *seem* to have disappeared. So far.</p>
<p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. What is the exact error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Runtime error is a software or hardware problem that prevents a program from working correctly. Runtime errors might cause you to lose information in the file you're working on, cause errors in the file (corrupt the file) so you can't work with it, or
 prevent you from using a feature. Unlike stop errors, runtime errors don't typically cause Windows or a program to stop working.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1<br />
</strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
If the issue does not persist in the safe mode then try clean boot to check if any third party program installed on the computer is causing the startup error.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2<br />
</strong>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Note: Follow step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

            Microsoft explains the differences here to help you choose between the two:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/help-me-choose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-rt/help-me-choose</a><br />
<br />
But I'll try to sum it up here:<br />
<br />
The Surface RT can't run traditional Windows desktop programs. Instead, it's limited to apps you download from the bundled Store app. The Surface RT also includes versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. For many people, that's all they need.<br />
<br />
What the Surface RT lacks in horsepower it makes up for in extended battery life: Mine typically runs two or three days if I'm just using it a few hours a day.<br />
<br />
The Surface Pro, by contrast, is like a desktop computer in a tablet package. It can run both traditional desktop programs, as well as apps. All that power comes at a price, though, as it lacks the battery life found in the Surface RT. Its battery probably
 won't last more than four or five hours. (Microsoft hasn't yet released battery life figures.)<br />
<br />
So, when choosing between the two, decide what's more important to you: battery life or traditional desktop programs. Then choose the Surface that best meets your needs.<br />

<h2>            I am getting MFC application has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an application named idg1429.exe developed in vc++ using VS6. When I run this application on
<strong><em><u>Windows Server 2008</u></em></strong>, in English Locale, it runs successfully. But when we run the application with Japanese Locale, initially it starts successfully but if we try move away from the focus of application then it crashes and gives
 error "MFC application has stopped working".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same application works well on <strong><em><u>Windows XP</u></em></strong> for both English as well as Japanese Locale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is the even veiwer logs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>General:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Faulting application idg1429.exe, version 1.0.0.1, time stamp 0x51516925, faulting module idg1429.exe, version 1.0.0.1, time stamp 0x51516925, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x001adad8, process id 0xc14, application start time 0x01ce2a04dc5b86b7.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Initially, when I tried to complie my code on vs2008, I got few syntax errors(windows server 2008 doesnot have support for VS6) but that got resolved after minor changes and so I sarted debugging the application.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It's been 1 month and I have got nothing in my hand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Firstly,I thought of some thread getting terminated while the application runs, but through debugging I was not able to trace it down.</div>
<div>Secondly, thought of memory leak. Used tools such as memoryleakdetector.exe and application verifier.exe but got nothing.</div>
<div>Also used Dependecy Walker.exe to list down the faulty dll. It listed IMJP10K.dll in the red category and not much I was able to figure out of it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While debugging I have been getting the below error before the crash:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Windows has triggered a breakpoint in idg1429.exe. This may be due to corruption of the heap, which indicates a bug in idg1429.exe or any of the DLLs it has loaded-. This may also be due to user pressing F12 while javaw.exe has focus. The output window
 may have more diagnostic information. [BREAK] [CONTINUE] [IGNORE]"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help in this regard will be appriciated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

</p><p>Unfortunately, Skype is no longer supported on Mac devices running on <strong>
Mac OS X 10.8 and lower</strong>. Users with unsupported platforms might experience issues with calling, messaging, signing in or the application could stop working completely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Affected users can still use Skype on a supported platform as long as they meet the system requirements.

<p>We do not have a working version compatible for Mac OS X 10.8 as Skype already retired support for this. You would have to either
<strong>use Skype on a supported platform </strong>or <strong>upgrade your OS to Mac OS X 10.9 or higher
</strong>(if applicable). </p>

</p><p>My users are all Win 7 pro 64. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thompson Reuters will probably be able to identify the specific windows update that causes the error.</p>

            Windows automatic updates were installed overnight. &nbsp;This morning we are having the same issue on our Windows 7 workstations that access Thomson Reuters tax &amp; accounting software. We did system restore to earlier point and all is good again (at &nbsp;least
 for now).&nbsp;

            I uninstalled the update from two affected workstations, rebooted and everything (Thompson Reuters Tax &amp; Accounting Suite in particular) works as it should.

            <p>Microsoft's update KB3176493 and KB3176495 for Windows 10 resolved some security issues in IE10 and IE9. &nbsp;Thomson Reuters accounting programs that are affected are using an older IE7 API upon startup to display current content from their own servers inside
 deprecated frames - TOP.HTML, SEPARATOR.HTML and CONTENTS.HTML. &nbsp;Because IE7 is not supported by Microsoft any longer, the corresponding files did not get updated while the newer files did. &nbsp;This breaks rendering the T-R webpages in the frames where they are
 called, and is what is causing the error messages to occur.<br />
</p>
<p>The problem is with T-R using the outdated &amp; unsupported API with their accounting packages. &nbsp;At this time, we do not anticipate Thomson Reuters will update their Creative Solutions program because it has been termed end-of-life and will not be supported
 at all after June 1, 2017.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the info.&nbsp; However, the only Creative Solutions Program being termed end-of-life is the Write-Up software, for this they have a new platform.&nbsp; The Fixed Assets, Ultra Tax &amp; FileCabinet programs will still be supported so I would like to think
 that Thomson Reuters will respond and get an update at their end.&nbsp; So far the only program at our office that's been affected by the latest Windows update is FileCabinet.</p>
