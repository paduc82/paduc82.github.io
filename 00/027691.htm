            <p>Hi Purden,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize if one of your email accounts is unable to switch back to the old Hotmail layout. Please be informed that if you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail will not be available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Eventually, all Hotmail users will be upgraded to Outlook.com. The launch of Outlook.com preview</span><span> gave everyone an opportunity to learn together as we roll out and scale this new service.
</span><span>We will continue to listen closely and fine tune so </span><span>Outlook.com experience will continue to improve</span><span>. You need not worry since it is just like the same old Hotmail, only the interface had changed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            <blockquote>My hotmail account has automatically been changed to Outlook in my personal computer. I am having great difficulty with this so called "new and improved" site. First, every time I try to log in to my old hotmail account the
 Outlook screen appears. I cannot even begin to set up the Outlook mail because there is no way to access my old hotmail service to get my "contact" list to transfer to Outlook..... What a mess for a novice computer user.... All I want is to start being able

<p><br />
You won't be able to switch back.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This may work...</p>
<p>To access your Contact list, once you are signed in<br />
- upper left corner of the screen, you will see the word "Outlook"<br />
- To the right of that, will be a vertical "I"<br />
- To the right of that will be a "v" symbol<br />
Click on the "v" symbol, and that should take you to a screen that has options like<br />
MAIL&nbsp;&nbsp; PEOPLE<br />
Click on PEOPLE, that should take you to your contact list, in Outlook format.<br />

Good luck.&nbsp; Learn to live with the Outlook interface, like you would&nbsp;a personal speech impediment that you wake up with one morning, and you are stuck with it for the rest of your life.

    <title>Most of the Cc&#39;d recipients are not shown on incoming messages. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arabesqueandpirouette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Most of the Cc&#39;d recipients are not shown on incoming messages.</h2>
                    <p>When I receive new messages, sometimes the people that the e-mail writer included as cc's are not shown, so I can't tell (until I read the context of the e-mail) who is on copy, which is a hindrance.&nbsp; I can hit reply to all and it displays them, but I tend
 in general not to "reply all" but pick particular recipients, or just the sender-- but I need to be able to immediately see who is on cc distribution before I can decide this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what use to be one step in Hotmail (because as soon as you&nbsp;click on a message in in-box, it showed all&nbsp;cc names)&nbsp;is now 2 or 3 steps in Outlook -- you must first click open a message, then you have to hit reply all to see who else is copied, then have
 to take out the ones you don't want (for example, if I could see who the cc's were at the beginning, I would know to just hit "reply" and avoid having to cherry pick names a lot of the time.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Please don't suggest I change the default option to "reply all" in the advanced settings -- I tried that, and it doesn't help this problem -- you still can't tell who is on copy until you hit the "reply all" button -- and I don't know why that can't be
 displayed immediately when the message opens.)</p>

<p><br />
This is a poor and ill-thought-out design, if that's the case.&nbsp; For professionals that use their e-mail to conduct business, it just adds an extra step before you write a reply -- because if your business is sensitive, whether you are replying to one or multiple
 recipients is a critical distinction.&nbsp; I resent that Outlook thinks it knows better than Gmail, Yahoo, and even it's own prior Hotmail interface how to present such a critical piece of a message -- &nbsp;all&nbsp;of these other servers allow a user to instantly see
 who a message is from and who is on copy without several extra steps (or guesswork based on the message text).&nbsp; I regret giving business to MSN since 1997, as a paid account holder, only to have MSN turn the tables and foist this terrible interface on us,
 without choice and without soliciting feedback to begin with before doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the other comment I've made about the overly and unnecessarily large icons used to display the attachments were addressed, then there would be more space freed up for the critical functions of e-mailing (like displaying all CC's at one time).</p>

            That is absolute MARKETING speak--turning an ill-informed decision about functionality into a "feature." Showing all the cc'd recipients does NOT reveal more than a line or two more of the message, if that. (In the past, Outlook showed only three or four
 lines of cc'd recipients if there were many many of them.) What everyone has said is true: more work, more clicks, less functionality. I want to return to the earlier version of Outlook!<br />

<p>
</p><p>there is not much about it on internet - it is apparently related to making change in file explorer to open in another windows but this does not work for me

<p>I did change that file explorer option and still the same.</p>

<p>Hello Jaros,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would just like to clarify some information. You mentioned that your are using iShare, are you opening the excel files directly from the iShare app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the files stored locally on your computer? Have you set .xlsx files to be <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028161/windows-10-change-default-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
opened by Excel 2013 by default</a>?</p>

Skype for Web FAQ</a> mentions support for only Edge (Windows 10) and Chrome (Mac/Windows). It makes no references to any other web browsers.&nbsp; If it has worked/was supported in the past and no longer works now, those supported browsers would be your only method

<p>Hi Maggie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your query in having another antivirus program. We highly suggest to use the new Windows defender, because it is helping our PC to protect by scanning for malware, viruses, and, security threats. It also uses real time protection to scan everything
 that you download and run to your PC. Please check this article about Windows defender: Help protect my computer with
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Defender</a>. It contains troubleshooting steps pertaining to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>It is absolutely your choice which Anti-Virus program you want to use.</p>
<p>Windows 10 comes with in-built Windows Defender but that does not mean that you have to use it...</p>
<p>It is definitely depending on your own personal needs which Anti-Virus program fits best for you.</p>

<p>Let's look at what Windows Defender Security Center (which includes---but is not limited to---Windows Defender Antivirus) actually DOES for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is time to do some reading.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why are we reading all these things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Third Party Antimalware Programs will try to take advantage of your lack of information about what Windows Defender Security Center actually does for you in addition to just fending off Virus Attacks.</p>
<p>That is what the articles shown above are about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which product you choose in the end is entirely up to you but make an INFORMED choice, at least.</p>

It suppresses only a bubble message while using Screen Clipping.
<div>AFAIK there is no switch to suppress the "annoying" text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But you can set the clipboard as target for the clip. By pasting from the clipboard there is no additional message.</div>

    <title>How to Display Resource Availability by Macro or Formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niteshm  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Display Resource Availability by Macro or Formula</h2>
                    <p>Hi All;</p>
<p>I’m using MS Excel 2007 and need a solution of my problem with some formula or macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Below is the table (entered in excel) in which I wanted to place a Month (in column B) from which resource is free (which is displayed as 0).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Any Macro or Formula which helps me to display the availability month when resource is free and also&nbsp;its automatically change the
 month whenever I increased the booking of resource and display only that month from which he/she is getting free.</p>
<p>One more thing to share that I’m not interested to make changes in my table structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here :
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>1. Resource Names are displayed in Column A</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>1. Resource Names are displayed in Column A</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. Program ID’s are displayed as Prg1, Prg2, etc.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Zero (0) indicates resource availability in the month.</p>

<p>I have been trying to access my main hotmail account for the past 2 days and I have provided my information that is accurate and I still have not been able to access my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The email address that I am referring to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and the reference number that I was given by Claudia is #1435948330 and she even reassured me that she put notes on my file to escalate the matter so I can get
 access to the email account and I still can't access it. I receive important emails about work etc. So I would like to see this matter rectified immediately because this is not professional. &nbsp;I would like to have access to my email account asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Shannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the urgency in this issue. Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community forum. I was able to pull up the reference number you've provided and based on the notes, you were told that the account could be compromised and you were
 advised to recover your account. Were you able to perform that step before? If not, kindly fill out the needed information in this
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">form</a></strong> so we can help you recover your account. There's a box wherein you need to enter an alternate email so we can contact you, make sure to put a different email
 from the one we're trying to recover.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We need to know much more about your computer. Please answer <em>each of the following
</em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. <em>Assuming you started with Win8 =&gt;</em> When (approx. date) was Win8.1 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em> expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Is KB2962872, KB2971850, KB2973201, KB2961072, KB2972280 and/or KB2974008 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. When (exact date) was KB2919355 installed according to <strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,

<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v14.0.0.145</strong> <em>for Internet Explorer</em> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;

    <title>Pivot Table Monthly Reporting - Daily Accumulation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table Monthly Reporting - Daily Accumulation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to display and calculate monthly reports through a pivot table, but running into some issues. (Excel 2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>I'm giving out loans (interest accumulated daily) that need to be repaid in 30 days at "rate" or else they accumulate late penalties "late rate".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially: if between date1 and date2, use dailyamt, if between date2 &amp; date3, use dailyamt_late, else 0. sum all entries for month</p>
<p>These dates can span across multiple months, but need to display monthly amounts owed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Current setup:</strong></p>
<p>I have a table with many entries with the following columns:</p>
<p>amt = Overall Amount</p>
<p>funding date = date1</p>
<p>rate = yearly rate between date1 and date2</p>
<p>dailyamt = rate*amt/360</p>
<p>late date = date2 (30 days after date1)</p>
<p>late rate =rate between date2 * date3</p>
<p>dailyamt_late = late rate *amt/360</p>
<p>date3=payoff date</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Automated monthly reports of amount owed through a pivot table.</p>
<p>It should give report showing the sum all interest owed (dailyamt*days in month + dailyamt_late*days in month).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Entry example:</p>
<p>date1 = 7/8/2016</p>
<p>date2 = 8/7/2016</p>
<p>date3 = 9/3/2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>For July, this entry should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>23 days (July 31 - date1) multiplied by the dailyamt</li></ul>
<p>For August, this entry should have: </p>
<ul>
<li>7 days (date2 - August 1) multiplied by the dailyamt</li><li>24 days (August 31 - date2) multiplied by dailyamt_late</li></ul>
<p>For September, this entry should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 days (date3 - September 1) multiplied by dailyamt_late</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I don't necessarily need things broken out by current or late, just need total amount for each month. I'm willing to change my table as needed, use calculated fields in PivotTable, use Power Pivot, Queries, VBA, or whatever cool tools are out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we get number of days between Date1/Date2 and Date2/Date3 then by multiplying them with respective dailyamt&nbsp;/dailyamt_late, we can get Interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel has <strong>Days</strong> Formula giving the number of days between 2 dates.</p>
<p>Syntax- Days(EndDate,StartDate) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Interest Amt @ Normal Rate = Days between Day1/Day2 * dailyamt&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest Amt @ Late Rate = Max(Days between Day2/Day3, 0) * dailyamt_late&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total interest = Interest Amt @ Normal Rate + Interest Amt @ Late Rate</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uploaded the sheet for your reference.</p>

<p>Hi Manoj,</p>
<p>Based on your description, I have done some tests and cannot reproduce your scenario. So I need some information below to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>1. Based on my tests, we will be asked to choose a way to open the PDF attachment after we click&nbsp;<b>Print</b>. Can you open the PDF attachment in other ways (like open with Internet Explore)?</p>
<p>2. Can you open other types of attachments such as Excel in the same way (open with Word Online) after clicking&nbsp;<b>Print</b>? Meanwhile, try opening another PDF attachment.</p>
<p>3. Can you open the PDF attachment in OWA on other PCs?</p>
<p>4. Regarding “if I click on Open a printable PDF of your document link on the bottom, the link open another tab on IE11”, can you view the PDF document in the new window? If yes, it may be caused by IE which can’t recognize the original PDF document and
 then convert it to a recognizable one.</p>
<p>5.Try it in the Outlook client to see if it works.</p>
<p>We appreciate your updates.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>1 - I can open the PDF after downloading on local computer from OWA. I visited a website on IE11 and clicked on one of pdf manual &nbsp;and pdf got opened in IE without any issue.</p>
<p>2 - I can open excel and word files in OWA and I can print them without any issue.</p>
<p>3 - In OWA when I click on the attachment, I can view the pdf on the left hand side but when I click on print, I get stuck on print preview windows.</p>
<p>4 - No I can't view the pdf in another window as well. The only way to print the document is downloading pdf on local pc and then print it or use Google Chrome.</p>
<p>5 - Are you talking about MS Outlook? Outlook Client application has no issue. It's OWA where I have issue with printing the pdf attachment.</p>

<p>Based on &nbsp;your description, the issue may be related to the integration of OWA and IE11.</p>
<p>Since it works in Google Chrome, I suggest you use this browser at the moment.</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm the following to narrow down it:</p>
<p>1. Could you please send the PDF to us for test to identify if it is related to the PDF file?</p>
<p>To protect the privacy, I have sent you my email account via a Private Message. Please click this link to access the message:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations<br />
</p>
<p>2. What’s the Operation System are you using?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

<h2>            Access 2007 &#34;Create Outlook Task...&#34; - Outlook 2010 FAIL</h2>
                    Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any help.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having a bit of trouble with Access 2007 and Outlook 2010.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to "Create Outlook Task..." for a Saved Export in Access 2007 and I'm getting the following message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The Microsoft Office Access Outlook Add-in is disabled in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007. To collect data by using e-mail messages in Microsoft Office Access 2007, verify that this add-in is installed and enable from within Office Outlook 2007"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't have Outlook 2007 installed I have Outlook 2010. Is this the problem or shouldn't it matter and there's another issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks again</div>
<div>William</div>
                </div>

            I think it's a different issue. Check the Options dialog under the Office button, Add-Ins tab, COM Add-Ins (at the bottom). Perhaps the add-in is not checked so it is not active.

                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS there a way to delete a number in a cell but not the formula. I am writing a Macro to clear the sheet of old values but i want the formulas to remain so when new data is imported, the calculations are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!!</p>

I avoid special cells if at all possible.&nbsp; It has returned unexpected results more than once.<br />
Last cell returned multiple cells for me one time.<br />

Just to see, I ran your posted code in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">xl2003</span>.&nbsp; SpecialCells returned 16385.<br />

<p>
</p><p>And the range is $A$1:$A$16385.&nbsp; And that's the wrong answer.&nbsp; QED.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since every other cell has a constant, the correct answer is 8193 cells, and the range should be a list of the form $A$1, $A$3, $A$5,....</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS....&nbsp; We should be able to see that (well, one less) by setting n=2^14 in selectIt.&nbsp; But in that case, Excel 2003 crashes [1] on my old XP computer.&nbsp; I don't know if that might be a resource limitation of that particular computer, or if that is a defect/limitation
 of VBA in Excel 2003.&nbsp; n=2^14 works as intended in Excel 2007, even with an "xls" file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to test my specific example, use __my__ test case.&nbsp; Klunk!&nbsp; To that end, your test is inconclusive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you want to demonstrate that the issue is not the number of <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">cells</span></em> per se, you might have done that -- if and only if __my__ test case does fail in Excel 2013.&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, my own further testing demonstrates that is indeed correct (in Excel 2007).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Off-hand, I don't know exactly under what conditions SpecialCells does not behave as intended (in Excel 2007).&nbsp; I'm not going to take the time to deduce the rule(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my point was and remains to be:&nbsp; be wary of using SpecialCells with "large" ranges (TBD) because sometimes it returns unintended results -- at least in some releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could live with its "unpredictability" if it returned a runtime error.&nbsp; But when it "fails", it returns the entire range, not just the range(s) of qualified cells.&nbsp; That could do a lot of damage.</p>

<p>Second: How do I un-lock them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have these 'files' and 'pictures' ( family, I would even let you view them IF I could get them un-locked) that Win 10 Pro is telling me the&nbsp; Directories are locked ...Microsoft, I Am the Admin, why would you lock My files/folders???</p>
<p>...and yes I have tried Microsofts standard UN-lock solutions and None of them work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;any other ideas ...?</p>

<p>Do not know why there are Two (2) 'Everyone' in here but Highlight only the one that has a 'Deny' in front of it and then click/press '<strong>EDIT</strong>'.</p>
<p>That should take you to this screen.....3.</p>

<p>Change 'Type' to your choice in the dropDown.</p>
<p>Change 'Applies To' To your Preferred choice in it's dropDown.</p>
<p>Select the Boxes you went to empower and press/click 'OK' till you are back to the begining.</p>
<p>I now have access to My folders...Still do not understand Why the Permissions were changed in the first place.</p>
<p>Hope this will save others from a lot of down time for nothing.</p>

            <p>You don't have access to that area on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So "other" is basically a storage of data from a variety of sources (photos, music and video as well as reserved space for applications).&nbsp; Each application that writes (and stores data) has their own specific area to use so WP allocates space according to
 needs of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone allocate storage dynamically, so if the phone is relatively empty, it will reserve a&nbsp;lot of space&nbsp; (as an example, IE and&nbsp;Maps would take space.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;you add more to your device it will release some of the reserved&nbsp;space back to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty much if space is not being used, it will automatically take space and reserve it for use for what is there.&nbsp; If a new app is installed and it needs more space, the phone will allocate&nbsp;the space needed.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. It was working fine until yesterday. Now i have request to enable push notification plastered accross the middle of the screen making Skype on my iphone unuseable. If I enable push notifications it goes away but the minute I turn
 off notifications it comes back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this some sort of underhand process that Microsoft is introducing that benefits them at the expense of users?</p>

<p>Same issue. &nbsp;No matter what you do it does not go away. &nbsp;Please release a patch to remove the banner or provide better instructions here on how to get rid of it. &nbsp;It's extremely annoying and takes up lots of screen real estate. &nbsp;I don't want push notifications
 from Skype and should have the right to refuse them.</p>

<p>So... this has been going on for over a month with 200+ views. This says to me that other people have an issue with this non-removable banner (nicely illustrated by Chris_512ATX). And what has been done? Nothing, zero, zip, nada... etc etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great that M$ claim to listen to their users and respond to comments and feedback. Yeh, right...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on! Get your act together. Remove this banner! We’re savvy enough to turn on notifications if we want. I thought you’d done enough by completely changing Skype, but now you’re steadfastly refusing to help. &nbsp;Fantastic customer service. Can do MUCH better...</p>

<p>Microsoft should be renamed into something more appropriate... You know more in line with the quality of software they produce and the level of customer experience that they maintain.... Or rather don't....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely the downfall of Skype. This stupid banner reeks of desperation for wider market share, nearly raping us into submission to enable notifications from Skype. Absurd in this day and age. And really not that farsighted.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since you're using Office 2007, you don't need the compatability pack - that's to enable Word 2003 &amp; earlier to open docx files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the file has a docx extension, that would ordinarily imply it's a Word 2007 or later file. Of course, it's possible the file has the wrong extension. Do you know what version of application created&nbsp;the file&nbsp;(Office is not an application - it's a suite
 of applications inclusing Word, Excel, etc)?</p>

<h2>            Can you help me fix Error 801812EO&#63;</h2>
                    I have the Nokia Lumia 800 Windows&nbsp; 7.5<br />
The Hotmail has stopped synching properly (it says it has, but it is out of date) and the built in ebay does not work.<br />
Consequently, I tried to restore it via the last update (August 2012). When I try to reset it, I get the above error code.<br />
I have tried to restore via Zune (which was the previous answer), but that provides the same error code.<br />
What can I do?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi dilmarus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time you posted this thread there was a temporary hotmail sync issue which should now be resolved and hotmail should be syncing normally on mobile devices again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the error you received when trying to reset your phone, please take a look at the following threads where a similar issue was discussed:</p>

                    When I click to select a cell within a document, the border does not select the cell accurately but an area slightly askew of the actual cell border. According to community forum posts this has been a problem for years and has yet to be addressed. Please
 help. Thank you. &nbsp;

            I apologize but I didn't expect such a prompt reply!! I figured because the template documents from which I'd began (which had the problems) were older files, I created a new template from scratch and no problems now.&nbsp;
