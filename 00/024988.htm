<h2>            Please take my FEEDBACK&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft, you guys say that Windows 10 is being built on the feedback of consumers but I have been on forums, twitter, and everything else and no one has acknowledged my concern for Windows 10 and its making me a very upset customer. I even updated to the
 Win 10 preview JUST to give you guys this feedback on the feedback app.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of Continuum and the integration with Xbox One but I really need a User Interface that supports GamePads like the Xbox One controller with apps such &nbsp;as netflix/hulu supporting controller. My PC is hooked to a tv and there is a growing trend
 towards living room PCs. <br />
<br />
*Also a wireless Xbox Controller for Windows would be much appreciated, please send my complaints to the devs on Windows 10. This is my must have feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 should know if you are using a TV and Controller and instead or tablet mode or desktop mode it would go to a living room mode. A whole new graphical interface by the way. Make it just like the Xbox One interface and have them both be updated at
 the same time. Very&nbsp;Important feature.</p>

            It would nice if Microsoft could personally respond to feedback, but with over 800,000 pieces submitted and 1.5 million testers, I seriously think that would be an impossibility. Microsoft usually tries to accommodate requests, but unfortunately, you need
 to wait for the next build to see the difference. I usually find it to be a pleasant surprise when I see the changes implemented on new builds and if you do not like something, you submit new feedback on the issue. The system does work, but some patience and
 understanding is required.

            <p>Hi Obi_Alfred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Rick-M says, we (Microsoft) can't always answer every post individually, but please know that we are listening. I like your idea, but need a little clarification. Are you saying that you would like gamepads like the Xbox One controller to work for input
 (for example emulating mouse input), or are you suggesting a different graphical user interface as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thank You John!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am suggesting the latter. An interface that can detect input from controllers (Xbox One) and can scale nicely to TVs. It should be the same interface as the Xbox One for consistency. I don't know for sure how universal apps work but Xbox One apps should
 work on the Console UI. Emulating mouse input doesn't sound ideal to me, but better than nothing I suppose.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again and I hope you all over at Microsoft can implement these ideas into Windows 10.</p>

            Basically the Xbox One Interface should not be based on if you are using an Xbox One. It should be activated based on input such as a controller and based on connection to a TV. If a user wants he should also be able to manually go to the Xbox One mode.
 This would make Windows 10 the PERFECT OS. Would kill Steam OS too.

<p>How big a percent of the billion plus desktop users does million or so truly represent...??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is, sadly, not a very big one at all. The problem..?? Limiting it's use to those who are willing to use a ms account, a very tiny number indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open it up so the vast majority can join in, and I bet the feedback they would receive would be completely different. Under the current system, said feedback will not be apparent until 10 goes to market.</p>

            <p>I agree with you that Windows would be a great HTPC (Home Theater PC) OS if it were usable with the Xbox controller.&nbsp; I think you might be able to use it already though with the start screen.&nbsp; I'm not too familiar with how the buttons are mapped on the controller
 but if you use the arrow keys on the keyboard at the start screen (on windows 8.1) or the start menu (Windows 10) you can navigate between tiles.&nbsp; Are the joysticks and d-pad on the controller mapped to the arrow keys? If so this should work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah emulating the mouse would be a pain for anything other than web browsing.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to all information you shared, we understand the issue is that Recent files are empty in Office apps when you close apps then reopen, or when you restart Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We test on Mac OS Mojave 10.14.2, Recent files work fine, we cannot reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to suggest you completely uninstall Office with the steps in the article below:</p>

<p>I am having the same problems as Ben- and I did a clean reinstall yesterday. There is no change in the condition with the reinstall. The recent documents that were open yesterday did not reappear after I quit and closed Word. It seems that the recents only
 stay as long as the document and WORD is still opened. But if I quit (close), the recents disappear.<br />
<br />
If I had &nbsp;the latest version installed yesterday, and it shows that there are no updates when I go to "help". But there is an updater available:&nbsp;Microsoft_Word_16.16.18120901_Updater - Is that an update? Am I supposed to install that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am cautiously optimistic that the directions (see below) worked! I have saved, quit Word, and reopened. The "recents" were there! I also did restart my computer 2x to see if the "recents" remained. So far so good! I hope I won't be writing again anytime

</p><p>I did:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) 1. Clear&nbsp;Word&nbsp;cache.</span></p>

<p>b. From Finder Go &gt; Go to Folder... (Shift+Cmd+G)</p>

<p>b. Search "Office" under Login &gt; All Items and delete everything</p>
<p>c. Search "ADAL" and delete everything</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Restart your&nbsp;Mac.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Try launching&nbsp;Word&nbsp;and signing in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was not able to fine "ADAL" so I didn't do that part. And I did have a clean reinstall done from Microsoft yesterday, and assume that was the latest version of Office, so I didn't do the "update" because it showed that I did have the latest version
 of Word. Also, I do have the latest version of Mac OS.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for &nbsp;your help- I really didn't even realize how much I relied on "recents" until I didn't have it anymore!</p>

<p>Hi GreenScribe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, you are using Word version 16.16.4. Let us know if there is any misunderstanding by clicking Word &gt;About Microsoft Word. I test the same version on Mac OS 10.14.2 (Apple icon &gt;About This Mac), but can not reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I'd like to suggest performing the below steps to check if there is any improvement:</p>
<p>1). Install the Microsoft_Word_16.16.18120901_Updater to update to the latest version 16.16.5.</p>
<p><span>2) 1. Clear&nbsp;Word&nbsp;cache.</span></p>
<p>a. First, make sure that&nbsp;Word&nbsp;is not running</p>
<p>b. From Finder Go &gt; Go to Folder... (Shift+Cmd+G)</p>
<p>c. Enter "~/Library/Containers" and press Go (Return key)</p>
<p>d. Find the "com.microsoft.Word" folder</p>
<p>e. Select and delete that folder using File/Move to Trash (Cmd+Delete)</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2. Delete these folders under&nbsp; ~/Library/Group Containers/</p>
<span>UBF8T346G9.ms</span><br />
<span>UBF8T346G9.Office</span><br />
<span>UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span><span>Warning</span></span></strong><span><strong>: Outlook data will be removed when you move the folder listed in this step to Trash. You should back up these folders before you delete the</strong><strong>m.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Clear Office related&nbsp;KeyChain&nbsp;Access:</p>
<p>a. Go to&nbsp;KeyChain&nbsp;Access, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.</p>
<p>b. Search "Office" under Login &gt; All Items and delete everything</p>
<p>c. Search "ADAL" and delete everything</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Restart your&nbsp;Mac.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Try launching&nbsp;Word&nbsp;and signing in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, to better assist you, could you please help confirm the below information?</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur in safe mode?&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac</a></p>
<p><span><em>Disclaimer: Microsoft provides no assurances and/or warranties, implied or otherwise,&nbsp;</em></span><em><span>and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third-party linked sites or any support related to technology.</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If you create a new document and save it, does it show in recent file list after you restart Mac?</p>
<p>3. Did you encounter the issue before? What did you do before the issue occurred? (Update Office or Mac or install any program on Mac?)</p>
<p>4. Where are your documents stored?</p>
<p>5. Your Mac OS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Tina</p>

<h3> luke57  say:</h3>
<h2>            6500 slide earphones</h2>
                    
<p>i have a 6500 slide which is great but i want to be able to use any earphones as the supplied ones are uncomfortable and just rubbish.</p>
<p>cant see any other earphones that the 6500 supports so i bought a 2.5mm adapter but the phone doesn't recognize any earphones and just plays music through the speaker.</p>
<p>however if i enable the tv out the sound does come through the earphones but is very loud and worse quality than when using the original headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have read on here that others have been able to use the adapters with no problem so this is frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the firmware version is v08.30 and the phone is locked to vodafone</p>
<p>the 2.5mm adapter is a quality sony one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone tried using another nokia headset through the 2.5mm adapter, such as the hs-45?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does anyone in this community use this Program along with another antivirus? Please do not say "You should not use more than one antivirus because they may conflict" That would mean that You know nothing about this subject. Of course one does not use "Norton

            <p>That was a bit strong don't you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using Malwarebytes Pro. since the year dot, I can assure the original poster that MP is more than an
<em>"anti-spyware program".&nbsp; </em>Melwarebytes Pro (premium), is a totally different animal to the free version. Which one do you use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also said:</p>
<p><em>"If we are talking about knowing something about</em><br />

<em>is *not an anti-virus".</em></p>
<p>

            <p>For those who are unaware, MBAM Pro was certified as an Anti-Virus Desktop by West Coast Labs since at least Sept. 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/productList/checkmarkTestResult/?productID=516&amp;techGroupID=27&amp;from=v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/productList/checkmarkTestResult/?productID=516&amp;techGroupID=27&amp;from=v</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the real concern isn't status as an AV, but rather the inclusion of real-time protection by both products, since at some point this is virtually guaranteed to create a conflict in operation, whether or not an issue is known to exist today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth, we've seen multiple complaints of conflict with MBAM Pro/Premium here in the past, though not consistently as it appears to work&nbsp;for some and not others.&nbsp; The MBAM forums also include threads where various recommendations exist to disable or exclude
 portions of one or the other of MSE and MBAM files from each other's monitoring, specifically to avoid some apparently known conflicts between the two products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for those arguing these points here, understand that&nbsp;for&nbsp;all security products which&nbsp;perform real-time monitoring and automatic detection and removal of malware, conflicts will always occur, since these products will all overlap to some extent.&nbsp; The only
 true question is to what extent these conflicts will affect the stable operation and effectiveness of either of the security products involved and thus the overall security of the operating system and protection they provide.</p>

            <p>Yes ...since virus protection is conflictive with some malware scanner tools and has different behaviors for protecting your system you can use one or the other at different times just not at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes has honestly one of the best malware scanners around and also "Microsoft Safety Scanner" is another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to try microsoft security scanner if malwarebytes is having a problem running on your pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx &nbsp;&lt;-----safety scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p>(<span>Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Also try "Malicious software removal tool"
</strong>it runs only once, removes anything it finds, then uninstalls itself.</span></p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here may be your issue (hopefully i understood your question correctly and have not mistaken you)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes is programmed to restart your PC due to the state of infection. After a full scan, if malwarebytes quarantines or removes any such PUP or PUM file extension, It must remove or modify your systems registry and to get your machine to adapt immediately
 to such change it will automatically restart your PC for you. Sometimes after the scan is complete it will use a small dialogue box and ask you if you will allow it....but not always...it depends on the level of registry modification is has to do.</p>
<p>No fear, It is a common feature. If your computer is taking too long to start up, you will want to check your start up registry and modify that as well. You can modify what starts up with your machine...if there are too many programs you have downloaded
 in the past...most of them have defaulted settings to start up with your machine which can cause a pc to take up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A few other things to try:</strong></p>
<p>Did you try uninstalling and reinstalling Malwarebytes? &nbsp;I run both Microsoft security essentials and malwarebytes. (at the same time...never conflicted, both programs still were competant)</p>
<p>Here is something peculiar I always found...in my earlier days, when I really thought you had to pay for AV protection, I would trace scan registries on "paid" software. The reason why i stopped and went to free was the free versions mainly found the same
 stuff.. paid versions may have a larger parameter to contend to when searching your machine...all in all I efficiently manage most areas of my pc rather than trust a program to do so. If you are good with registry (check MBAM root paths), start up , make sure
 windows is up to date.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You could try doing the below and see if it gives you a different outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try it in new user account</p>
<p>2. Boot to safe mode and try scanning again.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Westcoast labs have misnamed the product (there is no longer a Mbam Pro even though I still call it by that old name since 2008) and unlike Mbam themselves, they are calling it an AV (?)</p>

<em>Three proprietary technologies (signature, heuristics, and behavorial) automatically protect you and your online experience from malware that antivirus products don't detect.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Removes what antivirus can't</strong><br />
<em>Employs malware removal techniques so innovative that computer technicians often recommend Malwarebytes when an antivirus can't finish the job".</em><br />
<br />
Doesn't sound like a claim to be an AV to me (?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nowhere in the Mbam forum headings is there a section on "Melwarebytes AV" or anywhere in the Mbam forum do I see any claim it is an AV, but does advise to use Mbam in conjunction with an AV.<br />

            <p>In multiple places on the Malwarebytes web pages including the comparison of the current&nbsp;Free and Premium products is the following text next to the West Coast Labs Checkmark symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Malwarebytes is certified by Westcoast Labs for antivirus, anti-spyware, and anti-Trojan."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the antivirus desktop testing was done on the Pro platform, this has simply been renamed to Premium and isn't really a different product, as with any product this is&nbsp;just marketing terminology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither West Coast Labs nor myself indicated that Malwarebytes includes a full-featured AV, since MBAM&nbsp;don't themselves.&nbsp; This&nbsp;was nothing but an attempt to pass the very basic Wildlist av testing that they do to confirm that the most prevalent viruses found
 in the wild at that time could be detected (and possibly removed) by the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Undoubtedly the reason that Malwayrebytes chose to do this was for those who no longer feel that they wish to install an av product on their PC, since some people may&nbsp;never experience these any longer and instead tend to run into the other classes of malware
 more often.&nbsp; This is also why Malwarebytes chose to move more aggressively against PUPs, since these are now more commonly experienced by those who download lots of junk software and so end up with lots of other junk along with these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, again none of this really matters in the least and is all simply semantics.&nbsp; The only real issue is that any two security products which both contain automatic detection and removal features will conflict at some point if there is any overlap in
 their protection.&nbsp; The only question is to what extent this conflict will cause a disruption of the operating system and thus stability in the long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft specifically recommends against combining real-time security products on the same system for these reasons and does not support it.&nbsp; MBAM has claimed in the past that they do support this with various av products, but it is thus entirely their
 own responsibility to make any changes that may be required as these other products change their operation when a new&nbsp;version releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has just recently released a new 4.6.x subversion last week, so it may be necessary for Malwarebytes to make an adjustment as a result.&nbsp; However, since no one here recommends using anything other than the Malwarebytes Free version with MSE for
 this very reason, you are looking for help in the wrong place and should be asking about such potential new conflicts in the MBAM forums where others using it are more prone to be discussing such issues.</p>

 case of any future Mbam/AV conflict ; )</p>

            A blank Excel spreadsheet uses about 8 KB.&nbsp; Your file is about 86,000 KB roughly (about 10000 times as large as a blank Excel spreadsheet).&nbsp; I have found that the Windows Phones does great for most of the sample Excel files I tried to open, but they were
 all pretty small files.&nbsp; I think that wether it is Windows Phone, or on a PC, the ability to open the file in Excel is limited on the amount of memory available for Excel to use in the particular platform (be it Windows phone, or PC).&nbsp; You might try asking
 whoever made the Excel file of 86 MB, if they could somehow reduce the size of the file, and then you could try again to open it.

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016&#58; folder Delete button grayed out</h2>
                    I am running Outlook for Mac 2016 downloaded from Office 365. &nbsp;In the course of importing exchange emails into Outlook, Inbox subfolders were created. &nbsp;The emails were recovered from an email archiving system. &nbsp;The emails were moved to an existing Inbox
 subfolder leaving the imported Inbox empty. &nbsp;I then attempted to delete the empty subfolder only to find out that the delete function was grayed out for this and all other Inbox subfolders. &nbsp;I then checked all subfolders in the Sent box and found the same
 grayed out Delete function. &nbsp;I have searched extensively for a solution but with no luck. &nbsp;Suggestions?

</p><p>I'Ve seen planets move faster than it takes Cortana to adopt features available in English to other languages like Spanish-Spain.</p>
<p>The same applies to other languages such as Portuguese, French or Italian among many others.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For Skype to work, the version must be Android OS 4.0.3 or higher. You need to upgrade to a supported Operating System to be able to use Skype. We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes
 along the way. These decisions are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.</p>

<h2>            Using multiple books to create one master book</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I am trying to create a master database in Microsoft Excel 2007. with in the master database i need to create a formula that will take in formation from two different books and add them to the master book, as well as automatically combined the duplicate numbers
 in to one cell then adding the remaining necessary information from the other two books into the designated cells.
<br />
<br />
fort example i have two books that have the cell title Bar codes that need to be meshed together, then once those have been combined i need the retailers name that match the bar codes along with the address and city, province, postal code, date, and what retailer
 accepted these.<br />
<br />
is there some way to do this?<br />
<br />
any help , tips, will be greatly appreciated<br />

<br />
thank you so much for this. <br />
i am reading it in detail now and trying it out - however i keep getting a sour code error

i am not sure what i am doing wrong?<br />
<br />

<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply. <span><span>&nbsp;</span>I am going to need a little more information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When do you get the source code error?</p>
<p>Did you try using the Vlookup function in the Master sheet to consolidate the data from other Workbooks?</p>
<p>You may upload the sample master sheet and the other two sheets to SkyDrive, so that we can assist you better.</p>

<div>for review about every hour. If I press Send, nothing happens and I get the prompt again in an hour or so. If I press 'Don't Send' then the same thing happens. Is there something that I'm
 missing here? Should I just delete the file in question? This is getting to be a nuisance that I just want to stop.</div>

<p>I want to say the issue started sometime in August. I'm not positive, because it feels like it's been going on for ages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as recent changes to my computer, there hasn't been any. I use this computer for school, videos, games via steam, and that's about it. I haven't installed anything substantial lately, nor have I had to mess with the files of anything for any of the
 above mentioned tasks.</p>

<p>Hello Holly,</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried adding a different email account? If so, did you experience the same issue?</li><li>How are you adding your email account to Outlook? Is it via <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook app</a></strong> or via

<p>Hi <span>Nicopatricio,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>May I know whether you've added the sending server's IP to the allowed IPs under the connection filter? If not, please give it a try.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, please try removing proxy to disable mail filtering&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;(basicaly changed source ip) to see if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If all above with no avail, you may need to set up a connector via the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Exchange Admin -&gt; Mail Flow -&gt; Connectors</li><li>Create a new connector</li><li>From: "Your organization's email server", To: "Office 365"</li><li>Click Next</li><li>Give the connector a name (I used the DNS name of the server it's coming from)</li><li>Leave the 2 checkboxes checked</li><li>Click Next</li><li>Select "By verifying that the IP address of the sending server matches one of these IP addresses that belong to your organization"</li><li>Add the remote server's IP address</li><li>Click Next</li><li>Click Save</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I've sent you a private message to collect the entire bounce message(NDR) to analyze. You can click the link below to access the pm:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to hide an update and hence you are getting an update which you don’t want to install.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately in Windows 10 build 9926 and 10041, you cannot hide an update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However you may refer to the suggestions provided by

<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 Bluetooth music streaming patchy</h2>
                    <p>I have three Nokia Lumia phones 920, 925 and 620&nbsp;paired with a Sony audio receiver and when playing music via Bluetooth the songs frequently cut in and out. This happens to music that is stored locally on the phone so there should be no buffering or downloading
 of data from the internet involved. The cutouts last less than a second but occur at least once per song (often three or four times).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried switching off all other wireless signals. Set the phone's wifi off, turned off my home wifi network and even switched off other computers in the house but it is still happening no matter how close to the receiver the phone is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't test with a different phone OS as we only have windows phones in the house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue with music via Bluetooth for WP?</p>

            <p>Thanks Monica. The links you have sent through describe the process of pairing but I am not having any issues with that. The music does stream to the receiver. The problem is that it occasionally cuts out for a short time which makes listening to music in
 this way a very poor experience.</p>

<h2>            OneNote for iPad Frequently Randomly Crashes</h2>
                    I am using OneNote Version 15.20.1 on my iPad Air 2 OS 9.3. &nbsp;OneNote opens fine and I am able to take notes for about fifteen minutes, but then OneNote simply closes without any warning or notice. &nbsp;When I open the program again, I am able to resume taking
 notes, but it just crashes again ten minutes later. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to fix this would be amazing.

            What Internet browser is he using and does he have any addons which disable the use of java script?
<br />Because those elements you named use javascript events when clicked.
<br />
<br />First you should let him try it with another browser. If the same problem occurs we at least know it is independent from his browser settings :)

            The second one is the one without Add-Ons which we need to test if an addon is causing the problem.
<br />Here is a guide how to enable javascript for the internet explorer:

<br />But I would try a different browser first because it is the simplest method :)

            Of course you can. :) 
<br />Edge is just the newer version (and name) of the Internet Explorer.
<br />But I just tried to disable Javascript on IE myself and I can't even enter the site.
<br />because it says:
<br />
<br />Sway requires javascript
<br />
<br />This browser blocks or does not accept scripts.
<br />
<br />But here is stated how to enable scripts in all browsers:

<p>The person can log in to sway and even see presntetations if he clicks on the left side of the bottom. The problem is he can not see the icons “ viewed”, “edited”, “ analytics” and etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you still think that the root cause is that scripts are disabled? If yes, then how he can log in sway if you can not log in when scrpits are disabled?</p>
