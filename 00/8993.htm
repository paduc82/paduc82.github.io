    <title>I have Kapersky Total Security. Windows Defender is giving me - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I have Kapersky Total Security. Windows Defender is giving me contradictory notifications about firewall. UPDATE&#58; All&#39;s good.</h2>
                    <p>For about the last week,&nbsp; I get a notification from Windows Defender that I have no Firewall running. It gives me the option to either turn on&nbsp; Windows firewall or turn on Kasperky Total Security. When I check Kaspersky, it is on and running, as it is set
 to do on startup. I have been checking "turn on Kaspersky" anyway to try to get rid of the notification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Settings for Windows Defender then say that "These settings are being managed by Kaspersky Total Security." But it happens every time I turn on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked every setting to make sure I haven't missed anything. All looks as it should (except the Windows Defender setting on startup).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Is this a bug, and if so, is it being fixed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not a bug, what can I do to make it stop? </p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: as I noted in a reply below, this issue resolved without my having to do anything more. Thanks to folks who responded. It seems to have helped someone else, anyway.</p>

            Hetti, thank you for taking the time to respond. As I noted above, my issue somehow resolved without my having to take draconian measures.&nbsp; But your response apparently helped someone else, so that's good.

    <title>Powerpoint slide animations not editable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> intiha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint slide animations not editable </h2>
                    
<p>I have a powerpoint slide that I made in office 2007, and saved it as ppt (for backward compatibility. However, now after about 6months, having checked the presentation in SVN, I try to modify it and find that while I can copy paste slide and individual
 elements of the presentation, I cannot edit any part that is animated. And I mean literally doing anything with the animation (except, interestingly. for delaying the time that the animation occurs using the advanced time line). I can not delete (clicking
 remove gives me the ping-of-no-result) an animation, I cant change its order and I cant even change its color or type of animation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is frustating as I put in a lot of work for many of the animation and the only way it appears for me to tweak it a little bit would be to redo them all.. any reason why this is happening?</p>
<p>PS: These animation are NOT part of the master slide (I searched and found similar problems but with animation in the master)</p>

<p>Are you editing the ppt file with PowerPoint 2007?</p>
<p>If you still have the file as ppt and if you try to edit the file with PowerPoint 2007, some of the features may not work because it’s a 97-2003 file format. So try to back up the file and convert the file to pptx.</p>
<p>To convert the file go to office button and click on convert.</p>
<p>Then try to edit the pptx file and check.</p>

                    I purchased an individual copy of Office 2016 for windows 10 that contains Outlook 2016. In the calendar feature, I have only a choice of 9 colors, and you cannot add to or change these colors depending on different categories . Looking in the Help section
 did not help, because it pointed to non existent features in my Outlook. I need help now!

            AFAIK, Office 2004 has never been available as a public download from an authorized source.<br />

<p>Hi Reza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office is configured by default to block external content, such as images, linked media, hyperlinks, and data connection. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
We suggest that you change the Trust Center Settings to fix the error. To do this, select
<strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Trust Center</strong> &gt;
<strong>Trust Center Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Protected View</strong>, and then uncheck all options. You may also look into
<strong>External Content</strong> and <strong>Message Bar</strong> also located in the Trust Center Settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Trust Center Settings is not showing, it's possibly hidden. Click the <strong>
View </strong>tab and select <strong>Unhide </strong>to get the said settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we'll be glad to assist you further. </p>

<p>When I placed a "text box" where the information needs to be filled in, and then printed it, the print came out showing the certificate plus it was very small and not in line at all with the actual size.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't find a way to keep the name/date/etc.

    <title>Semi-Automatic Placement of Pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oscar ruitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Semi-Automatic Placement of Pictures</h2>
                    <div>I am evaluating Microsoft Word for technical writing and I can't figure out how to do the following related to placement of pictures.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pictures (graphs, diagrams, etc.) need to have some sort of semi-automatic placement. Consider the following. I _first_ reference a figure, say Figure 12, in some text. I also have some sort of graphic in the form of a shape which is the actual Figure
 12. I want the graphic to appear at the top of the same page as the reference unless doing so would push the reference off the page, in which case the graphic should appear at the top of the page following the reference.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That's the gist. However...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let's say there is a Figure 13, with its first reference and its own graphic. Normally, I want the same behavior as described above for Figure 12. However, Figure 13 graphic should always be placed after Figure 12 graphic, _AND_ if both Figure 12 graphic
 and Figure 13 graphic appear on the same page, Figure 13 graphic needs to be moved downward so that is is just below Figure 12 graphic.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Etc. If a page fills up with figure graphics, the process is continued on the next page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And this should be done without any gaping white space holes appearing at the bottom of pages (widow control of individual lines notwithstanding). Text from any lines and paragraphs following the references should flow in to fill any would-be white space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course there are other strategies for placing pictures, such as having it immediately follow the first reference (or paragraph containing the first reference) but pushing to the next page when necessary, and of course not leaving any gaps of white space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I do this in Microsoft Word?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FullWrite Professional could do all this easily in 1988. 8^)</div>

            Hi Jerry:
<div><br />
<div>A Couple of Secrets :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;You must disable "Widow/Orphan control" and enable "Keep lines together" if you want this to work. &nbsp;Allowing a paragraph to split across a page negates the ability of "Keep with next" to keep the caption with the picture.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) &nbsp;The picture must be inline with text, in a paragraph, preferably its own paragraph.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) &nbsp;Word is NOT any other program: drive Word like you drive FrameMaker and you won't go far wrong, but it's NOT FrameMaker, and when you hit the outer edges, you have to do it Word's way or it won't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) &nbsp;You are expecting Word to have "pages" in a file on which you can put things. &nbsp;It doesn't. &nbsp;The "page" is an unknown concept to Word: it does not exist in the Word document. &nbsp;Word makes up the pages on the way out: either to the screen or the printer.
 &nbsp;Since the pages don't exist, you can't anchor anything to them. &nbsp;The fundamental atom in a Word document is the "Paragraph". &nbsp;Everything is in, or anchored to, a paragraph, in Word. &nbsp;Think about this for a moment: knowing it will enable you to easily and
 dependably achieve what you want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5) &nbsp;You are expecting text to flow backwards to fill the gaps where pictures moved forwards. &nbsp;Word can't do that. &nbsp;No word-processor can. &nbsp;For that, you need a Page Layout program (a desktop publisher, if you will).</div>
<div><br />
<div>6) &nbsp;Most people these days would use InDesign rather than LaTeX for this kind of thing. &nbsp;If you ensure that the style names in InDesign match the stye names in Word, it will simply suck the text straight in, discard Word's formatting and apply the InDesign
 formatting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            Rebooting failure after downloading Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded Windows 10 but am now not able to restart my computer. &nbsp;The Windows 10 logo briefly appears and then says there is a problem. The following message is also displayed &nbsp;System_Thread_Exception_Not_Handled.</p>
<p>Windows 10 then says it will restat my computer automatically and solve the problem. &nbsp;I then arrive back at the same message. &nbsp;I am stuck in this loop. &nbsp;Does anyone know how I can solve it?</p>

            <p><span>Hi, Rory.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your response. I understand the issue that you are facing currently, and we in Community will try to resolve your issue the best way we can.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">System Thread Exception Not Handled error in mostly arises due to incompatible or old graphics card drivers. System Thread Exception Not Handled error is often displayed along with the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).<br />
<br />
After the Blue Screen of Death is displayed with System Thread Exception Not Handled error, even if the computer is powered off and then powered back on, it keeps getting restarted after every few seconds.<br />
<br />
In order to fix this issue, the computer must be restarted in safe mode, and the problematic graphics driver must be uninstalled. Once this is done, the latest driver of the installed graphics card must be downloaded from the manufacturer’s website, and must
 be installed in order to make the Windows system work.</span></p>

</p><p>Your instructions to solve it look structured and do-able. &nbsp;However, could you explain what you mean by the first one:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Restart Windows 10 computer and insert the bootable media into optical media drive (CD/DVD Drive) or USB;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What 'bootable media'? &nbsp;Would this be the up to date version of the graphics&nbsp;</span>card driver that you talk about??</p>

            What she means is an ISO of Win10 which in your posting you said you <em><strong>downloaded</strong></em> that media<strong>
</strong>is what she is talking about, I think what you did was an upgrade from the Win10 site, more info would help us as I posted earlier.

            <p>thanks Joe. &nbsp;You are right of course. What I did was upgrade from Windoe 7 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop ACER ASPIRE 5738PZG, which is about five years old. So Vanessa's assessment that the problem is with the system's out of date graphic card could weel be right.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your help. Btw - what's an ISO?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I need some details to assist you with the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>Is the issue only with Word or is it the same with other Office applications as well?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps below and check the result:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open Word program in safe mode, and then try to save the document to check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>To open Word in same mode try the steps below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold <b>Windows key</b> + <b>R</b>.</span></li><li><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <b>Open</b> box, and then press Enter:</span></li></ul>
<p><b><span>WinWord /safe</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>There is space between WinWord and /</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it you are able to save without getting the save as window in safe mode, then you may check if there is any add-in that is causing issue in Word:</span></p>
<p><span>· Click on File menu, Options and then Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>· Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</span></p>
<p><span>· Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above steps helps. If you need further assistance on this particular issue or any other Office related issues let us know and we will be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Defender keeps telling me every startup to enable its service</h2>
                    Well, after upgrading to the build 10041, Windows Defender&nbsp;pop-up appear at the lower right side&nbsp;asking me to enable its service though the OS know that I have another antivirus installed. There's an red "X" mark appearing on the taskbar then when I open
 it, it says that Windows Defender is disabled and I have another antivirus.<br />
<br />
I have an installed antivirus named 360 Total Security when I was in build 9946.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
Usually Windows defender gets disabled automatically when you enable other antivirus. If it is not disabled, then I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Open Defender and go to the Settings tab.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then in the administrator section, uncheck this box.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will stop the service and when you reboot it will no longer start itself anymore.<br />
<br />
You will be unprotected unless you install another app.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>Normally you don't need to do this:<span>&nbsp; </span>
if you install another app, Defender will disable itself automatically.<br />
<br />
Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span></span>

a. Press Windows key + R,<br />

<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, could you try the following steps and share the outcome?</span><span>1.Please confirm whether you have accessed your OneDrive for Business library once. If not, log into the portal and click OneDrive icon in the app launcher to provision
 it, and then add an attachment from your OneDrive for Business again. If so, go to your OneDrive for Business library in the browser, and check if you could upload or download a file properly.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Add an attachment from the local PC, and see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, for further investigation, could you provide your account information and OneDrive for Business URL via the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list"><span>Private Message</span></a>?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please share updates when you have time.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Dora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this using PowerShell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will first need to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Office 365 PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have successfully connected, type the following in PowerShell:</p>
<p><span>Get-MsolUser | </span><span>Export-Csv C:\AllUsers.csv</span></p>
<p>This will create a CSV file containing all users in your tenant that you are able to open in Excel and print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2777380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Getting all Licensed Office 365 users with PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The reference I provided is for getting all licensed Office 365 users, but the steps are similar, so you can use the images in the link as reference.</p>

            <p>Sheen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I cannot use the instructions above, it requires the IT department. I did mention it to them. I am confused because about 6 months ago I was able to export and print an excel document with all of the employee names and numbers. I do
 not know if something has changed. I see that all employees are listed in the directory, but we do not have them in a contact list. The contact list is available to export, but not the directory. Why so complicated to get a printed list of employees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How do I keep Save as PDF options&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep Save as PDF options&#63;</h2>
                    When I do File &gt; Save As then select Save as type PDF, Word retains that I've checked Open file after publishing and Optimize for Minimum size. But if I click on the Options button, I always have to re-check Include...Document structure tags for accessibility.<br />
<br />
As I always want document structure tags for accessibility, how do I get Word to retain the fact that I've checked it for subsequent saves?<br />

            Ah, I see what the issue is.<br />
<br />
If I choose Standard, it defaults to checking tagging.<br />
<br />
If I choose Minimum, it defaults to unchecking tagging.<br />
<br />
What I am looking for is minimum size for things like images, but always keeping accessibility tagging (and making headings bookmarks).
<br />
<br />
I'd like to see an overarching Word preference for "Maintain accessibility for saved documents" that would, among other things, always check "Document structure tags for accessibility" unless I intentionally uncheck it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I would want three options:<br />
<br />
Standard<br />
Minimize images<br />
Minimum<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I need to somehow email a report that has been designed in Access 2007. This report contains 3 pictures and need to be in the body of the email.</p>
<p>I don't really care which method is used... I just need to know which method would work the best, and if VBA is needed I need some help in that too, please.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            This is really a separate question, but the answer is you should not be storing the e-mail address in a hyperlink datatype. Use a text datatype and just assign the value to the To property.

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.

<p><span>What type of account you have configured in Outlook.&nbsp; (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account).</span></p>
<p><span>Was there any updates installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Was it working previously?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>let us try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Let us press Windows+r on the keyboard (simultaneously) the Run appears.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type outlook.exe /cleanviews (Leave a space after Outlook.exe)-&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’. The above mentioned command restores Outlook to default view settings and all the custom views that you created will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane (Leave a space after Outlook.exe) -&gt; Click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, let us create a new profile and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Recent update craters email alerts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tshinder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent update craters email alerts</h2>
                    <p>After the recent update to the Band 2, the email alerts no longer show email messages. I just get inaccurate messages about "received 12 emails" or "received 134 messages" and other random numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails on the Band was one of the best features. What was the reasoning for breaking it and providing zero-value messages regarding how many emails you allegedly got (although the numbers are spurious).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this or roll back the recent update?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

If you formatted you Hard Drive, you can reinstall Win10 by using the Windows 10 media tool, it will work as long as your old install was Windows10 with Digital Entitlement and you haven't changed the Motherboard after you install Win10 it will go on line and
 check with the activation servers and match your account with the system serial number and auto activate. as of build 10525 Keys were no longer needed except when you buy a retail version.

<p>Might notice you can use a new&nbsp;win7/8 key or the machines original win7/8 key&nbsp;in most instances now if you would need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably will have a link to skip entering the key when you fresh install, provided win10 was on same computer and&nbsp;had been&nbsp;previously activated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you can use a temp install key I think ... pro is VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really insist on having your very own win10 key, you certainly can visit the windows store and buy one.</p>
