<h2>            Dell 780 issue - No audio driver for Win 10, Dell will not update drivers</h2>
                    Hello.. I have a Dell 780 PC and I upgraded to Win 10 and could not get the on board sound to work, and then found on Dell's website, that it will not be updating specific drivers for the Dell 780 system. So.... if there are no drivers, thus no sound,
 in upgrading to Win 10, why would one upgrade? &nbsp;Or better still, how to resolve? &nbsp;I don't have an answer for either, anyone with a valid fix? &nbsp;I've since rolled back to Win 7, because it works!

            <p>Indeed. Why would one upgrade their operating system without first checking if their hardware is supported?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Determine who makes the onboard sound chip, go to their website, see if there's a Windows 10 driver. If not, a Windows 7 or 8 driver will many times work. If not, you are SOL. Unsupported hardware and/or software is a very good reason not to upgrade an operating
 system.</p>

            Hi..&nbsp; Oh, I did check but had read reviews some people had no issues, and also had a few solutions offered to me, as you have... so upgraded, and found out myself the solutions offered were useless, thus the issue.&nbsp; So yep, sticking with Win 7.. and I
 got 3 Dell 780 systems in my network. Win 7 will be around a few more years, that's good enough for me.&nbsp;The issue now is.. that 'upgrade to Win 10' notification keeps popping up, hehe.. must fix that. :-D Cheers for the reply.

</p><p>So I bought this Surface Pro 2 a month back and now I am a bit disappointed. I have an external monitor
<strong>Dell 2208 WFP.</strong> I am using a VGA connector to connect with the external monitor, which was working fine till a week back when suddenly the video disappeared. I can still get audio through the attached speaker of the external monitor but no video
 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of Range Signal</p>
<p>Cannot Display this video mode, change</p>
<p>Computer display input to</p>
<p>1680*1050 @60 HZ</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following things:</p>
<p>1. Reinstall driver.</p>
<p>2. Put every possible resolution in Monitor 2 though the Surface Pro</p>
<p>3. Tried both 60hz and 59 hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No avail. I can get no video. Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The monitor works fine and I checked with another laptop.</p>

<h3> chrishibbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Update on Tablet out of space &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Running out of space on updating, I have got to the point of selecting another drive, and have selected the SD card which is D: Drive. &nbsp;It has 25Gig spare space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no way to tell the update process to "go ahead and use that". Clicking refresh does nothing other than refresh the dialogue, still showing that drive as selected. Just doing nothing does not do anything either. It just keeps complaining
 that C:Drive needs another 5Gig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be a button, probably "Continue", missing, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how does one persuade it to get on with it, using the selected drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done everything advised to free space on C:, including checking redundant system files. I have seen reference to what seems to be a fix for this problem, but you only get it by performing the update, which runs out of space.....</p>

            Hello Chris,<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, what is the make and model of your tablet? Normally, system updates require to be saved on the Internal storage and it may cause a problem if it was saved to the SD card. We could recommend that you move first some apps and files to
 the SD card to free up some space on your Internal storage before updating your tablet again.<br />
<br />
Let us know if the suggested action works.

            <p>Here are some more details.</p>
<p>The update is in fact an upDATE followed by an upGRADE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update</p>
<p>Starts, then needs more space on C: - 14Gb needed</p>
<p>Select D: with 28.9GB free. Click Refresh. UpDATE proceeds - downloads, installs, no re-boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>upGRADE then starts, and needs more space - 2.5Gb needed on C:&nbsp;</p>
<p>C: is in fact 11.9Gb used out of 14.4Gb, which I calculate as 2.5Gb free</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select D: again. Click Refresh. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 2 Questions</p>
<p>Why, if 2.5Gb free is needed on C: , and 2.5Gb is shown as free on C: , does is still say its needs 2.5Gb free?</p>
<p>Why, in the case of the upGRADE, will it not accept D: with the free space needed ?</p>

            Thank you for your update, Chris. Updates are optional if you want to save it to your C: drive since you can now also save it to D: drive.
<br />
<br />
When upgrading your device, you need to make sure that there's enough space on your C: drive. In your case, the upgrade didn't proceed because you only have the exact storage needed in your C: drive. It is recommended that you should have more storage space
 than the size of the upgrade it requires to avoid hang or freezing issues with your device. It is required to save upgrades to the C: drive since that's where your Windows 10 OS is saved. Your C: drive is the first system storage being detected in your device
 that's why any system-related files and items should stored and saved on it. <br />
<br />
If you have more concerns, feel free to let us know.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I cleared out another 0.5Gb, making 3.05Gb free, and still could not complete the update. It appears that C: even then still needs
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">another</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> 2.5Gb &nbsp;(so 5.55Gb free in total) to complete, which as I have said, seems impossible to achieve.</span></p>
<p>I conclude that Win 10 is not sustainable on a device with "only" a nominal 16Gb RAM. The minimum looks to me to be about 19Gb, so realistically, the next step up, 32Gb.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If I am correct, then standard advice should be along those lines, rather than have everyone flail around trying to achieve the impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to run Win10, DO NOT buy a bottom end Tablet with only 16Gb RAM !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not going to mark this as problem as solved, as it would appear to be insoluble.</p>

<h2>            UAC prompt window disappears after a split second</h2>
                    <p>Having an issue when I tried to update my graphics card's drivers in Win 10 where the UAC prompt to let me do it comes up but disappears immediately. There's no way I can click on "Yes" before it's gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to change the UAC level but same issue, I can't possibly click "Yes" before it disappears to allow me to change UAC either.</p>

<h2>            Need clarification on hard disk space distribution...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Vista Home Premium which i got when i bought my PC. My C drive is of 100 GB.<br />
When i check the size of all contents in the drive, it will constitute to 15 GB.<br />
But the system shows only 69GB as free space. I'm wondered where the other 15 GB has gone.<br />
My C drive uses 3GB of pagefile....hw ever i'm not sure whether it gets added to "used 15 GB" or the "missing 15GB".<br />
Someone pls help me to find where this missing 15GB has gone...hw its allocated...hw to check it...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,,,,,</p>

            Hello rr1786,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Determining drive capacity can be confusing at times because of the different measurement standards that are often used. When dealing with
<strong>Windows</strong> based systems, you will commonly see both decimal measurements and binary measurements of a drive's capacity. In either case, a drive's capacity is measured by using the total number of bytes available on the drive. As long as the drive
 displays the correct number of bytes (approximate), you are getting the drive's full capacity.
<p><strong>Decimal vs. Binary:</strong><br />
For simplicity and consistency, hard drive manufacturers define a megabyte as 1,000,000 bytes and a gigabyte as 1,000,000,000 bytes. This is a decimal (base 10) measurement and is the industry standard. However, certain system BIOSs, FDISK and Windows define
 a megabyte as 1,048,576 bytes and a gigabyte as 1,073,741,824 bytes. Mac systems also use these values. These are binary (base 2) measurements.</p>
<blockquote><strong>To Determine Decimal Capacity:</strong><br />
A decimal capacity is determined by dividing the total number of bytes, by the number of bytes per gigabyte (1,000,000,000 using base 10).
<br />
<br />
<strong>To Determine Binary Capacity:</strong><br />
A binary capacity is determined by dividing the total number of bytes, by the number of bytes per gigabyte (1,073,741,824 using base 2).</blockquote>
This is why different utilities will report different capacities for the same drive. The number of bytes is the same, but a different number of bytes is used to make a megabyte and a gigabyte. This is similar to the difference between 0 degrees Celsius and
 32 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the same temperature, but will be reported differently depending on the scale you are using.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong></span> If you are dealing with drive sizes smaller than the
<strong>Approximate Binary Capacity</strong> of your <strong>Drive Size</strong>, then you may be dealing with either a BIOS limitation, or a Windows drive size limitation. For more information, please see links below.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boone as companion</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I was doing the mission where you have to inquire and see who killed his wife and kidnapped her. Boone is a night time lookout sniper for Novac. I was looking on youtube and stuff and found that Jeanie May Crawford was the woman who kidnapped Boone's
 wife and sold her as a slave. What I was supposed to do is send jeanie may front of the dinosaur and then you gotta show boone the proof that it was jeanie may that was the one that killed boone's wife. I had no proof back and I couldnt do the science 55 because
 I wasnt 55 back then. I told Boone it was jeanie may but I had no proof. He then told me to never talk to him again and told me to get lost because I had no proof. I was exploring Novac now and I find a safe with the proof. I cant talk to Boone and give him
 the proof, he just tells me to get lost. Also I really want him as my companion, he seems to be the best companion in the whole game.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screwed up by itself cause of Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    I got up this morning and went to turn on my Surface and it wouldn't even boot properly and just went to the UEFI BIOS Screen. How's it even possible for something to screw up that badly by itself because of a damn operating system aka windows 10 pro this
 doesn't seem right? Any suggestions as to why this would've happened?

            Yes the hard disk icon is there but with a cross in the middle of it. This has happened to me before only a couple of weeks back. But this is the fist time windows 10 pro has screwed the surface up by itself without any input.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query at Microsoft Forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the description provided I understand that you are facing issue with the icon to Solitaire game on your windows 8 computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is possible you the game itself has been uninstalled on the computer or just the icon has been removed. So you make have to check few things in order to make sure that the game is installed. You may have to look in the Microsoft store in applications
 installed (<em>as shown in fig 1</em>) or in windows start menu in apps section <em>
(as shown in fig 2</em>). </span></span></p>

<h2>            Family Safety Curfew not working - also tons of Event ID 4625</h2>
                    <p>I'm having the exact same issues as these:<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not sure if the event log errors are related to the curfew log-out problem or not, but I have followed all the suggested steps, including:</p>
<p>- Removed Windows Essentials, both via Add/Remove programs and via CMD line, reinstalled latest (several times now)</p>
<p>- Removed children from account on fss.live.com, removed Windows Essentials, re-installed Windows Essentials, re-added children to account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing seems to help.&nbsp; I can see that my son's log-in time can be controlled properly via the Curfew, but it never logs him off.&nbsp; I see in the tray that his account is being properly monitored.&nbsp; I also use the 1 hour blocks since this is Windows 7 (Home
 Premium).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another Windows 7 computer on the same Home Group that is also monitored.&nbsp; My other son predominantly uses that computer and the curfew log-out works properly for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do next?&nbsp; I just want the curfew log-out feature to work properly.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues with curfew log-out feature. Really appreciate your efforts to troubleshoot on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which anti-virus software is installed on the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it can be an issue with the user account itself. </p>
<p><br />
Follow these methods and check if it helps:<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>First, let us check if the anti-virus software is the cause. </p>
<p>Temporarily disable anti-virus software and check if that helps.</p>
<strong>Disable Anti-virus software</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong>I would also suggest you to create a new standard account and then turn on Parental controls on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create a user account </strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a><strong>Set up Family Safety </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-up-family-safety#set-up-family-safety=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-up-family-safety#set-up-family-safety=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; We're using Microsoft Security Essentials:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antimalware Client Version: 4.6.305.0<br />

</p><p>Also, for what it's worth, the Family Safety version is:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that our other computer on the same HomeGroup has the same event log errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled the MSE antivirus and will see if anything changes.&nbsp; I will update this thread tomorrow.</p>

            <p>OK, disabling anti-virus did not change anything.&nbsp; The 4625 event log errors continue to occur and the Curfew setting did not force my son to log off (again, using 1 hour blocks).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created a new user account and immediately the 4625 errors began to show up in the event log for that new user account.&nbsp; I am testing now to see if Curfew causes a log-off for the new user and will update accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info in case it helps:</p>
<p>- I have 2 Windows 7 machines on a HomeGroup.&nbsp; One is Home Premium and the other is Ultimate.</p>
<p>- I have 3 standard accounts for each of my 3 kids.&nbsp; My oldest predominantly uses the Ultimate machine and has no issues with Curfew - it logs in and logs out properly with the Curfew settings.&nbsp; My middle kid doesn't use these 2 machines.&nbsp; The youngest predominantly
 uses the Home Premium machine and has the Curfew problem.&nbsp; Curfew prevents log ins until the proper time, but never forces a log out.&nbsp; This function used to work fine until about 2 years ago.</p>
<p>- Both machines show the 4625 errors for each account, including the Admin account that I use, in the event logs.</p>
<p>- Both machines are running the same Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus and Family Safety versions.</p>
<p>- Both machines are the exact same hardware and firmware.</p>

            <p>So I set up the newly created user account to log off after 1 hour and it worked properly.&nbsp; So it appears there is something wrong with my youngest son's user account on this machine.&nbsp; I will try later today to have him sign in on the Ultimate machine to
 see if the Curfew logs him out just as a data point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, assuming it is a corrupted account on this machine, is there any utility available to copy his settings to a new account?&nbsp; I'd like to try that first to see if he can preserve his settings before removing his account and starting from scratch.</p>

            <p>OK, as a test, I had each son log in with their own accounts on the opposite computers while the family safety curfew was set for 1 hour each.&nbsp; Sure enough, each kid was logged off successfully by the Curfew settings.&nbsp; So this means the problem is isolated
 to my younger son's account on the Home Premium computer.&nbsp; This means there are probably 2 options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Figure out what is corrupted about his account and fix it, or</p>
<p>2) Wipe out his account and create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd prefer to pursue #1 if you at Microsoft would help me and if this is possible.&nbsp; If not, I will, as a last resort, pursue option #2.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to create a new standard account and then turn on Parental controls on it.&nbsp; Please check if you are able to monitor the new user account. This is to test if it is an issue with the user account itself.</p>
<p><strong>Create a user account </strong><br />

<p>That's a great trailer, they really should have made this a serious game though. So far all trailers have had a serious theme, it's going to seem odd finally playing the game and it’s like Dead Rising.</p>

<h2>            seeing chkdsk results </h2>
                    When&nbsp;scheduling chkdsk to run on startup (chkdsk C: /F/R/X/B) it runs like it should (I think) but I am unable to see the last result&nbsp;of the final statistics screen before it is erased as vista quickly boots up. I can't find a log file. Is there a log
 or journal written to disk that I can access once Vista boots to see the results of the last chkdsk run. If not can I write a batch file to "pipe" output from chkdsk to a text file?

<p><span><span><span>Hello Illegal in all fifty states,<br />
<br />
To see the <strong>Chkdsk log</strong> follow these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open The Event Log...<br />
<strong>Control Panel (Classic View) -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer (3rd choice)</strong><br />
<br />
The ChkDsk Log is found in....<br />
<strong>Windows Logs (2nd choice on left) -&gt; Application (1st sub-choice)</strong><br />
<br />
&lt; NOTE &gt;<br />
This will display a number of information logs in the center pane, many of them from the most recent Windows startup. You will notice the 1-2 hour time difference in events if you rebooted to scan (time spend runnign chkdsk). This should help you identify the
 startup events after the scan...<br />
<br />
About half way down the list of logs, look for the item <strong>Wininit</strong> in the source column. This will contain the log data for the ChkDsk scan prior to the boot.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful</span></span></p>

<p>Hello everyone: Here is the issue I am having. Yesterday, an update came in 07/20/2017&nbsp;</p>
<p>and ran with no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I placed a DVD in my player, and it started to play. When I Paused it in a middle of watching it,</p>
<p>it did pause. But, when I hit pause again to play again, the above error came up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several times to shutdown and restart to fix this issue, but it still would show</p>
<p>this error when and I paused the movie, then hit pause again, to play.</p>
<p>The dvd player was operating with no problems prior to the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I am using the windows dvd player.</p>
<p>I have a backup of my system on a external hard drive prior to the update that ran.</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this issue. Never had a problem before.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you may already know, you can save a file to a folder on your hard disk drive, a network location, the cloud, DVD, the desktop, flash drive, or save as another file format such as RTF, CSV or PDF. While you must identify the target location,
 if it is different than the default folder, the saving process is the same regardless of what location you choose. Answering the following questions may help us in identifying the cause of the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Which file format are you trying to save?</span></li><li><span>are you getting an error message or code?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you already performed?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<p>Might you have possibly enabled the additional folder protection in Defenders 'virus &amp; protection settings' ?</p>
<p>You need to make program.exe exceptions for other than default windows programs to save files to normal places.</p>

            This is interesting.&nbsp; This is possible as we just upgraded our Bitdefender with a BOX and new software.&nbsp; I'll check this.&nbsp; I have also gone to my C: drive and updated the permissions so all are administratively capable.&nbsp; I don't know if this has worked
 yet as I just restarted my computer.

            Actually, I realized later that Mike P. meant Windows Defender and Bitdefender does not have the additional folder protection as such.&nbsp; I also don't have anything like this checked in Bitdefender so I do not believe this to be the problem.

            <p>It appears that instead of updating the driver you went back to an older driver!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Update the ATHEROS L1E Driver to version 1.0.0.45:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/lan/AR81FamilyWinSetup_V10045_WHQL.zip?_ga=1.173496419.1338398815.1461086594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/lan/AR81FamilyWinSetup_V10045_WHQL.zip?_ga=1.173496419.1338398815.1461086594</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download the driver and copy it to a folder on your desktop. Write down the path to the folder. If the driver has been zipped you will need to right click on the file and extract to your folder.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Next type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press ENTER. Locate and right click on the device and select Properties. Click on the Driver tab and the Update Driver button. Click on “<strong>Browse my computer for driver</strong>”
 (<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">do not select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver</strong></span>) and click the Browse button. Type in the Search box the file path to your folder and click on Next. The system should find the driver in your folder and

            <p>In fact the 1.0.0.45 is misnamed, it is 1.0.0.18 as suggested by its netL1e64.txt system information file included in the zip file...</p>

            <p>Usually that is a function of your email provider and is not native in Windows Live Mail 2011. Check with your email provider. As an
<em><u>example</u></em> I use Cox HSI for my personal email and if I go into the web based email I can configure it to send a vacation message.</p>

<p>This allows you to send a vacation message without needing to have your PC/laptop always on and checking email...</p>
<p>In a corporate environment check with your network admins...</p>

            <div>If you do this, you will have to leave your computer on 24/7, be connected to the Internet, and have your e-mail program open. If you want do this anyway, the link below will explain how to do it. One thing I would suggest is that where it says to create
 a rule and check For All Messages, you change it and make the rule for people in your address book only. Otherwise you will be replying to Spam as well and could end up in an endless loop of bounces.</div>

<div>Most ISPs/Mail Servers offer this service which would be a better choice.</div>
