<h2>            I WARNED YOU ABOUT EDITING THE START MENU, MICROSOFT</h2>
                    <p>On day 1 - LITERALLY ON DAY ONE - I tweeted the product manager AND posted in this forum.&nbsp; Microsoft, you have done NOTHING - WHY???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the crux of the issue:<br />
<br />
<strong>One cannot edit the start menu from within the start menu.&nbsp; This functionality existed all the way back to Windows NT, and now you yank it?&nbsp; Oh, wait, no, you didn't YANK it - you've chosen to dump the code for it and not merge it into the dual start
 menu **** you call a start menu in Windows 10.</strong><br />
<br />
MICROSOFT, I TRIED TO PROTECT YOU.&nbsp; I TRIED TO KEEP THIS FROM BEING A PROBLEM BUT YOU DID NOT LISTEN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MANAGERS - NOTE THE ABSENCE OF ACTION ON THE PART OF YOUR EMPLOYEES WHEN THIS **** HITS THE FAN AND YOU FINALLY FEEL THE PRESSURE TO FIX THE DAMN THING.<br />
<br />
I did my best.&nbsp; You just won't listen.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: try searching Windows 10 Insider forums and questions for "start menu."&nbsp; I was the first - and am probably about the 1000th - person to complain bitterly about this.&nbsp; FIX THE ISSUE!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Proplus - OneDrive, Sharepoint &#38; Azure AD</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office365 Proplus subscription which I renewed for the 2nd year in November. I have the following queries regarding my account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I await my 1 TB OneDrive for Business activation which has not yet happened. A few days ago a greyed out OneDrive link had appeared on the top in my admin centre but has disappeared now. Any idea what's up here?</p>
<p>2)When I click on the Admin link, the dropdown which used to contain only one link "Office 365", now has 2 additional links - "SharePoint" &amp; Azure AD". Any guidance about what these are for &amp; what I need to do would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As should be obvious by now, I am just a plain old office user &amp; am figuring out this whole admin thing. Look forward to clarity from the good &amp; knowledgeable folk on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            &#91;How&#93; do table styles work&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I'm trying to define and use table styles in Word 2010, and I'm puzzled about how table styles handle fonts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I was going to learn how table fonts work by studying the behavior of various styles. I was wrong.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I started with a document in which all paragraphs were styled Normal, defined as: 11 point Arial font, left aligned, 9 points space before paragraphs, 0 points space after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I defined a table style named EXAMPLE. I set its "Whole table" format to Times New Roman 10 point regular, center alignment, 4 points space before, 3 points space after. Border was a solid black 1-point rule for all borders. Shading is "None."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set the "First column" format to Courier New 14 point regular, center alignment, 12 points space before, 18 points space after. Border was a dashed red 3-point rule for all borders. Shading was light green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I set the "Header row" format to 11 point Arial, center alignment 4 points space before, 3 points space after, with 1-point solid rules and light grey background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I composed a table with this style.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In columns after the first, the text was 10 point Arial. Paragraphs were centered with 9 points space before and zero after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first column, text was in 14 point Arial, right aligned, with 9 points before and zero after. The background was light green. The heavy red dashed rule was applied to the left and bottom borders, but not to the top or right border (where there were
 adjacent cells with different border formatting) or the interior borders (where there weren't).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The header row was 14 point Arial in the first column and 10 point Arial in the rest, centered, with 9 points space before, zero after. The background was light grey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But wait... I never defined a header row! The first row was a data row. The Table Tools / Layout ribbon confirmed that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried defining the first TWO table rows as header rows. Both rows then had a light grey background. I deleted both of the rows. The old third row, now the first, acquired the grey background. Table Tools again confirmed that it was not, repeat not, a header
 row. Apparently Word not only applies Header row" properties to header rows -- it also applies them to the first row of a table whether it's a header row or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "rules," so far as I've investigated them, seem to be: A table style's font size property is applied, but its font property is ignored, so each table cell's font defaults to the default paragraph font. The style's paragraph alignment is applied, but
 its space before and after paragraphs are ignored. Its background color is applied; its border properties are applied to some borders but not others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this seems completely random. I'd assume it's just a buggy feature, but I know that table styles\ have been in Word since at least Office 2007, and it's hard to believe Microsoft would leave bugs like these in place from one release to the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone explain what Word is doing?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            First , please do this.&nbsp; In your test document, go to&nbsp; Styles pane &gt; Manage Styles button &gt; Set Defaults tab.&nbsp; There make these settings: 11 point Arial font, left aligned, 9 points space before paragraphs, 0 points space after.&nbsp; When you OK out of the
 dialog, you should see the fonts you set in the table style.<br />
<br />
Just a little background (revised a little from a previous post).&nbsp; By design and initially, the
<i>defaults</i>, the <i>table normal</i> (and <i>table grid</i>, which is based on it) table style, and the normal paragraph style have the same font settings.&nbsp; So if the font size is 12 points in the defaults, it will be 12 points in table normal and in the
 normal paragraph style.&nbsp; In other words, every table you create will be in 12-point type.
<br />
<br />
If&nbsp; tables must appear in a different font size (or font, etc.),&nbsp; you can do that by 1) applying a paragraph style to the table text and not change the font settings in the table style (this is what I still do because many of the business documents I prepare
 must be in W2003 format and it's the only way&nbsp; to make table styles work in W2003) or 2) modifying&nbsp; table grid or creating a custom style that specifies the font size needed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
**Everything works the way I described if we change the document's regular text fonts, style sets, line spacing and such either from the change Styles icon on ribbon--as MS intends us to do for W2007-13-- or by changing the defaults manually.
<br />
<br />
But many of us learned Word when the typical/recommended way to change formatting was to&nbsp; modify normal. Big problems in W2007-13...because changing normal does not also change the defaults (probably for good reason) and when normal is different from the defaults,
 its paragraph settings override the font settings in the table styles.&nbsp; Even changing the font with direct formatting can fail.&nbsp; Read more about styles hierarchy

here</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So the most important thing to know about tables is that the styles in the document must be set up for W2007-13.&nbsp; From there, learning table styles by doing is pretty&nbsp; straightforward.&nbsp; Another Word blog explains about&nbsp; table styles and

<h2>            Unable to change picture in a Microsoft Word brochure template</h2>
                    I've been trying to make a brochure for an organization and am unable to change the stock pictures because they are grayed out. I've gone to View and Print Layout and double clicked on the grayed out stock picture (as recommended) but it remains gray.
 At one point I did manage to get it highlighted (not sure how) and got one of the pictures changed, but haven't been able to do it again. Frustrating!

<p>After changing the placeholder text as Suzanne described, turn off the Design Mode button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the appearance of the user's response, click in the field (in Microsoft-speak, it's a content control rather than a field) and click the Properties button on the Developer tab. In the Properties dialog, check the box for "Use a style ..." and then
 click the New Style button.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the Create New Style dialog, enter a name for the new style (here I've typed "Response") and select the Italic and the desired font color. Click the "New documents based on this template" button and click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/548b6054-a716-4c8b-b00c-dd569c897171?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/548b6054-a716-4c8b-b00c-dd569c897171?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK in the content control's Properties dialog and save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to go to the Properties dialog of each content control, open the dropdown, and select the style you created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's one thing you need to be aware of: If you're creating the form in a template (*.dotx or *.dotm), the "based on this template" option causes the new style to be saved in that template. If you're working in a regular document based on the Normal.dotm
 template, though, the style will be saved in your Normal.dotm template -- which means that it won't be available to users on other computers (or even in other profiles on the same computer). And if you choose the "Only in this document" option, the style will
 be saved only in that document's file. In general, anything you expect to send to other computers should be based on a specific template from which new documents are created and then sent out.</p>

<h3> lla3574  say:</h3>
<h2>            XPS file with comments and ink markup</h2>
                    In PowerPoint 2013 - when saving as an .xps file, handouts, 6 slides per page and choosing Options for including comments and ink markup, the comments should show on a separate page. The slides do show on one page however, the comment number only appears
 on the slide, where inserted, but not the actual comment. Has this changed in 2013? If not, what am I doing wrong. I am completing this process as I have done in the past? If so what would be the point of including comments if they cannot be viewed? I tried
 on both a W7 and W8 environment for Office 2013. Thanks for your help. LLA<br />

<h2>            Page numbering stops after 1 when I apply page numbers to section 2 of a Word document</h2>
                    I have a Word doc with two sections. It's a report so I want to start numbering from the introduction, which should be page 1. I've created a new section by going to the preceding page and choosing Insert -&gt; Section break (next page). Then I go to the
 footer of the introduction and choose Insert -&gt; Page numbers. It inserts a 1 neatly at the bottom of the introduction but none of the successive pages are numbered. Any help on how to get Word to number all pages starting at the introduction page would be
 most welcome!

</p><p>I upgraded to 14366, and now she's even more unstable. She used to be able to play single tracks, but now she refuses, and is also crashing on basic tasks that used to work before.

</p><p>I've upgraded to the recently released 14367 build, and while the overall instability is fixed, she still cannot set timers. Now, she brings up the menu to set the timer for a duration of time, but if I say "10 minutes," she freezes and says "I'm sorry,
 something went wrong. Try again later"</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've also tried performing all troubleshooting steps. I even completely reinstalled Windows 10, not reset, but reinstall. She still refuses to work.

            Done that. No change. Done a complete format and reinstall.. No change. Upgraded to 14367 no change. Look in feedback I haven't seen anyone manage this yet. Are you actually confirming from the insider Dev team this function is actually working?

<p>WOW! thank you, I could not have possible known to do that without your 'expert' help!&nbsp; It's like I have repeatedly told Donna/Insider tweeters,&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be really nice to have some support in the Insider Forums from people who actually help. Instead of
 posting useless, pointless information easily found in 2minutes by our selves!!!</p>

<h2>            Deleting a Skype Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have two skype accounts under the same email address as I believe the second one was made by mistake when I couldn't remember the password for my first account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now able to access both accounts and so I would like the second account to be deleted if possible while retaining the first account. Is that possible and if so how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

</p><p>#1 - "Start not responding" means what exactly in terms of message(s) that appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Which instructions did you follow exactly? (that post&nbsp;consolidates the&nbsp;most common issues being reported resulting from the WIndows 10 update and was updated yesterday with actions to take if the solutions don't resolve the problem). However, it is
 certainly your prerogative to read the myriad of other threads with the same info.</p>

<p>windows scan complete: windows resource protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them, details found in a cbs log</p>
<p>second, I downloaded offcat and ran that which offered updates for outlook 2007 and I did the updates then did a computer restart, every time I tried to open outlook it went in to outlook not responding so I had to close it each time</p>

</p><p>This is in response to the numerous posts regarding Outlook &lt;send&gt; &amp; &lt;folder&nbsp;permission&gt; &nbsp;errors after updating to Windows 10. The issue is being investigated.
<br />
<br />
The work-around.............<br />
<br />
Run the &lt;Command Prompt&gt; with elevated privileges (explicitly select "Run as Adminsitrator" whether you are the admin on your machine or not)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Have all apps closed (<strong>especially Outlook</strong>)<br />
- Search for &lt;cmd&gt; (without the left/right brackets) - or see article below&nbsp;<br />
- Right click and select "<strong>Run as Administrator"</strong><br />
- In the command prompt window type in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sfc /scannow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (be sure to leave a space between "c and /"<br />
- let it run to completion</p>

            <p>Hi again, after your response I carried out all the scans ect on both this computer and my laptop that had the same problem, the laptop seams to be able to send emails now, so the difference between them: laptop had windows 8.1 and was updated to windows
 10 but once I did the sfc /scannow it corrected the sending of emails in outlook207.</p>
<p>My main desktop computer had windows 7 until windows 10 was put on and the problem has not been rectified.</p>

<h2>            Drop Down, Autofill cells and Data Lists</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I am adapting Excels "Martketing Plan" template and would like to add an additional auto-fill, drop down list (the same as the "assigned to column" with different values. I want to add a priority column that "high, medium, and low" values. How do I go about
 doing this?&nbsp;I have Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also love how to make a toggle list that changes the colour of the cells as in the "Status" column!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Phillip,</p>
<p>Thanks for referring me to that article! It was very helpful, but now I have another question:</p>
<p>How do I get the contents of an adjacent cell to automatically change the colour of cells around it?</p>
<p>Eg. In the "Marketing Plan" template, if the the "Status" of a row is changed to "complete" the whole row of cells turns green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know this is some type of conditional formatting, but I can't figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Sherri</p>

<p>Thank you for your response Sherri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are thankful that the article that we provide to you was very helpful. About your second query on how do we get the contents of an adjacent cell to automatically change the color of cells around it. In order for us to help you with this, let's say that
 the value in cell A1 in the "Status" column is changed to "Complete". Therefore, the entire row 1 should be highlighted in green. To achieve this, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select row <strong>1</strong> or all the rows where you want to apply the <strong>
conditional formatting</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Home</strong> &gt;<strong> Conditional</strong> <strong>Formatting
</strong>&gt; <strong>New Rule</strong> &gt; Use a formula to determine which cells to format.</li><li>Under <strong>Format values where this formula is true</strong>, type <strong>
$A1="Complete"</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Format </strong>&gt; <strong>Fill</strong> &gt; Select the <strong>color green</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> &gt; <strong>OK</strong> &gt; <strong>Apply</strong>.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 for phones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vnze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 for phones</h2>
                    <p>Android users are complaining that WP doesn't look like Android. IOS users are complaining that WP doesn't look like IOS. Now Windows Phone developers are moving the OS closer to those two to achieve what? An Android clone? This is not going to convince
 Android or IOS users. At best they'll say "huh I'm not going to buy this rip-off". Meanwhile I like WP very much specifically because it is NOT Android or IOS as I find these OS bloated, inefficient; inconsistent and chaotic. If Windows 10 for phones becomes
 a second Android why would I still prefer it over Android? The negatives would be the same (bloated, chaotic, inconsistent) while the advantages of Android are not copied (bluntly stated: more apps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today in fact I read two kind of reactions on forums</p>
<p>- wow they're finally improving! But I'll stick with Android/IOS after all!</p>
<p>- hmm to bad, I bought WP for it's elegance and now it seems they want to get rid of it. Maybe I should go back to IOS/Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I don't like</p>
<p>- the hamburger menu. Why is it there? And worse, why is it on the top of the screen? This is a bad decision as you have to move your hand further and doing that you block the view of your screen.</p>
<p>- Displaying the name of the picture: this makes scrolling through your pictures unpleasant. Good to know that my pictures at the zoo are named IMG2374 through IMG2398 but what's the benefit?</p>
<p>- the setting menu. While grouping the settings is a good idea the menu itself seems less consistent at least in styles. The tranquility and simplicity of the white-on-black is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall the UI is less tight and modern and more Android-like without also copying the advantages of Android. Please return to the WP8.1 style. You're not convincing the complainers as they usually don't even have Windows Phones and probably never will.</p>

 switches changed from clearly visible to those roundy nonsenses .... it's tiny, it's more complicated, it looks fragile instead of robust as on WP8.1 ...... it's more androidy ..... hope this will be changed and they are just trying to get feedback or whatever
 .... but I don't think they have much time to get rid of this ****. They could just improve categorization in settings, add some icons to quick menu (surprisingly FLASHLIGHT or mobile data icon still MISSING!!!) Instead they change everything, I would be surprised
 if some WP8.1 owner would upgrade .... why? To learn new stuff, which are more complicated .... what the hell is the phone app? Those icons on top??? What happened to left/right swipe to navigate between logical pages? And wh

            <p>This is what I'd like Windows Phone to keep:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ability to download entire maps for use offline is amazing. I have tried Android and apple devices and neither has this. PLEASE keep this functionality it is so useful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you plug in your phone to your computer it pops up with an explorer window that allows you to do whatever you want to files. Again, PLEASE keep this, having to use sync software like Zune is awful and I never want to go back to that!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dedicated camera button that turns camera on even with screen off - this is a must on phones for me. I can't understand why apple and samsung claim to make such fantastic camera phones but have no camera button! On WP pressing and holding camera button opens
 straight to camera, can't live without this feature!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all for now!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office 365 public folder permission propagation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 public folder permission propagation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I am applying permissions on PFs, they are not propagated to sub-folders. It is penetrating to certain extent like 3-4 sub-folders in sequence then it stopped. Although it takes a long time to apply permission and I am selecting the option to propagate
 permission. I tried single user as well as multiple users but it is not propagating to all sub-folders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi HasanSiddiqui,</p>
<p>I have performed a test from my side but I could not reproduce the issue. The permission was propagated to all sub-folders without any issue. Therefore, to further investigate the issue, Id like to confirm the details below:<br />
1. Does this issue happen to a specific public folder or all of them?<br />
2. Are there any differences between the sub folders with proper permission propagated to and others that are not?<br />
3. Can this issue be reproduced if another Office 365 administrator tries to apply the public folder permission?<br />
4. If possible, could you please create a new public folder for test and check if the issue persists in this folder?<br />
5. For those sub-folders that are not assigned with the right permission, could you apply permissions directly?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<p>1. Happens to all of them</p>
<p>2. There is no difference i can spot, all folders are different like some are mail enabled some are not.
</p>
<p>3. I will check that</p>
<p>4. I created new PF and then created multiple sub-folders inside and permissions work just fine.
</p>
<p>5. Yes i can apply permissions on them directly</p>
<p>Let me add that these PFs were migrated from Exchange 2010. </p>

<p>hi hasansiddiqui,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>as the permission is propagated to some of the sub-folders properly, the problem might have nothing to do with the migration. lets set it aside now. back to the issue, as it works fine in the newly created public folder and you can apply permissions on
 the sub-folders that are not propagated to directly, the issue seems a bit odd.</p>
<p>to avoid misunderstanding during reproduction, could you please share with us the detailed steps of how you apply the permission along with the differences of permissions between sub-folders? some related screenshots are greatly appreciated. to upload pictures,
 please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and <strong>insert/edit media</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi HasanSiddiqui,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your time and patience.<br />
<br />
I got feedback from our senior engineers whom Sam had consulted. Based on the current situation, in order to find out the reason why the permissions cannot completely take effect, we may need to involve our back-end team to capture some detailed logs about
 it, which will surely cost some more time. Would you like to do it that way? If yes, please see the private message I sent by clicking
<strong>Private messages</strong> under <strong>your details</strong> section in the upper-right corner. It contains some information which is required to let our back-end engineers contact you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Yes, you could optionally run Windows Defender in Safe Mode with different results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could get a second opinion from several trustworthy free third-party on-demand malware scanners. Windows Defender does not detect what others may consider malware. Since you don't give details of why you think you have a virus try those
 listed below.</p>

                    <p>Random pages in our OneNote lost it's formatting and the editor watermark changed to "unknown" on the ones affected. How do I revert back to the way everything was without manually correcting them all. We have about 30 people who reference this OneNote.

            This link only tells you how to change the page color which does not pertain to this topic. I know how to format in OneNote. What I'm trying to find out is why this glitch happened as this is WEEKS of work having to reformat everything manually.&nbsp;

            Hi Bruno,
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor on this community I am a user as yourself
<br />If you don't have Outlook installed on your computer, you can't import Google Calendar into Outlook Web App or Outlook on the web. But you can subscribe to a Google Calendar. This option has less functionality than importing the calendar.
<br />As per article below:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-google-calendar-to-outlook-098ed60c-936b-41fb-83d6-7e3786437330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import...</a>
<br />Seems like they don't play nice together. 
<br />Unless you can do the setup in outlook application first it won't replicate to outlook web. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answering quickly. Unfortunately, this answer is completely off-track: I am ONLY using Outlook Wep App with my personal account and do not use the Outlook desktop application. I AM currently using the Subscription feature, and I want to use it
 as intended: I want to see a read-only, but updated calendar. However, OWA never updates the subscribed calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else has this issue? Did you guys resolve it? Anybody at Microsoft listening here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bruno M-A.</p>

            Hi Bruno,
<br />I am just a moderator on this site a user such as yourself trying to help others. 
<br />I understand your frustration. 
<br />It may not be the answer you are looking for but it's the way it is sometimes they don't play nice together when looking for a solution for you I tried for an hour to get my gmail calendar to sync to my outlook.com You can if you want to make your gmail calendar public and it can be seen all over the net this is all Gmail not outlook. Nothing that microsoft can fix I suggest that you complain to gmail. When adding I did get this from Gmail 
<br />*** Email address is removed for privacy *** recommends that you use Google Calendar. So  they want me to use their calendar not sync their calendar to outlook. 
<br />To accept this invitation and register for an account, please visit: <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=bHNhbWlzQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ&amp;invEmailKey=xxxx.xxxxx.xxxa00e9aceb3e08fc9abb3a934b4b9c319a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=bHNh...</a>
<br />Google Calendar helps you keep track of everything going on in your life and those of the important people around you, and also help you discover interesting things to do with your time.
<br />So in my investigation of getting your gmail calendar to work with your outlook.com you can do it if you share your calendar publicly these are all on the gmail side Look under share calendar with people who don't have Google Calendar view your calendar is to make it public. A public Google Calendar is one that is searchable on the web. 
<br /><a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3417970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/3708...</a>
<br />So there are choices to make you can export you google calendar file into outlook but it will not replicate any information back to your google calendar. It gets the information into your outlook calendar so you have access to those appointments. use your outlook calendar going forward. 
<br />Where as Microsoft you can share your calendar with the gmail calendar. So tell me how Microsoft is to fix something that Gmail has locked down. 
<br />You can however sync gmail calendar to your outlook application or windows mail program. Seems web based techology is where the problem lies. 
<br />Sorry it's not working the way we think it should. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole idea in subscribing to my calendar Google calendar is to see (not modify, just see) my job calendar in my personal Outlook calendar so I don't double-book myself. I cannot emphasize enough the fact that the problem is not entirely with Google:
 subscribing, with the same link, in my iPhone's calendar app and macOS Calendar app works as expected. Those calendar apps, however, know that Google Calendar does not notify changes, so they poll the private URL every 1-60 minutes (it's a setting on macOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can resolve this. I think filing a bug report would probably be more effective in reaching my goal. Does anyone know where I can do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>
<p>Bruno M-A.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; have made the suggestion to UserVoice and I upvoted some suggestions that said the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a follow-up to the situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar ended up updating without my intervention, as expected. It took more than 24 hours, though. This is clearly a "bug" that it takes that much time for the calendars to update (every other major online service can keep subscribed calendars up to
 date way faster). (I put bug around quotes because I am a software engineer and I know this might be by design, but for the user it would be reported as a bug)</p>

            Hopefully once it has synced that it will not take that amount of time to update when adding an event. 
<br />So to confirm with you your original  Pasted my Google Agenda calendar's Private Calendar *.ics link (tried with both https:\\ and webcal:\\ protocols)
<br />worked to get your Google agenda to show up in Outlook? That's good to know so if I come across this again I will know it's just that it takes up to 24 hours for the Agenda to appear.  
<br />Thank you for getting back to me and letting me know it worked It's appreciated! 
<br />Kindest Regards,
<br />Sam
