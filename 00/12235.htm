<h2>            Phone loses music</h2>
                    <p>Now don't confuse this with deleting music. Nokia 810 8.1 dev preview (which probably explains alot). Well let's get in to this... This past weekend I tired playing my music on an airplane in airplane mode. The phone said it wasn't able to play it at the
 moment (even though this music was on a memory card... not in the cloud... It should always play media that is present on the device, connection or not, but that's a whole different stupid problem). I figured it might have been because I had switched the SD
 card into an android briefly and it got confused about where the music was. To try and fix this I backed up all of the music files, cleared the card, and put them back on. I turned off "sync" feature to make sure I wasn't trying to play something that I had
 purchased long ago. And I still got the problem in airplane mode. I plugged it into the computer to try and see if there was any other weird problems, and could find nothing. When I returned to Xbox music I noticed that very few of the albums were in there,
 (in spite of the fact that i just saw them on the computer). I'm not crazy, I downloaded a 3rd party music app and it saw EVERY MUSIC FILE, like I would assume it would... because they were all on the card. I have replaced the music several times (along with
 a restart each time) and everything works great, unless I want to add a folder of new music... then I have to repeat all of the steps again.<br />
<br />
Long story short two separate problems, every time I plug my phone in to a computer xbox music loses the music files to the point I need to remove them and add them again. If airplane mode is on before xbox music is entered music can not be played, even if
 it is on the SD card.<br />
<br />
I've been an avid Windows phone user since 2010, I like the look of the interface and for the most part the user experience. I've tried to champion this product to those who have not used or seen a windows phone, but I'm tired of it. I'm tired of making excuses
 for "why I don't have that app that everyone else has." I'm moving on, in spite of desperately trying to find a reason to keep this woefully under-supported thing. I really wanted this platform to succeed, but it's increasingly clear that it won't be, so I'm
 getting out here. This thing can't even play music, I'm so frustrated about this&nbsp;it takes every ounce of will power in me not to crush it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these are bugs, fix them... not for me but for the rest of the 1% of people that still love this phone.</p>

<h2>            microsoft solitaire drains battery faster than any other app I use. Why is that&#63;</h2>
                    Streaming netflix or hulu plus does shorten battery life somewhat, but playing Microsoft solitaire absolutely eliminates my battery life. 30 minutes of play results in 60% battery drain. no other software comes close. Why would this be. The app isn't particularly
 graphic intense. I play assassins creed with no where near the same drain. Has anyone else noted this?

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your entry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your are experiencing battery drain issue while playing Microsoft Solitaire Games, I haven't noticed this issue so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to suggest you to make sure that there is no other application running on background when you launch it that&nbsp;may cause this issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 has stopped working - just after starting up</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago I upgraded Office 2010 to 2013. At first it worked fine, but then Windows Update wanted to update a lot of files - and after that, Outlook 2013 stops working right after starting up (it does fetch some emails from the server first) with
 a popup saying "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working" with a posibility to check online for a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no solution given and the error is consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the following:</p>
<p>1. From the setup-program to repair the complete Office 2013 installation</p>
<p>2. From Mail in Control Panel to choose another data file as the default</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of these attempts had any effect. I hope that someone knows what to do :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1. It happens only with Outlook - I have tried all the other programs in the suite, and they all start up correctly</p>
<p>2. I wasn't aware of any DisplayLink drivers, so I searched for them and didn't find them - just in case, I installed the recommended version anyway, but it had no effect (I have rebooted the pc afterwards, but still no effect)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, Outlook doesn't crash immediately after the splash screen - the main screen does open and I can see how it fetches one or two emails from the server (IMAP) before it chrashes.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;starting Outlook in safe mode it asks for the profile to use and I&nbsp;select the only one available ("Outlook") -&nbsp;then it starts up without the preview pane but still stops working immediately after.</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">It looks like the Outlook profile is corrupted which in turn could be causing the issue. The best option here would be to create and configure
 a new Outlook profile and check if the issue gets resolved in the new profile. Refer to this article for more information:</font></span></p>

            <p>Thanks once more for your suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried at first to create a new profile, and that solved the problem. Outlook now starts as it is supposed to, using the new profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, I have to setup&nbsp;all account information, folders, rules and settings in order to get back to what I had before. Is there an easier way than doing it all over? Could I, for instance, import these things from the old profile?</p>

    <title>Column Headers not displaying in Outlook for Mac 2016 15.20 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelrnorton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Column Headers not displaying in Outlook for Mac 2016 15.20 &#40;160315&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Outlook for Mac 2016 v15.20 (160315) via Office Insider updates, every time I click on a folder in Outlook, the text and separators on the column headers disappears. &nbsp;Then, if I scroll, the (now blank) header row ultimately disappears.
 &nbsp;This happens no matter how the contents of the folder are arranged or grouped, and impacts folders both locally and on the Exchange server. &nbsp;Oddly, this only appears to happen with folders which contain items. &nbsp;Folders which are empty show the headers just
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing this?</p>

            Looks like my issue was resolved when I was able to update the device to El Capitan last night. &nbsp;Specifically installed 10.11.3, and now the column headers are displaying again. &nbsp;For what it's worth, I haven't installed any patches to Office since I reported
 this, so perhaps is unique to Yosemite. &nbsp;Either way, it's fixed for me know.

<p>My Lumia 521 will not take photos for some reason. The camera activates, I can see the photo that I am trying take thru the screen, it focuses, and clicks when I tap the screen, and the the photo slides away. But the photos are all blank (gray screen). I
 can take videos without problem, so it's not a lens issue. Can someone help me with this? &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

<h2>            the image part with relationship id rid5 was not found in the file</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a word file where I lost my pictures and this message popped up.</p>
<p>I found here a solution which and tried to fix a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked for me (usual backup warnings apply);</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Rename .docx file to .zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Extract the files into it's own folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Look in the&nbsp;<span>word\_rels</span>&nbsp;folder for the file&nbsp;<span>document.xml.rels</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>4) Open this file in notepad or your basic text editor of choice and search for your&nbsp;<span>rID</span>&nbsp;string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) In my case, the target bit in the example below was set to NULL</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Relationship Id="rId39" Type="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image" Target="media/image30.png"/&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) To fix, put in a filename that exists in the media folder.</p>
<p><span><br />
</span>7) Save the file, ensuring the filename is the same as before (make sure notepad or your editor of choice doesn't mangle the filename by adding .txt to the end).</p>
<p><span><br />
</span>8) Zip up all the files and folders back into one file again.</p>
<p><br />
9) Rename your .zip file back to .docx, open in Word and you should be sorted.</p>
<p><br />
Note that one of your images in the document will be wrong, but unfortunately you can't tell which one, so a bit of proofreading is needed.</p>
<p>Hope that helps. &nbsp;Had about four different incidences where I work, all due to a large number of images being placed in the docx file.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>I can't proceed to the step 7 because I was taking all the pictures by prt sc and pasting them directly into the document, so I don't have any</p>
<p>media folder with filenames and I don't know what filename should I type there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Physically saving videos of FB is not possible in Microsoft Lumia 640XL LTE Dual SIM. &nbsp; &nbsp;In some Androids, one has to just soft touch the video little long time while playing and it will give option to save videos; alternately it has symbols to "save video".
 &nbsp; Similarly any long text messages posted on FB can also be copied to memory by just touching on the text and paste anywhere you want.

<p>1. &nbsp; This does not happen with Internet Explorer. I use Goggle Chrome as a browser.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp; I do not have any other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fail to see why I should go through a complicated two step verification with a security number which I would no doubt lose, when I have had no previous problems with outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit the email shortcut, it briefly shows the secure &nbsp; https://dub126..... &nbsp;which was secure previously, then reverts to https://dub116...... which is insecure.</p>
<p>I am getting fed up with this</p>

<p>It sounds as if you have a shortcut pointing to a server cluster other than the one where your account is now hosted (moved from 126 to 116 at the Dublin datacentre).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>; can you log on to your account there? That's the address you should use for your shortcut.</p>

            You mean you're still seeing a certificate error? What does it say? There are many different errors with different causes. The pale line at the bottom of the error message is probably the best clue.

            problem still not solved. I notice no one answered this time. I have started using IE as browser, which I don't like as much as Chrome, but at least it's secure. Would like to go back to Chrome, though, if problem is resolved.

            Yes.<br />
<br />
MS still recommends using 32 bit Office, even on 64 bit Windows. Functionally 32 and 64 bit office are the same except that 64 bit can handle files larger than 2GB (mostly excel). The main reason for the recommendation is that many addons, including a bunch
 from MS, have not been updated to work in 64 bit Office.<br />
<br />
The "slimmed down:" office is called Starter. It runs in a virtual computer called "Click to Run". As you noticed, it includes only crippled versions of Word and Excel.

Yes you can install Outlook 2010 with Home and Student 2007. Note that you will not get the full integration between Outlook and Word that you get when Outlook is part of an Office Bundle.<br />

    <title>Microsoft office, and User32.dll errors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft office, and User32.dll errors</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently started college and decided to put office 2010 onto my desktop at home. i am running windows xp 3.2 with 4gb of ram, 32 bit. i downloaded the trial version of office 2010 from Microsoft and all the programs worked fine except the one
 i really needed, which was access. When i tried to open access it gave me the "illegal system DLL relocation error". which is User32 was relocated in memory due to Shell32 occupying an address range reserved for windows systems DLLs. i have done a lot of research,
 tried replacing both the user and shell32.dll&nbsp; to no avail. i decided to buy office 2010 from my college, put the disk in and it wont even open the disk, it gives me that same error. so i decided to right click and explore the CD ROM drive, found the setup,
 ran it. It opened the installation interface, froze for a couple mins and it said it encountered an error with no error code.&nbsp;&nbsp; any tips or suggestions would be very helpful, i have done my research with all the hot fix's and stuff from microsoft nothing works.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and consideration<br />

<p>did you test the other sample code, it updates everytime the date is changed in the cell. If you don't want it to do this automatically you can pull some of the code and put it in a regular module.</p>

            I think I may have stated something incorrectly. My spreadsheet has a data tab with the pv table data. there are going to be about 100 individual tabs with names of salespeople. I copied the pv table i first created to all of the tabs and renamed them
 pivottable4. I went into each tab and selected only the name of the individual that should be on that tab. If the macro can auto update based on the date, that is fine. Will it go into all of the sheets and update all of the pv tables?

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you optimize your browser to make sure that it isn’t contributing to this issue. This will also serve as an initial troubleshooting step to clean up unnecessary
 clutter in your hard disk and improve browser performance. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>For&nbsp;Internet Explorer
</span></b><span>- kindly close all the programs you are running on your computer.&nbsp; Then you can simply press (<b>Ctrl&nbsp;</b>+
<b>Shift</b> + <b>Del)</b> key, check all the boxes when <b>Delete Browsing History
</b>windows pop up. Click <b>Delete</b> and then <b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
For other browser, please refer to this </span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>link</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>If the issue persists after following the suggestion provided by kathleencollins, we’d like you to provide us the answers to the following questions that I have enumerated below. These will help
 us to investigate and eliminate the possible causes of this issue&nbsp;your concern:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•Is your browser updated on its latest version? if you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work
 and it might not display properly.</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the issue happen when using a different computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>•Do other Outlook.com accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the same thing happen when you access your account from the same computer with a different browser?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p></span>

            I still don't understand your comment in the initial post <em><strong>(not contains ZERO, but equals ZERO).
</strong></em>What do you mean by contains zero as against equals zero. They are both the same.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean you cannot see the contacts that are online or you cannot see the whole list of contacts in your messenger? I you cannot see the whole list of your contacts, it's possible that those were hidden, you can<strong> click the arrow next to messenger</strong>
 on the left pane of your hotmail and it should show your contacts in messenger. You can also select<strong> 'show all'</strong>&nbsp; to view all the messenger contacts including those that are offline. However, for this feature is no longer available in outlook
 so you won't be able to view your messenger contacts and you will have to use your Windows Live Messenger which I think is the icon on your desktop that you were referring to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Why would Messenger be integrated into Outlook.com the same way it was/still is with Hotmail. It was a very handy feature when using a computer that wasn't yours, for example a work machine or a friends. Is it because Messenger will be going away and replaced
 by Skype? If so will there be a day when Skype gets integrated with Outlook.com in the same way Messenger was with Hotmail? I hope so, ty for any replies.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Outlook.com web messenger and Windows Live Messenger are two different things.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web messenger is a instant messaging browser-based client or web application. You can use it online without even installing it in your computer. Outlook.com web messenger can be accessed through
<a href="http://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://people.live.com</a>&nbsp;by clicking the Smiley in the box icon which is located at the upper right corner of your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Windows Live Messenger is instant messaging client. You need to install it your computer to be able to use it. Windows Live Messenger will retire and it will replaced by Skype.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Messenger</span> will retire soon. <span>We will make an announcement about the changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

            First to correct a typo in my original post ... the first sentence should read "Why would Messenger NOT be integrated into Outlook.com ..." ( I see now that it is)<br />
<br />
Ty for the reply Mark ... just for clarification, I do see the smiley face in the upper right corner when I am in Outlook or Skydrive or whatever. I also see now how to use it to access Messenger. So now my question is .... When Skype replaces Messenger completely
 and Messenger is gone, will that still work the same, except now I will be IMing ppl through skype and not Messenger? Thanks again.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We're glad to know that you can now use the Web Messenger. As mentioned by the previous moderator, Outlook.com Web Messenger is different from the Windows Live Messenger. Outlook.com Web Messenger will work the same as before. The upgrade of Windows
 Live Messenger to Skype will not affect the Web Messenger. When Windows Live Messenger is replaced by Skype, sending instant messages to people will either be on Skype client or through Web Messenger.</span></p>

<h2>            Problems with Internet Explorer after windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my husband installed the update to windows 8.1 I haven't been able to do anything with photos on Internet Explorer. I can't load new pictures to Facebook with out an application error message popping up saying something about memory reference
 and memory not being able to be written. It then closes Internet Explorer. The same thing happens when I try to open photos within emails, and when I try to look at photos on my friend's photography website. Can anyone explain why this is happening? It would
 be great if someone knows how to fix this. </p>

    <title>Cannot Place Calls from Skype to Landline &#35;s and Mobile &#35;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marina yg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Place Calls from Skype to Landline &#35;s and Mobile &#35;s</h2>
                    <p>A while back I bought a skype credit so I will be able to call mobile phones and landlines.
</p>
<p>I still have enough money for many calls. </p>
<p>When I tried to place a call to United Kingdom (country code 44) I got errors saying that the number was unknown
</p>
<p>even though I verified it, and it was a valid number. I tried to dial this number from the landline, and it worked.
</p>
<p>I tried dialing from skype and put 011 in front of the country code (because I am located in USA).
</p>
<p>I also tried to call from skype without entering 011 in front of the country code 44.
</p>
<p>In any case I could not make it work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you, please, advise? </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />So that other users can not see your calendar anymore, you must stop sharing the calendar.
<br />
<br />To stop sharing your calendar follow the step below.
<br />
<br />Note: At any time you can revoke access to your calendar. Note that it may take a while for Office 365 and the user's Outlook to sync and remove the view to your calendar.
<br />
<br />1- Click Calendar.
<br />
<br />2- Click Home&gt; Calendar Permissions.
<br />
<br />3- On the Permissions tab, click the user's name and then choose Remove.
<br />
<br />4- Click OK
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />I hope it works for you       
        </p>

            Hi Heather
<br />
<br />If you share a resource with a user, from the moment you share it the other user will have access to the information in the resource, but if you stop sharing the resource you will no longer be able to see or access the shared resource. But for the other user not to access the resource you must stop sharing because otherwise the resource will remain shared with the user (s) to whom the resource was shared.
<br />
<br />Best Regards       
        </p>

<p>Ok; so let's say I add Conference Room 1 account to my iOS Outlook app. And, Joe and I work at the same company. And I share Conference Room 1 calendar only with him, from my app (he does not add the full account to his phone app).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, then I leave the company. Conference Room 1 does not leave. Will Joe continue to be able to access the calendar- even though I am gone and was the person who shared it to him? Is that what I understand you are saying? I think so, but I want to make
 sure before I got back to my team and tell them.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Heather
<br />
<br />Joe does not have access to your account, just the calendar in Room 1 that you shared with him even though you left the company because you have not stopped sharing the resource with Joe. If you want Joe to stop accessing the resource calendar, you should stop sharing with him.
<br />
<br />Best Regards

<h2>            Income Mail on Outlook 365 does not appear in queue</h2>
                    Last week I switched over from Outlook 2016 (which kept hanging) to Outlook 365 online. The online version seems to be working properly EXCEPT new emails do not appear in the inbox, which is set to list most recent emails first. My inbox does not show
 any emails from the last six days. However, If I search for a specific email that I know should have arrived, it will l as a result of the search. How do I get all new emails to display properly in the inbox? Thanks!

<h2>            Is there a trick to stepping through a macro with Office 2013&#63;</h2>
                    I have a macro that I created for Excel in Office 2010, but when I try to run and edit it on my laptop, which has Office 2013, the step-though doesn't work.&nbsp; I am using the F8 key, but at a certain point, the macro just continues to run through the end
 and won't let me step through line by line.&nbsp; It will stop if I put in Breakpoints, but otherwise it just keeps running. &nbsp; I don't see anything in my macro that would make this happen, and it was just working the other day with my desktop using 2010.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            If it helps, the last row that will allow me to Step through with F8 is the following:<br />
<br />
DTfile = Application.GetOpenFilename("CSV Files,*.csv", , "Select New Drug Testing Billing Download File", "Open", False)<br />
<br />
As soon as I select the file to open, the macro takes off and doesn't stop until it reaches a Breakpoint later in the code.<br />

            <p>I've seen this too.&nbsp; It appears to happen when "control" is passed to the User to work on a dialog.&nbsp; As soon as the dialog is closed, the code falls out of debug mode.&nbsp; Only way I know is to add extra breakpoints.&nbsp; You could add a parameter and set it to
 true while debugging:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Public Const bInDebug As Boolean = True</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DTfile = Application.GetOpenFilename("CSV Files,*.csv", , _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Select New Drug Testing Billing Download File", "Open", False)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>If bInDebug&nbsp; Then Stop</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I'd need to be needing to use this a lot to make it worth while using throughout my code!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            Thanks Rich - that helps.&nbsp; At least now I know I didn't accidentally mess up my macro, and I will be on the lookout for it in the future.&nbsp; I wonder if this is a bug to be fixed with 2013.<br />
