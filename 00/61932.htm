    <title>Windows 10 Boot Camp Installation Leads to Boot Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twitch2021  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Camp Installation Leads to Boot Loop</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 on my iMac (late-2013 model) and, while the initial installation was successful, it appears there was an issue with the drivers installed by Boot Camp because, as soon as the installer finished and I restarted Windows, it
 went into a boot loop and eventually recovery mode. It should be noted that the Realtek Audio driver installation hung and I had to use Task Manager to kill that process and manually install it from the Boot Camp drive. Any help would be appreciated as I don't
 want to have to start again.

            Hi Twitch,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
We apologize for not being able to address your concern in a timely manner. &nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you own an Apple Macintosh but need to use Windows 10, there are many options available. The most common choice is the Boot Camp utility bundled with OS X. This helps you prepare installation media, download Windows 10 drivers and partition your Mac's
 hard disk or SSD. With Boot Camp, your only option is to dual boot OS X and Windows 10. The benefits are significant because you get direct access to the hardware so the performance faster.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let‚Äôs try to refer to the article, created by Andre Da Costa December 22, 2015, to fix your issue.</div>

<p>I'm having EXACTLY the same issue as you're describing. Furthermore, I deleted the partition and started it all over again, but the problem still persists and I have no idea what could be wrong. Did you find anything that could fix it? Any idea? As far as
 I can see it's not an isolated case...</p>

</p><p>As Twitch states "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The problem is with Windows 10 being in a boot loop, not with anything Apple-related</span>". Any ideas? I bought a product that I can't use and I do need it for my work, we need a solution

            Since this forum wasn't generating the kind of help I was in need of I've been asking around elsewhere and someone on Reddit suggested that I reset the Windows partition from the Recovery screen and then, once booted into it and before running the Boot
 Camp installer, navigate to the drivers folder in the Windows USB drive/key/etc and delete the entire Realtek folder. Then launch the installer and let it run and all should be well. I'll be trying this this weekend so I don't actually know if it will work
 yet but I thought I'd share here. The Redditor also said there's a Cirrus audio driver that can be used instead of the Realtek one but I haven't looked into this yet.

            So, I reset Windows, deleted the Realtek folder from the Boot Camp installer drive, and ran the installer. It completed the installation successfully and I rebooted Windows and ended up in the same boot loop which resulted in the repair screen coming up
 again. I'm at a complete loss...

    <title>Rear audio jack is very quiet with headphones plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rear audio jack is very quiet with headphones plugged in</h2>
                    <p>My front audio jack broke so now I'm trying to use my rear audio jack to plug my headphones into. Windows is detecting the headset as
<strong>Speakers "High Definition Audio Device" </strong>and it is set to the default device. I've gone through everything the windows troubleshooter has recommended and all that's on the Microsoft website about fixing audio. I believe that the problem is that
 Windows is detecting my headphones as speaker. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might appear due to the incompatibility drivers. I suggest you to perform the following troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Run
<strong><span>inbuilt audio troubleshooter</span></strong> and check if it works. Follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong><span>Windows Key +R</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>Control Panel.</span></strong></span></p>

<span>Type<strong><span>troubleshooting
</span></strong>in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now click on <strong><span>view all</span></strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong><span>Playing audio</span></strong> and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver,
 and your speakers or headphones.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, follow method 2.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest to download and install the latest soundcard drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>How to download and install drivers,
</span></strong><span>please follow the link given below.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply Aswin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very odd. When I run the troubleshooter, the audio begins to work. Only when the troubleshooter is open though. Once I close the troubleshooter, the audio stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After more experimenting, it seems that I'm unable to set my <strong>Communication Headphones</strong> to be the default device. I've tried reinstalling drivers and changing to the windows 10 audio drivers. What should be my next option?</p>

            <p>I've attempted to update both of the drivers offered on my computer: "High Definition Audio Device" &amp; "IDT High Definition Audio CODEC", both of which don't work. Not only is the sound only working with troubleshooter open, but it will briefly work when
 I test the audio with sound manager open. Instead of playing the default windows audio test sound when I test the headphones, it will play music which is opened in the background.</p>

<p>Hello JayTee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. If the paperclip method did not work, you may want to consider taking the Xbox to a Microsoft store for assistance. If you live nearby one, they will be able to help.</p>

<p>Is the console under warranty still?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't, it might be worthwhile hitting up one of the local game stores (not Gamestop or EB Games - something local that sells older games) to see if they have any advice.</p>

<p>I suppose you have an HP that stopped working. When Microsoft updated your PC to Windows 10, it Muted you DTS Mic installed on your computer. IT cannot be fixed without getting HP to install a new Driver. IF you are one day over the warranty as it was set
 up to be, you have to pay. Even after you pay, they still cannot fix this problem.&nbsp; You only two choices is to disconnect Cortana or go back to Windows 8.1. I just went through this, I found the problem, you can also. GO to Control Panel, look up Devices,
 Find DTS, it will be Muted. Mine would not repair. This is an HP problem that they will not fix. Trust me, Microsoft cannot find this problem. After 12 hours, my remote tech finally let me show him the problem!</p>

            Also, Device manager will not help! You have to go right to your Driver, DTS. IT will be muted and not fixable!

            I, also, did not want XBOX on my PC, but I was being charged $11 dollars monthly for Groove Music. No refunds even if you did not order this program! See you account activity and check if you are also getting charged for your Non Existence XBOX.&nbsp;

    <title>Silverlight sound problem when using firefox. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filiph94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Silverlight sound problem when using firefox.</h2>
                    <p>Ive been watching live sport and on those websites they're using Silverlight as the media player. Ive noticed that when the silverlight player is playing that when I open another tab in firefox that the sound on the silverlight player sounds a bit weird
 and broken. If I then open the tab with the silverlight player again the sound problem is gone and if I choose the other tab without the Silverlight player then I get the samething with the sound error. Its a bit hard to explain exactly how it sounds.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>Ive also noticed that when Im watching something live and Im on another tab that the silverlight player is playing the video in a lower speed so if Im watching something live then when Im on another tab and then changes back to the one with the silverlight
 player then I can see that Im a few seconds behind depending on how long Ive been on the other tab. The quality of the video is also much lower after switching back to the tab with the silverlight player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what the problem is. I recently got a new computer so I believe that I have the newest versions of firefox and silverlight. I didnt have any problems with the sound on my older computer which I believe used an older version of silverlight
 and firefox.</p>

<p>When I start my laptop, my password space where we type laptop password, is automatically filled with a huge long random string. So everytime I have to delete and type my password. Is there any way to get rid out of the irritating issue.</p>

            Hi KulMihir, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend disabling the Windows 10 password prompt, then re-enabling it. This might stop the password from being autofilled.
<br />
<br />You can search Start for "netplwiz", then choose the first result. In there, you should see an option to disable the password requirement when logging in.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, here's a tutorial on how to do this:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-lo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, reboot and reverse the steps to re-enable the password.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1-</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform
<b>Clean Boot.</b><br />
<br />
Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot</b> state helps in identifying if <b>any third party applications</b> or
<b>startup items</b> are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a
<b>Clean Boot-</b><br />
<br />
<b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to follow
<b>Step</b> <b>7</b> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to
<b>Normal Startup</b> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to install the
<b>Bing</b> <b>bar</b> from the article mentioned below ‚Äì</span></p>
<p><b><span>Bing Bar version 7.0 is available</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505591</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you may download from the link mentioned below as well ‚Äì</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://toolbar.discoverbing.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://toolbar.discoverbing.com/en-US</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the steps mentioned in
<b>Method</b> <b>1</b> does not help then you need to go to <b>
Method</b> <b>2</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2-</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the
<b>Installer</b> was installed successfully means that there is no fault with the
<b>Windows</b> <b>Installer</b>.<br />
As mentioned earlier, you need to refer to the <b>Bing</b> <b>forums</b> for further assistance since the issue is limited only to
<b>Bing</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hope this helps!!</b></p>

                    Every time I try to access my passport recently, I cannot. I've checked and it seems that Devices and Printers and Device Manager can detect it, but my computer cannot, even though the passport clearly lights up and is whirring and vibrating each time
 it is plugged in. I am using Windows 10, and it was updated from Windows 7. I'm not sure, but I think my computer was able to detect it prior to updating it to Windows 10.

            <div>Using the <strong>Share</strong> charm to send the files to another place is the recommended way of&nbsp;sending the recordings out of the app easily.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to access the recordings directly you can find them stored inside the application data for the Sound Recorder app. Note that apps store important information in these locations so it is not recommended that you mess with other files in there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can find the recordings of the Sound Recorder app stored under: &lt;Your user profile&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsSoundRecorder_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\Indexed\Recordings\</div>
<div><br />
<div>To get to that location you can follow these steps:</div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Copy and paste the following:<br />
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsSoundRecorder_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\Indexed\Recordings</div>
</li><li>
<div>Hit <strong>Enter</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>All the recordings from the app should be in that folder. </div>
</li></ol>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Keep in mind that if you modify the files in that folder those changes will be reflected in the app. For example, if you delete those files you will lose the recordings so proceed with caution.</div>

<h2>            Xbox One&#39;s console is a poorly made product</h2>
                    <p>I have had 3 replacement consoles under warranty, two replaced power blocks under warranty, 3 replaced Elite controllers under warranty and over 100 hours talking to support on a variety of problems. I just received a new Turtle Beach Elite 800 headset and in connecting the digital optic cable I inadvertently disconnected the consoles power supply. I reconnected the power cable and now the console will not power up. I did not drop, kick, bang, or jar the console in any way I simply moved the power cord with my fingers while pushing the optic cable into its slot. The light on the power bar is orange and I've been through all of the trouble shooting tips from both Xbox support and Youtube video's with no luck. It seems that I'll need to either have this garbage product replaced again or go back to my 360 that still works great after over 10 years of use.</p><p>IT LOOKS LIKE I"LL HAVE TO TOSS THIS&nbsp; PIECE OF GARBAGE XBOX ONE CONSOLE INTO THE TRASH CAN WHERE IT BELONGS AND BE DONE WITH

</p><p>You're just really unlucky. I've never had a problem with any console I've owned......ever. My day 1 console that I&nbsp;use nearly every day is still rocking without any issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I actually know a lot of people in real life that haven't had any issues. Not saying there aren't any, but your experience is not indicative of the product.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Randomly Powering Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaytek13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Randomly Powering Off</h2>
                    
<p>Everything went fine with the setup, but within an hour the One just randomly shut itself off in the middle of action. At first I thought it was weird, disregarded it, and turned the console back on without issue. But then later, it did the same thing. Both
 of these times I don't remember what I was doing. Again, after the second time I powered it on again without issue.</p>
<p>Then the third shut down came. I was in the middle of a game of KI and the first thing I noticed was that the game started lagging terribly. After about 10 seconds of lag, another shut down.</p>
<p>What could be the cause of this? At first I thought maybe it was a heating issue, but the One was only slightly warm to the touch. Then I thought it might be a power issue, but why would a power issue cause lag before it shut down?</p>
<p>Any way to diagnose this?</p>

    <title>Fan spins before Powering off the Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o dova o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fan spins before Powering off the Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question regarding turning off the Xbox one in energy save mode. When I turn off the console, the fan turns on and spins up for a half second right before the xbox powers off. Is this normal?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey o DOVA o </p>
<p>&nbsp; This is very normal, you actually want to make sure your fan is also running while the console is on. This way your console doesn't over heat. If you have any more questions please feel free to ask them. Happy gaming or something like that :)
