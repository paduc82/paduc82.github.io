<h2>            access 2010 64 bit full and 32 bit runtime</h2>
                    I have office 2010 64 bit installed but need to run some mde's created in 32 bit access. Can I also install the 32 bit 2010 runtime and use each as necessary?

            <p>Hi Christianlea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t install 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office products and 32-bit versions of Microsoft Office products on the same machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2269468<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You receive the error "You cannot install the 64-bit version of Office 2010 because you have 32-bit Office products installed."</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-US;2269468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-US;2269468</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to install the 32 bit version of Access runtime, you will need to install it on another machine or install it on a virtual machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint won&#39;t open in Office, will open in Polaris</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Office Standard 2013 installed on my laptop . I tried to open a PowerPoint downloaded from a website. I get the message "PowerPoint found a problem with content in C:\Users...reports.pptx. PowerPoint can attempt to repair the presentation."
 I click repair, and it says "Sorry, PowerPoint can't read C:\Users...reports.pptx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning off my anti virus program, but that did not change the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go on my Android tablet to the same site, I have not problem opening the file in Polaris Office. I tried emailing it from my tablet to open on my computer, but that did no good. Any ideas?</p>

<h3> bernardfigueroa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Publisher Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know if its possible to print out my Outlook calendar ( in monthly view) and have a detailed view of each date, the way it would print on Publisher.<br />
</p>
<p>Just to clarify, here is an example:<br />
The first &nbsp;image below shows a Outlook calendar, the events scheduled on this calendar are partially showing its information. If i print the Outlook calendar, the print out will print with partial information on each date. The second image shows a Publisher
 calendar , the events shown on this calendar are showing all details of the event. If the Publisher calendar is printed, it will show all details within that date.<br />

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps in the link you provided still doesn't really provide me with the same view that Publisher gives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i have 3 meetings at 3 different locations and timings on November 10th on my Outlook calendar I want it to print out in calendar form with
<strong>all</strong> the details on that specific date as Publisher would. With Outlook, when I want to print the calendar view, you will only see partial details of that event. This is what I dont want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to know if I am able to merge my Outlook calendar into Publisher?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Using the link I sent, Outlook will try to print all calendar details, but the over-riding formatting is that it uses one page to print the monthly calendar. When I follow the steps with on appointment per day, I see all the detail. But you're right that
 if you have many appointment, Outlook will no expand the calendar to more than one page to fit all the text in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Publisher has only a built-in command to merge Outlook Contacts. You could try exporting your Calendar as a CSV file, then using that as a merge source.</p>

    <title>Constantly required to log in to Office 2016 applications on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atli bjarnason  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constantly required to log in to Office 2016 applications on Mac</h2>
                    <p>I've installed all Office 2016 Home for Mac applications on my MacBook with OS X El Capitan including the OneDrive application, or more specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word for Mac (version 15.26)</p>
<p>Excel for Mac (version 15.26)</p>
<p>PowerPoint for Mac (version 15.26)</p>
<p>Outlook for Mac (version 15.26)</p>
<p>OneNote for Mac (version 15.26)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and finally...</p>
<p>Microsoft® OneDrive (version 17.3.6389).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have ONE(1) Microsoft Personal Account and THREE(3) Office 365 Business Accounts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;All THREE(3) Business Accounts are "Office 365 Business Essentials" without Office license.</p>
<p>3. My Office 2016 Home subscription license is on my Microsoft Personal Account.</p>
<p>4. I use my Microsoft Personal Account to log into Word, Excel and PowerPoint.<br />
5. I've added OneDrive for all FOUR(4) accounts as a Place in Word, Excel and PowerPoint.<br />
6. OneDrive for all FOUR(4) accounts is also synced with my Mac using the OneDrive app.<br />
7. I have OneNote notebooks stored on all FOUR(4) accounts and all opened in OneNote.<br />
8. All THREE(3) Business Accounts are set up in Outlook with Exchange.<br />
9. All THREE(3) Business Accounts have two-step verification set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, everything is set up in a similar way on my iPhone, iPad and on my Windows 10 desktop computer. A mobile productivity paradise, right? Well, almost. I love all these Microsoft products. I've used them all my life and I think they've never been better.
 Especially since we're now able to use them on all devices and collaborating (kind of) with others from anywhere using OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to see better and more smooth file collaboration and better file sharing abilities in OneDrive (similar to Dropbox), but I can live without that for now. But the biggest problems I have not is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. EVERY TIME I close down OneNote and Outlook, I have to log in to SOME of my accounts again in order to use the applications. Having long passwords as well as two-step verification on the&nbsp;Business Accounts, this is an EXTREMELY annoying problem. Also,
 what I like most about using OneNote on multiple devices is being able to jot down notes really FAST (and two-step verification x3 is just not).</p>
<p>2. SOMETIMES after I close down Word, Excel and PowerPoint I must&nbsp;log in to SOME of my accounts again in order to use the applications. However, this behavior is very unpredictable, but I can never count on opening files FAST from OneDrive straight from
 within the apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything to fix these problems. I've read every single article online that addresses the issue, but nothing works. I've even tried removing and reinstalling all Office applications on my Mac and tried using it in every possible scenario to prevent
 problem 1 and 2 from happening, but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me please? If I have to type in my password and verify a sign-in one more time, I'm not sure if I can remain sane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to fix the problem by NOT using Outlook for Mac. Logging into Outlook requires me to use the "App password" generated in the multi-factor authentication panel in my Office 365 Portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to be super-clear:</p>
<p>1. APP PASSWORD is generated in the multi-factor authentication panel in the Office 365 Portal.</p>
<p>2. ACCOUNT PASSWORD is set by the user and used to log in to the&nbsp;Office 365 Portal, OneDrive, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>My guess is that the Keychain Access in Mac OS can't handle the same Office 365 Account using&nbsp;APP PASSWORD for one application (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">e.g. Outlook for Mac) and
 then an&nbsp;</span>ACCOUNT PASSWORD for other applications (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">e.g. Word, Excel and PowerPoint).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I might be able to use Outlook if I turn off&nbsp;</span>multi-factor authentication (and then use the ACCOUNT PASSWORD there to log in), but that's a big NO-NO
 for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE MICROSOFT...FIX THIS ASAP!</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is back. In a little under one day, OneNote mysteriously started prompting me to log in again, but first only for ONE of the THREE Business Accounts. After I log in to that account, it takes OneNote just under another day to prompt&nbsp;me to log in again
 for ONE of the other THREE Business Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so it goes. No Outlook and no way to rely on OneNote to quickly jot down notes.</p>

            <p>Hi, I don't have a fix for this - but I have a similar issue, though it is limited only to OneNote. I constantly get prompted to log in, even when I am in the middle of writing a sentence, for reasons that are completely beyond me. Have reinstalled the entire
 Office suite two times since this started happening, still doesn't work properly (version 15.26).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b672324-40ad-4f33-b9b2-dcc00054f18f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b672324-40ad-4f33-b9b2-dcc00054f18f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is obvious from my highly mysterious screen shot, I am prompted to sign in even though I have never signed out. This is driving me crazy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting Microsoft Support and they suggested turning "2-factor authentication" off. This sounded absurd, but I tried it and I now get the "sign in" thing appearing a bit less frequently. But it does not resolve the issue completely and am I not
 willing to stop using&nbsp;"2-factor authentication" in the long-run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I know how frustrated you might be - because Microsoft really <strong>
do not care</strong> about their customers, especially if they are private persons...</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I just hope that by joining in this thread will get more attention.</p>

<h2>            why can&#39;t I open the amazon kindle phone app since Windows 10 last update&#63; And who at microsoft do I report this to to get someone to resolve it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the recent Windows 10 update to my Lumia phone the kindle app I have been using for over 2 years will not open, it does not recognise my login or password. This same fault has been reported in the message boards by hundreds of people
 in the last few days but the post is now blocked. There have been 4 responses from Microsoft none of which have addressed or resolved the issue that hundreds of people are having. Please will Microsoft resolve this as a matter of urgency. I am sure I will
 be not the only person who will&nbsp;switch to an Apple or Samsung phone if the problem is not rectified, kindle is the app I use more than any after email.</p>

<p>The Kindle app is a third party (Amazon) app - why would you ask MS to fix it when it is Amazon's responsibility to maintain their own app ? Did you try Amazon support ?

    <title>how to always display rows 2 &#38; 3 &#43; column A - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to always display rows 2 &#38; 3 &#43; column A</h2>
                    I'm trying to figure out how to use the freeze feature on Office 2007 to do a more complicated freeze.
<br />
I want column A to always be visible, along with rows 2 and 3. Row 1 should be hidden unless the user scrolls all the way to the top.
<br />
I can get either one or the other, but when I try for both I get odd results with the freeze happening at seemingly random locations.<br />
<br />
Times like this I miss AppleWorks 2.1 on the Apple IIe where you just put the cursor where you wanted this to happen, hit Apple-T, and were asked "<b><u>T</u></b>op,
<b><u>L</u></b>eft side, or <b><u>b</u></b>oth?" and made the selection or typed the appropriate highlighted letter.<br />

            <blockquote>I don't care about seeing row 1, I'll delete it if necessary. Just how do I use the freeze so that column a is visible as well as rows 2 and 3?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
To set up the "freeze"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Select B4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; View<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freeze Panes --&gt; Freeze Panes (1st option on the dropdown)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then just hide row 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Float cursor over the row number for row 1.&nbsp; It should change to a <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; →&nbsp;&nbsp;right arrow</p>
<p>&nbsp; The right-click and select "Hide"</p>
<p>You can do the above in either order.</p>

 the 2 rows and paste it in the email body)</p>
<p>This is what I m using now but its copying/concatenating&nbsp;the cells values into the email body and I need it the original format as I would manually&nbsp;Select+Copy the 2 rows (probably that I"ll end up doing since I don't want VBA)</p>

                    Windows update continues to show the definition update KB2267602 even after installing it. This has been a constant problem since the first technical preview build. This still persist in the current build 9879 and also 9888 for reference. I know build
 9888 wasn't officially released but I wanted to see if the problem still existed.

<p>Just a suggestion, try running Update within Defender and see if it clears it.</p>
<p>If it doesn't, maybe just right click the update and hide it if it's just a definition update.</p>

            <p>OK here is what seems to be the answer. Defender is using the same KB2267602 for all its definition updates even though the def updates are different #'s.</p>
<p>I just opened "view installed Updates" and they are all listed as the same KB#.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a bug or ****.</p>
<p>Added info: I just checked on my Win 7 PC with Security Essentials and ALL the definition updates are the same KB#, so I guess it's ****.</p>

    <title>rich text content control within hidden text - once filled in is no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonjaboo  say:</h3>
<h2>            rich text content control within hidden text - once filled in is no longer hidden</h2>
                    <p>Word 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got various content controls (plain text, rich text, combo box) mapped via the XML Mapping Pane (using a custom XML part) to another location on page 2 that I want hidden - it's in the format that is needed later but is not user-friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I group the entire text + CCs and get the protection I need - the user can only add content to the CCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hide everything on the second page using 'hidden text' from the font formatting menu.</p>
<p><br />
However, when the user enters text into the rich text CCs, that text is no longer hidden - it appears directly below the end of the visible part of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating a character style with no specified font but as hidden text, and assigning this in Design Mode, CC properties 'Use a style to format text typed into the empty control' to the rich text controls on the hidden page. However, this style
 is applied only when text is entered directly into those CCs (not when they are populated automatically from the corresponding CCs on the first page), and when I do that - even though I don't want to, I was just checking it out - it changes the style in the
 first-page CCs too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes: </p>
<p>- rich text is necessary for these particular CCs (need access to Symbol font, italic, bold, superscript, etc.)</p>
<p>- I am not accidentally in Design Mode when testing the CCs and their behaviour</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know whether there is a way around this? Another way to hide a page or a section? I wanted to keep things pretty simple and avoid VBA macros because I will be deploying this to a varied audience, some of whom are restricted from using macros
 by their IT departments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to provide more detail if this is not clear!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Sonja</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Doug for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it's the same story as with the hidden character style:</p>
<p>1) the specified character style only applies if I use that CC (i.e. the one that's in the hidden section) to do the text entry</p>
<p>2) when I use the visible CC (with no specified character style) to do the text entry (which is naturally what I want to do), the style I specified for the other one (in the section I want hidden) doesn't get applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've played around some more and found that even when I use two different specified character styles, the style of the one that's used for text entry gets applied to the contents of all the other rtccs that are mapped to the same xml element. So it doesn't
 seem to matter what style is specified for the others, as it will be ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep thinking I'm missing something really simple, but it seems like the only way to hide the filled-in contents of mapped rich text CCs is to apply a hidden character style to the one used for text entry, and obviously that's not what I want to do. The
 other CCs I'm using stay hidden when populated from their mapped counterparts, and I'm having a hard time understanding why it's so difficult or maybe impossible to do the same for rich text.<br />

<p>Thanks for your reply Charles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't use the 15 built-in CCs appropriately, so I created a custom XML part and used the XML mapping pane in Word 2016 to map the content control. I then copied that CC and pasted it (using Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) to another part of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the thus-mapped CCs talk beautifully to each other, and for all except the rich text CCs, they behave just as I want.</p>

<p>The second page will be unhidden later and used in-house for processing. You could think of it as the electronic analogue to the 'for office use only' section of a paper form, except it's much more distracting to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may indeed contact Greg Maxey, thanks for suggesting it. I may also just write some code to copy those entries during the later processing. Though not ideal, I may need to do this anyway if any of my users are working with older versions of Word where
 the rich text CC mapping disappears because of compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for having given this some thought - I appreciate the time you've spent.</p>

            That is pretty hard to do with a single formula. Your best bet is to build a table of the values that you want for each letter. Then use a formula to separate the word into single characters per cell (look at the MID function). then do a look up of the
 cell into the table you created (look at the VLOOKUP function). And, finally sum the total.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool v2.2 won&#39;t install on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool v2.2 won&#39;t install on Win7</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install this tool on a Win7 machine.&nbsp; I have Office Professional Plus 2010.&nbsp; (It should be noted that I had no trouble installing this on a Win10 machine with the same Office software.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the installer, after a couple of seconds, I get the following dialog box: "Could not open key: HKEY_CURRENT_USERS32\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.&nbsp; Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your support personnel."&nbsp;
 When I click the OK button, a microsecond later, this dialog box comes up: "Could not open key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\Folders.&nbsp; Verify that you have sufficient access to that key, or contact your support personnel."&nbsp;
 I then click the OK button 12 times (very repeatable) and the dialog box closes, and there is a message that the setup ended "prematurely" and that nothing was installed, and to click the FINISH button.&nbsp; At that point the installer box closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being a total nub, I have looked and neither of the named keys exist in my registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any info on this problem "out there".&nbsp; Microsoft's 1st tier (and mostly useless) tech support people (off-shore) haven't been able to help me with this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can tell me how to fix this problem, that would be great.&nbsp; If there is a way to contact ON-SHORE (at least 2nd tier) tech support via email or phone, to get the problem rectified, that would be just as good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>

<li>Are you installing&nbsp;Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool v2.2 on a computer provided by the company?</li><li>Is the .NET Framework 4.5.2 installed on your computer?</li></ul>

<p>Ryan:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously?&nbsp; You mean that you can't figure things out from what I wrote initially and then responded to Winnie Liang?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"the company"?&nbsp; What do you mean by that?&nbsp; If you mean is my computer in some kind of controlled network environment that you might find in a company where there is a Net Admin who controls all of the machines on said network, then I suggest you re-read
 what I have already written.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But in case for some reason that you can't, let me be clear:&nbsp; THIS IS A STAND-ALONE single PC, running Win7.&nbsp; It has 12GB of RAM.&nbsp; Updates, as necessary are all installed.&nbsp; I am THE ADMIN for this computer.&nbsp; .NET Framework, v4.6.1 is installed.&nbsp; .NET framework
 was installed long before the attempt to install the MS Office Configuration Analyzer v2.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I am a reasonably knowledgeable PC user.&nbsp; I've been using Windows since 3.1 and DOS for 6 or 8 years before that.</p>

<p>Hi, the reason for asking if you installed .NET framework 4.5.2 is because it is compatible with Office Configuration Analyzer v2.2, it doesn't mean that if you install the latest .NET framework is will work right away the analyzer, it may not work on latest
 version of .net framework.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ryan, definitely don't know what computer you are using that is why you are being asked. I just hope someone will have an answer to your question.</p>

            Unless I am mistaken the directions to install the Tool say that one needs <strong>
<em>at minimum</em></strong> .NET Framework version 4.5.&nbsp; I'm at 4.6.1.&nbsp; To me that means the version I have of the .NET Framework should work and it shouldn't be an issue here.&nbsp; Besides there is no error message telling me I have the wrong .NET framework installed.&nbsp;
 IF that were the case, one must assume that the installer would tell me that.......

                    <p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I recently purchased a new computer (64 bit) with Windows 7 Home Premium installed.<span>&nbsp;</span>I used PC mover to migrate everything off of my old computer running XP with Service Pack 3.<span>&nbsp;</span>I

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I did not purchase an office suite for the new machine hoping that my office suite would either transfer via PC mover or I could purchase the software for the new machine via HUP but that wasn’t permitted.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>I went ahead and purchased a copy of Microsoft Office 2010 Professional because I wanted to have Outlook.<span>&nbsp;</span>Everything loads fine except Outlook where the following occurs:</span></p>

    <title>Access pie chart for labor, materials, and profit. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawndurfee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access pie chart for labor, materials, and profit.</h2>
                    <p>I am very new to Access, so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a database to track my job by job profits (among other things).&nbsp; I'm trying to setup a report (dashboard) to view an individual job compared to the historical averages of all jobs.&nbsp; I'm trying to generate a pie chart that compares 2 groups
 of data:&nbsp; 1) labor, materials, and profit and 2) department by department labor data (to see if a particular department had more labor than normal on a particular job).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the table I've setup has the Job Name as a key field, all of the other data points I need are additional fields within that same table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Job Name - Total Job Price - Total Labor Costs - Total Materials Costs - Total Profit - Department 1 Labor - Department 2 Labor - Department 3 Labor - etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st - I'm just beginning to understand normalizing data.&nbsp; None of the fields in this table are redundant enough that I think they should be in a separate table.&nbsp; Is this correct logic?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd - How do you generate a Pie Chart comparing multiple fields from this table?&nbsp; This seems so easy, but I wasted about 4 hours already trying to figure this out.&nbsp; I'm getting very frustrated at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the Pie Chart to generate off of a test table that is structured like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Job Name - Job Cost Category - $ Cost</p>
<p>Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labor Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $500</p>
<p>Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $800</p>
<p>Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1200</p>
<p>Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labor Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $750</p>
<p>Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $975</p>
<p>Smith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $1470</p>
<p>
</p><p>but my data isn't setup this way.&nbsp; Is there a way to transpose my data into this format?&nbsp; Or can I generate a Pie Chart off of my current table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another idea I had was - would this make more sense to export to Excel to have the dashboard there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry so many questions in one post - I'm just very confused on which way to go.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I would stop all work on the system and attempt to change the table structure to be normalized. There are lots of great resources on the web on what this should look like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time to get your charts (I much prefer vertical bar charts to pie charts) you can use a normalizing union query to transpose your data:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Select [Job Name], "Total Job Price" as CostType, [Total Job Price] as Amount<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Total Labor Costs", [Total Labor Costs]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Total Materials Costs", [Total Materials Costs]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Total Profit", [Total Profit]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Department 1 Labor", [Department 1 Labor]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Department 2 Labor", [Department 2 Labor]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
Select [Job Name], "Department 3 Labor", [Department 3 Labor]<br />
FROM YourUnnormalizedTable<br />
UNION ALL<br />
&nbsp;- etc -</p>

            <p>BTW: I would also suggest you don't store values that can be calculated "on the fly". I also use an autonumber for a primary key for all tables and never have spaces in object names. For instance my Job Name field would be JobName and Total Job Price would
 be TotalJobPrice. </p>

            <p>Duane,</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice.&nbsp; Do you have any recommendations as to where to start on the research for the normalization?&nbsp; This is ok - my gut feeling was that something was hinky in my table structure, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was.&nbsp; Still not sure
 I understand fully, but I'm willing to research it and learn.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

                    I have a newly installed 2011 Office for Mac, installed and activated and while I was working on a document tonight, it tells me I can not edit as the document is locked for edit? &nbsp; This document is super important so I would appreciate any help you can
 offer.

            Unless the document is currently open by another application or another user, it is an error. The lock condition exists, but no one actually owns it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>First try to make a safety copy of your document:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Finder, select the file and type <i>Command D</i>&nbsp;(for "Duplicate").</li><li>If you somehow have it open in Word, try to do a Save As under another name.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Then just restart your computer and the lock condition should clear itself.</div>

<p>File locking is a feature of Mac OS and Windows. We need to know more about what's going on with your file system to help you.</p>

            Although file locking is a feature of both Mac OS and Windows file systems, this problem is unrelated.
<div><br />
<div>In this case, some fields in the Word document cannot be modified or removed, and Word exclaims that the reasons is that "the file is locked for editing". &nbsp;However, the file system has not locked the file, and the file can otherwise be modified, saved,
 duplicated by Word.

            It seems that sections of your document have been protected from edits.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Click the&nbsp;&nbsp;show/hide paragraph marks button in your toolbar to display paragraph marks and section breaks. Click into the section that is locked and then go to the Tools menu and choose Protect Document. You may need to know the password that
 was used to unlock the section.</div>

<p>Hi MacTop,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When we record a slide show in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac, we can use pointer via Ctrl + click. In this way, we are able to access the recording commands that let us navigate through the slides, change cursors, or trigger screen
 blackouts or whiteouts.

    <title>Excel Making Duplicate Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ginny402  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Making Duplicate Files</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2013 Excel on OneDrive with Windows 7.&nbsp; I got help in creating a finance budget spreadsheet which I have been using since this past January.&nbsp; About a month ago I noticed that after I saved the latest entries, a new Excel spreadsheet would
 show up in OneDrive.&nbsp; The original would be Budget Spreadsheet.xlsx and the duplicate would be Budget Spreadsheet-Ginny-HP-4.xlsx.&nbsp; Each time I put in a new entry and save it, yet another duplicate will be made.&nbsp; It looks to me that I could have an uncountable
 number of duplicates if I didn't delete them.&nbsp; Knowing that having a backup is not a bad idea, I typically keep the duplicate that has the latest entry.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are these:</p>
<p>1,&nbsp; How/why did this start happening?&nbsp; I have used this spreadsheet since January, and only in May did the duplicates start to occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Options with tools for making backups, but I never touched them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How can I control the backups so that I don't have an additional duplicate each time I save anything on the "master"?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The duplicates are saved on OneDrive, along with the master spreadsheet.&nbsp; Is this a good idea, or would it be better to store it in a different directory?&nbsp; If so, how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure I will have more questions!&nbsp; Thanks for help and guidance!!</p>

            <p>The link you provided above leads to two more links, both of which tell me that my access is denied.&nbsp; So that didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your questions, I have really only noticed with my spreadsheet which I access by clicking on it in the OneDrive file.&nbsp; I have not been very active on other files, but have not noticed it.&nbsp; Will have to check to see if it happens in Word, as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Early on with OneDrive I tried moving files into it.&nbsp; Somehow I now have everything mixed up, Word files in my pictures and vice versa.&nbsp; But that is another problem that I am not able to deal with right now.&nbsp; Want to get my Excel spreadsheet sorted out first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>.....a bit later....</p>
<p>Just made a change to another Excel document on OneDrive and a Word document on OneDrive.&nbsp; Neither of them duplicated themselves.&nbsp; I now am thoroughly confused!</p>
<p>
</p><p>...later still...</p>
<p>Just checked the Options Save settings, and they are the same on all the documents I cited above.&nbsp; Yet the budget spreadsheet is the only one that duplicates itself.</p>

 that I try what you suggest above?&nbsp; While I have used a computer for a long time, I am primarily a "typist", not really that computer savvy.&nbsp; I am a little afraid of deleting something that I need so badly for fear that I will mess up!&nbsp; Thanks for your patience!

<br />Correct. The limit is 7 days, from the selected date. It cannot be increased. Sorry. 
<br />
<br />If you need to see a future date, select it and you'll see the events on that date + 6 days in the future.

<p>
</p><p>OK, but some weeks I have only 4 or so appointments and the right side Calendar is only 1/2 full -- completely blank in the bottom half.&nbsp; It would be nice to fill in the blank spaces so users can view a few more days without having to do an extra mouse click,
 and then remember to click back to see events of this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Prior to updating to latest Windows 10 1903, I used an addin called Outlook2013Addin at<br />
<a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=outlook2013addin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=outlook2013addin</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, it stopped working after the latest update, so I am now confined to the Microsoft Calendar.&nbsp; I just think a few minor improvements in it by Microsoft would make it a lot better product!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example.&nbsp; Looked at the wasted space:<br />
