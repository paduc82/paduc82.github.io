            Hi NJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  NjBunton
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturer's website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

    <title>Administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strikingzulu845  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administrator account</h2>
                    <p>My Mom's laptop used a password (I'm assuming its a local administrator account since the screen showed her name and asked for a password) to login upon startup.&nbsp; I was trying to use the virus scan when I decided to sign in to my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; The
 computer stopped asking for her password and made me an administrator.&nbsp; I went online to find a way to detach myself from her laptop and found a video showing me how to delete my administrator capabilities.&nbsp; Now the computer won't allow me to add an administrator.&nbsp;
 How do I change this so my name no longer appears?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that once the Microsoft account is attached, there is no way to go back to using a local administrator.&nbsp; Is there a way around this?&nbsp; Will a factory reboot fix the problem or is there an easier way to fix this problem?</p>

            Hey, I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The way to change the Local Admin account which converted to your MS account when you signed into it, is to go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info and click the link to Sign in with a Local Account.   This will change it back and you can change the name if you need to here:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-account-username-in-windows-10-when-signed-in-using-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-account-us...</a>
<br />
<br />If this option is no longer available because of changes you said you also made, then go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People to create a new Local Admin Account in your Mom's name here: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>, sign into it, move her files over, and set it up so she likes it, then when ready go back to that location to delete your account if you want.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This is a reply to both Samuel and Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After writing my question on January 24th, I went back into the computer and somehow ended up taking myself off as an administrator by unchecking a box in some window I came across.&nbsp; If I try the Run command and type "Netplwiz", a window pops up which normally
 asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" and there would be two choices, "Yes" or "No".&nbsp; But since I made the choice to take myself off as an "administrator" the only option available is "No".</p>

<h3> matthewdonohue  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 printer error&#58; Driver is Unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When installing a network printer via the settings app- "printers and scanners" I am get an error saying the "driver is unavailable"</p>
<p>However, when I install the same printer by typing in the share path using "devices and printers" in the control panel the printer installs with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the point and print GPO setup still have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason this matters is because we want users to be able to install the printers on the go and we are trying to avoid desk calls.</p>
<p>Using a gpo to install all printers is not an option, we want the user to be able to install printers when they travel to different sites and there are too many to install all of them on each machine.</p>
<p>thanks for any responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe this is a signed driver issue because the driver installs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there is a fix for this issue with out a workaround or 3rd party software.</p>

            Hi Ministry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How do you know it's in Hibernation mode?  When Windows Hibernates it actually powers off after writing the contents of RAM to a Hiberfile, then when you power up it loads the Hiberfile to place everything back where it was.  
<br />
<br />Sleep mode keeps RAM powered and should respond to mouse or Enter key, at least power button.  
<br />
<br />Will Windows start at all?  If not Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Computer Won&#39;t Auto Change the Playback Device When Headphones Plugged In&#47;Out</h2>
                    <p>I may have messed this up myself way back when I was trying to get a headset with a built in Microphone to work with a game, but now I can't seem to get my computer to recognize and auto change the audio playback device from my TV speakers to my Headphones.
 The only method that works is going into the Playback devices list and manually set one or the other to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both devices Enabled, and I have the check box in the Realtek Audio Manager labeled "mute rear input when front headphones plugged in" marked as true, but it continues to stay on one device no matter what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is what my playback device list looks like.</p>
<p>Speakers = Front Heaphones jack</p>
<p>E32h-C1-4 = the HDMI cable going from Comp to the TV</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what the other three HDMI ports mean, since my computer case only has one other HDMI port and I go no output whatsoever through that one.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific to only Headphones/ Does External Speaker play when plugged in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try resetting the default device as shown in the steps given below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Plug in the Headphones in the machine.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to&nbsp;Start and Control Panel.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select&nbsp;'Hardware and Sound'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click 'Change system sounds'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click 'Playback' tab. (It should then show you your headphones in the list).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select your proper Headphone device from the list, then Click 'Set Default'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now unplug your Headphones and select speakers from the list, then Click 'Set Default'.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope it helps. Please reply for further queries on this.</p>

            The "Speakers" device is actually the front Headphones jack. My Headphones don't show up as it's own device in the list when they're plugged in. Nonetheless I tried your suggestion by plugging the Headphones in with the front jack as default, then I unplugged
 them, set the TV as default, and when plugging the headphones back in, it didn't recognize and stayed set to the TV. I have change it manually.

<h2>            solitaire missing from hard drive</h2>
                    The solitaire game is nonexistent on my Windows Home Premium Machine. The Windows on/off feature does not restore the game! I have replaced gameux.dll but the game still does not exist on my machine! Somehow at some point in time, long ago, the file was
 destroyed accidently! I do not have a win 7 CD, the software came bundled with my PC. Everyone, including MS wants money to restore my game!!!! All I need to know is: What files do I need to restore the game and where do I find them to download!!!??? And maybe
 a little advice as to how to restore the files other than just dropping them into a folder! This has been the worst experience of my life! MS is worth billions and yet you still want money from a guy on a fixed income! What ever happened to human charity!?
 Cam, will someone take the time to help out a poor slob with a little advice and direction!? I can do this myself, if I have the files and am told how to install them! I can hack the registry, if I need to, I have done so many ti

<p>You will probably have to re-install the system. It's not just that you have found Solitare to be missing, there might be other problems that have not yet become apparent.</p>

<p>I am not a computer geek but I do know my way around a computer better than the average user.&nbsp; I used to build computers for a living, long time ago.&nbsp; I can hack the registry.&nbsp; I can register files.&nbsp; I can even take files from another system and replace
 them on mine, if that would help and if I knew what files to replace!&nbsp; Can you tell me what file(s) the solitaire game is made up of and where they are?&nbsp; I can un-hide hidden files as well as system files.&nbsp; I can change permissons on files so I can rename
 or replace them!&nbsp; I can also follow instructions!&nbsp; If I have to I can replace sections of the registry!&nbsp; I absolutely do not want to replace the OS with a restore disk!&nbsp; Any backups I may have will also destroy lots of data.</p>

<p>There is one thing that I am confused about and that are "back ups".&nbsp; What's the difference, that is what happens, when I "back up" my files as opposed to making an entire mirror of the HDD?&nbsp; Does win 7 have a program to mirror the drive so that I can restore

<p>Back up your user files first. Make sure you have a way to re-install any applications you added to the factory-supplied configuration.</p>

<h2>            No Additional Clickpad Settings or Access to Chiral Scrolling</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using and HP Probook 450 G4 with a Synaptics SMBus Clickpad. The driver version is&nbsp;19.3.8.27 which is the latest one available. My problem is I have no access to additional settings provided by Synaptics (as shown in picture below) which could be accessed
 by using the Additional settings option in Settings &gt; Devices &gt;Touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what is usually available:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5589c87c-be11-4a46-9f9f-cace29195dc1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5589c87c-be11-4a46-9f9f-cace29195dc1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot from my machine:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c633b0a9-6ec0-4179-a12e-a526a6d94b1e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c633b0a9-6ec0-4179-a12e-a526a6d94b1e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, I have no access to feature such one finger scrolling (chiral scrolling) and am stuck with using two finger scroll which is offered by windows 1 as default. Please help me resolve this as I find it extremely inconvenient to use the two finger
 scroll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: This is what chiral scrolling options offered by Synaptics</p>

<p>Hi Anubhav,<br />
<br />
<br />
The screenshot you provided does tell us that the ClickPad settings are something provided by the Synaptics drivers. You can follow the resolution provided in this

<p>Hi Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided was useful and advises me to use an older version of the driver. (The other answers simply ask me to do 4 hours worth of useless troubleshooting) However, this link to that old version of the driver is dead and I am unable to find it
 (since the exact version is not mentioned). </p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result is that I now have a possible solution but no way to implement it. My problem is still unresolved!</p>

<p>You can check if you can find the roll back the update for your driver. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows + R</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on the desktop screen.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and hit enter.</li><li>Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select properties.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab and click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>RollBack driver</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If that option does not work, you may need to get in touch with your hardware manufacturer or Synaptics for the correct driver you need.</p>

    <title>Missing&#47;Corrupt Hardware Info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dioxyde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing&#47;Corrupt Hardware Info</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, I have a desktop computer that I built that worked perfectly for about a year. I had a virus infection that occured about 6 months ago and while I don't remember exactly which it was or what happened, (i had to reformat to remove the virus),
 the virus did cause some corruption of hardware info in regards to my motherboard. Basically any kind of system info program will show the following:
<br />
System Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
System Model&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be filled by O.E.M.<br />
System Type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x64-based PC<br />
System SKU&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be filled by O.E.M.<br />
<br />
Butg the information IS correctly displayed when booting into bios setup. The reason why this is an issue is that the drivers that are auto-installed are from 2006 it seems and operate very poorly with my hardware. I've listed some examples of the drivers below
 but there are probably 8-10 drivers that are like this. <br />

sfc /scannow<br />
device manager<br />
manually installing AMD chipset drivers (wont install and wont recognize that any drivers are needed)<br />
updated to most recent bios and reflashed again, no help<br />
used all of gigabytes optional software to attempt to get them to recognize<br />
refresh pc<br />
reset pc<br />
clean install<br />
attempted windows 8.1 and windows 10 clean installs and problem persists across both.
<br />
ran all antivirus software including the extra ones on microfsofts security website, including saFteyscan.
<br />
Ran all of the above in safemode <br />
tried both the drivers listed on gigabytes site and also the ones off AMD's site <br />
<br />
I would just write it off as a fried computer and just get a new motherboard but the bios displays the correct information..which leads me to think that there is something that can be changed/configured in windows to update the info. any help/advice would be
 greatly appreciated. <br />

            Hi Sky.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This PC shows your drives attached to the PC, not the Computer Name.  You can change a drive name like C by right clicking on it to choose Rename.  
<br />
<br />I replied in your other thread that the official PC Name is reported at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  So check there if it has the name you want.
<br />
<br />If not follow this guide to change PC Name:  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-change-your-computers-name-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-change-your-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>1. Do you get any error message when you connect the camcorder to computer?</p>
<p>2. Did you try inserting the camcorder to other computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly. </p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Arlene Traver,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 stated “Completely redid the hard drive” Did you reinstall Windows by formatting the hard drive?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Looks like HpqSRmon</span><span><span> is an HP application that may be causing this issue, I would suggest you
 to try the following steps: <br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode
 with networking and then test to see if the issue persists. To do this, follow the steps below</span></p>
<p><span>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the&nbsp;<strong>F8 key</strong> before
<span>Windows</span> starts. On the advanced boot options menu select&nbsp;</span><strong><span>safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Put the computer
 in clean boot and test</span></p>
<p><span>Follow&nbsp;<strong>Step 1
</strong>in the link below,</span></p>

<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.<br />
</span><strong><span><br />
Step 3</span></strong><span>: Check the event viewer logs for more information on the module that is failing to load.</span></p>

<p>Your son accidentally pressed a combination of keys. To correct it, hold down Ctrl and Alt and press one of the four arrow keys (up, down, left or right).</p>
<p>As the screen is completely upside down, hold down Ctrl and Alt and press the up arrow key.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may have a Rotation setting in the display properties of the graphics card. If all else fails, try restoring the system to an earlier date.</p>

<p>The ability to rotate the screen image is a feature of your video<br />
card, to help it work with monitors that rotate to portrait<br />
orientation. Almost certainly he accidentally pressed Ctrl-Alt, and<br />
some arrow key. <br />
Rotate it back using those keys. </p>

    <title>Cannot connect to home group computers after sleep mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poit57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to home group computers after sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>This problem started within the past few weeks. I have 3 computers in a home group all running Windows 8.1. My main productivity computer is having trouble accessing shared folders from&nbsp; one of my other computers (and only one as far as I can tell).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that I will start working on a file stored on that other computer. If I leave my computer for a time and it goes to sleep, I have trouble accessing that file to continue working upon my return. If I try to browse to the shared folder through
 File Explorer, I get the error code 0x80070035 with the message below. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2addfb2-c72e-46c1-bee3-eebfec823e98" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting the computer resolves the issue, but I shouldn't be required to reboot that often.&nbsp;These computers have been running for about 2 years and I've never experienced this issue until just recently. I have not experienced the issue in the connections
 between any of my other computers or even the reverse direction of the two computers in question. It is only my productivity computer connecting with&nbsp;"DVR" where I've seen the error message so far.</p>

<p>Hi Rantandeep, thanks for the reply. I tried option 2 and all was well, I then uninstalled AMD quick stream, still the same error. I then uninstalled AMD catalyst control centre and the error had gone. I would suggest that there is a compatibility issue
 with this program at the moment. I may run it in compatibility mode if I can be bothered but I think the windows 10 drivers are good enough for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
John.&nbsp;

            Lenovo now have updated drivers for Windows 10 so no problems now, although the blue tooth&nbsp;drivers are not compatible strangely. Maybe they will patch them. Thanks for your help again.

            Hi  Sankha,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then tight click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Adminsistrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />regsvr32 comctl32.ocx
<br />
<br />Check to see if your application will run . . .
<br />
<br />You may have to install VB6 on your PC as the version of controls you have called on your coding may not be compatible to the Windows 10 version of that OLE  Control Extension library

<p>Hi<br />
the same IP never possible in same network or network segment, what ever the network in simple or routed LAN or DHCP. you have nothing to do the last user never join his pc by using the another ip which already using &amp; actiev in same network.</p>
<p>you have to change/select different ip or contact network administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>- if this is a vertual network the same IP can be possible but remember that ip not act as active.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Backup App Has Problems That Need To Be Addressed</h2>
                    <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Well, I just checked the Backup Advanced Options after about four days since I last initiated it manually.&nbsp; I've set&nbsp;the Backup App&nbsp;for "Daily" and have tried other setting as well (e.g., "Hourly").
 &nbsp;&nbsp;I've attached a screen snip image showing that I've set daily backups, yet none have been performed for four days.&nbsp; Since that last backup, I've loaded 2-3 Gb in many locations.&nbsp; I've set the App to backup my entire hard drive (C:), and the other virtual
 drives, also (those are the default, the main drive is NOT).</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b12c2f51-4120-4a9e-bedd-a971581966d1" /></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The only way Backup seemingly starts is when I manually initiate it, and I usually have to do so 2-3 times before it actually "takes" the command.&nbsp; Another issue, I have had to include the main hard
 drive letter (C:) because Backup's default settings did NOT include it.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Seriously, how can newbies rely on this app when the default settings do not include the main hard drive, nor does&nbsp;the app&nbsp;work automatically?&nbsp; How many Windows 10 users believe they've got backups
 of their prized files when in fact they do not?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Will someone at MS please fix the Windows 10 Backup Application (that is, fix the multiple serious&nbsp;issues as I've stated immediately above)?&nbsp; Thank you in advance!</span></p>

            <p>With all due respect to our esteemed friends in Redmond ... why do you bother with Windows 10 backup when just about any third-party software has more features and is more reliable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, Microsoft is not in the backup software business. Like other Windows 10 utilities, the built-in backup provides basic capability for people who don't how or are too afraid to install software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For backing up folders there are a zillion great applications. For disk imaging there are also plenty of good choices, some of them free. Why fiddle with kludgy Windows utilities when you could be enjoying a soothing Pinot Grigio?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>BD20: Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; However, to ask some obvious questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1) How would anyone (like me, or any newbie) know that the new MS Windows-10 Backup App is not the best one to use, or that is should not even be used at all, per your question?&nbsp; I have many other interests, so I don't subscribe to &amp; read IT magazines,
 nor do most newbies.&nbsp; That is, this is all&nbsp;news to me, and should be to most non-IT users and newbies.&nbsp; We just want to get our work done as efficiently and as quickly as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we buy (invest money in) our PC's, or that's why the company we
 work for puts these PC's&nbsp;on our desks or our laps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put, we average users&nbsp;don't want to have to become IT experts just to be able to know what apps work well and what ones should be avoided (like the Win-10 B.U. App, apparently).&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;when the first IBM's came out 30-some years ago, I had
 to buy books on DOS and quickly &amp; thoroughly read them just to be able to use the new IBM PC's my company was putting in our labs.&nbsp; I was not a computer science&nbsp;major, yet I had to learn the basics of the new MS DOS which ran&nbsp;the IBM PC's at work, just to
 be able to make proper use of these new machines.&nbsp; I thought that the introduction of Windows 3.1 changed all that by making PC's effective &amp; easy-to-use tools&nbsp;for everybody, not just IT types.&nbsp; We should not have to go back to the way things were 35 years
 ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2) (rhetorical questions, mostly) If MS is not in the backup-software business, and they apparently cannot write a decent backup app, then why is the Backup App even included with Windows-10?&nbsp; I know you (BD20) likely don't know the answer to this, but
 it's the obvious question to ask based on your opinion of the Windows-10 Backup App.&nbsp; Consequently, why doesn't Microsoft just: (a)&nbsp;not include any B.U. app at all, or (b) spend a few bucks so they can add a decent second-party one, or (c) delay adding a B.U.
 App until Windows-10.1 arrives so they can add a decent backup app?&nbsp; I know that Microsoft probably has the Not Invented Here mentality of most huge corporations, which makes (b) highly unlikely.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>A computer is not a toaster; it takes some effort to get the most out of complicated technology.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree.&nbsp; Today, a&nbsp;computer MUST BE as appliance-like as possible for the majority of users.&nbsp; If PC technology is not to the point where a computer IS an appliance, then a whole lot of PC designers and software developers have completely failed at their
 jobs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the majority of users, a computer&nbsp;must be&nbsp;an intuitive&nbsp;and easy-to-use office tool, not unlike a fax machine, paper shredder, digital copier, elevator, thermostat, or coffee maker.&nbsp; Given how technology has taken over the corporate office of today, employees
 cannot be required to become experts at using these&nbsp;tools.&nbsp; They need to concentrate on their true jobs, not waste time trying to use their office machinery.&nbsp; All such office machines must&nbsp;be simple to use, with no exceptions, and especially not excepting
 the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a modern-day PC is not to the point of being an appliance, then we're going backwards, not forwards, with PC technology.&nbsp; We do not need to go back to the days before Windows&nbsp;et al when users could only use a computer if they knew how to write programs,
 be it with APL, Basic, Fortran, Cobol, DOS, or whatever languages were&nbsp;used by non-computer-science majors.&nbsp; Sure, there was some DOS-based software available, but you still had to know DOS well enough to properly use such software (e.g., to install the software,
 find files, make backup copies, troubleshot problems, and so forth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a technology parallel, a minivan or a basic midsize four-door sedan is the automotive equivalent of an appliance.&nbsp; Owners need&nbsp;these types of vehicles&nbsp;to do their job as simply as possible.&nbsp; The owner's learning curve must be nonexistent.&nbsp; Owners need
 to be able to operate such vehicles without even reading the owner's manual.&nbsp; Yes, owners&nbsp;must read the manual, say the corporate legal types,&nbsp;but they shouldn't have to.&nbsp; If you travel, and rent one of these vehicles, then you can't be searching for the wiper
 controls while trying to find your exit while driving on a thruway in a city you've never been in before on a dark, rainy evening.&nbsp; Your safety and the safety of others on the road require that such appliance-like vehicles be intuitive and easy to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, there are sports cars, and those vehicles take extra effort to operate.&nbsp; But, if you buy a sports car, you're expecting the ownership experience to require extra work.&nbsp; The same goes for the computer experts, IT types, and power users.&nbsp; They want more
 from their computers, and they don't mind putting extra effort into using such PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in time, the majority of office workers and average home users need their PC's to work as effortlessly as possible.&nbsp; They require&nbsp;the computer equivalent of a minivan or four-door sedan.&nbsp; Leave the sports car PC's&nbsp;to the IT types and power
 users.&nbsp; It can't be any more simple than that... 'nuff said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for your reply.&nbsp; And to others I say: thank you for reading my posts.</p>
