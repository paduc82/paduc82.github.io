            Hello,
<br />
<br />with the O365 Exchange services you get a default domain (onmicrosoft.com). You cannot remove it but you can change you reply emails address.
<br />A. You have to add your own custom domain to O365: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-email-address-to-use-your-custom-domain-f4d8cae9-6d06-4c4b-b4e5-6581fd05ea82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change...</a>
<br />B. You have to change your reply address in the Exchange admin center: 
<br />1/ Log in Office 365 Portal and go to the Admin page.
<br />2/ Click Users
<br />3/ Select the user and click Edit.
<br />4/ Click Details
<br />5/ Click the dropdown list of domains beside user name and choose your own domain and click Save.
<br />
<br />Please bare in mind that OWA is an online mailing platform for your Exchange online account. Emails from other (non-microsoft domains) cannot be send from there.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Manuela

<h2>            How to close all of Edge&#39;s WINDOWS &#40;and tabs&#41; so they can all be reopened with &#34;Open with previous pages&#34; setting.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Firefox and Chrome, I have the ability to exit the browser and all of my windows are closed.&nbsp; In settings I have it set up to start up using the previous windows/tabs.&nbsp; When I start up again, all of the windows and tabs that I had before are restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is VERY useful to me for times when I want to temporarily stop the browser, but I want to get it back to where it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I need to reboot to make something work right again (possibly unrelated to the browser), sometimes I want to watch a movie and want to free up memory and CPU usage so the movie doesn't have jitter issues.&nbsp; I often keep many windows open and have
 many tabs in each of my windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see how to do this in Edge.&nbsp; I have the option in the Setting for "Open with" set to "previous pages".&nbsp; So, if I only have one window with multiple tabs, and I close it, when I start Edge back up, it does open all of the tabs.&nbsp; But, if I have two
 windows, I can't exit Edge (gracefully) and have it restore multiple windows (with the tabs for each window also restored).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ugly work around that sometimes works where I can kill the "parent" PID for Edge, and all of the windows/tabs go away.&nbsp; And, I've had it restore multiple windows.&nbsp; But, I have to guess the right PID.&nbsp; And, I even then, it sometimes doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to exist Edge without manually having to close each individual window so that when I open Edge again it will restore all of my windows/tabs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>sjmyst</p>

            <p>E.Gray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope when you say "Pinned Tabs" that doesn't mean that Edge will have to be "Pinned" on the taskbar for functionality like this to be supported.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't like the concept of mixing "Pinned" tab with "Live" (unpinned) tabs on the taskbar.&nbsp; I actually think Microsoft got it right with the Quick Start menu.&nbsp; Not sure why they thought that was something that shouldn't be enabled by default.&nbsp; I
 re-enable it and those are my "pinned" things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, maybe by "Pinned Tabs" you mean I have to mark tabs as "Pinned", meaning they should stay around between starts of Edge.&nbsp; If so, I'm not sure how that helps if I have to close each window to get out of Edge unless Edge will remember to open up those
 "pinned" tabs in separate windows even if they had to be closed to get out of Edge.&nbsp; If this is what is meant, I don't like that as a solution either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like a simple function to allow all windows of Edge to be closed with one menu choice.&nbsp; Firefox, Chrome and Opera all do it on both Windows and MAC.&nbsp; I know they don't want to copy function just to copy them.&nbsp; But, for me, some things just need
 to be copied (like CTRL-N, or CTRL-T).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm probably not a "normal" user since I typically have 50+ windows (each with between 1 and 15 tabs) open most of the time.&nbsp; But, if anyone opens even 3 or 4 windows, and needs to close them to exit Edge, it's painfully obvious that this function
 is needed (even if you don't want to open them all up again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>sjmyst</p>

            <p>Yeah, it is a poor choice for naming that feature (since there lots of other things called "pinned")</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the context of Edge, a "pinned tab" means that when you open Edge, it will remember all of the tabs that were open (and pinned) and automatically load those tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These pinned tabs appear on the left of the "first tab" location... so you can easily distinguish between a normal tab that you have open and a "pinned" tab that will always be open.</p>

            Hello JugalParikh,<br />
<br />
Thanks for visiting the Answers forum.<br />
<br />
In order to update SkyDrive, sign into the app, go into Settings, and tap Refresh. This will initiate an update of the files on the client side view. You may also want to go into the Phone's settings, and tap and hold the primary account on the device and ensure
 that it Syncs.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Office 2016 passing wrong credentials while opening and editing a SharePoint 2013 document in office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Environment Details-</p>
<ul>
<li>SharePoint 2013 onpremise</li><li>Office 2016 (365 Pro Plus)</li><li>Shared Machine :&nbsp;Windows 2007 Professional</li><li>Integrated windows Authentication enabled</li></ul>
<p>Issue Description : </p>
<ul>
<li>User "A" logged in to Shared Machine and then open web browser and browse SharePoint 2013 site</li><li>User "A" then sign in as a different user ("B") in SharePoint 2013 site to access it (sign in as different user is enable on SharePoint 2013 site)</li><li>Now, I can see in welcome control of SharePoint 2013 site that User "B" is logged in to SharePoint site and can browse all the content</li><li>User "B" opens the word document to edit - in browser He can edit and save and his name is appearing properly in modified by field</li><li>User "B" opens the same document in office 2016 word&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Word first asks to login to SharePoint site - User B provided his credentials</li><li>Word opens the document and allow user "B" to edit</li></ul>
</li><li>User "B" saves the document and gets saved in SharePoint site</li><li><span style="color: rgba(161, 29, 122, 1)">User "B" checks the modified by column of the document library - &gt; User "A" name is coming there
</span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">(this is the issue)</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Why it is taking credential of user who is logged in to machine and why it is not taking the credential of user who is accessing the SharePoint site and opening the document ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help : Registry settings ? IE Settings? , Machine level Settings or this is by design ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks Jerry</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this issue is purely related to office 2016 (it is passing the wrong user name)&nbsp;and here SharePoint on-premises is merely used as&nbsp;a repository.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for suggestion and redirecting to appropriate forum.</p>

    <title>Emails from my friends &#38; family are automatically placed into the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christmas morning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails from my friends &#38; family are automatically placed into the deleted box</h2>
                    <p>I have had hotmail for years and in the last few weeks have experienced a problem with some emails going directly into the deleted box.&nbsp; When I send some emails to one or multiple people and they reply to me their reply goes immediately into the deleted
 box.&nbsp; I had first learned this was happening when my sister told me she had, indeed, replied to several emails I had sent her.&nbsp; I couldn't find her replies because, of course, they weren't in my inbox and also not in my junk box.&nbsp; It never occurred to me that
 it would be in the deleted box.&nbsp; I have tried CCing myself on these emails and I don't receive my own CC into my inbox, it goes right to deleted.&nbsp; Over the years I have had 3 occassions (that I recall) where acquaintances have told me they had replied to my
 emails and I just thought they were bending the truth and had not replied to me.&nbsp; But, now I am thinking this has been an intermittent problem with some glitch for quite some time.&nbsp; I have been told it may be a filter issue.&nbsp; So I tried to fix it by seeing
 what filters I have in place.&nbsp; I went to the settings button in the top right hand corner and got to the page about filters.&nbsp; With hotmail you don't actually have a lot of customization of filters, I learned.&nbsp; There are only 3 choices you have regarding filters
 and all of my choices appear pretty standard.&nbsp; I have checked other things, like my "rules" box and none of my rules should be causing these emails to go to delete.&nbsp; Further, I haven't changed my rules or filters and this problem with my sisters' email addresses
 has only recently started.&nbsp; One thing I am wondering:&nbsp; a couple of weeks ago I received junk mail from myself.&nbsp; So, believing I had been hacked, I changed my password.&nbsp; No one has told me that they received spam from me, so I'm not sure who, if anyone, got
 anything from me that was junk, but I know I did.&nbsp; Could the hack have screwed up my safe contacts or filters?&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to get my contacts' emails to go into my inbox?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            Am having the same problem to emails are going to the DELETED BOX, by passing the junk box, why is this, ? at least when emails go into the Junk box it lets you know something is there, but when they go straight to the deleted box it doesnt give any indication
 that there is any thing in it, and its only if you look there you find your missing emails, Ive checked and double check my safe &amp; blocked list and the rules for sorting new messages, and everything is how it has always been, emails that i use to receive in
 my inbox are now going straight to delete .........how can this be sorted ??

</p><p>I understand that some of your emails are automatically deleted. We're here to check this for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails can automatically be deleted or go to your Deleted if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have set up Sweep. This can delete old emails from certain sender. You can check this article from more information:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/clean-inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clutter-free inbox</a></li><li>You're accessing your account in a mail client or application in a mobile device and is connect via POP protocol. If your mail client or application was set to delete messages from the server after being downloaded emails will be deleted but if your Outlook.com
 account was set to save them, it will be moved to a special POP folder instead.</li><li>You're account was hacked. If this is the case, change your password right away and secure your account. This article contains useful information which can help you keep your account secure:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My account has been hacked</a></li></ul>

<h2>            Messages not in outbox when not deliverable but move directly to Sent Items - Outlook 365 for Mac &#40;2016&#41; Version 15.9 &#40;150408&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I travel a lot an the wifi connection sometimes drop and for large periods, having no connection at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sending messages that cannot be sent, previously stayed at the outbox and where able to sent once connections are available.</p>
<p>With the newest version of Outlook, when no connections can be made, it isn't just stored in the outbox but moves directly to sent-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a couple of gmail accounts which normally show duplicate mails but now only show one item (the one outlook copied to the sent-mails even when no connection was made).</p>
<p>I have a lot of customers now, who did not receive any mail and I need to send mail again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot rely on this anymore and would really like to have it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>

</p><p>The Exchange error message and details are:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Same issue here, this is very worrying as I have no idea whether the email is acutally being sent or not. I have found multiple post on the forum and no one seems to have a solution yet or even a temp solution. This is not only applied to gmail account but
 also other non exchange email account. Can someone from MS to give us an answer and a solution even it is a temp one.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Another issue I found today was that even you have constant internet connection, but when you send email with large size attachment, if for any reason the smtp server timed out or drop out connection, the email will go missing / lost forever with no trace
 at all!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or another scenario will be when you are still sending the email (which by the way you have no way to know the progress, again this is very frustrating) and you closed your macbook to go, the email sending is interrupted then the email is gone missing again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, this bug exists since the very first release the public preview all the way the most recent 15.10</p>
<p>
</p><p>It MUST be outlook's bug and MICROSOFT's MAC OFFICE TEAM PLEASE MS FIX IT SOON FOR US!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need an visible outbox (when there is no connection), we need to a status bar to show to the progress of the sending (real sending), and fix the internal email sending issue on SMTP server and making sure the email will actually be sent out of the app
 or stays in the outbox with an error message to remind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this ^^</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got another rather ridiculous issue. If you switch Outlook 2016 offline and write mails from two different email accounts they are first queued in the outbox which is fine. But if you switch Outlook online again with an active wlan connection, Outlook only
 sends out the mails for one account properly while all mails from the other account are not send out at all but automatically moved to sent-mail without any error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is even more annoying as switching Outlook offline is the only solution Microsofts' phone support offered before they let me know they couldn't help me any further.</p>

                    <p>Dear all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with a view of folders in my Outlook 365 Business. Two folders "Outbox" and "Deleted Items" are overlapping in the list of folders on the left side and I cannot separate them easily. Only after a complete computer reboot I could see non
 overlapping items. But not for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help here?</p>

<h2>            How to pick random values from a column without repeating&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bunch of values in a column, say, AB, AC, AD, BB, BC, BD, CB, CC, CD, and I want to show, say, 3 of them randomly in another column, e.g. 1- AB, BB, CD; 2- AB, CB, CC; 3- AC, BD, CC, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no repeating is the case, it is easy to use RANDBETWEEN command, but when I need to use values without repeating, it gets complicated. Any solution?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Seeing Windows Update issues on Fast and Slow rings this morning. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Seeing Windows Update issues on Fast and Slow rings this morning.  Failure to connect to server error.  Also Error Code 0x800b0100 which comes and goes.</h2>
                    I got a "file not signed" error on three Insider devices a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Re-starts or another fiddling around got rid of the messages but WU takes several minutes (as much as 10) of searching before giving the up-to-date status message.&nbsp; Anyone else
 seeing quirkiness with WU on Insider devices today?&nbsp; Release devices are behaving normally and promptly.&nbsp; There does seem to be a distinct difference between the release channel and the Insider channel.

<p>Hi Colin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is fine on this side of the pond, but I have noticed that 'Checking-for-update' times vary quite a bit. My guess is that it is caused by new bits being put on your local upgrade server.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT] The issue seems to have resolved itself as it is working again (no action on my part).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>LOL again. Too late, already tried it: The result below. I did get a rather curious Windows Defender SC warning this morning saying that the location of 'temporary Internet files' was no longer on it's default value. Why, I haven't a clue. Anyway, it offered
 to repair and apparently did as the warning is now gone. I just wonder if the two are related somehow. Did you happen to see the same? And is your update working again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW My SP3 sitting just beside the troubled machine (and on the same LAN) is working just fine.</p>

<p>I am still getting missing file error on one Insider device and ten minutes of searching for updates on two others.&nbsp; Searching on release devices takes less than five seconds.&nbsp; Clearly, there is an issue in the Insider channel(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The media may make it sound like there are gun shops on every corner but it just not true.&nbsp; Remember it was the English Parliament that first established the right to bear arms in the NA colonies.&nbsp; A right we did not give up after the Revolutionary War.

<p>Both machines still ok. Checking every 10 minutes or so to see if I can catch the 'bug' travelling the world |--)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, happy to hear it (about the gun shops). But you can't but admit that it is a lot easier to buy guns in America. Much, much easier than just about anywhere in the world. Anywhere civilized, that is. As for British Parliament, well, they did repeal that
 right for their local population (surely?). So, maybe you should still be listening to them |--)? On second thought, the idiots did 'allow' a rather stupid poll not too long ago. My guess is that they will live to regret that. Still, freedom does imply the
 freedom to be stupid.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 cannot display the webpage</h2>
                    I have a brand new HP Pavilion, It registered and downloaded 2 updates on my wireless network, I restarted the computer after the updates. It will check the internet for driver updates and basically whenever it wants something from it. Internet explorer
 cannot. I have Windows7 Home Premium 64 bit. It claims it is connected and has excellent signal strength. My other computers say it's there and it was marked as friendly. Any ideas? My brother in law said buy Windows 7 professional and scrap it, seems a bit
 extreme.

    <title>Outlook 2013 Track Changes Bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dizzkat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Track Changes Bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2013- I&nbsp;get Track Changes in my email only when - a) I create a new email from a template b) I copy text from Word into the Body of the message c)&nbsp;I forward and email before sending it using CTRL+F when in the subject line</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create an Outlook template and save it to your desktop</p>
<p>2. Open Outlook Template</p>
<p>3. Copy Text from a Word Document into the body of the message</p>
<p>4. Go to the subject line and forward using CTRL+F</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text will appear in track changes mode, however when you right click on it, you can't accept the changes. If I copy text from Notepad, I am able to accept the changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want it to show up as Track Changes. But if it has to, I'd like to be able to accept it. Anyone know how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Tracking changes won't work in Outlook completely. However, you may use Word to forward the message using send to mail recipients command.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar and add send to email recipients to quick access toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>To better understand the issue, kindly post the screenshot describing the issue.</div>

<h2>            Vista doesn&#39;t recognise my pocket pc</h2>
                    Hi There,<br />
<br />
Vista doesn't recognise my HTC Touch Dual when I connect it via the USB cable.<br />
<br />
I have unchecked the "Enable advanced network functionality" checkbox.<br />
<br />
I have done various hard resets<br />
<br />
If I add hardware under the control panel, it doesn't detect the HTC, but if I add the "Standard Mobile Device" manually, device manager doesn't recognise it and WMDC does not connect.<br />
<br />
I am able to sync to WMDC via bluetooth ?????<br />
<br />
Thanks for help

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Do you hear a connection sound when you connect the device? Have you tried other USB ports?
<div><br />
<div>After you connect the device, open Device Manager on your computer. Do you see your phone listed under Network Adapters and Portable device?</div>

<p>It does absolute nothing - no sounds</p>
<p>The USB port is working, but I've also tried other USB ports on my laptop.</p>
<p>It does not appear on the Device Manager, however if I add it manually using the "add new hardware function", HTC doesn't come up, but I add "Standard Windows based Mobile device".</p>
<p>Once I've done this, it doesn't recognise the driver and appears under the device manager as "other" with the question mark, meaning it doesn't work.</p>

I have now tried anything but no way!!<br />

Will have to check something with Microsoft - it must be Vista's problem, as WMDC works via bluetooth, but not via USB<br />
<br />
Strange, anyway, I'll keep trying<br />

            Have you tried another USB cable or connecting to another PC? I assume "Allow USB connections" is selected in WMDC Connections Settings.

                    I'm noticing a 20 minute delay for receiving e-mails once I open Outlook 2016 and click on send/receive. I have send/receive automatically every 5 minutes. I thought it might be the AOL server but when I opened my laptop the mail appeared quickly. I have
 an IMAP account with Windows 10.

    <title>Unable to use start button in Windows 10 Technical Preview Release - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mac&#35;22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to use start button in Windows 10 Technical Preview Release 9926 but could in previous release.</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Windows 10&nbsp;Technical Preview Release 9926. All appeared good but after joining the PC to a domain (2008 R2), only the local accounts can access the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have traced this issue to the server stored profile. If I remove the AD Profile path, I can then access the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue was not apparent in the previous Windows 10 Technical Preview release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue?</p>

            Change your language to English United states and region to United states. The Cortana will start working.

<h2>            Windows Update installs bad driver for NVidia GeForce 630</h2>
                    In Build 10158 Windows Update finds and installs a driver for NVidia GeForce 630 which does not work. The latest driver is not Windows 10 compatible. You have to roll back the driver to get it to work again.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today. 
<br />
<br />Is not working where? On the Office client when you sign in?
<br />
<br />If so, Try method 1 in this article to erase previous activation keys and try again.

            On Mac would be different.
<br />
<br />If you have a Mac and also are facing an activation issue try this.
<br />
<br />Reset Keychain.

<br />
<br />If the issue persists try reinstalling Office.
