<div><br />
<div>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting us for your concern. Let us help you on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you're not receiving emails on your newly created account. You mentioned you used the email information coming from your
 Internet Service Provider. Please be advised that since you've registered a non-Microsoft account in Outlook.com, you'd normally not receive emails except for Microsoft announcements and notifications. To start receiving emails intended for your actual email
 account, you have to set up your actual account as a Send and receive account in Outlook.com. You can refer to the link below on how this is done:</span></p>

    <title>Unable to view CNN and Fox News Videos in IE9, Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gjm_090312  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to view CNN and Fox News Videos in IE9, Win 7</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to view CNN and Fox News Videos in IE9,Win 7.</p>
<p>This occurred when I upgraded to ie9. I have reloaded, Flash, Silverlight and Java.</p>
<p>I tried removing IE9 to reload it, but the system hung with the message "windows is configuring ..." I was lucky in that manually shutting down the system (after 1/2 hour) and restarting in the "safe mode" allowed a full recovery back to IE9, but videos
 still don't work.</p>
<p>There is one aspect of all this that may be clue about what is wrong.</p>
<p>I have Firefox,Safari and Chrome also. Firefox and Safari will display CNN &amp; Fox videos correctly, but Chrome will not.</p>
<p>However, if I open Firefox first and then open IE9, the videos in IE9 all display properly. I can then close FireFox and the IE9 videos still work. If I close IE9 and then reopen it the videos don't work. Restarting Firefox again and then opening IE9 allows
 IE9 to display video correctly again.</p>
<p>The same process fixes the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>So it appears Firefox is making some kind of setting. -- But what?</p>

            <p>Hi<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/065412ed-5454-494f-aab9-657a562f0990"><span>Waseemulla Shariff</span></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span>and cranky27, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your responses. I tried enabling the add-ons and have updated the Safari, Firefox and Chrome. These actions didn’t fix the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I then tried the following and ultimately all IE9 and the other browser
</p>
<p>appear to functioning properly. Here’s what I did and the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down the internet connection by powering off the modem (I have DSL).
</li><li>Disabled all anti virus and firewalls (I use Norton)
</li><li>Removed IE9 and reverted back to IE8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time I was successful and IE8 came up on the reboot.
</li><li>Performed a registry scan/repair
</li><li>Tried to view the CNN videos in IE8 and had the same problem – i.e., I couldn’t view videos.
</li><li>Went to IE8 toolbar, and did tools&gt;internet options&gt; advanced&gt; Reset (internet explorer settings to their default state)<span>&nbsp;
</span>- HOORAY – everything worked in IE8
</li><li>Upgrade to IE9 – Everything worked in IE9
</li><li>Tested the Safari and Firefox browsers and they worked.
</li><li>Tested the Chrome browser and had sound but no picture for the video
</li><li>Downloaded the latest graphics driver and installed. HOORAY – Chrome works.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think everything may have been fixed with only steps 6 and 10, but I don’t know that for sure. Step 6 has warnings; I did it anyway because I was out of options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            emails from past six months have disappeared from Outlook</h2>
                    All emails between August 2015 and a few days ago have disappeared from Outlook. I can access emails as far back as 2011 but nothing for the past 6 months. Even emails from three weeks ago which I moved to the "Important" folder cannot be found. How can
 I recover them?

<div>
<font>I went into the Outlook 2013: Options&gt;Trust Support&gt; Trust Support Center&gt; Email Security and imported the Verisign certificate. I clicked on Trust Settings and can see the S/Mime settings for the email address I want to validate. I check the
 box for <b>"Add digital signature to outgoing messages"</b> under encrypted e-mail and close out the Trust Center</font></div>

<h2>            How do I unjoin&#47;remove myself from a Yammer community I joined by accident&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I unjoin/remove myself from a Yammer community I joined by accident?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the Yammer icon in one of the Office lists of features because I didn't know what yammer was - instead of getting any information, I was rudely autojoined into my company's unused empty wasteland of Yammer. I don't want this unnecessary service,
 I don't want to manage a membership to it, and I don't see a way to unjoin myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the story? It looks like I'm stuck here permanently unless my O365 account is deactivated, or our O365 admins deactivate Yammer for our entire orgainization? Is this something I can do myself, or should I be escalating this through our own IT department
 to ask them to better police the unwanted O365 services you're activating automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide</p>
                </div>

    <title>Problems after deleting &#34;Microsoft Office 2010 Click to Run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inara505  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems after deleting &#34;Microsoft Office 2010 Click to Run Latest&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, after clicking&nbsp;a <u>prompt</u> (during exiting what I was doing-sorry, I can't remember exactly.)&nbsp;to get an updated&nbsp;for
<strong>Microsoft Office Starter 2010</strong>, I could no longer open any files saved on my laptop. I called Microsoft Tech Support, but was told that it was the manufacturer of the laptop's issue. I thought it was strange but I called
<strong><em>Samsung</em></strong> anyway. And of course, I was told by a <strong>
<em>Samsung Tech Support </em></strong>just what I thought which was the problem came from downloading a
<strong>Microsoft </strong>product. I was then transferred back to <strong>Microsoft Tech Support</strong>. I was told I had to be transferred to
<strong>Volume Licensing </strong>(which didn't make sense to me at all). I spoke to
<em><strong>Cy</strong></em> who couldn't really help me and wanted to transferred me back to
<strong>Tech Suppot</strong> again. But when I told him how frustrated I was,&nbsp;he then tried to help me by telling me to
<strong>uninstall </strong>just the way it did a couple of times (That was why I called
<strong>Tech Support</strong> as a message saying so).&nbsp;We did remove only <strong>
Microsoft Word </strong>(only) a&nbsp;usual way from <strong>Control Panel</strong>. He couldn't help me
<strong>uninstall Microsoft Office Starter 2010 Click-2-Run </strong>and transferred me back to a
<strong>Tech Support</strong> which I was disconnected after being put on hold for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was about to give up,&nbsp;I googled and found "<strong><em>How to delete manually 'Microsoft Office 2010 Click to Run' (Protected) (Q)?"
</em></strong>Finally, I removed <strong>Microsoft Office 2010 Click To Run </strong>
(Updated Prompt I clicked when I already had <strong>Microsoft Office Starter 2010</strong> which came with the laptop) successfully by using
<strong>FixIt</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still couldn't double click to open any files as&nbsp;before clicking <strong>Microsoft Office 2010 Click To Run</strong> Updated. I have to right mouse click to open any files every single time by choosing how I want it to be open in.&nbsp;Anytime I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the
<strong>Start</strong> key, <strong>Microsoft&nbsp;Office Starter 2010</strong> is&nbsp;still there. But&nbsp;if I try to open it,&nbsp;I&nbsp;will get a message saying&nbsp;"<strong>Problem with Shortcut</strong>:"
<strong><em>The item "CVH.EXE'&nbsp;that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly. Do you want to delete this shortcut: "Yes" or "No."
</em></strong>If I check all programs in <strong>Programs and Features</strong> in
<strong>Control Panel</strong>,<strong> Microsoft Office Starter 2010</strong> is still there.&nbsp;But if I try to
<strong>uninstall </strong>it, I'm afraid I might lose some of saved files which were saved in
<strong>Microsoft Word Starter 2010 </strong>as a warning message describes.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;My questions are:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>How do I get back to double click to open any files without having to right mouse click each time to go to
<strong>Open With</strong>, and choose one of the options (including Adobe PDF Files)?
</li><li>How do I make (keep or reinstall?) this&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Office Starter 2010</strong> work properly? Or do I not have it anymore since I uninstall
<strong>Click-2-Run</strong> successfully? Or by uninstalling <strong>Click-2-Run</strong> make
<strong>Microsoft Office Starter 2010</strong> not to work properly? </li><li>How do I get back/reinstall <strong>Microsoft Word </strong>[only] (not sure about the details on this one that I unintalled during the time I talked to
<em><strong>Cy</strong></em> in <strong>Volume Licensing</strong>) without having to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;Restore Point and without losing other updated programs?</li></ol>
<p><em>[Moved from feedback]</em></p>

<h2>            How to keep READ e-mails on my phone marked as UNREAD on my PC.</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to receive and read my email messages on my phone, but when I go to my desktop, I want the email to remain as unread if I've already viewed it on my phone.&nbsp; It used to be like this before, but I can't seem to get it with my new phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically all I want my phone to do is download the messages, but not resync or interact back with the server for marking them as read.&nbsp; Is this so hard to figure out?&nbsp; I know it's backwards for most people who once they see an e-mail, they move on, but
 sometimes I'm too busy to reply to the e-mail or it's something that I can only reply or help with at my PC.&nbsp; I still want to receive important emails without having to be tied to my PC to see them first.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting us
<br />
<br />when you configure your email account in your mobile device using Exchange mode or IMAP, it will sync the read/unread status across all devices. We can only manually mark the emails so it will show as an unread email the next time you open your account on your Outlook client.
<br />
<br />As a manual workaround for built in mail app for iOS is to:
<br />
<br />- Manually mark emails (tap hold an email), it will display a blue check/mark on the left side, then press the Envelope at the bottom panel (2nd from the left) to mark these selected mails as “Mark as Unread”
<br />
<br />- Or In the INBOX, Click the Edit button on the top right corner and manually select the mails you want to Mark, click Mark on the bottom panel, then choose Mark as Unread.
<br />
<br />As a manual workaround for OWA for iOS is to:
<br />
<br />- Manually mark emails (tap hold an email), it will display a check box on the left side, then press the Envelope at the bottom panel to mark these selected mails as “Mark as Unread”
<br />
<br />- Or set a “Quick actions” to swipe the email you want to mark as Unread. To set the Quick action got the “Gear” icon &gt; Quick actions &gt; now set the action to “Mark as read or unread” to either swipe right or left.
<br />
<br />As a manual workaround for built in mail app for Android is to:
<br />
<br />- Manually mark emails, tap hold an email to show the options, on the top left select the “envelope” icon to mark the email as read/unread.

            What about using POP3?&nbsp; I have an Android, and I'm using the basic Samsung Email app that comes with it.&nbsp; When entering my e-mail I don't see an option to change it to or from IMAP and POP3.

            HI,
<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting us wishing you a great day
<br />
<br />Let Try something:
<br />
<br />Open the default Android email app. Select the option to Add a new account, or if it’s your first time using the app, you’ll be prompted to set up an email right away.
<br />
<br />Enter in your full Outlook.com email address and password, then Press Next. On the next screen select the “POP3 account” button. Currently, Outlook.com doesn’t support IMAP.
<br />Now configure Incoming and Outgoing server settings. Note that for both settings you need to leave the username and password the same. Just make sure the username is the full email address @outlook.com.
<br />
<br />Incoming server settings:
<br />
<br />POP3 server: pop3.live.com
<br />Security type: SSL
<br />Port: 995
<br />Delete Email from server: This setting is optional, set whether you want emails deleted only from your phone or from the entire account (server).
<br />Outgoing server settings
<br />
<br />SMTP server: smtp.live.com
<br />Security type: TLS
<br />Port: 587
<br />Require sign-in: Yes
<br />
<br />Next configure how often the email app will check for new messages. I suggest setting this at either two or four hours, if you need to check mail more often you can manually refresh. when the email frequency is set to a quick interval it drains a lot of battery from the phone.
<br />
<br />The last thing to do is to give the account a local nickname. This is is only seen by you on your phone. And then add your name in the second box, and note this name may be seen by the people you email.
<br />
<br />Check it out. Now you have Outlook.com email set up on your Android phone using the default email client. Outlook.com emails can also be synced up using Exchange ActiveSync .
<br />
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Victor

make sure that the volume in your phone is UP or ON, the same way the volume in the BT headset is also UP or ON...<br />
<br />
also, make sure your BT headsets does not have a low charge...

            Hi Friedbrains,<br />
<br />
First, thank you for your reply... but I did check everything with the sound... volume was up, both on phone and headset... the headset was fully charged... so, this really stays a big mystery to me...<br />
today i called the Nokia Care Service Center and they never heard about this problem, Finland will be contacted and they will get back to me with a solution... in the meantime i am still stuck with a very expensive phone and BT headset that i cannot use properly...
 I am still a big fan of Nokia, but they should get with a solution to my problem quickly if they don't want to loose a fan ;-)

            your problem is no nokia phone supports stereo headsets its true the bluetooth has to have a a2dp profile none of the nokia handsets have this but the 8810 im serious i have an n91 thats for music right well i can not use a stereo bluetooth headset with
 it none but there 800 dollar phone has it and the worst part is you can not upgrade the profile of the bluetooth in the phone its worse cause some inexpenssive SE phones have a2dp

            Hi Kevin,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support, mate, but I have to tell you that my headsets are not STEREO headsets but MONO headsets... so, the a2dp profile is not needed!!! Nokia is really getting lame now, the Nokia N93 is such a "monster", but a simple bluetooth audio profile
 they "forgot" to build in, or what? I hope they come really quick with a solution, I need the handsfree function to keep my job fine-free, since here in Belgium the police is very strict about misuse of mobile phones whilst driving a car!!!<br />

            you can never fix the problem, becuase N93 is defective product. I have same exactly problems. my BH900 can connect N93 but no sound. Now, I am stuck with useless piece junk on my desk. what a waste money.<br />
<br />
my suggestion is don't buy Nokia anymore. all they want is to cheap your money.

            one thing, i have noticed that the Bh-900 has what they call Version 2, in the package it is written as such... do you have this or you have the V. 1???<br />
<br />
another thing you can do is update your N93's software via Nokia Software Updater...<br />
<br />
you can also do a hard reset on your headset and/or with your phone...

            I have both a v2 bh-900 headset and a fully updated N93, and my headset still wont work. It's worked once but that was after resetting my phone and turning my headset on and off about 3-4 times, it just started working. I cant get it to work again though.
 I read everything in the manual and there nothing i havent tried, Ive been messing with it for a week.<br />
<br />
Any idea?

            Have the same 2 items (N93 and BH 900), and yes, after a couple of hours of fiddling with it, I managed to get it to work flawlessly for an hour... I could hear everything, from keytones, ring tones, and even played back my MP3 files.... but it did not
 last. Next day, the problem persisted and this is what I realised:<br />
<br />
After pairing (amidst numerous resets, hard resets...)<br />
It works once out of 3 times I do this:<br />
When a call comes in, I answer it with the earpiece, press and hold the answer key to transfer it back to the headset, then press and hold the answer key to transfer it once again back to the earpiece.... and it works. I can hear the caller, and they can hear
 me.<br />
<br />
I am hoping the next firmware release fixes this problem.<br />
<br />
I noted that the "enhancement" settings does not allow the "bluetooth earpiece" choice despite allowing configuration of it.

Can you be a bit more specific, and more importantly if you are still having the problem? You say you did, but did what? Align the screen? What is now not working? The whole phone? The alignment? The touch screen? what in particular is not working.
<br />
<br />
The more info we have (like what kind of phone is it, what softare is it running, etc etc) the more likely we are going to be able to help you out.<br />

    <title>Enabling Landscape on my music player... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Enabling Landscape on my music player...</h2>
                    I have an hp iPAQ 4150 running Windows Mobile 2003 (a bit old, I know), and I was wondering if there is any freeware utility that can rotate the screen into a landscape format (320x240 instead of 240x320) for me. It would really make life easier when using
 Pocket Internet Explorer or using Pocket Excel. I tried using the button that is available in some task managers, but nothing happens at all.<br />
<br />
Thanks for answering all these burning questions!<br />

            Well, I gave that a shot and "no dice". First, I think I am stuck with non "se" windows mobile 2003, which does not support that within its os. It also gave me a little warning box before it installed about compatability (which I don't normally see), so
 I think that could be the problem. The program itself did what many others now do (that didn't before the firmware upgrade - weird): nothing. Good Luck, everyone! Thanks. - 2 Bunny Merry Thanksgiving!

            Activesync 4.5 is the latest version, so you better stick to that. You are not the first have problems with the same device. I remember seeing a similar issue and I remember ending up recommending the owner to take back the smartphone to the reseller.
 Hopefully we won't have to come to that. Did you try diabling the antivirus software? In Activesync on your device, in the menu you have the option to check the status. Go there and see if ther's any support code. Try uninstalling Activesync, reboot your pc
 and reinstall again.

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you certain that these particular users did not accidentally insert the missing images as linked versus embedded? That would cause the missing image situation if the linked path was not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software will default to the last used insertion method so if you use a linked image setting just once, it will keep defaulting to that insertion method until you change it again.</p>

<h2>            Inbox only showing less than one week of emails</h2>
                    
<p>I use office365 outlook. It's been fine until about a month ago when I noticed that my inbox was missing blocks of emails. I went through settings and couldn't find a sweep or archive setting that should be moving my emails, but they are being moved to deleted
 file. </p>
<p><br />
I've been a subscriber since 2013 and should have an inbox going back that far. My sent emails go back, but the Inbox is not going back more than a week at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I see from the community that this has happened to multiple parties over the past year.
</p>
<p>I even tried IE to see if the browser had any effect, but none. </p>
<p>I did find that MOST of my past emails are in the "deleted" folder. In fact I moved them from delted back to my inbox two weeks ago - however they vast majority of my emails are in the deleted folder.
</p>
<p><br />
thanks</p>

<p>To confirm your question 3 - I also tried it from another computer moments ago and have the same issue.
</p>
<p>I will turn off my two mobile devices (Microsoft Lumia 640 and iPad2) so they will not be pulling from the server this weekend, but will need to reestablish on Monday.

<p>So, I'm not sure how to disconnect the email account from my phone. That appears to require that I unregister my phone from my microsoft account. That's potentially going to mess up my synced folders, so I'm not going to disconnect email on my phone at this
 time. </p>
<p>So to recap, I have a Microsoft Lumia 640XL that is registered to MY Microsoft ID, which is not the same ID as Think Versatile. But I don't understand why this would be affecting the inbox at this time. It has been fine until early December is when this
 started. Around December 8th or 9th I noticed my inbox acting strangely. </p>

<p>Interesting, I cannot find a way to delete an email account on my phone once it's been added. The support only shows how to add an account. Bizarre. So I'll remove from my ipad for now. Look forward to resolving.

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>You don't need to remove the account from the mobile device. Just make sure it's not connected to the Internet when performing the steps below or when monitoring the issue.</p>
<p>Please access Outlook Web App. Right click the <b>Deleted Items</b> folder and click<b> Recover deleted items</b> to check in the
<b>Recoverable Items</b> folder.</p>
<p>If you cannot find the emails there, please contact your admin to use <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/praveenkumar/archive/2013/07/19/single-item-recovery-in-new-o365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> travelaround  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random characters &#38; messed up text</h2>
                    <p><span>I want to start by saying that I do not know if my problem is starting with Pages or Word. I have a document that I created in Word 2010 (on my PC). I opened it in Pages
 (on my iPad), edited it, and sent it back as a Word doc. I opened it in Word - no problem - edited it more and saved it as a Word doc. Now, when I try to open it, there are Chinese characters in the place of some words, while other words are mixed and matched.
 For instance the phrase "You'll find it's anything but true" now says "yout closerates are respected true." The heading of my first chapter now says It</span><span>啀</span><span>Ȳ</span><span>圀</span><span>Ȳ</span><span>壀</span><span>Ȳ</span><span>帀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>怀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>懀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>掀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>局</span><span>ȿ</span><span>媀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>壀</span><span>ȿ</span><span>圀</span><span>.
 I have checked the language settings, and they appear fine. I've also tried opening earlier versions of the document. They open nicely, but also mess up after a save. Any help is greatly appreciated!</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Highlight the characters which is displayed in Chinese characters then change it to any other available font in the document and check how it shows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue persists, you may repair the document manually then try to save the changes and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To manually repair</strong>, Open Word &gt; Click on ‘File’ &gt; click ‘Open’&gt; In the Open dialog box, select the file you want to open, and click the arrow next to the Open button &gt; Click ‘Open and Repair’, and then choose which method you want to use
 to recover your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result to assist you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft 365 account &#40;through employer&#41; expired</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 and had a subscription to Microsoft 365 through my employer. I left my employer 6 months ago and took computer along. It seems they have only now deactivated my link in to the account. I still seem to have functionality of Office (word,
 powerpoint, etc) but obviously not linked to cloud services - which I do not need. A reminder comes up telling me there is a problem with my subscription. I click the link which takes me to a login to change my info. But that login has been changed or deleted....so
 I can't do anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have not lost functionality of the Office 2013 products that I need for this computer: Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel. Will this change at some point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to remove the annoying reminder re: problems with my Microsoft 365 subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Change payment method</h2>
                    <p>I'm repeatedly getting emails from Microsoft as my subscription to Office 365 needs a payment method changed. I go into my payments but it won't let me edit or change! Can't contact them at all. Very frustrated.<br />

<p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the current payment method is still active and being used for billing, you have to add an alternative payment method before you can remove the existing card. For detailed instructions on how to remove the card on the
