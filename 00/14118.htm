<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 16232.1000 &#40;rs_prerelease&#41; update....</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I received an update to install&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 10 Insider Preview 16232.1000 (rs_prerelease). I updated and restarted my computer. When it booted up I noticed that the windows are not redrawing properly. I lost the "x" and the minimize buttons in the
 upper right hand corners and when I opened Windows File Explorer window not only did I lose the ability to close and minimize but the entire left pane was empty. Where you would normally see your drives and folders was completely blank. I noticed the top of
 the windows were not complete. It was like they were missing the entire top bar. When I opened my Chrome browser I had the ability to close and minimize the window. It just seems that any window that had to do with the system OS were the ones giving me trouble.
 I do not have the creators update yet as it's says it's not available in my time zone. (eastern time) I reverted back to version 15063.483 and all is working fine again. Even though I now have this Windows 10 Insider Preview 16232.1000 (rs_prerelease) update
 waiting to install again. Anybody else have this issue updating to the latest insiders preview build? When will I be getting the Creators Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Greg</p>

<p>You already have the creators update if you are on 16232. &nbsp;The creators update was before that number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some issues with 16241 regarding display DPI scaling, I'd be curious if that is the cause of the missing interface controls. &nbsp;But I'd suggest installing the latest build before digging into it.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not on 16232...I reverted back to 15603 due to the window issue I was having. They weren't redrawing properly and I lost the "x" and "-" minimize buttons. The entire top of the window didn't look right. I had to right click on the folder in the task
 bar just to close the window. I'm on 15603 again and everything is working perfect like before.</p>

<p>Hi Perrito,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are already running the Creators Update (15063). The next public update is called the 'Fall Update' and is expected in the next couple of months. You have clearly setup/installed the Insiders things, so there is no way to undo that (short of a Clean
 Install). <strong>What you can do is configure it for the 'Release Preview Ring', that'll keep you closest to the most reliable OS</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why things were so bad in 16232, possibly it'll work better if you simply try again. To be honest, it will probably require a Clean Install of 16232.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no matter what, make sure you keep your backups up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to update to 16232 again but I got the same result with the windows not re-drawing properly. I can't close the window or minimize it because there's nothing there to click. So I reverted back to 15063 (and all is working fine) and I'm going to
 stay there until the next release preview ring is released. I don't want to do a clean install if at all possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Via HD Audio problem - No sound since update</h2>
                    What have you done?! Since I received the latest update which included an update for VIA HD Audio I have not had any sound. I tried to do a system restore, which worked for the sound but then the start menu and apps stopped working. Tried the suggested
 ways of getting these to work, got the menu working but not the apps. Did a system refresh, the menu and apps work but no sound. The gravity of this situation is no sound = no Peppa Pig, No Peppa pig = screaming child!! Please help..someone...anyone!

<div>All these problems started when my Mac downloaded update 14.2.5 &amp; all my Outlook information&nbsp;disappeared. I know it is in the 'microsoft user data' file in 'my documents'- but my MAC doesn't see it.</div>

            Testing in a new User will quickly tell you if the problem is system wide or if it's your User's folder that contains the problem.<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Drag from Documents/Microsoft User Data folder/Office 2011 Identities your Main Identity to the Shared folder. Data in the Shared folder can be accessed by another User. When you "Switch Users", you can access the Identity in the shared folder.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dianeross/7951190134/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Your Hard Drive/Users/Shared</a><br />
<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; CREATE A NEW USER<br />
<br />
Go to System Preferences --&gt; Create a New User in Accounts. Switch to the New User by logging out/in or use Fast User Switching.<br />
<br />
Open Outlook. It won’t be in the Dock in the new User. Go to Applications to open.<br />
<br />
Open Outlook so it create a new Microsoft User Data folder. You can delete the new blank Main Identity.<br />
<br />
Drag from Shared (it actually copies) your Main Identity and place it in the Microsoft User Data folder &gt; Office 2011 Identities folder for testing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity<br />
<br />
Any POP mail you download into the Identity in the test User will not be available unless you set to "leave on server"&nbsp; in Account &gt; Advanced settings/Server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you still see the issue?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, then the problem is with your base files.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If no, then the problem is in your User's folder. **see fix below<br />
&nbsp; <br />
3)&nbsp; Remember to drag your Identity back from Shared when you log into your main User or Outlook will open in a new blank Identity.<br />
<br />
**Fix for User's folder:<br />
<br />
In Lion/Mountain Lion, there is an additional Repair Permissions application utility hidden away. This allows you to repair permissions on YOUR files and folders.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
1 Restart and hold down the Command and R keys during startup. <br />
<br />
2 You will boot into the Repair Utilities screen. On top, in the Menu Bar click the Utilities item then select Terminal.
<br />
<br />
3 In the Terminal window, type resetpassword and hit Return. <br />
<br />
4 The Password reset utility launches, but you're not going to reset the password. Instead, click on the icon for your Mac's hard drive at the top. From the&nbsp;drop-down below it, select the user account where you are having issues.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;5 At the bottom of the window, you'll see an area labeled 'Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs'. Click the Reset button there.<br />
<br />
The reset process takes a couple of minutes.<br />
<br />
While booted from the Repair drive, you can run Disk Utility to check or repair your hard drive. Run both in Disk Utility.
<br />
<br />
Restart<br />

<p><br />
No they are wrong. You can install it as often as you need. You may only have it activated on up to any 3 computers at once.</p>
<p>The reason the key is wrong is because you have other Office on the computer. Uninstall all Office entries and do it again.</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 Pivot Chart Date Formats dont seem to work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tas r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 Pivot Chart Date Formats dont seem to work</h2>
                    <p>I am using excel 2013 pivot charts against a power pivot data source which has imported data from a SSAS 2012 Tabular Model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to create a dashboard with some compact date based charts and want the date axis to be in "J A S O N D J F M A M J J" format for Australian financial years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the dates in the data source in date format, but cant format these with the "mmmmm" format that is supposed to show month first letter only since this cant be selected in Power Pivot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the chart I get the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/482caa3f-5f7d-4b78-b68d-2750923ba864" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding mmmmm, "mmmmm" as custom date formats. &nbsp;I found if I choose US as the location (as shown in the above), then mmmmm is a selectable date format option. &nbsp; I have unlinked the format. &nbsp;But still all I get is the numeric month showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives? &nbsp;Is it too much for this stuff to just work as advertised?</p>

            <p>I have found a work around solution to this.</p>
<p>I have a text column in my data source called "Mon YY" which displays Jan 14, Aug 15 etc. &nbsp;This is set to column sort by a MonthFirstDate column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use this as the horizontal axis, set the axis to Text format, set the Text Direction to Stacked, the vertical alignment to center, and the space from the axis to 0, and tweak the size of the plot area, I can get the right result.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e4dd129-b341-4f04-9187-cd4da5d5c05e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It still doesn't explain why the date format feature doesn't work as it should though.</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an Outlook data file contains no information when it's opened, it may not have been created properly, or it may have gotten corrupted. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions
 for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to confirm, which version of Outlook are you using?</li><li>How did you get the data file? Did you create it on the same computer or did you get it from a different device?</li><li>Did you get any specific error messages? If yes, please post a screenshot. </li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest repairing the Outlook data file using the Inbox Repair tool. The step-by-step instructions for doing this can be found through this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We looks forward to your reply and the results of the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided, Joe. We suggest checking C<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><span>:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook
 for a visible or hidden PST file. If you find it in that location, select it as the default from the settings in Outlook. Otherwise, create a new Outlook profile by following the steps

here</a> and use that profile instead.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><span>Let

<h2>            removing an Exchange Server connect from HTC pro</h2>
                    &nbsp;My company had an exchange server that I received push email from to my HTC Pro via active sync.&nbsp; I no longer work with that company, but I can't get my phone to stop trying to connect to the exchange server.&nbsp; I need to set it up so it will active sync
 via USB to my laptop.&nbsp; Also, my company installed some security program that pops up whenever the phone reboots or has not been used for 20 minutes.&nbsp; It simply asks for a 4 digit pin to unlock the phone.&nbsp; It also pops up whenever I connect the phone to my
 laptop via USB.&nbsp; I need this removed as well (It does not show up as an installed program).<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>To remove the Exchange server account, just open Activesync on the device and click Menu &gt; Options. Select the server and click Delete. Then reboot your device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, since there is more than just a server connection that remains on your device, I would hard reset the device to get rid of all the security settings or any other settings that belonged to the company you worked for. If there are information that you
 need to backup, I'm thinking here of Contacts, Calendar, tasks, emails, SMS etc, check out&nbsp;<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobileactivesync/thread/www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PIM Backup</a>.</div>
<div><br />

<p>followed all the instructions on the apple forums for missing device&nbsp;</p>
<p>uninstalled and reinstalled itunes</p>
<p>removed the drivers&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Looks like a compatibility issue with Windows 10 and iTunes and the appropriate drivers.

<p>
</p><p>My iPod Touch does show up in File Explorer though, so I don't know what it could be, could be the device version depending on what Apple device you are connecting.</p>

            Yeah, probably that's the root cause. It probably has something to do with the new kernel version too and the devices not identifying the OS properly.

            <p>I had the same problem, the device was recognised by computer&nbsp;when plugged in&nbsp;but didn't show in iTunes. I updated iTunes to the latest version and followed the instructions for Win 8 on the apple support page. Did a screenshot on the ipod&nbsp;and it showed
 in device manager under portable devices. then followed this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, or Apple iPod entry in Device Manager and choose Update Driver from the shortcut menu.</li><li>Click "Browse my computer for driver software".</li><li>Click "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer".</li><li>Click the Have Disk button. (If the Have Disk option is not present, choose a device category such as Mobile Phone or Storage Device if listed, and click next. The Have Disk button should then appear.)</li><li>In the "Install from Disk" dialog, click the Browse button.</li><li>Use this window to navigate to the following folder:<br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers.</li><li>Double-click the "usbaapl" file. (This file will be called "usbaapl64" if you have a 64-bit version of Windows. If you don't see "usbaapl64" here, or if there is no Drivers folder, look in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers.
 instead).</li><li>Click OK in the "Install from Disk" dialog.</li><li>Click Next and finish the driver-installation steps. Open iTunes to verify that the device is recognized properly.</li></ol>

            <p>Before, my IPod 4 always synched fine with Outlook on two laptops running Window 7, using iTunes.&nbsp; Upgraded only one laptop to Windows 10 and have had many disasters.&nbsp; Windows 10 finally running (so far), but now the iPod will not synch with Outlook on BOTH
 laptops.&nbsp; This problem did not occur until my Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Synch should at least work on n the laptop still using Windows 7. &nbsp; Spoke to someone at Microsoft who said some file might have become corrupted.&nbsp; Purchased tech support from Microsoft and
 later talked with someone on Friday who could not help me at all.&nbsp; I asked to have my problem escalated and she stated that someone from Microsoft was to call me on Saturday between 10am and 5pm.&nbsp; I waited all day and never got a phone call.&nbsp; So much for tech
 support help so far.&nbsp; I have already spent hours trying to find out how to get this problem solved and need help.&nbsp;&nbsp; iTunes shows the IPod (on both computers) and indicates that synch is taking place, but nothing happens in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help to solve this one??</p>

            Having worked with GMail's OAuth before, I don't think this is going to be on Google's side. &nbsp;I, too, am having the same issue, and every time it's asking for "Offline Access", which leads me to believe that Microsoft is not properly handling the OAuth
 token given to them by Google.

            I revoke Microsoft permissions and linked it again, but the problem persist. About all the permissions only "Offline Access" seems not working, other permissions are ok, like basic info access, gtalk access and contacs access.

<h2>            8002801d automation error - library not registered</h2>
                    Hi Guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope you can help me on this one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my work laptop I am running Windows 7 64 bit, Office 2003.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I mistakenly installed the Office 2013 preview (I wanted to just download it) and then as it had installed on my work laptop, I uninstalled it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since doing that, I now cannot open Excel through VBA, I am getting an Automation Error: 8008201d - Library Not Registered when I run the following command:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched online about this extensively, and found one solution to the problem to re-register the .dll files.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is where I am having a problem however, I have tried re-registering several files, but the some will not register, I get another error saying it has loaded but failed to call on DllRegisterServer with Error Code 0x80004005. I am an administrator and
 have tried running cmd with administrator rights, to no avail.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then also updated to a copy of Office 2007 that I had, but having the exact same issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me in any way you can, it is crucial that I get this working and I would be grateful to anyone who can assist.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<h2>            Bing Ads Account Has Stopped Spending. Please Help</h2>
                    <p>So for a while I have been spending great on my ads and no problems whatsoever...</p>
<p>However, now I am faced with a problem. All my ads are not spending even ads with great quality score.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what it says under delivery:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your keyword, ad copy, or landing page is not relevant enough to users' search queries.Improve the relevance of keywords, ad copy, and/or landing page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is like this for all my ads. Is my account under review ?? Has anybody dealt with this before ??</p>

    <title>Important emails going into junk mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjijin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Important emails going into junk mail</h2>
                    <p>Before this outlook upgrade from hotmail, I was able to change the settings of my junk mail to 'only contacts that I know' to come into my hotmail. All other emails would go into junk mail. However, I want to now change this setting as a lot of very important
 emails go straight into my junk mail and obviously i do not get notifications for emails going into junk mail. By the time I realise these important emails are in the junk mail it is already too late! With this newer and unfortunately not better version, i
 cant even change the junk mail settings! Why would outlook remove this useful option?! I can now only add and block senders but if I do not hold the power of knowing what happens in the future how will I be able to know and add the email addresses of important
 emails?! I want to either change to my old hotmail account or please can someone tell me how I can stop emails going into the junk folder. I want ALL emails to go straight into my inbox from now on. At least I can monitor them manually then. (Dont fix what

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do understand the importance of Outlook.com to always function properly especially when sending or receiving emails. It is possible that there is an issue with the
<strong>Junk email</strong> settings of your Outlook.com and that is why important emails are going to the Junk folder. Kindly check the Junk email settings to see if the senders of the important emails are included in the
<strong>Blocked senders</strong> or <strong>Blocked domains</strong>. You can also add email addresses in the
<strong>Safe senders</strong> list so that you can make sure that the emails coming from legitimate contacts will go to your Inbox folder. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Access the Outlook.com website.</li><li>On the upper right part of the page, click the gear icon (Settings).</li><li>Click <strong>View full settings</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, select <strong>Mail</strong>.</li><li>On the right pane, choose <strong>Junk email</strong>.</li><li>Check the boxes there for any incorrect settings. You can also add an email address to Safe senders list so that the emails that comes from it will always go to your Inbox.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Unable to open downloaded Excel files</h2>
                    Since the Microsoft updates the week of 11jul16, I am unable to open Excel files downloaded from an online data system when using Windows 7 Professional, Service Pack 1.&nbsp; However, there is not a problem with other laptops I use with Windows 10 operating
 systems.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this, and identified solutions?

            I guess one would have to ask as to what exactly happens when you try to open these files, and how exactly are you opening?<br />

<strong><span>2016 Cannot Open Files in Excel after upgrade to 16.0.7070.2026</span></strong>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update</span></strong><span>: Our dev team is working on options to preserve security
 and assist customers with their workflow. Currently we do not have any further workarounds.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Additional background</span></strong><span>: The security update changed how Excel handles
 documents that are opened from untrusted locations (such the Internet zone) which are not supported in Protected View, such as HTML/XML/XLA files. Opening them without Protected View is a security vulnerability, and therefore files open from such locations
 are now blocked. &nbsp;We realize this breaks compatibility with some existing solutions, and are working on getting these file types supported with Protected View. &nbsp;Until that happens, users will need to manually trust the file before they open them in Excel,
 as demonstrated in one of the workaround suggestions. &nbsp;Excel can still open these files without an issue if they are trusted.&nbsp;

            <p>I am having this issue with Excel 2016 and files downloaded into my downloads folder. I see that the files are there. I click on the files, Excel opens but the files remain closed. I have tried opening from the File menu with the same problem. I was able
 to work around the problem by opening the file with Word, but that seems to defeat the purpose of having the file in Excel format to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new solutions out there?</p>

            <p>After digging a bit into file properties, I found the security property at the bottom which said: "</p>
<p>
</p><p>This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking the check box that says "Unblock" it's opening the file just fine. I don't want to have to do this for every file. Is there a better way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
