<h2>            Your message seems to have triggered our junk email filters. Could you edit your message and try again&#63;</h2>
                    I get the above error message for most of the emails that I send now.&nbsp; I have no suspicious content, I am not sending to multiple emails, I don't have attachments, I have not sent so many emails that I am over a sending limit.&nbsp; There is no reason why this
 message should be popping up so much.&nbsp; I cannot find a way to turn off this function, nor can I find a way to contact microsoft/hotmail/outlook.com for help.&nbsp; Anyone else have this problem?&nbsp; I am really close to changing my email service provider because I
 can't send emails (which is kind of a basic function to have for an email service provider).

            My account isn't a new one.&nbsp; I've been with this service for over ten years.&nbsp; I did however create an "Outlook" alias and am now using that as my primary email address.&nbsp; Other than that, there has been no change in my usage.&nbsp; (Removed for Privacy).&nbsp; I
 was using some links to my website and to my book on Amazon as a part of my signature and sometimes I have noticed that these (or one of them) triggers the error message, but it is not consistent.&nbsp; Sometimes I need to delete both links, sometimes just one
 will work, sometimes it sends just fine with both links still there, and sometimes it has nothing to do with any of that.&nbsp; I have verified my account using my cell phone at least twice and this does not fix the issue.<br />

            <p>Hi ryanstockton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information that you have provided. I have investigated your account and it is working fine on our end. The scenario that you are encountering is normal. Links&nbsp;may trigger the junk mail filter when you are sending emails to a group or sending
 it multiple times. The system may tagged the message as spam since "links" are a&nbsp;common method that are used by hackers on spam emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent the issue from happening, please avoid sending emails to group or multiple times when you are sending emails with a link. You may also try to edit the content of the message and check if will go through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks, but that is really of no help at all.&nbsp; I was using my email the ways that I always did when these "triggers" that are tagging my outgoing email started up in the last couple of months, so I know that it wasn't what I was doing that started this
 problem.&nbsp; Also, I need to send emails with links every now and then to many people at one time.&nbsp; It seems ridiculous for me to be the one changing how I use my email when it is the email service that has changed to make things more difficult/confusing.&nbsp; I
 understand the idea behind these filters, and the junk mail filter for INCOMING mail is actually very good.&nbsp; But this filter for outgoing mail is extremely hyperactive.&nbsp; At least there should be a way (an additional button to push perhaps) to allow me to send
 the email anyway, though maybe with a warning that it may be received as junk/spam by the receiver.<br />

            <p>Hi Ryan, I'm experiencing exactly the same thing. After 2 years of not being a problem, now my email sig which has links in it is causing me the same problems. Something must have changed recently as the sig, email content and the addresses are all very
 like the emails I've sent for years. Anyone from Microsoft out there listening please?</p>

            <p>Yes I read that. Having used migrated from Hotmail at the beginning of the outlook launch I'm surprised that now, years later it rears it's head. I must also add that as I use it for work and running my company so to have a blanket system that see's a link
 in a sig (links to my websites unsurprisingly) and an email to some regular clients as spam all of a sudden is unhelpful to say the least.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has potentially made outlook unusable for me to run my company through. Is it not possible to have more sophisticated filtering on outgoing mail? I may be missing something in the options and would willingly be directed to such.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This article is a&nbsp; complete waste of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried all suggested (now, I suspect Ím getting spam from registering my phone number here---no where else have I registered my mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OUTLOOK is so counter productive.&nbsp; It doesn't like links sent in email??&nbsp; Do their coders live under rocks??&nbsp; My email was to someone on the SAFE list and ,still, cannot go through.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out the codes idiotic throw emails into the spam filter if you have too many links within the email.&nbsp; Well, in the modern world, modern humans do shopping online; if you happen to suggest a list of where to shop, Outlook will go crazy and deter
 mail from sending (this was my case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve this issue, use gmail or take out all the links. </p>

<br />
<br />Multiple persons cannot have the same email address. That's evident since you are getting emails from "other people" so more then likely that the wrong email address was entered OR your email address has been "hijacked" by a spammer and sending out emails making it appear to come from you. A "hijacked email address" is not the same thing as a "hacked email account".

            <p>Thank you for your suggestions but, so far,&nbsp;I have not&nbsp;had any luck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled all Internet Explorer add-ons; the problem still occurs.&nbsp; I then ran a full system scan using Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; It found and&nbsp;deleted&nbsp;several low priority tracking cookies but nothing else.&nbsp; I then reset Internet Explorer and rebooted
 but the&nbsp;problem still occured.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm viewing an email and I hit delete, it&nbsp;deletes the other&nbsp;email immediately.&nbsp; After hitting the delete key, it seems like nothing happened because&nbsp;I'm still viewing the email I had intended to delete but then when I go back to my list of emails, I
 see a different&nbsp;email has been deleted instead.&nbsp; During my recent tests, I noticed the first email in the list is the one which was inadvertently deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything at all stored on my system for Outlook.com that can be deleted or reset? &nbsp;If not, is there anything else I can try?&nbsp; Thanks again!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No problem about not having responded quickly.&nbsp; I appreciate the help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked "Manage Rules" and I do not have any rules. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected&nbsp;"Default view after moving or deleting email" then clicked on My message list and hit save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem&nbsp;still occurs.&nbsp; I double click any message in&nbsp;my Inbox list to get a full view of it.&nbsp; I then hit delete to delete the message I am viewing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like nothing happens (the message is not deleted&nbsp;and I am still viewing the&nbsp;full screen&nbsp;of the same
 message).&nbsp; I then&nbsp;double click Inbox to go&nbsp;back to my Inbox message list, and what was the first message in my Inbox&nbsp;list is now gone (even though that's not the one I was viewing when I hit delete).&nbsp; I tried the above&nbsp;with my Deleted email folder, as well,&nbsp;and
 the same problem occurs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My sense is&nbsp;something has become corrupted with my particular email address (a&nbsp;folder, a pointer, or whatever)&nbsp;which is causing the code to point to the incorrect email when it does the delete.&nbsp; Is there a way to reset&nbsp;my email address so it is&nbsp;like using
 my email address for the very first time.&nbsp; Even if a reset would cause me&nbsp;to lose&nbsp;my current emails, it would be worth it, as long as I could keep the same email address.&nbsp; If a reset is not possible, can my email address by deleted but then quickly recreated
 from scratch&nbsp;(so I can continue to use the same address) which&nbsp;in effect would be like&nbsp;a reset?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rick,<br />
<br />
I'd like to clarify that the OneDrive for Android is different from the OneDrive for Business sync client desktop version. OneDrive for Android only allows us to connect to our OneDrive for Business libraries and view, edit and save changes to files stored
 there, but we are not able to sync any other kinds of SharePoint libraries.<br />
(The files shared&nbsp;separately with a user can also be found in the<strong> Shared</strong> section in OneDrive for Android even if they're located in a SharePoint Online library.)<br />
<br />
Given this situation, I'd like to invite you to join the following discussion and share your ideas with our related team. Many features will come directly based on customers' valuable comments.<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/8279568-allow-onedrive-for-business-to-synchronise-with-sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Allow OneDrive for Business to synchronise with SharePoint document libraries other than your own private
 doc library</a><br />
<br />
Your understanding is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James</p>

    <title>Funny censorship in Bing. I find it offensive like all internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> constiff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Funny censorship in Bing. I find it offensive like all internet censorship. &#58;-&#40;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft banning the word "Lollipop" from its search suggestions on Bing. I don't know why would MS ever choose to do that even though the word sounds very similar to "L*****n" and "L****a", which are considered inappropriate by all search engines and it
 is acceptable, because....you know. But, Microsoft is not a company which can ban a piece of candy which they consider "offensive", that's why I wanted to share this with you guys. At first I found it ridiculously funny. Now I realized that It's funny
<strong>and </strong>sad at the same time.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't actually find it funny anymore after a little. I'm one of the chief officers in an anti-censorship organization and I actually find it offensive.</p>
<p>I chose the categories that I thought they're the most appropriate.</p>
<p>I post in various forums so that's why I said a lot of things here.</p>
<p>I "fight censorship every day" even the little things in search engines such as search "suggestions" or "predictions" (that's how G<strong>*****</strong>&nbsp;calls them) censorship have to be stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Bing is better than G<strong>*****</strong>. Bing censors little to no content. I also believe that Microsoft has better customer support than G<strong>*****
</strong>(but hey, does G even have a customer support?)</p>
<p>P.S: I hope MS won't delete this. I don't want to offend anyone nor post anything inappropriate here. I just want to share thoughts with the public.</p>

    <title>Failure to add Outlook.com email account to Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterzedwards  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to add Outlook.com email account to Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have set up an outlook.com email account. When adding this account to Outlook 2016 (and 2013) the system fails to recognise my user name and password, so I am unable to receive/send email. Interestingly, this account appeared automatically in the Mail
 program. I cannot set it up on my windows phone either, but have been able to do so in the Outlook app for Android. I spent three hours online with a technician who eventually gave up (after reinstalling Office on my machine). I use Office 365 (one of five
 users under a package in the name of a family member) but cannot see how this might affect the situation. The importance of this for me is that I want my calendars to sync with my phone and its seems Outlook.com is necessary for that.

            Dear Nokia, Do you have any idea what a driver could satisfy your stuff (please the question asked in post above please)? Otherwise, it seems to had been the best decision to say goodby to Nokia products, vendors with no control over own products and their's
 properties are not worth the customer's trust.

            Are you looking for legal or illegal films?<br />
<br />
We can not talk about downloading films illegaly but there are some safe options out there. Itunes for example lets you download movies and a few other sites will as well.<br />
<br />
After getting the movie, you need to convert it into MPEG-4 format. There are some good ones such as<br />
<a href="http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/free-dvd-video-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dvdvideosoft.com/free-dvd-video-software.htm</a><br />
<br />
Then, you can transfer it to your phone. You might need around 800 MB for one movie.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could rip the movie off a DVD.

            Hi Mandagirl and anyone else who may finf this useful.<br />
<br />
I have spent ages trying to get movies on my N95 8gb after mine did not come with the spiderman 3 film on it. I tried many different sofware site and even paid on some download sites but nothing would work. I was even on this site this morning reading the advice
 and was going to try and use the smartmovies software but like other users get confused with all the different software downloads. Then after one last search before officialy giving into the fact that i just won't have movies on my phone i found this site:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ipod-lounge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ipod-lounge.com</a><br />
<br />
Brilliant site! And great choice.<br />
<br />
WOW!! So easy, so cheap (yes you have to pay per film but don't be put off it well worth it) and most of all amazing DVD like quality. (The quality of the welcome video or the spiderman movie i did not get-saw it on a friends).<br />
<br />
Saw it at at luch time and have already paid for and downloaded onto my N95 8gb 4 movies. Thougt I should share my find with you guys.<br />
<br />
Right heres how i have got them on:<br />
<br />
I am using the new vesion 7 pc suite which is better than the one you get in the CD from the box (downloaded it after trying to gets europe maps on phone - customer services recomended it). However sure it will work just as well with the N series pc suite.<br />
<br />
Choose film on site - most $4.99 so about £3 but new top releases may be more.<br />
<br />
Pay &amp; save. Once downloaded -may take 2hour - unzip it and film appears on desktop.<br />
<br />
Conect phone using USB and on phone choose PC suite.<br />
<br />
Then, and this is the important bit, cos i did have problem at first and it may just have been me tho. Open my computer and click on phone browser, open mass memory (the 8gb bit) and open video. Just literally drag and drop film and wait for it to copy. (Had
 problems when i tried to use video manager thing on PC Suite with it,so found this way works great - but play about, as i said may ahev just been me.)<br />
<br />
When finished open video centre on phone and my videos. Don't panic if it takes a min or 2 to appear first time it will be there.<br />
<br />
Downloaded film has no expiry on phone or PC, if you don't want it any more just delete it. There customer service is very good to, according to testomonys anyway.<br />
<br />
Check it out and try it, cheap, easy, very good choice, and very good quaily and sound.<br />
<br />
Hope i havent bored ya and you find this useful.<br />
<br />
Love Nicky

<h2>            Can you remove the date navigator from the Outlook 2013 To-Do bar&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook 2013 on Windows 8.&nbsp; In previous versions of Outlook, you could hide/remove the date navigator (calendar) from the to-do bar.&nbsp; This still showed the day's appointments, but not the calendar, thus freeing up screen real estate.&nbsp; It doesn't
 seam possible anymore.&nbsp; Is this the case?

<br />Where in Outlook do you change the password now that the old File / Account settings / Accounts settings / Change screen seems to have changed and the password box seems to have been removed.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />What you're encountering is the new "simplified" account settings UI. There are now 3 ways to go about changing email account settings. 
<br />
<br />Option #1
<br />
<br />From within Outlook
<br />- Press CTRL+ALT+S (this brings up the Send/Receive Settings window)
<br />- Select the group you want to edit and click on the &lt;Edit&gt; button
<br />- Select the email account you want to modify --&gt; click on &lt;Account Properties&gt;
<br />
<br />Option #2
<br />
<br />From within Outlook 
<br />- go to File --&gt; Options --&gt; Advanced --&gt; click on the Send/Receive button
<br />- click on the applicable &lt;Account Group&gt; (most people will only have one)
<br />- click &lt;Edit&gt;
<br />- select the &lt;Email Account&gt; --&gt; click on &lt;Account Properties
<br />
<br />Option #3
<br />
<br />With Outlook closed
<br />- open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app
<br />- select &lt;Email Accounts&gt;
<br />- select the desired &lt;email account&gt; --&gt; select &lt;Change&gt;
<br />
<br />*** the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app is not an option if the MS Office "Store" version is installed. If it is the store version, then the alternative in this instance is to click on Windows &lt;Start&gt; and &lt;Run&gt; the following command
<br />
<br />Outlook.exe /manageprofiles

If you start Excel in safe mode, any better? Or if you delete the <br />
settings in the registry, any luck? <br />

<h2>            IE10 Not Saving Typed URL&#39;s</h2>
                    I am running IE10 on Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit. Since installing IE10, I no longer have a saved history of typed URL's. I have made no changes to IE10 after the install, and IE9 would save these URL's. When I click on the down arrow in the address
 bar it's always blank. I checked to make sure that it isn't configured to clear history on exit. Outside of that, I have no idea why this is happening. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

AutoComplete for Address bar needs to be checked.&nbsp;&nbsp; (via Options, Content tab)

            <p>I'm getting the same result after upgrading from ie9 to ie10.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what I turn on under AutoComplete.&nbsp; It is always completely blank.&nbsp; No browsing history, favorites, etc.&nbsp; Complete blank.&nbsp; What I type is being stored like before in the registry
 under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs.&nbsp; I have tried turning off autocomplete and then back on.&nbsp; I have tried using the IE options reset but no luck.</p>

            <p>*** I found a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Protect and deleted the file CREDHIST.&nbsp; Restarted IE 10 and now the address bar drop down shows previous web sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is related to a message I got when I first ran IE 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A program on your computer has corrupted your default search provider setting for Internet Explorer.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went to Manage Add-ons there were no providers listed under Search Providers when I remember Bing was always there.</p>

            Thank you for your reply, but I have since switched back to IE9. When I do upgrade to IE10 in the future, I will look at those configurations at that time.

                    <p><b>Original Title:</b> MS OFFICE Home Edition 2007 - Will not open, repair, or un-install. &nbsp;Help. &nbsp;Error 1302 and Error 1402</p>
<p>I really need your help.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a 2 year old Dell Studio running Windows 7 and Office Home Edition.&nbsp; All worked fine to last week when I called HP support&nbsp;with help on getting their scan software to work.&nbsp; They messed&nbsp;everything up.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I launch office
 it now tries to configure that application(any of them) and fails saying:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>"powerpoint has not been installed by the current user.&nbsp; Please run setup to install application".</u>&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>I load the media in the drive and launch.&nbsp; When I try to install or repair the message is:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<u>"Error 1310: Error righting to file c:\config *&amp;&amp;^^. Verify you have access to that directory".</u></li></ul>
<p>When I try to install I get the message:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>"Error 1402: Setup Cannot open the registry key.&nbsp; Verify you have sufficient priviledges".</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>I swear I have tried to be self-sufficient. I'm no were as technical as you all; but I did try and I hope someone will take pity on me. &nbsp; I've spent about 8 hours confirming that I seem to be in a loop. I've spent about 10 hours hunting through the MS sites
 and trying bit and pieces.&nbsp; Hey - I know now how to get to the RUN field.&nbsp; None have worked or simply scared me to try. Many are partical answers mixed with references to XP, Office 2010 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone could please tell me how to get out of this loop I would appreciate it.&nbsp; I'll send&nbsp;good karma to you now. &nbsp;AGAIN - Window 7 64 bit...not XP...not 32 bit.&nbsp; Microsoft Office 2007...not 2010.&nbsp; I am not super technical so over explanation with lots
 of steps would be appreciate.&nbsp; Just need someone to care and help a stranger out.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Lastly, if I can't get this fixed....what do I tell the computer repair place the problem is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> mikeadmin4588  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to hide Security Groups in O365&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Situation</strong> - Currently we have an enviroment set up with Students and Staff (separate domains under the same forest). We have both our Outlook and O365 updated through our Active Directory using DirSync. When accessing our O365 environment
 students are authenticated via their own personal active directory account.</p>
<p>We have modified the following Active Directory attributes <strong>authOrig</strong>,
<strong>unauthOrig</strong>, <strong>msExchHideFromAddressLists</strong> to control who can/cannot use or view our security groups. Through testing, the above attributes have worked well with Outlook but not O365. When our Students try to share files/folders/blogs
 our security groups appear in the O365 "Invite" query. We do not want our Students to be able to share anything with our Security Groups.</p>
<p><strong>My question: </strong><strong>Is there any way to hide security groups from appearing in any search&nbsp;query in O365?</strong></p>
<p>Additional questions - If you cannot hide security groups in O365,&nbsp;can you restrict who can send to those security groups?</p>
<p>- Does the "Invite" query override our specified settings in Active Directory?</p>
