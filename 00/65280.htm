<h2>            Downloaded game files are locked</h2>
                    I use Action PC Football, a game software that allow an individual to play alone, or to play others on line.&nbsp; On this new computer I've encountered a problem.&nbsp; I have spoken with support people of the Manufacturer and they could not resolve.&nbsp; I can load
 the application, but it is necessary to download files from other participants to open in the application.&nbsp; I am able to download them, however, I cannot access them from either the application or any other manner.&nbsp; For example, when I go to the folder where
 I downloaded the file, it does not appear.&nbsp; When I attempt to download the file again, I can see it in the folder, however, it is grayed out and there appears to be a "padlock" attached to it.&nbsp; If I download it to desktop or flashdrive, it shows up and is
 accessible, however, this is only a work around and it does not enable me to fully use the application as intended.&nbsp; The Lenovo support people directed me to folder options and suggested there

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Are you logged in as administrator?<br />
Are you able to access other downloaded files located in that folder?<br />
<br />
I suggest that you try the following methods and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Log in as administrator<br />
Login as administrator and then try accessing the file and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> SFC Scan<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
Click StartCollapse this imageExpand this image, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
Collapse this imageExpand this imageIf you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> Uncheck the read only option <br />
To do this:<br />
1. Right click on the file that you want access, select properties.<br />
2. Under general, uncheck the read only attribute.<br />
3. Click on Apply and Ok.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

            Sorry for the delay in replying.&nbsp; Since FB season was over and I had a significant personal-family issue intervene, I did not take time to assess&nbsp;your suggestions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Method 1:&nbsp; I always log in as administrator.&nbsp; Administrator has all the permissions, when right clicking the properties of the folder, neither "read only" or "hidden" is checked.&nbsp; Individual files/apps have differing security setups, for example one has:<br />
CREATOR OWNER<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Administrator<br />
User<br />
TrustedInstaller<br />
<br />
Only CREATOROWNER has special box checked.&nbsp; System and Administrator are check the same.&nbsp; The box for read-only appears to be filled in (blue) but not checked.&nbsp; If I check it, the blue clears out without leaving a check mark.&nbsp; But it doesn't change anything,
 when I go back in the box is filled in blue.<br />
<br />
The system and administrator appear to have the same security settings.&nbsp; Only <br />
<br />
Method 2:&nbsp; I performed this scan and received the following: WPR did not find any integrity violations.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Method 3.&nbsp; When I right-click the folder that is supposed to contain all the files for this game, I have a general tab and neither read-only or hidden are checked.<br />
<br />
However, all of the above does not even address the problem with files that are on the computer that I cannot see in the folder.&nbsp; These are game files I have downloaded to the folder and cannot see, unless I attempt to download them again, and they appear with
 a lock and they are faded out.&nbsp; I was only able to access them with the main program application (so that I can play the game) if I downloaded it to a flash drive OR to my desktop.&nbsp; This, however, is not a good work around because after I play a game the results
 need to be sent to the commissioner and THAT FILE is also locked! (it will appear faded with a lock).&nbsp; I cannot do anything with these files, including changing security or any attributes.<br />
<br />
What do you suggest now?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike<br />

<p>First mark the other as not anwered, cause you might get overlooked if you don't do that as people think this has been resolved.
<br />
<br />
Second, follow this link take ownership and grant permissions to the folder that you are having issues with.

<p>I cannot do a screen shot.&nbsp; At best, all I can do is describe what I see.&nbsp; Assume you are a participant in an organization.&nbsp; The head of the organization sends you a file that you download to a program file.&nbsp; It is your task to modify the file using the
 program.&nbsp; You load the program, open the file folder and then modify the file, rename it, then save it.&nbsp; You open your email account to send the file to the Head of the Org.&nbsp; When you open the file folder to attach the file, you do not see it.&nbsp; Nor do you
 see the original file you downloaded from your email.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So you go through the process again.&nbsp; Open email, and download to folder.&nbsp; As you do that you see the results of your first attempt, i.e. the file is in the folder but it appears with a lock attached to it, and it is somewhat "greyed" out.&nbsp; You also see the
 file you modified and renamed, also with a lock.&nbsp; &nbsp;You proceed and you even get a message that the file already exists.&nbsp; So you download it again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This time, you go to your computer directory and find the folder where the program resides, and ostensibly, the files associated with the program.&nbsp; The file you downloaded (twice) does not appear, nor does the file you modified.&nbsp; They are there, because you
 saw them during your second effort at&nbsp;downloading the email.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I actually found a "work-around", by downloading the file from the email to a flash drive or desktop.&nbsp; There you can see the file.&nbsp; However, that file that is modified, which in this case means it is a completed football game, is not retrievable.&nbsp; So, as in
 paragraph one, retrieving the modified file back to the head of the organization is not possible due to some glitch, bug or whatever that is, well, screwing everything up.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As I said in my previous email, the mfg logged into my computer and saw it for themselves.&nbsp; This is probably the best solution, if we can set it up.&nbsp; You have to see it, perhaps, to understand it?&nbsp; I have attempted everything to correct/modify/adjust the security
 settings for this folder and those files, including the above.&nbsp; I really need to get this corrected.&nbsp; What do you suggest?<br />
<br />
My original post was March 18, still no answer.&nbsp; I would just like to know what to do next?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Mike</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 - Battery Wear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laur_nt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 - Battery Wear</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Surface Book 2 on 15/Jan/18 and I'm quite happy with the way it has been performing. I opted for the basic UK version (i.e. the i5/integrated video card/8GB RAM) as I only use for admin tasks - emails, web browsing, watching films, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that I have is that I recently ran a Battery Report via the Win10 Command Prompt and it shows that Battery 1, the touchscreen battery, has worn out by 10.5% in 13 charging cycles. Hence, it's max charging capacity is now at 16110 mWh, down from
 its 18000mWh design specifications. I find this to be a very high degradation rate given the fact that it happened over 45 days. So given these figures, 1 year from now the detachable tablet function will be unusable since its battery won't be able to hold
 any charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the onset I implemented all the recommended Li-Ion battery care measures:</p>
<p>- never left the battery to drain completely</p>
<p>- once a month let it drain to 10% an recharge completely</p>
<p>- usually recharge the battery from 40% <span>(rarely let it drop down to 20-30%)
</span>up to 80-90%</p>
<p>- use power saver below 30% battery</p>
<p>- always kept it at room temperature</p>
<p>- always charged it with its proprietary charging cable</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, has anyone else experienced this? Is it something normal, or did I just get one from a dodgy batch? Would the Manufacturer's Warranty cover this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your replies. Cheers!</p>

<h2>            Loud siren alarm sound from Xbox 360 slim</h2>
                    I made another post for this but couldn't find it.. I have an Xbox 360 slim that makes a horrible siren alarm sound similar to an UPS unit when the battery needs to be replaced. It's a loud constant alarm that will only go away when I turn the Xbox off
 and back on. In the other post I made I was asked to replace the HDMI cable I did that and more. This is what I did - 1 - replaced HDMI cable 2 - used an official Microsoft component cable 3 - connected it to another TV while the sound was happening Nothing
 made the sound go away. I have multiple Xboxes and this one is the only one that does it, so I'm hoping it's just a manufacturing flaw. I have the following - 2 - 4GB matte black Xbox 360 slims 1 - Halo Reach LE slim 1 - MW3 LE slim 1 - GOW3 LE slim 2 - standard
 xbox 360s 2nd or 3rd generation, I'm not sure But this one 4GB slim is the only one I have I problem with. I am sending this unit in for repair, but you might want to keep an eye on this issue as I have heard of several people

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10. Apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;assist you better, I&nbsp;would like to ask if <strong>Bitdefender</strong> is installed in your computer. If yes, then suggest you to uninstall the application. The issue might be causing due to third party services. I suggest you to follow the steps provided
 below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Remove all non-essential hardware and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode. To boot the system in Safe Mode, refer the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>(Applies to Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Perform a Clean Boot. <span>
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> &nbsp;Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong>"How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"
</strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to <span>
write to us </span>for any other assistance with Windows, we‚Äôll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>The DRIVER_VERIFIER problem occured when I turned him on. The crashes then occured every time my PC was booting. I managed to disable him already via Safe Mode. This error vanished but I still had crashes. It happens completely at random. It may happen when
 PC is in use, but can also when it's in idle state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that the crashes stopped since around my first post. The only thing I did, is to send a ticket to BitDefender and installing a program called WinThrusher I think which fixes registry entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to upload the MEMORY.DMP file but the last time I checked it was 956MB!</p>

<p>Hi, RichardTamparong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if the tips in <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this FAQ help article </a>do not direct you to what your Skype ID is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Your "ID" might also appear as live:[series of numbers and letters]</p>
<p>You are indeed correct; Microsoft accounts do not use an "ID" or "nickname" as old Skype accounts did.&nbsp; While all Skype accounts became Microsoft accounts in September 2016, it may take a while before all websites to update their data entry fields to accommodate
 Microsoft account identifiers as well as the older Skype account names that are still in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Elaine</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>There is no need to install the drivers for USB 3.0 in virtual XP mode as well as Oracle Virtual box. The drivers will be installed when the Virtual XP mode is installed for the first time.Same holds good for Oracle virtual box.<br />
<div>You would have to manually attach the USB devices in Virtual XP mode.<br />
<br />
a. In Windows Xp mode, click on the <strong>USB </strong>Tab.<br />
b. You will find your Device in the list.<br />
c. Select it.<br />
d. Once done, the USB device is selected inside the Virtual XP mode.</div>
<div><br />
Refer the screenshot provided by James orr in the following Microsoft answers website.<br />

<h2>            Cannot burn an mpeg-2 ts file to DVD&#43;R disk</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty much it, an mpeg-2 ts file - that's a 55 minute recording of a TV programme won't save onto a DVD+R disk.
</p>
<p>The error message is E:\PVR20120516 is not a supported file and cannot be imported.
</p>
<p>However I can do this on a DVD+RW disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only difference is one is rewritable and one is not. In this case I'd prefer to have this one protected from being over-written.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there something I can download so I can save this on a DVD+R disk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Does the error actually say&nbsp; "E:\PVR20120516"&nbsp; ?<br />
<br />
The file does not have an extension that denotes the format of the file.<br />
Try renaming to&nbsp; PVR20120516.mpg&nbsp; and see if it makes any difference.

            <p>Hi Madcyclistuk,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which burning application are you using?</p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined only while burning .mpeg file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Make sure that the all the files you're trying to burn are not corrupted. To see whether the files you want to burn is corrupted, try playing or viewing them using Windows Media Player. If the files don't play using the Player, Windows DVD Maker cannot
 burn them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If you are using Windows DVD Maker then choose a slower burning speed for your DVD burner by doing the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Return to the <b>Add pictures and video</b> to the DVD page, and then click
<b>Options</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the <b>DVD burner speed</b> box, select
<b>Medium or Slow</b> and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Crash Repair and Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
My windows 8.1 crashed and i'm not able to boot in. My hard drive is HDD (500GB + 25SSD) and I'm using USB to boot in and repair my OS but it fails with message "Drive is locked". So i used command line to get details about my disk and all of them show as RAW.
 Can you please help me how to proceed from here. I'm also attaching a image with details of my disk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i run chkdsk i get error saying "Cannot run chkdsk on RAW disks". I also ran these commands</p>
<p>Bootrec /fixMBR ==&gt; result was "successful"<br />
bootrec /fixBoot ==&gt; result was "successful"<br />
bootrec /rebuildBCD ==&gt; successful but total identified windows installations 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3990ef75-13f3-4255-b4b0-5851f1c39eac" /></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hello Sandeep,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per description, you are getting </span>&nbsp;"total identified windows installations 0" while running&nbsp;&nbsp;bootrec /rebuildBCD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Would suggest you to follow the steps given below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>1. First Start System Recovery Options. To start system recovery options.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>a) Boot from the disk, Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option ‚ÄúInstall now‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on Repair your computer</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the next page click on Advanced Options</span></p>
<p><span>d) Now click on Troubleshoot<br />
e</span><span>) Lastly click on Command prompt</span><span> and follow the on screen instructions<br />
<br />
2. At the prompt, type the bootrec command as shown below and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>bootrec /rebuildbcd</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><p><span>The bootrec command will search for Windows installations not included in the Boot Configuration Data and then ask you if you'd like to add one or more to it.</span></p><p><span><br />
3. You should see the following message.<br />
</span>Scanning all disks for Windows installations.</p></pre>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please wait, since this may take a while...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Successfully scanned Windows installations.</span></p>
<p><span>Total identified Windows installations: 0</span></p>
<p><span>The operation completed successfully.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>4. Since the BCD store exists and lists a Windows installation, you'll first have to "remove" it manually and then try to rebuild it again.</p>
<p>At the prompt, execute the bcdedit command as shown and then press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p>
<pre><strong>bcdedit /export c:\bcdbackup</strong></pre>
<p>The bcdedit command is used here to export the BCD store as a file: <em>bcdbackup</em>. There's no need to specify a file extension.</p>
<p>The command should return the following on screen:</p>
<pre><code><strong>The operation completed successfully.</strong></code></pre>
<p>Meaning the BCD export worked as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. At this point, you need to adjust several file attributes for the BCD store so you can manipulate it.</p>
<p>At the prompt, execute the attrib command exactly like this:</p>
<pre><strong>attrib c:\boot\bcd -h -r -s</strong></pre>
<p>What you just did with the attrib command was remove the hidden, read-only, and system attributes from the file
<em>bcd</em>. Those attributes restricted the actions you could take on the file. Now that they're gone, you can manipulate the file more freely - specifically, rename it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. To rename the BCD store, execute the ren command as shown:</p>
<pre><strong>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</strong></pre>
<p>Now that the BCD store is renamed, you should now be able to successfully rebuild it, as you tried to do in Step 2.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You could delete the BCD file entirely since you're about to create a new one. However, renaming the existing BCD accomplishes the same thing since it's now unavailable to Windows, plus provides you yet another layer of backup, in
 addition to the export you did in Step 5, if you decide to undo your actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Try rebuilding the BCD again by executing the following, followed by <strong>
Enter</strong>:</p>
<pre><strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></pre>
<p>which should produce this in the Command Prompt window:</p>
<pre><code>Scanning all disks for Windows installations.</code></pre>
<pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Please wait, since this may take a while...</code></pre>
<pre><code>&nbsp;</code></pre>
<pre><code>Successfully scanned Windows installations.</code></pre>
<pre><code>Total identified Windows installations: 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>[1]<span>&nbsp; </span>D:\Windows</code></pre>
<pre><code>Add installation to boot list? Yes&lt;Y&gt;/No&lt;N&gt;/All&lt;A&gt;:</code></pre>
<p>meaning that the BCD store rebuild is progressing as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. At the <em>Add installation to boot list?</em> question, type Enter <strong>
Y</strong> or <strong>Yes</strong>, followed by the <strong>Enter</strong> key.</p>
<p>You should see this on screen:</p>
<pre><code><strong>The operation completed successfully.</strong></code></pre>
<p>meaning that the BCD rebuild is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that an issue with the BCD store was the only problem, Windows should start as expected.</p>
<p>If not, continue to troubleshoot whatever specific issue you're seeing that's preventing Windows from booting normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Depending on how you started System Recovery Options, you may need to remove a disc or flash drive before restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</span></span></p>

    <title>Memeo Autobackup won&#39;t uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flyboy007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Memeo Autobackup won&#39;t uninstall</h2>
                    Ok, I just upgraded from Windows Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Home Premium and I'm having a major issue with trying to uninstall Memeo Autobackup.
<br />
<br />
Right after windows was done installing "Windows 7" it made my profile and in a few seconds of logging on Memeo started up and tried to install. Although, it failed, it gave me a message that Memeo backup was not compatible with Windows 7 and only worked with
 Vista. I already had Memeo installed when I had Vista. So being alarmed on what might happen and the fact that the program doesn't work anymore I tried to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
A few seconds in to the "Unistallation" i get a message that memeo autobackup is not compatible. And it quits out of the uninstallation before it is removed. i have tried that multiple times and to no avail. So I also attempted to delete the program files and
 registry values, and again it didn't work. Is there some way to fully remove it?

            There is no product key associated with a Windows 10 Free Upgrade as it relies on your Windows 7 or 8.1 product key and its activation information is stored 'in the cloud' and based off an algorithm that uses your hardware to make a unique entry for that
 hardware.

    <title>File Tagging- Suggested Values - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hywel harris  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Tagging- Suggested Values</h2>
                    <p>I am starting to use Tags to catalogue my files, however one thing that is really annoying is the Suggested Tag values that pop up on entering the first letter of a tag. I see loads of irrelevant entries that I have never used or input, and I dont know where
 they came from. I want to remove all the suggestions that are not relevant so its easy to see the one that are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done loads of reading up about this and cannot find the answer. Rebuilding the Search Index didn't help either. That list must be stored somewhere. I searched the reg for one of the more obscure words and nothing came up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any ideas?</p>

            <p>Found the solution. You have to select only files that are capable of having tags applied to them. Then mulitselect, right click Properties, Details, Remove Properties and Personal Info.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the new dialog that pops up choose 'remove the following properties from the file(s)', then check the Tags box, OK out. Job done, but it took a while for 1800 files.</p>

You have a thirty (30) day grace period from the time of installation before activation would become mandatory. After the grace period ended, Windows Vista would not permit you to log on without activating.</p>

<p><strong><br />
You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong></p>
<p>If you don't like the letter Windows has assigned to a new drive or you want to organize your drive letters in a certain way, you can change the drive letter.You can assign the letters C through Z to each drive on your computer. A and B are usually reserved
 for floppy disk drives, but if your computer does not have floppy disk drives, you can assign A and B to volumes. You can see which drive letters are used on your computer by opening Computer.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
I have two notebooks running Vista. On each one I have an external USB or SATA drive that I use as a Backup partition.<br />
I have my own backup utility and I like to use drive letter B for Backup.<br />
<br />
When I change disks at times I have encountered this Parameter is incorrect problem on both computers - sometimes I can change using the above method and sometimes I can't.&nbsp; I have tried stopping disk caching, anti-virus etc etc etc with completely inconsistent
 results as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Today I tried booting into Safe Mode (F8 during boot) and tried the same steps as before and it worked at the first attempt.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is worth trying.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Password to another computer on local wired LAN</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am new to this community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to connect to my wife's computer on our wired LAN.&nbsp; I can see the computer just fine from Explorer.&nbsp; When I attempt to connect to one of the drives I am asked for a password.&nbsp; I have tried every password we have ever used for her MS account
 and I still am denied access.&nbsp; Is there a different password it is expecting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to reset any password I just do not know where I need to go or what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running through a Netgear 24 port PoE switch.&nbsp; Not having any problems reaching my NAS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another level is there a document or video that basically takes you through a primer on how to set up networking on Windows 10 (both wired and wireless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance!</p>

    <title>Netflix app -- Windows says I&#39;ve installed it, so where is it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Netflix app -- Windows says I&#39;ve installed it, so where is it&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought my new Toshiba laptop with Windows 8 last night, and I already seem to have screwed something up. Somehow or another, I seem to have removed the Netflix app I installed Classic Shell to get the start menu back, and from there tried to move
 the Netflix app shortcut to the desktop, or pin it to the taskbar. That didn't work, and now I can't find Netflix on the Start page.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went to the Store and re-installed the app, but it still isn't showing up. There's a red rectangle on the Start page that takes me to the Store, but it just says "your apps have been installed." When I go back and search for Netflix again, I can pull
 up its entry in the Store, but it says "you own this app" and won't let me try to re-install again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can go to Search (the magnifying glass icon on the right of the screen) and Netflix is listed there among my other apps. But when I click on it, it just takes me to that "your apps have been installed" page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong?</div>
                </div>

<p>I want to purchase this, but I have a quick question, When I purchase it, am I charged $59.99 instantly or am I charged $5 a month? Is there a monthly payment plan?</p>

<p>There are different GOLD memberships available. &nbsp; While youre in Xbox.com, click on 'My Account' in the upper right hand corner, just below your Gamertag. &nbsp;Then just below to the right of your avatar, click on the green bar titled 'Upgrade/Manage'. &nbsp;It will
 take you to a list of options available for gold membership purchase:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 month =$9.99 &nbsp;/ 3 months =$24.99 / 1 year =$59.99 /&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR family pack plan (up to 4 gamertags) $99.99 for one year.</p>
<p>As long as you have auto renewal on:</p>
<p>- If you purchase the 1 month, every month you'll be charged $9.99</p>
<p>- If you purchase the 3 months, you'll be charged 24.99 every 3 months </p>
<p>- If you purchase &nbsp;year, every year you'll be charge $59.99 in one transaction</p>

<p>You will be charged $59.99 up front and that will activate auto renewal, which will have you pay $59.99 every year unless you turn off auto renew. The $5 a month just reflects how much you will be saving each month if you're on the yearly plan. Though, there
 is a monthly plan that charges $9.99 a month, and again, if you opt in for the $9.99 monthly plan, auto renew will start up and charge your card that amount every month.</p>
