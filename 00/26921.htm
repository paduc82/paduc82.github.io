                    I use Microsoft Office 365 2013.&nbsp; Everything works ok except Outlook.&nbsp; Every once in a while when I start up Outlook it will delete all the emails in the inbox.&nbsp; I have lost some very important information because of it.&nbsp; There seems to be no solution
 so far.&nbsp; My OS is Windows 8 Pro.

            What kind of email account do you have, POP/SMTP, IMAP, Hotmail/Live Mail/Outlook.com, Exchange Server, something else? About the only way Outlook can do this by itself is if you have AutoArchive turned on and these messages meed the archiving criteria.
 Otherwise, the issue is usually due to an add-in/third party application, the most common of which is an email scanner provided by an Anti Malware application. Are you using one?<br />

<h2>            Lost Work - Word did not save locally or to SkyDrive</h2>
                    <p>I'm using MS Word 2013 linked with SkyDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last three hours I created and typed a new chapter, along with making several revisions to previous chapters. I have manually saved the document periodically, and Word is also set to automatically save every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this last save, something weird happened. The document reverted to the version from this morning -- which means at this time, all of my work performed today has become lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a .tmp file somewhere that I might be able to recover my work from?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>This exact thing happened to me as well - BUT I MANAGED TO FIND IT AGAIN!</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;after a whole day of work on a document on which i had been periodically saving, something funny happened with skydrive and then suddenly my document reverted back to how it had been the day before.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I looked at the folder on my computer for unsaved documents which you could recover, it wasn't there and on my computer it said that there were no older versions of the file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was absolutely gutted for about an hour but then i decided to look on my online skydrive profile to see if I could find it. After looking about it for a while it didn't seem to be there and it kept saying that there were no older versions of the file.
 But, after about 10 mins of looking around, I right-clicked on the document on the online skydrive profile and clicked to see the version history. And for some reason, about ten old versions of the file appeared, one of which was the one which I had lost!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if anyone's having this problem, I'd say trying doing this on your online skydrive profile. And maybe even check after about an hour or so, as it's possible that it just takes a little while for skydrive to show old versions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nevertheless, I don't think skydrive is terribly reliable because of how sporadic it was being in saving files, and so I'd definitely recommend just saving files to your local computer in the future, I definitely will be doing so!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this can help some other people. &nbsp;</div>

    <title>N8 video playlist - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosferati---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 video playlist</h2>
                    I'm waiting for this since about 3 years on Symbian.<br />
I'm able to create a music playlist but what about video?<br />
<br />
I can create *.m3u playlist of let's say *.mp4 files which is recognized by i.e. real player. Then I can copy it to my Video folder. However when I run it on my n8 the music player starts and plays audio only. How can I do this to force full video playback
 by video not music player?<br />
<br />
I think there is no way to do this right now. But I hope someone from Nokia will read this and will push it further. I think it's not hard or expensive to implement it in the future software release and it will add another great "PC-like" feature.<br />

There's a two way arrow icon in right bottom of screen? click that to bring up the "Menu &amp; Options"<br />
<br />
Otherwise press and hold "Menu" button (physical menu button between red and green call buttons) it'll bring up task manager, now long press browser icon, it'll give you the option to "Close" or "Exit"

<p>Do you mean the pen you use to draw on slides during a presentation?&nbsp; There's nothing much that can be done about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean the lines or curves you get when you use the Insert Shape command, you can rightclick and choose one of the compound line types, but I don't think that'll give you what you want (or at least what I'm guessing you might want from your example
 in the body of your message).</p>
<p>I think you'll need to draw the first line, press Ctrl+D to duplicate it, press left arrow twice then up arrow twice.&nbsp; That'll line the duplicate up with the original.&nbsp; Now hold Ctrl down while you use the down arrow to nudge the duplicate to the distance
 you want it from the original.&nbsp; I'd then choose both lines and group them.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make the date time screensaver stay on the whole time during lock screen, without pressing the optical navi-key?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Open Office Attachments in Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 3 and am trying Office 2016 through Office 365. Anytime I try to open an Excel or Word attachment, I get the splash screen like it's opening, and then I get the message that the application is not responding. I can open PDF
 attachments just fine and can open Office files from my computer or network.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>To identify whether the issue is related to the new Surface Pro 3, I recommend you try opening office attachments on another computer and check to see if the same issue will occur.</p>
<p>In addition, to do further troubleshooting, I’d like to collect the following information:
<br />
1.&nbsp;What’s your operating system version? With this information, I can try to reproduce the issue at my side.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you tried on other Outlook versions on those worked computer using your Office 365 account, then check to see if the same issue will occur, so I can rule out the account issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Vivian Wang</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>The same thing happens on all our windows based systems following our 365 Office 2016 upgrade.</p>
<p>We've found you need to disable "protective view for outlook attachments" which is enabled by default in all the office applications in Windows. You can find this option in File, Options, Trust Centre, Trust Centre Settings, Protective View.</p>
<p>Its not nice to disable trust settings but its the only thing we found sorted this issue for us. Hopefully someone from MS support can explain why the crash is so terminal when opening attachments and if there is a better fix.
</p>
<p>Hope this works for you and helps others.</p>

<p>I have found the exact same issue opening documents from Outlook Office 2016 or from the internet, protected view means it crashes. This is true for Word and Excel. After turning off protected view it now works. The word previewer in outlook 2016 also fails,
 and I noted it says it is trying to open in protected view. I have a surface pro 2, windows 10 and office 2016.</p>
<p>As a note, the protected turn off has to be done in the opening app (word or excel) rather than in outlook. Thanks for the work around - although not great to have protected view turned off!</p>

<p>I have the same issue. &nbsp;Outlook was working fine 2 days ago. &nbsp;I could preview attachments, open attachments, etc. &nbsp;Then something happened (possibly a Windows Update) and now I cannot preview or open Word, Excel, or Powerpoint Attachments unless I turn protected
 view off. &nbsp;While off, attachments will still not preview, they simply open in Read Only mode. &nbsp;I've also tried the save, change properties to unblock but that is very clunky at best. &nbsp;I've checked for Office and Windows Updates, my system is up to date. &nbsp;This
 is very frustrating. &nbsp;Has anyone heard of a real solution to this problem rather than just work-a-rounds?</p>

<p>I have the same problem with the wife's Outlook 2016 on a MS Surface Pro 4 Tablet. Disabling the hardware graphics acceleration took care of all the issues you all mention. Here's a quick and helpful blurb on the matter:</p>

<p>I had the same issue. First I did as Melanie did and disabled the graphics acceleration. You do this by:</p>
<p>File -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Display Section -&gt; (deselect) Hardware graphics acceleration.</p>
<p>However, this fix was not the root cause. The root cause I found to be was the displaylink driver for my monitor. After updating the driver for this, which it specifically said had an issue with protected mode of office, I no longer have the issue and have
 turned Hardware graphics acceleration back on. You can find the new driver here:</p>

<p>To do that, put the table inside a Text Box, then rotate the text box through 180°</p>

<h2>            Looking for an applescript to do paste plain text in  outlook</h2>
                    In Mac Word 2011 there is a ctl cmd v to do a paste special. I don't see this is Outlook 2011 when composing an email. I did find some examples of applescripts to do a plain text paste in Word. Does anyone have one to do the same thing in Outlook?

            Outlook has&nbsp;<b>Edit</b> menu --&gt; <i>Paste and Match Style</i>, which is equivalent to pasting plain text in Word. Even there the text will take on the currently applied style of the location where you're pasting.
<div><br />
<div>Optionally, you can also use the ribbon to change from HTML to plain text formatting. All pasted text will lose formatting altogether.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Using SELECT TOP to select the top 5 records in each category - for the resulting report.</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone help me with the SELECT statement below so that I only get the&nbsp;TOP 5 [GPA] scores in each [MoE Year Level]&nbsp;from the query SQL below?&nbsp; Hopefully I won't have to construct another query to achieve it.</p>
<p>SELECT [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry].Name, [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry].[MoE Year Level], [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry].A, [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry].M, [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry].E, IIf([MOE Year Level]&lt;13,(GPALow([A],[M],[E],100)),(GPATop([A],[M],[E],80)))
 AS GPA, IIf([E]&gt;50,"Excellence Certificate",IIf(([M]+[E])&gt;50,"Merit Certificate",IIf(([M]+[E]+[A])&gt;80,"NCEA Achieved","no cert"))) AS [General endorsements]<br />
FROM [NAME credit totals 2010 cqry];</p>
<p>Of course if it's easier - there may be some way of setting the selection on the report??</p>

    <title>How can I turn off Read Only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I turn off Read Only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have MS Word for Mac V. 15.20. &nbsp;After every update, my files open as Read Only files. &nbsp;How can I turn off Read Only? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that this question has been asked &nbsp;by others for many years, but none of the older answers apply to the current version of MS Word V 15.20 for the Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the top of the document is a bar that says “Read Only: To save a copy of this document, tap Duplicate.” &nbsp; I don’t want two copies of the document, just one. &nbsp;And why is it so difficult to turn off Read Only? &nbsp;It should be one click somewhere.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.<br />

            I've read about this issue when working from a network share. If that applies to you, try moving the documents to your user Documents folder (Users/YourUserName/Documents) and see if they open correctly there.

            <p>In my experience, this is very much dependent on the set up and version of the operating systems (Windows).&nbsp; You could try coding some macros, but it would probably be easier to just click the link then do Alt+Tab to move the focus to Excel.&nbsp; No need to

<h2>            Windows Store missing with latest updates</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm running Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 17063.rs_prerelease.171213-1610. Starting with the last release (I don't know the number. It was the one that I received immediately after that Fall release was official), the Windows Store (Is it called the
 Microsoft Store, now?) is completely missing. If I try to launch any Windows Store apps, they're missing as well. This includes the calculator and the feedback hub.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If I type "calc" into Cortana and click on the "Calculator+HD: Install App" that appears, I get the message: "You'll need a new app to open this: ms-windows-store". If I go into settings:Windows Insider Program and click on the "Give us feedback" link, it says
 "You'll need a new app to open this: feedback-hub"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I thought that perhaps the first preview after the Fall release had the store intentionally absent for updates. I it seems strange that it would still be missing with the latest update and that the Feedback Hub is missing from the Insider's Program.</p>

<p>Hi FOPETransitionAdmin,</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have modified your SR (Service Request) number.</p>
<p>I have checked the SR and find the case is related to email delivery and cutover migration. The SR opened at 19<sup>th</sup> and actually has been being handled from back end since them.</p>
<p>So, we suggest you keep communicating with the SR engineers as they’re more dedicated and professional then forum support. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia x6 16GB restarting after installing update v20.0.005</h2>
                    
<p>I've just used Ovi Suite to install the update v20.0.005 to my X6 16gb and now the phone keeps restarting.&nbsp; Before I installed the update, I did a back up of my phone contents.&nbsp; Now, after the update I can't restore the backup because the phone keeps restarting.&nbsp;
 My Ovi Suite is the latest version (v2.1.1.1).&nbsp; Is this a known issue and when will Nokia be releasing a patch for this update to fix the issue?</p>

<p>Try a hard reset</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hard reset (x6, 5800 and 5230 only) is done by the following (warning, this deletes all data on your phone):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.) Turn off the phone and remove battery for 5min<br />
<br />
2.) Reinsert battery<br />
<br />
3.) Press and hold the green, red and camera buttons. DO NOT LET GO.<br />
<br />
4.) While holding the three buttons, press the power key to boot the phone up.<br />
<br />
5.) Keep on pressing until you see the country selection screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A correctly done hard reset would show you that everything on the phone (contacts, messages, calendar entries, etc) would be deleted. So it is advisable to back them up. Upon restoration, do not restore settings or files if possible.</p>

<p>Well I've done a hard reset and put my back up back on the phone and the same thing is happening.&nbsp; What did you mean don't put the files and settings back on?&nbsp; Did you mean just redo the phone as if it were new? or transfer the backup back onto my phone.&nbsp;
 Seems an awful hassle if the backup utility cannot be used every time I update my phone!&nbsp; It takes ages!!!&nbsp; It's taken over an hour just to get my phone back to what it was before the hard reset.</p>

<p>Also, I'm having problems copying a few music files to my x6, whereas before the update, they just went straight on.&nbsp; I'm syncing a music folder from my pc to the phone by dragging it to the phone icon in Ovi Suite.&nbsp; Before it copied the whole folder and
 contents, now it'll copy one or two mp3's and the rest won't copy - I'm either doing something very wrong or the software update is useless.</p>

            You're doing something wrong because other people are not having problems.<br />
<br />
Yes I mean redo the phone as if new. NEVER EVER RESTORE FILES AND SETTINGS if you made a hard reset due to problems, especially after an update. Chances are you'll be restoring the problem. If you really need to restore files, do so, but at the risk of the
 problem coming back, so you'll have to copy them over or resync them from outlook.

<p>Well I copied all my contacts over to Outlook, copied my pics, music&nbsp;and vids over to a seperate folder on my pc and performed a hard reset again.&nbsp; Formatted the mass memory, unistalled Ovi Suite and all related drivers/progs and started from scratch.&nbsp; After
 reinstalling all progs/drivers and resyncing contacts with PC SUITE (not Ovi Suite) it was all fine and working correctly.&nbsp; Then I tried it with Ovi Suite and it switched off again.&nbsp; However, there was another update to Ovi Suite that I installed afterwards
 and the problem stopped.&nbsp; So, I went to my last backup (performed with Ovi Suite&nbsp;in the post above) and ignored all backup options except the settings one, put that back on and it works perfectly.&nbsp; A rather convoluted way of doing things but I got there in
 the end.&nbsp; It seems it was only doing it with Ovi Suite, with PC suite it was fine, but the little update I downloaded today seemed to resolve the whole thing.&nbsp; Happy days!!!&nbsp; I then copied all my music/pics and vids back to the appropriate floders and I have
 a happy phone again!&nbsp; Thanks for your help :-)</p>

            If a hard reset does not fix anything, then its time to take it to a Nokia Care Center. It may be an error in the embedded firmware. Or even a sudden hardware malfunction.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had my Nokia X6 for 3 months now and it has been working perfectly. However, two or three days ago I received a text message from the Nokia subscription service informing me of a new software update for the phone. The same update&nbsp; v20.0.005 that you
 mentioned. I went ahead and downloaded this using the official Nokia software updater that I have on my laptop, but since then my phone has been constantly restarting at random; up to 7-10 times a day at any given moment. I am not even getting enough time
 to backup any content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has Nokia or anyone found a solution apart from the hard reset as I tried that and it's not working. I am begining to regret ever updating the phoen I should just keep things old and un-updated seems to be better.</p>

    <title>OneNote does not accept password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daffyduckkangaroo  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote does not accept password</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My OneNote was syncing fine -- I have upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 -- but then all of a sudden it wouldn't accept my password. Each time that it asked for the password&nbsp;for the Microsoft account to sync OneNote, it re-asked, over and over again.
 But I know the password is correct because it's the same password that&nbsp;I use to open my PC, and it works. I can't understand what's happening. &nbsp; The error message that appear is:
<strong>"A password is required to synchronize this notebook. (Error code: 0xE0000024)."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that&nbsp; a few days ago, a message popped up asking if I wanted to upgrade my OneNote -- I have&nbsp;OneNote 2010 downloaded&nbsp;from a Microsoft Office CD -- and I declined. Perhaps that has something to do with it, but I can't imagine why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several hours later: it still isn't working,&nbsp;and I looked&nbsp;at my Windows phone and there's also a problem. Under "email &amp; accounts" it says there's a problem with connecting to the Hotmail, or Live, accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, while my password is correct, because I see that it allows me to login to my PC, I vaguely remember that it was different from what I thought, or what is working now; still, it should sync since the password is&nbsp; correct and it was syncing fine until
 yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I appreciate the link, but that link linked to two other links, which also linked to various links. One of the suggestions was that I clear out the OneNote cache, but I couldn't follow those instructions and I don't want to fiddle around with folders without
 knowing exactly what I'm doing.&nbsp; I can't even find the cache folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other links suggest I download some updates that will fix the problem, but I don't feel safe downloading an update from a link, within a link, within a link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Hi, i have identified an issue with this version. I am testing Office 2016 downloaded from MSDN, we have multiple subscriptions. Before the update, Outlook HTML signatures were working just fine, after the update, the email signatures are displayed as greyed
 out boxes, but only when you are composing an email... from Sent Items, they are displayed correctly, also, all email recipients get the images... i have tested this in 4 virtual machines, with 4 different user accounts and every time i updated Office to this
 latest version, the issue happened. All test VMs without the update continue to work just fine. Is this a known issue?
