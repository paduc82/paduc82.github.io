<h2>            The Surge DLC not working &#40;Xbox Game Pass for PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded both the game and free DLCs, however after doing their pre-requisites I can't get the enemies with the DLC armor and weapons to spawn. Looking through the folders, it seems like the DLC and base game are split into different folders. Is
 it meant to be like that for installing games from the Xbox App?</p>

            Have you tried installing again? Sometimes it corrects some problem that is happening.

<p>I have paid your wages for more than 10 years, xbox and microsoft. Stop banning people for meanial infractions, especially when during your "investigation" you see it was instigated. The xbox code enforcement is a joke of an entity, banning paying customers
 for a month at a time, then claiming you cannot take up the matter qith customer support. Weird, you're not allowing me to use my xbox now, which encompasses many other apps for which i pay to use. This is theft at very least. Also, a ***-poor business tact.
 Most likely going to call and verbally accost&nbsp;some unlucky member of the customer service team, when really my issue is aimed at the cowardly assassins in Xbox Code Enforcement.</p>

<p>Regretting giving you thousands of dollars over the years,</p>

<p>How is it theft? You agreed to abide by the ToU/CoC when you started your account which means you agreed that you will be punished if you are caught braking the ToU/CoC.</p>
<p>Customer support are nothing whatsoever to do with xbox live enforcement so can't help you.</p>

<p>Defending yourself isn't a violation of CoC. Stop being so liberal and punishing your customers. You have no business in governing what people say to each other. Your business is in accosting cheaters and those who actually affect gameplay. You're not the
 government. You're not our parents. We pay you so that we can have fun, and we can't even trust you to deliver. I've been an Xbox fan my entire life, and this is how I'm repaid?</p>

<p>In this situation I think the OP is probably guilty. &nbsp;He seems rather excitable and doesn't even try to say he's innocent. &nbsp;The enforcement team is not always correct daft. &nbsp;I was banned from communications under false pretense. &nbsp;He has a point about not
 being able to communicate with the enforcement team or not being presented with the evidence against you. &nbsp;The enforcement team needs to be held accountable. &nbsp;A start would be a dialog and &nbsp;specific proof. &nbsp;You can't truly believe they are right 100% of the
 time, can you?</p>

<p>Please point out where I said the enforcement team are always right?</p>
<p>The enforcement team always investigate a report thoroughly before giving someone a ban/suspension so I highly doubt you were banned under a false pretence.</p>
<p>Again,under the ToU/CoC that you agree to the enforcement team are under no obligation to show you any evidence they have found that results in a ban/suspension.</p>
<p>You can always ask for a case review if you receive enforcement action against your account.</p>

<p>The reason I said you said the enforcement team is always right is because you never think anyone professing innocence is telling the truth. &nbsp;I have seen you posts in similar situations and you always take the same stance. &nbsp;I was completely &nbsp;innocent. &nbsp;I
 was highly ranked on a certain games leaderboard and a group of jealous trolls blatantly told me they were falsely reporting me to get me suspended. &nbsp;They did. &nbsp;All my attempts to plead my case were met with paste and copy reponses. &nbsp;A lot like yours</p>

<h2>            Windows Reset Interrupted Before It Finished</h2>
                    I attempted to reset Windows 8 (clean install) and the PC shut down before the process completed. Now I am unable to load windows. Attempt at repairs doesn't work .Booting from the CD/DVD drive is not working, as the laptop is not recognizing the device.
 What are my options to try and reinstall Windows?

<h2>            Single player or multi player, what&#39;s your preference&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What do you prefer out of single player and multi player and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me multiplayer wins as it alters the dynamics of a game so much. Your team makes a big difference if they are good or bad, the experience can be much better due to the chat and banter, and if you pull off a sneaky move or special play it feels better
 knowing someone on ither side is watching the screen thinking how on earth did they do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont get me wrong I love SP also, elder scrolls and fable are favourite series and I enjoy strategy and building games also. But that feeling&nbsp; when you distracted someone and then sneak up behind and finish them or wipe out a team of 4 single handed. That's
 the best</p>

<p>Single player titles lets you enjoy the game without any competiveness while multiplayer does. Multiplayer lets you jam with friends and just takes gaming to a much higher fun level.</p>

            I love playing with friends on multiplayer and it's a great way to pass the time while catching up with friends you haven't seen or talked to in a while, so I'll never ever stop playing multiplayer games, but I really prefer the strong narrative story
 games.&nbsp; It's one of the reasons why Remedy is one of my favorite developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Could be because I do not fully understand this aspect of windows very well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Glen,</p>
<p>You really can safely ignore DCOM errors. They are one of windows most notorious errors but do not usually cause any problems.</p>
<p>You can read about them here. There are fixes all over the internet to edit permissions but that in itself can cause problems with windows.</p>

<p>Thank you! I have ignored them in the past for that very reason. I attempted a permission change in the past but nothing corrected it nor made it worse so I just left it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However - today marks the first time in 4 years my computer has crashed - I kid you not. I run a clean/stable system and I am OCD about how I do things. My event log has 4 errors. The first 2 are DCOM, the next 2 are Event IDs 45 and 46 relating to crash
 dump drivers / volmgr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>45: The system could not successfully load the crash dump driver.</p>
<p>46:&nbsp;Crash dump initialization failed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far the only thing I found as a possibility was to move the page/swap file to the system disk in lieu of soft mirrored disk. It hasn't crashed yet, but I also haven't repeated the task that facilitated the crash (creating a PDF from Revit (BIM software).
 The system specs are more than adequate for my use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to chase this down?</p>

<p>When looking around on the internet I found the same as you about&nbsp; the page / swap file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may have just been a coincidence with the PDF . Perhaps see if there is an update to the PDF program also. You may have fixed the issue by moving the swap file back to the system disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also saw something about hibernation in a few places in conjunction with this error.</p>
<p>Perhaps just try what you were doing and see if it happens again. If not you may have fixed it. Best thing to do now is wait and see.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />DCOM error 10016 is usually harmless and present on most of Window 10 devices. You can safely ignore them.
<br />
<br />If you still like to fix, here's how:

<h3> ralph sutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting TrueColor 32 in Wondows 7</h2>
                    I set my colour option by "Screen Resolution"-"Advanced Settings"-"Monitor"-"Color" Set as "True Color 32".&nbsp; It sets OK.<br />
<br />
However, when I re-boot, I find that the colour setting has reverted to "256 Color.<br />
<br />
How can I make the colour setting to remain permanently as "True Color 32", please?<br />

<p>Hey everyone i would really love some help asap with this.</p>
<p>When playing any games for over 20-30mins max my game/xboxlive stuff example my xbox live party will all disconnect and then eventually ill lose connection to the game and then ill disconnect from xbox live. and i need to wait at least the same amount of
 time for it to feel like its cooled down from the outside but ik its not cooled down internally!</p>
<p>I really would love to get this fixed these forums have helped me in the past with connection issues now its this...and i really cant buy much things or send it in if thats the case....and i dont think i should have to..to get it fixed and also the xbox
 360 is on my dresser next to a tv i dont have much room and this is most likely the only place for it at the time.</p>

<p>I'm afraid due to your poor place for the xbox sitting at the moment, that overheating problems will occur. If it is not getting proper ventilation, then the console will overheat, and suffer problems like this.</p>

            Hi  trippleddd,
<br />
<br />Was Windows 10 Home, previously installed and activated on your PC?
<br />
<br />If so, you can go form Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Home, you will however have to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 Home . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            You can try your luck with the following method, but if it does not work, you will need to perform a clean install of Windows 10 Home:
<br />
<br />55. Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />56. Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />57. Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />58. Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />59. Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />60. Close the Registry Editor
<br />61. Insert the Windows 10 Home installation media, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />62. When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key and select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />63. Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work...
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Yes, although it's not really a downgrade, it's possible by clean installing Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why do you want to do this? Are you aware that Home is just a subset of&nbsp; of Professional? Anything that runs in Home will also run in Professional. If you want to run some program that says it needs Home, what it mean is that it needs *at least* Home.</p>

<h2>            Browsers can&#39;t access the web after Windows update, unless a non-system drive is mounted</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the latest Win10 update to 1697 build 14393.1358, IE11 can no longer access the internet. The update was performed while 3 internal disk volumes were mounted: SSD C:\ (Windows), D:\ (holds several browser profiles), and E:\ (large data drive).</p>
<p>Now when I start IE, it can only access the web when drive E:/ is mounted, despite IE profile is kept on D:\. If E:\ is dismounted, IE posts error "Can't detect proxy settings" with empty pages. Same behavior from Firefox after that update: just opens empty
 pages, no reaction to clicks on links, unless E:\ is mounted. Windows Resource Monitor shows, E:\ partition is not accessed at all during web browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Edge works normally, but it had profile on C:\ , while other browsers had their profiles symlinked to D:\ . My assumption is, since E:\ is much larger and had more free space, during the update it was probably set in Registry as System drive for some
 functions like Security or Networking, and without it present IE no longer works properly, thus also affecting Firefox. Resetting browser prefs and uninstalling &amp; reinstalling IE and FF doesn't help. However, there are no system files present on E:\.</p>
<p>How it can be fixed? May be resetting network or security related settings in Windows?</p>

                    I recently noticed that my Gamerscore went down. I think it might be due to the backwards-compatible Call of Duty: Black Ops game that I recently started playing but I'm not sure. Tonight, while trouble-shooting, I have seen 3 different gamerscores attached

 when I turned on my 360 console but before signing into Live. I even took a picture to prove I wasn't going crazy! After signing into Live, my 360 console updated that gamerscore back down to 94355. Gamerscore #3: 96425 I saw this gamerscore on my Xbox One

<p>same here. I've recently been achievement hunting for the last month or so and have got 6000-7000 GS which put me up to 89,810 and now today out of nowhere while I was playing it bumped all the way down to 82,575. I hope it doesn't stay like this cause i'll

            <p>Hey there Jasmin Rice!</p>
<p>Generally the Gamerscore you see here on Xbox.com is the correct score, although it's odd that you're not see consistency between your Xbox One and Xbox 360. Because you are part of the Xbox One Update Preview, you'll want to post your issue over in the Preview Forums, as we are unable to support users taking part in the Preview Update. Thanks!</p>

<p>Mister Maka - Yes, per my post right above yours, I did post this in the Preview Forums and got a response there. I just updated my post here with the Preview Forums response I received for others who may have a similar issue. I agree that generally, the
 Xbox.com gamerscore is usually the correct score but something is definitely *** up somewhere.</p>

<p>I was in the preview program but opted out about 2 months ago. I found out that all of my recently played 360 games (backwards compatible or not) is whats glitched as one minute it says i have 0/1000 on those games and the next itll be back to the normal
 amount.</p>

<h2>            Start up menu and Microsoft Edge not working</h2>
                    My start up menu and Microsoft Edge are both not working in my windows 10. I have tried all the methods suggested in Microsoft community including the cmd and powershell command and resetting the pc. It was still not fix even I've reset the pc, instead
 my other browsers like Google Chrome was uninstalled as well and I have no browsers at all to use since Microsoft edge is not working as well. Also switching user doesn't work because no windows pop up after I clicked the add new user button. What should I
 do now? My laptop is like totally useless now without start up menu and any usable browser.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DWM.exe is Desktop Window Manager.</p>
<p><br />
It is a windows process which needs to be started for the aero and other features to work on windows 7.<br />
DWM is that gives you all those pretty effects in Windows Vista or Windows 7 Transparent windows, live taskbar thumbnails , and even the Flip3D switcher that you can disable and replace with Switcher.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><br />
I suggest that you check whether Desktop Service Manager is running.<br />
To do this:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Start</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type "services" in the start search box.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now check status of the "Desktop Service Manager".</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If it is disable set it to “Automatic’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><span>You can try performing <b>Clean Boot</b> and check if the issue still persists to view how to perform the clean boot click on the link provided below and follow the Kb article steps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer:</span></b><span> <span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem follow
<b>Step 7</b> to <span>reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try performing <b>SFC (System File Checker)</b> scan<span>&nbsp;
</span>on your computer and check if the issue still persists. To view how to perform the
<b>SFC Scan</b> click on the link provided and follow the Kb article steps.</span></p>

    <title>Can not turn off Media Streaming for Guest Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr_photo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not turn off Media Streaming for Guest Account </h2>
                    
<p>I have turned off (disabled) the guest account on my windows 7 home premium (64 bit) machine.&nbsp; However, the Guest account still shows up as streaming media from my Playstation 3.&nbsp; If I turn on (enable) the guest account and log into it on the computer, then
 I can see that Media Streaming is indeed turned on in the Advanced Network Configuration... but there's not clear way to turn it off (I think because the guest account has limited administrative rights).</p>
<p>I had thought that turning off the guest account using the Manage Accounts config screen would turn off media sharing by default, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a way to disable it manually??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Mat</p>

<h2>            Failed driver install sharp mx-b402 on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Attempting to install driver for sharp mx-b402. The printer is attached directly to a router. I am using an HP 64 bit machine and attempting to install Sharps 64 bit driver.&nbsp; I have installed Norton 360 software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>InstallSield detects the printer and executes the install up to this screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7c22e5a-90e5-4734-ab7d-b3126247d15b" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The install continues as follows:</p>
<p>1) get a message "Reading Information.....Please Wait"</p>
<p>2) next a progress bar is displayed and it appears that the process completes.</p>
<p>3) get a message "setting up devices"</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;HERE is the problem.&nbsp; Installshield loops back to the screen pictured above.&nbsp; If "next" is clicked, the "reading Information" process begins again.&nbsp; If cancel is selected, InstallShield says installation incomplete.&nbsp; When I go to the 'drivers' folder,
 there is a MX-B402 folder with subfolder and files written to it.&nbsp; When I click on 'devices' the MX-b402 is listed but there is a message that the driver is not available.&nbsp; So I (naively) conclude that the machine recognizes the printer location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have tried so far without success.&nbsp; In each case the machine is stuck in the same loop described above.</p>
<p>1) tried many combinations of custom installations with various options (eg. PS and CPL6 etc.)</p>
<p>2) tried this and older drivers in compatibility mode</p>
<p>3) tried turning off Norton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Ok, I did fix this issue by installing the driver for windows 7 but the one with WQHL version. because windows 8 has more security we have to install the actual hardware driver. ( make sure to run it as administrator).</p>

    <title>Problem purging emails from Gmail via Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raiderron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem purging emails from Gmail via Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I access my gmail account through Windows Live Mail 2012 on an ASUS Laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that when I attempt to Empty the Trash Folder, I'm getting some messages re-appear in my Spam Folder. Over the last 12 months I've built up about a dozen messages that keep doing this. I believe they all originally arrived in my Spam folder,
 but not every message that arrives in my Spam folder behaves like this 12 or so do. What happens is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The message arrives in the Spam folder</p>
<p>2. I delete the message, and it moves to the Trash folder</p>
<p>3. When I empty the Trash folder, all messages disappear from there, but these 12 or so re-appear in my Spam folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted these messages dozens of times, but I can't seem to get rid of them permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why you're seeing this phenomenon for only a few messages, but it might be worth pointing out that Gmail has an idiosyncratic way of classifying messages. It applies labels, rather than assigning messages to folders. Any given message can have
 more than one label, so this becomes problematical when a mail client like Windows Live Mail tries to translate those labels into folders. When you delete a message, you apply the 'deleted' label to it, but&nbsp;some of them&nbsp;clearly still have&nbsp;their 'spam' label.
 You might be able to get rid of them permanently by dragging them to the 'deleted' folder, whatever it's called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you might want to&nbsp;review all your Gmail IMAP settings. </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://mail.google.com</span>&nbsp;and log in. Click the settings cog&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsbm6za.dm2303.livefilestore.com%2fy2pXyjrmtekAck0S-sgGLY6yZ3S2Eoe-o-4B1TsHw2W2Z_JuLzR_qU8rL0CdTMK3chkY7O_fylLrF3ktMmZBYlu_wbDKzU99O2-3H8d_iH6dEg%2fGmail-settings-cog-1.png%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;and
 select <em>Settings</em>. </li><li>Under <em>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</em>, select <em>Auto-Expunge Off</em></li><li>Under <em>Labels</em>, select the labels you want to see in Windows Live Mail. These will become separate folders, so fewer is usually better to avoid duplication. In particular, you don't want
<em>All mail </em>(which is just that - all messages in all folders). I have&nbsp;opted to hide
<em>Starred </em>and <em>Important </em>also.&nbsp;</li><li>Make a note of the names of the special folders - I see <em>Sent mail</em>, <em>
Drafts</em>, <em>Spam</em> and <em>Bin</em>. </li><li>Back in Windows Live Mail, <br />
<strong>Reset the list of IMAP folders: </strong></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click on the account name in the folder pane and then press Alt-S F to open the
<em>Show/hide IMAP folders</em> dialogue. Click <em>Reset List</em> to refresh the folder list, then use the buttons to show only the folders you want to see.</li></ul>
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the IMAP tab, select
<em>Store special folders on IMAP server,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;then enter the server's names for the special folders in the boxes. If the folder for sent messages in webmail is called
<em>Sent Mail</em>, then enter <em>Sent Mail </em>into the box alongside <em>Sent Items path
</em>and so on. It's important to be clinically accurate with folder names - <em>
Sent Mail</em> is not the same as <em>Sent mail</em>.</li></ul>
</strong></em><strong>folders work the same way for all accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, select
<em>Use the 'Deleted Items' folder for IMAP accounts</em>.</li></ul>

            <p>Firedog,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tips...they have certainly helped my clean up how gmail looks in Wndows Live Mail. Turning off All mail, Starred and Important makes it all look a lot cleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all the other settings, and they looked pretty much as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my trash folder set up so it only empties when I initiate it manually, which I typically do about once a month, and co-incidentally thats about the time frame between these messages I'm seeing come back into my Spam folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if its doing something strange like not cleanly deleting the first or last message that has come from the Spam folder into the Trash folder? Might set up a few scenarios and test the theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will let you know how I go, unless you have any other ideas in the meantime?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/989f32ee-db9b-488c-8c2a-ea6845c73e88" title="Nachappa C K">
Nachappa C K,</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your response. I'm using a brand new Dell laptop; it's only 9 days old. The only apps I've installed are Norton 360 and Firefox. I had also installed Dropbox thinking it was part of Windows 10 (silly me) but some time after that I received
 "Critical Error. Your Start menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in". Cortana disappeared as well. I had read that Dropbox could be the culprit so I uninstalled it. The Start Menu came back but not Cortana. In addition to those 3
 apps, I installed a printer driver and made some shortcuts. Microsoft Office 16 Student and Home came pre-installed. I purposely didn't install any of my usual software yet (such as Photoshop, a video editor, FTP program, etc.) because if I encountered a problem,
 I wanted to be able to figure out which installation was causing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure my settings were correct: location and language. They were. I also checked to see if there were any pending Windows updates, but Windows was all up-to-date. I've used System Restore a number of times on my old Windows 7 laptop, but haven't tried
 it yet on this one. It's the only thing I can think of that could possibly fix the problem. I just hope there's a pre-Dropbox restore point. I will try that.</p>

            I ended up calling Dell about a different problem (Adobe Acrobat wouldn't run) and they fixed Cortana for me. It was a Win 10 setting about show/don't show, but I'm not exactly sure which one or where. Sorry. Many thanks for your help.
