<h2>            Side by Side or Resizing Windows on Desktop for Surface RT</h2>
                    When I am using Word or Xcel on the desktop, it would be great to put two different documents side-by-side.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I tap the document out of "full view" it shrinks it down to a little box, and there seems to be no option to resize it.&nbsp; What
 must I do differently?

<p>on the Desktop you can arrange the opend Windows by using the Windows-Key and the arrows-Keys together.</p>

            Hi jenny, while Microsoft no longer supports Photo Gallery, it is still downloadable and runs fine on Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Windows Essentials latest version 16.4.3528.0331:

            Hi Jenny.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Windows Live Essentials are discontinued and actively being shut down now.  So I would transition to the Windows 10 Photos and Mail apps which are better and work great, anyway.  
<br />

<p>This was a response given in another reply.&nbsp; I tried but Windows defender cut it out</p>
<p>Any comment</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help. Photo gallery was simple to use and effective, tho limited,&nbsp; But I found it better to use for quik unsophisticated improvements to most photos. &nbsp;&nbsp; I really don't want to go down the fiddly route, nor the photo elements route. It is such
 a shame it has been changed. Another simple enjoyable hobby bites the dust in the Third Age.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish I'd changed to Apple a few years ago.</p>

<p>The Windows 10 photo editing is not a patch on the Eassentials editor. I used to enter photo editor competitions with photos improved with Photo Gallery. Also I taught retired people how to use it to improve their work. The Win 10 version is appallingly
 poor. Nowhere near as professional . Ive stopped entering competitions and can no longer demonstrate to older people. So very very sad as photography was a big hobby.</p>
<p>Im too old to transfer to Apple but I am looking into this as Im am so disappointed once again with Win 10. &nbsp; On a different subject Ive had to leave my Hotmail account . So many important documents were going missing / deleted it became dangerous. &nbsp; So
 sad after 25 yrs</p>

<p>I tried this but looked too dodgy. I revisited it and tried but it didn't work. Thanks for trying I really really miss this . Win 10 version is of no value at all.&nbsp; So Ive lost one of my best loved hobbies. The adobe Elements is a possibility but as always
 the later versions become too complex.</p>

<p>Tags mean nothing to me at all. All I know was I got&nbsp; quick and simple results with simple controls. Exposure , Highlights , shadows , crop, straighten , etc etc. Photos were transformed enough to put into amateur competitions and do well. &nbsp; Win 10 isn't
 a patch on that or at least whatever it I'm using when my photos appear. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I may have to buy Adobe Elements. The later Elements like all software becomes more complex with the years so even that might not suit an amateur older photographer. Very sad.</p>

                    There is this app on my task bar that doesn't exist. It's MS word 2016, and I have the current version of word downloaded. The task bar icon has no image, and when I click to try run it, nothing happens. If I search up the the MS Word 2016 it cannot be
 found. If I right click on the task bar icon, to try unpin it, it just says pin to task bar (which it is already on).

            Hi Andrew <br />
<br />
This may be worth a try: <br />
<br />
Open File Explorer <br />
<br />
In the Address Bar, paste this and hit Enter <br />
<br />
%AppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar <br />
<br />
Do you see that Word 2016 icon in that folder, if so, delete it . . .

<h3> top1woman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crashes with no warning</h2>
                    <p>This is not an upgrade or new installation. &nbsp;The desktop computer is new (about 4 months old), and came with Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 2 days ago, it began to crash. &nbsp;On reboot I received a "CMOS checksum error", followed by the message "No hard drive detected".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, the system crashed 5 more times. &nbsp;Each time, it rebooted automatically. &nbsp;And now, webcam, which was working within an app I use frequently (Book Collector from Collectorz.com) no longer scans the bar codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the hardware vendor today, and he ran the WhoCrashed app. &nbsp;The dmp file dated 5/22 indicated the error: &nbsp;rt64.sys driver IRQL not less or equal</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was followed by a SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION &nbsp;pointing to a ZoneAlarm driver, vsdatant.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related information: &nbsp;This problem began in earnest after the latest two Window patches automatically installed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have placed a zip file containing the dmp files in the cloud on OneDrive. &nbsp;I have also uploaded a file containing complete system information to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Inspiron 24-5459</p>
<p>BIOS: &nbsp;2.4.0</p>
<p>UEFI ROM: &nbsp;Build 4302.10</p>

<h2>            xbox one game and app freezes then shuts down</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have been having problems my game and apps open at the same time, I play a game called hitman and I watch YouTube for guides.</p>
<p>I would play the game then I would pause my game and open YouTube without closing the game, then I will re-open the game.</p>
<p>the game would be at a black screen frozen, after 5 seconds I would hear a pop near the Xbox or its power box, then it will turn off my console, sometime it would turn back on ,by its self, or I have to hit the power button, after turning it back on ,its
 on the Xbox loading</p>
<p>screen not at the home menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please give me instructions how to fix it.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this happening on any game when using Youtube or only on Hitman?</p>
<p>If it's only Hitman then I suggest trying the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall the game, </p>
<p>2. manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>3. Install something else like a Demo for a game</p>
<p>4. Install Hitman again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this happens for all games where Youtube is used, then I suggest trying to Uninstall and Reinstall the Youtube app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't fix anything you can also consider doing a Factory Reset of the console (with keeping games and apps installed) to see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

    <title>Movie Maker detects my digital video camera but does not import Video - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Movie Maker detects my digital video camera but does not import Video</h2>
                    My computer and MS Movie Maker appear to connect to my DV Camera with no problem, but when I attempt to import video,
<div>it does not capture anything and just shows the black screen. MS Movie Maker correctly rewinds the tape and begins playback on my camera. I have updated the software on PC and laptop, after updating the import worked on laptop but not on PC. Drivers for
 video are up to date and I can see other content and photos in Movie Maker. I just can't get the import to function. Checked the Codex, which checked out ok, with MS tools. Any ideas?</div>

            <p>In your post you mention a dv camcorder, but in your picture it shows Import HD.</p>
<p>Can you confirm the make and model of cam and that you are trying to capture dv video, via firewire.</p>
<p>This capture is also normally done via via windows live video acquire wizard and then inserted in photo gallery,&nbsp; can you confirm this is how you are trying to capture.</p>

            <p>You are correct that I am connected via Firewire. I am importing from a Sony HDR-HC3. I am using the "Import from Device" option in which I am attempting to import from a Sony HDR-HC3. I get this screen below when I select Import from Device:</p>

<p>I select Sony HDR - HC3 and select Import which gives me the screen I showed in the original post. I am not using the Video Acquire Wizard, because when my camera is connected, nothing pops up.</p>

<p>You may need to install the legacy firewire driver, see</p>

<p>Where can I pre-order the Epic edition of Gears of War 3.</p>
<p>I went and called all the Gamestops/EBgames near me and they are all out of stock?</p>
<p>Amazon.ca doesn't seem to have any sort of real listing for it.</p>
<p>While I still haven't gotten a response from the big box stores like Future Shop and Best Buy.</p>
<p>Does anyone know anywhere that still has stock?</p>

 I have to switch it off and on again for the display to work properly. I don't really want to have to reset it to fix it.

<h2>            Unwanted Cropping</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Movie Maker issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3502.922)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I am building a slide show of still pictures,&nbsp; photo's taken with a point and shoot camera and have an aspect ratio of (I think) 4:3 appear fine with no cropping or distortion and black bars on either side.&nbsp; However photo's taken on a digital SLR with a wider
 aspect ratio (but not 16:9) are appearing full frame but with the top and bottom of the&nbsp;image cropped out,&nbsp; this is causing some of the compositions of these pictures to be wrecked.&nbsp; I have the aspect ratio for the display set at 16:9. I would like these pictures
 to appear with the full image and black bars on either side just like the pictures from the point and shoot.&nbsp; Strangely the SLR pictures appear correct with the black bars in the thumbnails in the work area, but not in the larger image on the left or when
 displayed full screen, also vertical images from both cameras appear correctly with full image and wide black bars.&nbsp; Any advice on making the SLR pictures appear fully with not unwanted cropping would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Joseph:&nbsp; I have not tried this with other images from other SLR cameras, I will give it a try.&nbsp; I am not sure exactly what the proportions of the frame are but it seems to be the same as 35mm film.&nbsp; I have tried making a short clip of the movie and
 the images remain cropped top and bottom as in the preview.<br />
<br />

            Hello Eugene:&nbsp; Here are two sample files which I hope will show the difficulty I am having.&nbsp; The first one (DSCN....) is from the point and shoot and should display the image fully in Movie maker,&nbsp; the second (ANZ...) is from the SLR and is one of the
 files I have been getting&nbsp;cropping from the top and bottom in Movie Maker.<br />
<br />

            Hi <span>EN6004, <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Windows Live Global Escalations Team. Your issue is currently being investigated as we speak and I am currently consulting our product experts regarding the matter. I am trying to get the some confirmation from them about this issue
 since the sample photos that you have provided are somehow more than what the default aspect ratios that Windows Live Movie Maker has. Your patience is highly appreciated on this matter and I'll get back to you as soon as I receive an update from them about
 this issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span>

                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I installed app Movies and TV and it rus great, but there is some issue.</p>
<p>If it is few audio in the movie I can use only Dolby Digital, AC3 formats with low bitrate. When I am trying to choose DTS or Atmos track it just flips back on AC3. App sees all tracks but runs only AC3 formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox oneX is pluged to reciver Sony STR-DN1080 and then from reciver to TV.</p>
<p>In Xbox settings I turened on bitstreaming by HDMI for Dolby Atmos.</p>

<p>Hi ArtymanRU,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible there is some issue with the connection through the receiver causing it to not play Dolby Atmos by bitstream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
<p>
</p><p>At this point reconnect the Xbox to the receiver. Once you reconnect, turn on the Xbox and see what you hear.</p>

<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can remember, there's none. The PC was updated already to Windows 10 when I applied BitLocker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also, tried connecting the drive to other PC (e.g. windows 7) and "The recovery key is not available in this device" is shown. I have saved the recovery key though. I also tried connecting the drive with other USB ports but it is showing same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Remove the drive from whatever port you have it plugged into and try in another port. You can check is to see if there are any new updates available for your BIOS. Look for any changes there might
 be a list and if there have been any changes to the TPM, run that update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And make sure that your system settings are all correct for the port you’re using.</span></p>

            <p>it still does the DING sound when i save an EXCEL file to a folder. &nbsp;annoying. Need that removed. &nbsp;why ding? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh wait a second.<strong> I figured this out.</strong></p>
<p>I am used to double-clicking when opening folders because that is what we do in File explorer. you click it twice.</p>
<p>So when i do a File save as in Excel and then see the Browse folder, i think i should click it twice (rapid double click).</p>
<p>nope!<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> in this case, you need to only click once!</span> &nbsp;hard to train mind for that when it is always a double.</p>
<p><br />
So the case of the ding is solved. Yay! &nbsp;just one click in this type of folder!!</p>

<h3> aj  h.pronounced ayejaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            16GB not enough and 32GB maximum SD Card allowed, can I merge 16 with 32 as 1 Partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My small Widows10 tablet Only has&nbsp; a maximum 16GB pre-installed&nbsp;for&nbsp;use, and an 32GB micro SD card also it's maximum allowable&nbsp;Card size and definitely no higher... I am desperate for someone who&nbsp;really knows about the advice I am seeking.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you are reading
 this now, this is my first question of most value to me and my nice little windows 10 tablet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Can I merge&nbsp;my 32GB&nbsp;SD Card with the 16GB C: Drive for more storage? Just that &nbsp;I have had to reformat it quite a few times now from attempt to attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding
 nothing in the build and removing apps&nbsp;unnecessary etc. has had no benefits in being able to do the necessary updates like 1511 (Cortana).&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing that I should be able to merge both the 16GB hard drive with the 32GB SD Card into 1 partition, without
 harming any performance or apps from working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reformatting several times, I am not winning. The space needed when it keeps trying to update and smaller updates prior, keep blocking me from continuing. When the first format was done the hard drive needed an additional 12GB's + or-&nbsp;something GB's
 and on my last attempt I got it down to only wanting an extra 4GB = or -. somethings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these examples, I certainly would have had no space left anyhow, in order to continue on enjoying the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet even though labelled with Microsoft etc and a proud windows 10 on it was from Bauhn Spere. And they told me to roll it backward into 8 and be happy with it just working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read and heard that what I want to&nbsp;have is it working as best as possible. to&nbsp;simply expand the overall storage via&nbsp;creating a single&nbsp;partition or using the 32GB Micro SD Card as the Primary drive, boot and all...&nbsp;everyone knows that its expected
 to work, but&nbsp; little slower, to me that's acceptable... will work would be a great answer, but now I need to know exactly how? And or any other methods that will have just as beneficial outcomes for me... Thank you... AJAY...</p>

<p>So far from my experience with the game:</p>
<p>-Doesn't log in most of the time<br />
-Kicks you out and says error 318 - spam, even if you don't spam<br />
-My friend can't see me even though we are right next to each other on the map and I can't see him<br />
-Vibration isn't even used in combat, I have only had it while fishing... FISHING<br />
-NPCs are invisible and you can't talk to them sometimes<br />
-Pressing A to interact with something doesn't work most of the time<br />
-Serious rubber banding<br />
-In game friends list doesn't show friends (Might show one or two but doesn't update)</p>
<p>More added:</p>
<p>-You can't have more than 2 people in a group<br />
-Inviting players through xbox one friends list does nothing<br />
-Queue lists you as #1, why is there even a queue...</p>

<p>I returned the pc version for a refund after one week,due to not able to log in and being disconnected after 10min of play all the time. Looks like I will be doing it again.
</p>
<p>You cant log in, getting dc, and lag. The prison map works ok but when in the world it fails. After this long wait for what is an average game it should be better.

<p>Some of these have been repaired with the maintenance schedule but I will still be returning the game, mainly due to the low quality of gameplay and continuing issues requiring "workarounds"</p>
<p>maybe I will pick it up after they have had a chance to beta the beta, starting to feel like an apple</p>
<p>btw if anyone has any advice on getting the refund from Microsoft or Bethesda or whoever I'd love to hear it, maybe start in a different thread?</p>

<p>I was abruptly tossed out twice last night (North American server) -- No warning, no slow down, no clue, no reason. Both times, I immediately logged back in and resumed play. At least the game accurately remembers where I was and what I was doing, even after
 these sudden disconnects.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hey </span></strong><span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=paladin75&amp;referrer=http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/18cefce8-dd05-4424-90d7-01a921d1e278&amp;rh=mQ2ECQ4hx9JGMrxtmJUJb129khm8XXjBxnfINJDirwc%3d&amp;sp=forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>paladin75</span></span></a>,</span></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I have few questions for you before we could start with the troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />
a. How long did you have this issue?<br />
<br />
b. Did you make any changes to your computer?<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program or process can be from malware or some third party services.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you run an Online scan by accessing the below link:
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a>
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Also go through the below link which talks about how to 'How to get rid of malware'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistasecurity/thread/ba80504b-61f1-4d71-960f-b561798b7b42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistasecurity/thread/ba80504b-61f1-4d71-960f-b561798b7b42</span></a><span>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method2:</strong><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may have to put the computer in a Clean Boot State to check which service is causing the issue. Below are the steps to put the computer
 in a Clean Boot state.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span><br />
To perform a Clean Boot on a computer that is running Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7. After the computer starts, check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual”, after performing the clean boot

            &nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the windows-7 upgrade cd. I installed windows 7 with no problems. once installation was completed i have had the shutdow problem ever since about 2 days ago. my pc will not power off or restart at all unless i hit the reset button on my
 PC.<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only change I made to my pc was when i ran the compatability checker was to uninstall Itunes on my PC<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have tryed the clean boot for my pc but that did not change anything

            Hi,
<div>Unfortunately, it will not be possible to use Movie Maker 6 as well as Windows Live Movie Maker on the same computer.</div>
<div>Please use your favorite search engine and browse for a software which help you to convert Mp4 files.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

            <p>Yes. You can have both Vista's own built-in Movie maker 6.0 and Windows Live Movie maker installed in the same Vista machine.</p>
<p>Just dowload Windows Live Essentials.</p>
<p><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other</a><br />
During the download, you will be offered programs that you want to install. Select Windows Live Movie Maker and de-select the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RE : converting MP4 to formats supported by Windows</p>
<p>Google for a Free video converter and convert it to WMV format.<br />
I chose WMV because it is the most reliable format for Windows.</p>
<p>I use Prism video converter. I am not big in video editing and stuffs like that. Prism does the job I need.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the info. I downloaded Live MovieMaker--<strong>I don't see any HELP menu as there is in MovieMaker 6.</strong> Clicking on the question mark ? just sends me to a page on Windows Live Page for MovieMaker with a few frequently asked questions---<strong>very
 limited information with no screen shots</strong>. I am very familiar with the 6 version and thought I would try the Live version since it will accept Mp4 files but this looks very different--don't see a timeline either. Is this the only instructional information
 available? If so, it is poor support from Microsoft. </p>
<p>I could not even post this question at the Live forum--gave me error-could not process request.</p>

 wrong with the search indexer. The problem is, these files don't show up when I search from Cortana, unless I click the "My stuff" button in Cortana Search. After I click that button, files show up instantly. Programs and&nbsp;items in my Users and desktop folders&nbsp;show

 what I'm seeing on my computer. On my laptop, I see document results as I'm typing [in "Best match]. Interestingly,&nbsp;my laptop only has one physical drive for&nbsp;everything (Windows, personal files, programs etc.)&nbsp;while my desktop (where I notice the problem)
 does have two drives -- an SSD for Windows and programs and an HDD for files. I wonder if that has something to do with it
<strong>Edit</strong>: To be more specific, I wonder if the fact that my Windows installation is on one drive and my files are on another is affecting the way they are displayed in the quick search ["Best Match"]. It is strange however that (as I mentioned)
 they do come up instantly once I click "My stuff."</p>

            Yes, that is what I'm referring to. The fact remains: when I search&nbsp;names or contents of files stored in OneDrive on my desktop computer, the "Best Match" is a web search. When I search the same query on my laptop, I see actual results in "Best Match"
 from OneDrive&nbsp;files that match my query. I would like to see immediate results from my files in "Best Match"&nbsp;when I search from my desktop just like I do on my laptop.

            This is still a pretty big issue for me because not having my documents come up in Best Match considerably slows down my work process. Can anyone confirm if this is a known issue and if it is because my&nbsp;OneDrive&nbsp;files are not on the same hard drive as
 my Windows installation?

            My OneDrive files are also stored locally on my HDD (drive D:\), while my Windows installation is on my SSD (C:\). The problem is, files on D:\ don't show up in "Best Match," but files on C:\ do. I store the majority of my files, including my OneDrive
 files, on D:\, so "Best Match" is broken for me as far as files are concerned.

<h3> etdavenport  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 shuts off my network adapter when i the computer goes into sleep mode.  Then takes forever to reconnect afterwards &#91;2-3 minutes&#93;</h2>
                    I have my power plan settings set to balanced [default settings] ,&nbsp; I have told configured the network adapter to not allow windows to disable it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There is a setting in the power plan settings to keep a wireless adapter active while in sleep but not the wired adapter.&nbsp; My computer is wired.&nbsp; This is really annoying and only started with windows 7.&nbsp; If the computer goes into sleep or whatever it is doing,
 when it comes back,&nbsp; it takes minutes to re-establish a connection.

<p>Hi etdavenport,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>The issue could be related to drivers. Firstly, I’d suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and update the network drivers to the latest version available for Windows 7 and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more info on updating drivers:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Update drivers: recommended links<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</strong></a></p>
<p>If updating the network drivers doesn’t solve the issue, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>1. Open Network Connections by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type adapter, and then, under Network and Sharing Center, click View network connections.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. Right-click the connection, and then click Properties. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
3. Click the Networking tab, and then click Configure.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
4. Click the Power Management tab, clear the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for details:</p>

<h2>            Been Signed up for Skype without my permission.</h2>
                    <p>Win 10 has just been updated and now it is signing me up automatically&nbsp;for apps like Skype without my permission. I have had a notice that it has sent my email to Skype and I am to have it installed. This is a breach of my personal choice of what gets installed
 on my own PC. It also took away software during the update like CCleaner that I had installed. What else has Microsoft done without my permission during the latest update?</p>
<p>Microsoft should not be able to automatically sign me up for software without my permission or giving away my email details without my permission or take away software I have installed during an update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 OneDrive cannot sync with external drive - very disappointed</h2>
                    <p>How can I sync OneDrive to my D: external storage in Windows 10? </p>
<p>
</p><p>After migrating to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1, I am no longer able to use OneDrive to sync files on my D: external drive, which is a micro SD card that I purchased to avoid using storage on my C:&nbsp;internal solid state drive. I even deleted my old Windows
 8.1 to create usable space on my C: drive after migrating to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read an older thread highlighting this exact problem, but that was for a technical release version or some such thing - SIX MONTHS AGO. Bottom line, Microsoft still has not enabled us to use the power of OneDrive with all our files in any location.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That is probably the result of malware so do an extremely thorough check and when the
<br />
system is clean see the next message to remove that error. Note that the folder in the<br />
error message is TEMP so something was trying to get itself loaded and probably was<br />
blocked by the antivirus. So there is only an error message left. Of course you need to<br />
check to be sure that no malware exists on the computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
