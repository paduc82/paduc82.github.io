<h2>            Jagged Alliance Back in Action &#40;pc game&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to play the above mentioned game in my old pc, with W7 installed, flawlessly but since I purchased a new pc with W10 the game crashes to desktop while loading to the main menu (after the intro movies); I've been googling around but that wasn't much
 help, the only thing someone mentioned was a probable problem with a video codec, but that doesn't help me much.</p>
<p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>delete the intro movies</p>
<p>(try to) play in different compabilities with Adm. rights</p>
<p>Neither worked; can anyone be of assistance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Francisco R.</p>

            Hi Francisco
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you try compatibility mode?

<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Your best option is setup a dual boot configuration with an older version of Windows, such as Windows 7 32 bit and install it there. This is if your hardware can still run Windows 7. Most modern computers especially those with Skylake and Kabylake processors or AMD Ryzen don't support Windows 7. 
<br />
<br />If yours does, then here is how you do it:

<p><em>Jagged Alliance Back in Action</em> is a 2012 re-release of JA2, and it should be compatible with Win10.</p>
<p>What version of the game do you have. Disc based, Steam or other on line retailer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you using old configuration files or saves from when you had the game installed on Win7 ? If so, you may need</p>
<p>to create new configuration files or saves.</p>
<p>- Same machine upgraded from Win7 or new machine with Win10 ? If it's a new machine, does it use dedicated graphics or Integrated graphics ?</p>
<br />
<p>- If there is an issue with Audio one possibility would be you have the default audio format set too high.</p>
<p>Many older games (and their re-release) have issues if you set the format higher than 24bit 48000Hz.</p>
<p>( <em>Control Panel &gt; Sound</em> - Select your <em>Playback Default</em> and click on<em> Properties</em>. In the Properties Windows select the</p>
<p><em>Advanced tab</em> where you will find <em>Default Format&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>...Or go via <em>Settings&gt;System</em>&gt;<em>Sound</em> ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- I expect the game would have been updated for wide screen monitors, and this is normally only required with old low resolution games,</p>
<p>so this should not be necessary, but have you tried using the Compatibility option ...</p>
<p><em>Change High DPI Settings - Override High DPI Scaling Behavior</em> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't have the game and have no idea what bugs the re-release may have, so you may need to keep trawling any</p>
<p>JA Back in Action forums.</p>

<p>Hi André,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried the compatibility modes and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that a dual boot configuration is overkill and apparently this hardware was configured for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I own a physical copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not using old configurations as this pc is rather new and I have never played JABIA in it. (trying now...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sound is set to default which is 12bit 48000Hz; I tried different settings to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the DPI settings and override scaling and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>

            Apparently the original version of Jagged Alliance 2 used SafeDisk copy protection in some countries. If they left the original DRM
<p>in the re-release the game <em>may </em>be crashing at launch because of MS's DRM Blocking.
</p>
<p>I have more details on this issue in my post at&nbsp; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread ---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- The following possibilities are in part dependant on how well they updated the games from JA2.</p>
<p>Do you have <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Direct Play</span></em> enabled ?</p>
(<em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off</em>. Scroll down to and enable
<em>Legacy Components &amp; Direct Play</em><br />
<p>
</p><p>If the new machine uses Integrated graphics there is some potential the game will not run. Some old games don't recognise</p>
<p>(or don't detect dedicated VRAM ) Integrated graphics&nbsp; .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your cpu has <em>Hyper-threading</em> and it is enabled in BIOS this is another potential. Some games, especially older games,</p>
<p>don't run well, or will crash with Hyper-threading enabled.</p>
<p>Apparently Hyper-threading is also a problem with some games that run well on quad core cpu with Hyper-threading, but</p>
<p>don't like the new AMD cpu's with 6 or more real cores with HT enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My copy does not have DRM protection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct Play was not enabled, I altered this just to check and nope, so I reversed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine uses a dedicated GPU (NVidia GeForce GTX 1080)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hyper-Threading IS enabled but there's not much I can do about it right? and also I have an Intel CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me out man, pity it isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this topic in a Steam Forum and apparently other people have had the same problem; someone replied this: (copy &amp; paste)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found the problem: There is a program called directVboSub which is activated by various programs, and cannot be uninstalled using the regular methods. I noticed this program executed several times when the opening movies start, this causes a crash of the
 GameJABIA.exe file. The solution that worked for me is to find the VSFilter.dll file and rename it to ___VSFilter.dll</p>
<p>this disabled the program and the game works now perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find any VSFilter in my machine nor directVboSub.</p>
<p>Further on the same person adds: (copy &amp; paste)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that the solutrion did not work for them, but have the same problem, it might be caused by another program that runs automaticaly when the openning clip runs. VSFilter is associated with the directVboSub program, you might have a different program
 that causes the same issue. try checking what programs are activated when you run the game... if you see a program that has nothing to do with the game it might be the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this help you to help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>- If your model Intel i7 has Intel HD graphics try using that with the game. I have a couple of old games</p>
<p>that don't run on my Nvidia gpu that run well on Intel HD4600 (&amp; HD4000).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Which codec pack did you install ?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.windows10codecpack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Codec Pack</a> </p>
<p>My Win10 has a VSFilter.dll but it may be left from when I upgraded to Win10 from Win7 ? My understanding is it related to</p>
<p>Direct Show and has to do with text (sub-titles ? ) .</p>
<p>- Not directly related, but with a new Windows install it's a good idea to run the -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> DirectX Web Installer&nbsp;
</a>- to verify all DX files are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;"I altered this just to check and nope, so I reversed it."</em><br />
-&nbsp; If you play other old games&nbsp; (mostly those that use DX7\8, but also some early DX9 I believe) keep Direct Play enabled.<br />
I don't know why MS have it disabled by default. I haven't heard of it causing issues with anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>"Hyper-Threading IS enabled but there's not much I can do about it right? "</em><br />
- Yes, you can disable Hyper-threading in the cpu section in BIOS. <br />
BIOS setups are not all the same, so I can't offer a guide to the location in your BIOS. It should be in your user manual,<br />
but you should be able to find it if you dive into the BIOS.<br />
I have a few older games that don't run if I have HT enabled. <br />

</p><p>Thank you, I'll bear that in mind if I ever run into problems with older games, but for your information all oldies that I have played have worked flawlessly, thank God.</p>
<p><br />
"I have a few older games that don't run if I have HT enabled."&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>see above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A positive note:</p>
<p>The bar loads (when initialising the game) from right to left, instead of from left to right, which monopolises my gaze, but on the left corner there should be the word "loading" (I had completely forgotten this and realised it only cause of a youtube post)
 and instead there's only gibberish. Doesn't this confirm your suspicions that it has to do with sub-titles, This sort of narrows it down right?</p>

<h2>            Where does  Movie Maker save file in Windows 10</h2>
                    When I click publish to Vimeo it saves the file then published it; but with a problem at Vimeo it says publish again but it saves it again first. Where does it save the file from the first post??

            <p>We only use Vimoe to publish our weekly sermons from the church. Once in a while I receive from Vimoe a request to resend it sometimes it says overload. Well I would love to resend the saved file but I can't seem to locate it on my computer. My only way
 now is to resend but it firsts saves again, taking sometimes an hour but if I could locate the saves file I could resend it in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            Personally, I just skip the auto-upload features of Movie Maker. I always save the video to my PC first. Then I directly use the upload facility of Vimeo, YouTube, etc.

            That is what I now do; but if using the Vimeo publish button I could walk away, it would save and publish without being there. Just a bit of advantage when it takes almost an hour to save.

            To know what exactly is causing the BSOD, I need to analyze minidumps generated by BSOD. 
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your BSOD 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

<p>Please try changing the connection you are using so we can determine whether or not this is an issue with the Internet connection you use. Make sure to close any application that may be using your bandwidth such as music streaming
 and video downloading applications. Let us know what happens after. You can refer to this FAQ for additional details regarding the recommended upload and download speeds for optimal Skype call experience.

<p>Can you check if the same behavior happens on another device? If you have a Firewall or an anti-virus enabled, please try to temporarily disable it as these two may be restricting your access to Skype.

    <title>Bluetooth speakers never connect on the first try - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wow.zhao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth speakers never connect on the first try</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks, I have a UE Wonderboom Bluetooth speaker. Every time I try to connect it to my laptop, it always takes at least a good half hour and multiple attempts to connect the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn on the speakers and turn on Bluetooth on my computer the settings will always say that the speaker is "Connected", but there is no music playing and if I go ino the Sound settings it still shows my speaker as disconnected. Only after a lot of
 waiting and more than a few tries of turning everything off and back on will it show "Connected music" instead of "Connected" and then play music through the speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this problem now with multiple Bluetooth speakers from different companies, so I know it's a problem with the computer and not the speakers. I have a Broadcom wifi/Bluetooth combo chip and all network/Bluetooth drivers are fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried just about every solution that's been posted on here and other forums and I'm at my wit's end. I've tried uninstalling the device and re-pairing it, I've made sure all the Bluetooth services are running and configured to start automatically as
 soon as my computer turns on. I honestly don't know what else there is to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any answers?</p>

<p>Where do I open the Hardware Troubleshooter? I have no search box anywhere on my computer. If you're talking about the system one that can be opened from the Control Panel, I opened this one up and there's no option for Hardware and Devices (see picture).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7646249b-d9ab-45dd-be0f-450d4c205fb5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7646249b-d9ab-45dd-be0f-450d4c205fb5?upload=true" /></a><br />
As you can see, there's an option to troubleshoot Bluetooth settings, which I tried. It told me the problem was that my Bluetooth needed to be turned on (which it already was) and proceeded to turn it off and back on, which didn't help. I also tried troubleshooting
 using the Playing Audio option which just told me that my speaker couldn't connect because it wasn't plugged in, which makes no sense since it's...a wireless BT speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the second option, I've already tried this many, many times, and it hasn't done anything. I've basically set every service with "Bluetooth" anywhere in the description or name to Automatic, and still nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus X555L laptop, which came preinstalled with Windows 8 and was then upgraded to 10, and uses a Broadcom BCM943142HM wifi/Bluetooth combo card.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one Kinect sensor service in India, Reddington india, Chennai.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone !</p>
<p>I have a kinect 2 under warranty period. Had frequent switch-on, switch-off problem. I contacted microsoft service on chat, they approved a replacement on email (reference number : 1332020717).</p>
<p>In India region, the service provider is supposed to arrange for courier pick-up. (Reddington India, Chennai. Mail ID: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, phone number : 044-30287938).They are not arranging the pick-up courier, nor replying to e-mails, not picking-up
 the phone also...(:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have even contacted Microsoft back to get them to act, they are also saying the service center is suppose to order courier. Each of them is pointing the other. I held an opinion, at least a world class company like Microsoft would have mechanisms to ensure
 the service they promise at the time of purchase. Doesn't seem like they have any.</p>

<p>Is it the experience of replacement of kinect for anyone from india, or only my case is going loops ?</p>
<p>Your answer will help me get some perspective and relief in this regard.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
<p>Manjunath</p>

<h2>            Face&#47;Object recognition slow - Is there a way to speed things up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Based on experience with other desktop photo management apps with face detection and recognition, I recognize that the process of processing faces and objects is time intensive, especially with large photo collections. Windows 10 Photos App feature is no
 exception, I have left it for days running and it still has not gone through more than 20% of a 100,000+ photo collection. On my PC, I have noticed that CPU and Memory consumption is low, which is good for most users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, <strong>I am wondering if there is a setting for advanced and/or impatient users?</strong> Perhaps a registry key which could boost recognition speed, even if it comes at a cost of more CPU/Memory usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thought came to mind recalling that&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/all/face-recognition-seems-stalled-in-windows-live/550ce1aa-6c38-4b83-9581-c0d59e8c0b09">Windows Photo Gallery had setting
 for increasing recognition at a cost of decreasing accuracy</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If no such feature exist, I would assume that since the Photo App can access photos hosted in OneDrive is could leverage OneDrive's recognition engine up in the cloud and turbo boost the desktop app.</p>

    <title>Reddish colour problem with Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 8 for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reddish colour problem with Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 8 for an Asus laptop</h2>
                    When I bought this Asus laptop installed with Windows 8, I found that all the photos and videos appear very reddish. I could notice a very saturated colour seems to be overlayed onto images when they are viewed in Adobe Bridge or Windows Picture Viewer.
 After doing some internet research, I realize that this abnormal colour could be caused by Asus Splendid Video Utility which was preinstalled on the laptop.
<br />
<br />
Upon uninstalling the Splendid Video Utility, the reddish colour was removed from the images, which now become normal in colour and saturation. However, the Windows Media Player 12 (Version 12.0.9200.16578) continue to play very reddish videos. The same videos
 display the normal colour and saturation when played on either the default Video application of Windows 8 or QuickTime on the same laptop.
<br />
<br />
I turned off the Windows Media Player under the Program and Features of Control Panel, restarted the computer and re-enabled the Windows Media Player. However, it still plays videos with reddish, oversaturated colours.<br />
<br />
I learnt that there isn't a WMP 12 version that I can download and reinstall on my Win 8 laptop.
<br />
<br />
What should I do? Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Uploading DV tape material to PC</h2>
                    I have just purchased a new PC c/w Firewire card, as I plan to upload all my audio/visual tape material to my PC, edit and store on DVD. When I connect my Canon MV300 to my PC via a firewire cable, My Devices identifies that a camcorder is connected, but
 I am unable to progress, that is to upload material,. Yes, I have tried switching the c/corder on!
<div>Canon state that they do not produce any software for the camcorder and rather, software would be specific to the Firewire card? My digital Canon EOS camera had a software disc with it when purchased and I can easily upload images to my PC. However, the
 camcorder dates from circa 1995 and did not come with any form of software.</div>
<div>Please help, what is required to overcome this problem? I assume that I require software downloaded from the Internet, or?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Finally, I know that the taped data can be uploaded and saved, as the camera was used to film an event some years ago and I have seen the edited DVD. Unfortunately, contact has been lost from the person who carried out this task.</div>

</span>1 Connect an external hard drive to the computer. Using Mini DV footage on a computer's built-in hard drive will cause the computer to lag because it takes so much space and the hard drive is overworked when trying to access and play the video. A 200-gigabyte,
 500-gigabyte, or 1-terabyte (1,000-gigabyte) hard drive will work well with footage.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>2 </span>Make sure you have an editing program that can capture Mini DV footage. On Windows-based computers, use the

</font><font><font><span>&nbsp; </span>3 Plug the DV cable from the camcorder to the computer's DV port. Use a mini-pin DV cable for laptop computers and a full-sized DV cables for desktop computers.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>4 </span>Open the video editing software and click on the "Capture" menu. A new window pops up with a blank or blue screen. Power on the camcorder and wait for the computer to read and load the camera content.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>5 </span>Use the on-screen controls to navigate through the Mini DV tape. Press "Pause" or "Stop" once you find the spot you want to start recording from.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>6 </span>Select an "Output" folder for the uploaded video. Click on "My computer" to access the external hard drive or choose "My videos" if you choose to use the same hard drive.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>7 </span>Press the "Record" button. The Mini DV tape plays automatically and starts the capture. A timer shows how much footage is uploaded and the footage streams live on the computer screen.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>8 </span>Limit each upload to 10 minutes. Anything over 10 minutes could create audio delays because the alignment gets messed up through the

</font></font></span></span></a><font>. Do not worry about overlapping shots through each file because the footage can be editing together into a single file after uploading.<br />
<font><span>&nbsp; </span><span>9 </span>
</font>Exit out of the capture screen when all of the footage is completed. Test the captured clips in the video editor to make sure the sound and video play correctly. Disconnect the camera and power it down when completed.</font></span></p>

            Hello Dave,
<div><br />
<div>I thank you most sincerely for taking the time to reply to my enquiry. I found your response extremely useful, but have just a few queries. Please forgive this, all due to the fact that I am a post war 'baby boomer' and as such my school education never&nbsp;encompassed&nbsp;I.T
 skills and therefore, I've been playing catch up ever since!</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>It sounds as if my expenditure on the Firewire card may have been&nbsp;unnecessary?</li><li>I have an external hard drive, but only of 120Gb, so it sounds like I will need to visit my friendly IT store? I have a total of some thirty, 60DV&nbsp;cassettes&nbsp;to upload,&nbsp;but&nbsp;presumably I can upload/edit/check one, before moving on.</li><li>I have MS Windows7 O.S., so Movie maker must be buried somewhere within that package, for free.</li><li>In you reply, you instruct me to connect the camcorder to the computer's DV port. Is this the port on my Firewire, which differs from a std. USB, or other?</li></ol>
<div>Apologies for being such a clod! I'm desperately trying to get the footage onto DVD a.s.a.p. in order that when I'm not around, my wife will be able to relive treasured memories in a simpler fashion than the present.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you so much, yet again, for helping me out on this issue,</div>
<div><br />

<p>This error when trying to Install/reinstall DirectX has been causing a lot of problems on Win10. Try the fixes below in the order presented...</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/repair</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Failing that try updating your Windows. This has helped another person with the same issue, but he didn't say if the update</p>
<p>was a cumulative/security update, or if he did a version update to v1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If neither of the above helps, you may have to try using the DX Registry key fix (Option #6)&nbsp; in the article below...</p>
<p><a href="https://windowsreport.com/directx-internal-system-error-occurred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/directx-internal-system-error-occurred/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another person who posted here a while back deleted the whole DX Registry folder. A radical fix, but it worked for him.</p>
<p>Do be sure to make a backup of the DX registry folder before deleting it.</p>
<p>Reboot after deleting the folder, and Windows will apparently rebuild the DX Registry folder during the reboot.</p>

                    I cannot get autoplay or any default settings to work when I put an SD card in the reader.&nbsp; It does not work to press shift when putting the media in.&nbsp; The only way I can get to the pictures on my SD card is by going to computer and clicking on the SD
 card.&nbsp; I would like for the SD card contents to be automatically imported to my pictures folder (like I did on Vista).

<p>yep, if you open WL Photo Gallery before inserting the SD and then insert SD, WL PG will notify that an external device with pictures was added, would you like to import?</p>
<p>I found this fix someplace (I don't take credit for it). This will bring autorun back to the SD card reader. I am pretty sure this is intentionally not functional for security reasons etc.</p>
<p>create two reg files. name them as you wish. Every time I install win7 or reinstall this is one of the first things I do. Always works. (Once you created a text file with the extension .reg for each you can insert into registry by double clicking the newly
 created reg files.)</p>

<h2>            Cannot run a programme &#91;Blue Stacks&#93; after enabling WINDOWS SAND BOX.</h2>
                    <p>Hey I hope you all are fine.</p>
<p>I am trying to run BLUE STACKS which is an android app emulator on PC Everyone knows it is necessary that Hyper-V and any other virtual feature should be disabled.</p>
<p>It was running smoothly even after updating to 1903[just for reference&nbsp; I made a clean installation]</p>
<p>But when I enabled <strong>windows sandbox&nbsp;</strong>it did not run again.</p>
<p><strong>AND I GOT THE FOLLOWING ERROR</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40f02ccd-8e17-46ff-ad97-e39938f2d9ee?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40f02ccd-8e17-46ff-ad97-e39938f2d9ee?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>As I make sure that Hyper-V and any other virtual environment is disabled. I turned WINDOWS SANDBOX disabled and properly restart the device.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>I also tried different steps like deleting registry key of bluestacks reinstalling the programme and some other.</strong>One of my friend faced the same problem
<em>BUT ALL HIS EFFORTS IN VAIN AND HE HAD TO REINSTALL WINDOWS.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And now he can run this third party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>so please guys if anyone has the solution&nbsp; please help me.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>I shall be very grateful to you as I didn't want to reinstall windows NOW Especially for next two months.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> skorpio11x  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;we can&#39;t find a microphone for these people&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My nephew is unable to communicate via game chat or Xbox party chat. He keeps getting the message "we can't find a microphone for these people". He is unable to hear me through his mic and I can not hear him. He can hear me through the TV when the mic is
 unplugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested everything for weeks trying to fix this. I have bought him a second mic and a second controller, still the problem is present. Both mics work perfectly fine when plugged into his phone. Both his controllers are brand new with no other issues
 (this is a brand new Xbox One S). The mic sometimes works, but only for a very brief moment then it stops working again for days/weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a full restart on the Xbox, updated the controller firmware for both controllers, gone through all troubleshooting steps with Microsoft, and nothing works. He lives in a different state than me and he is pretty young, so going through all these
 steps with him is very difficult and time consuming. Can anyone help?</p>

            Microsoft just released a firmware update that has fixed the problem for me. See:

<p>
</p><p>No more screen flickering or tint changing. The update should be titled System Firmware Update -11/2/2015.</p>

            The 11/2 update fixed the tint and flickering issue for me.. glad I gave it another chance buying the SP4 and installing the update. &nbsp;The funny thing is when I did the update once the display driver still showed the old version and of course the tint issue
 remained. But doing the update again fixed it.

</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experience to Microsoft Community. For Surface book, you can use the Headphone jack even if its in tablet mode or while its connected to the keyboard,&nbsp; it is actually&nbsp;a 3.5mm headphone jack. If you happen to encounter such issues
 like no audio on the Headset while its connected to the Surface Headphone jack, please visit this link that contains information on how to fix the problem

            Have you tried this headset with other devices? The audio jack on tablet is absolutely the way to go for this.
