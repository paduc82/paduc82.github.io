<h2>            Is Steam compatible with windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have many games on steam and all of them were released before windows 10 came out, so will I still be able to play my games?

            <p>OK here is what i did after i Upgraded to Windows 10 (From Windows 8.1) and Started Testing Games:<br />
First i went to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://store.steampowered.com/</a>&nbsp;and logged in again i got a Code Sent to my Email and Copy and Pasted it in the Box and then i Named my PC at the bottom now I'm logged in.<br />
<br />
I did the Same thing after i Reset Windows 10 to clear up some issues i was having not related to gaming.<br />
<br />
Yes i backed up everything and Restored Everything.&nbsp;<br />
I have a Backup and Restore Method that works really well.<br />
<br />
Next i had to Reinstall the Drivers for my Bluetooth and PS3 Controller after setting everything up correctly now i can use my PS3 controller to play Video Games.<br />
<br />
Do you want to Play Games on your PC with a PS3 Controller instead of using the Keyboard and Mouse to play Games on PC ? well check out this site:

and i Replaced the gfwlivesetup Located in<br />

<br />
With the one you can Download here <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient</a>&nbsp; Just click the Blue Download Button.<br />
<br />
The Reason i did this is because the gfwlivesetup is old and outdated it wouldn't work for me so that i could play Grand Theft Auto IV.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have a Microsoft Account and a Rockstar Social Club Account you'll need these if you want to Play.<br />
<br />
A Box will pop up asking you to Sign into your Rockstar Social Club Account after you type the Email: and Password: in you either click Play(offline) or Play A Windows Firewall may pop up or your Internet Security Program may popup you can either wait and Allow
 Later or if you use Windows Firewall hurry and check both boxes and Allow.<br />
<br />
Next once you're in game at the Main Menu click Home and Sign In using your Microsoft Account it should Display your Product Key and it should also tell you about a Update just Update after it's done Updating close out the Game and let it Install this Update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You'll probably have a GFWL Box popup and asking you to Sign so Sign In using your Microsoft Account hopefully everything goes smooth now Launch Grand Theft Auto IV again and when you get to the Main Menu click home and see if your Signed in.You may have to
 repeat the process but then it should Sign you in Automatically so long as you check the Box to Sign you in Automatically.<br />
<br />
You'll have to do the same Process for Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City.<br />

You should always download Mods Manually First and then Place them in Organized Folders so you can have a backup incase something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
I have a folder located on my C Drive called Files inside the Files Folder i have a Folder called Gaming Inside the Gaming Folder i have a folder called Gaming Files Inside Gaming Files i have a Folder called The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition Inside
 The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition Folder i have a Folder Called Mods Organized Inside the Mods Organized Folder i have the same Layout as Nexus If you go to
<a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/categories/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/categories/?</a>&nbsp;You can see what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Inside all of those folders are the mods i downloaded but i made sure to Organize them by name.<br />
<br />
I also Organize them by which should be installed First Second Third and so on.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I Put the Main Mod in the Folder and then i 2 i 3 i 4 i 5.<br />
<br />
Also everytime i download a mod Manually i extract the file and make a folder called Data and Place all the files inside that folder then i 7zip the data folder and name it the same file name the mod came with Example i download Haven Bag once the download
 is complete i Extract the winrar File by Right clicking the file Haven Bag-21454-1-5-2.rar and choose WinRar Extract here or 7Zip Extract Here then i make a Folder called Data and place all the files that were inside Haven Bag-21454-1-5-2.rar then i right
 click on the Data Folder i choose 7-Zip Add to archive... if you use WinRAR choose WinRAR Add to archive... Now you paste in the name Haven Bag-21454-1-5-2.7z or Haven Bag-21454-1-5-2.rar and then click OK.<br />
<br />
However i don't extract Mods that have their own Installer For Example:&nbsp;<br />
Ebony Blade&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52506/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52506/?
</a><br />
has it's own Installer with options so i wouldn't Extract that mod because it will ruin the Installer.<br />
<br />
Does it Bother you when you see the wrong Version Number on NMM ?<br />
<br />
I'll be Using Gemling Queen Jewelry Mod as an Example to Fix this Issue.<br />
<br />
You just click on the Gemling Queen Jewelry Mod in the NMM Interface and then click on the Blue with a white i in the middle and the green + it will open up a Edit Mod Information just click on the First name that comes up Gemling Queen Jewelry -Gemling Queen
 Jewelry All In One Installer v4-1 and click OK this will make it appear correctly in NMM.<br />
<br />
This works for any mod that isn't showing the correct mod Version.<br />
<br />
You can Also Try Downloading the Mod again to have the Correct Version Number Appear.You can Also Manually Place the Version Number of the Current Version of the Mod just do the same thing above except type in the correct version where is says Version:(Newest
 Number goes here)<br />
<br />
Anyway Goodluck on Modding your Skyrim and don't give up i know it can be frustrating but hang in there and it will pay off.<br />
If anyone needs help let me know.<br />
Thanks for Reading all of this.<br />

Helpful Info for Borderlands 2:<br />
I don't Have Borderlands but you can try the Following:<br />
Go into Steam right click on Borderlands 2 Then click on Properties Then click on VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE... When it's done it should say All Files Validated Successfully.<br />
<br />
If it didn't then it will download any missing/corrupt files and now you should be all good to go.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help try using Bing or Google to see if someone else has the same issue and maybe someone posted a Fix somewhere.<br />
<br />
If none of that helps contact Steam they might be able to help you.<br />
<br />
What i Found on the Web:<br />
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/541907867760541890/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/541907867760541890/</a><br />
<br />
I Typed this in Bing:<br />

borderlands 2 Windows 10<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
My Suggestion only if nothing else works:<br />
Backup Everything on your Computer:<br />
My Method is i plug in my Seagate External Hard Drive and Drag and Drop Everything i want to backup on there Please note everything is Organized in Folders:<br />
Files<br />
Gaming Programs<br />
Programs<br />
Steam<br />
Temp<br />
<br />
I Also Backup The Following:<br />
Google Chrome Flash Data (Only localhost)<br />
Local App Data (Several Folders with Files)<br />
ProgramData (Several Folders with Files)<br />
Roaming App Data (Several Folders with Files)<br />
All Desktop Shortcuts go into a Folder called Desktop Shortcuts<br />
Documents<br />
Music<br />
Pictures<br />
Videos<br />
<br />
What else is on your Seagate External Hard Drive ?<br />
A Folder called Program Installers with all the Programs i use all Updated to the Newest Yes there all Organized in there own Folders.<br />
<br />
Z Stored Files: These are files I'll probably never use again but i store them just in case.<br />
<br />
Reset Windows:<br />
First i would Backup everything you don't want to Lose. Unregister your computer on accounts such as Itunes.<br />
Click Start (the White Windows Icon located at the Bottom left hand of your screen)<br />
Click Settings<br />
Click Update and Security<br />
Click Recovery<br />
Up at the top it says Rest this PC click Get Started and follow the steps.<br />
<br />
Back to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1:<br />
Click Start (the White Windows Icon located at the Bottom left hand of your screen)<br />
Click Settings<br />
Click Update and Security<br />
Click Recovery<br />
In the Middle it Should Say Go Back (Your OS Here)<br />
Click Get Started<br />
If it says you can't go back then Nevermind.<br />
<br />
I Hope this helps.<br />
if you need anymore help just Reply and I'll see what i can do.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi tfarrebs,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below troubleshooting steps and get back to us with results:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:
<br />
Start the Windows Installer service:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type Services in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the Services window, look for the Windows Installer service.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Double click on the Windows Installer service and set the Startup type of Windows Installer to Manual.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Start to start the service. Note down the error message if any.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step2:
<br />
Reregister the Windows Installer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, and then type cmd in the search box,</span></p>
<p><span>2. At the command prompt, type
<strong>msiexec.exe /unregister</strong> and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type
<strong>msiexec /regserver</strong>, and then press ENTER </span></p>

    <title>Technician deleted my important files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sachin nanjunda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Technician deleted my important files</h2>
                    <p>A technician from Level deleted my important files. Then he installed pirated Recuva software from pirate bay&nbsp;and suggested me not to talk on call&nbsp;by writing it in the text file. He couldn't recover the deleted data because previous night there was a windows&nbsp;update
 and the technician was aware of it. He offered me Microsoft 365 as compensation at that time. I was so blank that I refused it and disconnected the call. Because of this, I lost my job and reputation in the office. This case went to level 3 technician. They
 couldn't recover again. So the case went to investigate and finally they conclude after one month that they will offer Microsoft 365 as goodwill and wanted to close the case. I asked them to write about the case&nbsp;in email and send it to me. So that I can complain
 Microsoft. He denied to send it and today he is telling me that it can't be true that technician deleted the data. I am really not able to reach higher department other than T3. They are like fraud team. How could they offer me an software and don't accept
 their mistake?&nbsp;I feel something is going wrong as no one is monitoring them. The manager name is Arshad Khan. Also, I forgot to mention about the compensation I asked for, it was 15000EUR. As I lost my&nbsp;job because of the mistake was done by Microsoft. I requested
 my&nbsp;annual income and expenses for living in foreign country. How can I reach my case message to the higher authority?&nbsp;Every time&nbsp;I contact to complain. It reaches to the same team. I need help please,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p>
<p>Sachin Nanjunda</p>

<p>Did you have a backup of these important files? </p>
<p>If not, you were always one hardware/software failure or one spilt cup of coffee away from disaster.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why were you fired if it was not your fault? Was it because you had no backup to restore from?<br />
</p>
<p>Why was a technician on your system in the first place? What problem was he trying to solve? How did the files get deleted. I take it that the Windows Update occurred after the files were deleted and a second technician attempted to recover the files. It
 wasn't clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably need to take legal and technical advice. If you can show Microsoft deleted the files, then you were fired unfairly.</p>

            No, I have my case number and it's Microsoft for sure. Also, I have proofs that they have done this. I asked that Tier 3 manager, write everything in email and send it to me. But he denied sending&nbsp;about the case situation and yesterday he said it can't
 be the technician who deleted the data. I was very shocked, after 1 month of trouble. He is telling me like that and offering me Microsoft 365 for 2 years as just good will.

            No, I usually make a backup on my external hard drive. But these files were in windows.old&nbsp;folder that is created by one of the technicians from Microsoft. Yes, I didn't&nbsp;have those important files which I had to submit. Now June 30 is my contract ending
 and they are not going to renew it. The technician was troubleshooting&nbsp;the problem related to sleep mode and shut down problems. There were multiple technicians working on it and the technician Siddharth selected an option from storage in settings. which deletes
 the previous windows files. He backed up only my present windows files, but didnt&nbsp;from windows.old. He was so careless and was in hurry to go home and was delaying it. During this he knew that there was an update going on. He didn't stop it saying that he
 will work on it next day. When he came next day, that too it was very late. Never ever it was on schedule. There was a plan that he will try to recover the deleted files. He installed pirated recuva&nbsp;from pirateb

            Actually, the support services are really pathetic. I have suffered a lot.&nbsp; T3 is topmost guys who handle these things and they resolve it in there own way. There is no complain centre&nbsp;from Microsoft. Its the technical department who handles this and they
 do whatever they want. From past 5 calls, I have made the call recordings also. They play very safely&nbsp;though they did the mistakes. If I ask some questions, they answer has its internal thing we cannot disclose. There are a lot of things going on in this case,
 which I can't type here everything. They are fraud support from Microsoft. They play with customers and escape somehow.&nbsp;

<p>This is a peer to peer support forum. No one here has any connection with Microsoft directly. We are just users like yourself volunteering our time. So, sorry for your loss, but there isn't much we can do.

<p>
</p><p>I do have a problem believing that they would install something from Pirate Bay which is obviously illegal and especially when you can get it free from the source.</p>

<h3> mr masido  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win Vista Business 64 Bit </h2>
                    
<p>We bought a computer to get experience with Vista Business 64 Bit OS, it came with Downgradeable rights to Win XP Pro. Some how Win XP was the default OS.
<br />
<br />
We then tried to re format the drive and re-insatll&nbsp; Vista. The computer came with a Vista Business 64 Bit Key but no OEM Disk.<br />
<br />
We also have our "MSDN" / Part # x33-37460 and Key.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I fairly sure that the current OS is 32 Bit XP Pro. When I put the Vista DVD in it stats to boot it get to the screen where it ask if you want to "Up Grade" which is disabled &nbsp;or do a "Custom Insatll" . I select Custom Install and it goes a bit further then
 stops a I get&nbsp; a message that it can't find teh required drives and I'm prompted to Browse.
<br />
<br />
On the DVD : DLRmcxFre_En_DVD<br />
<br />
I have Folders:<br />
<br />
BOOT, efi, Sources, Support, UpGrade. <br />
<br />
None of these folders contain the "Installation Drivers".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help please, I turn to your fourm because all the programmers are too busy to help and I'm a sales guy tring to muddle through.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

 and my Garmin Express icon disappeared. I looked in Control Panel Programs and Garmin Express was listed but when I went to the Start menu, All Apps there was a Garmin folder but it contained only WebUpdater. I searched my hard drive Programs Files (x86) and
 there was also a Garmin folder there but it to contained only BaseCamp, USB_Drivers and WebUpdater. I figured if I uninstalled Garmin Express and reinstalled it things would be back to normal. Wrong. After uninstalling Garmin Express (using Windows Wise Program

<h2>            Power</h2>
                    My Surface Pro 4 does not seem to power on. &nbsp;I was shutting down device by hitting top left button and then slide down tab on screen. &nbsp;Now device does not seem to turn itself on? &nbsp;What did I do wrong? How can I get the device up and running? &nbsp;Anyone know
 the answer to this? &nbsp;

<p>Yes Barb, I followed all the replies I gotten, but nothing is taking effect.. &nbsp;I just called the company I ordered from to send it back. &nbsp;They say it can be problem with the devices. &nbsp;I dont know. &nbsp;Spend almost $900 on this device, to experience this? &nbsp;HMMM
 maybe ask for my refund and purchase another tablet from either HP or Toshiba.... dont know yet till company receives device and tries to trouble shoot it.</p>

            Hi Tony, without a doubt the VLC Media player is your best option
<br />
<br />It is fully featured kept up to date, free and plays just about every Media file you can think of . . .

            I use VLC Player to watch all my media, both digital downloads and existing DVD's.  Its also free, you should download the full desktop version to get all the benefits:
<br />
<br />Download official VLC media player for Windows - VideoLAN
<br /><a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft has a Windows DVD Player app, but it cost $15 and its not full features.

<h2>            How do I reinstall Windows 10 on y laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the Windows 10 OS on my laptop for months after upgrading from Windows 7. &nbsp;Yesterday after booting, I couldn't get on to the Internet with any browser. &nbsp;After trying several times, the computer would no longer display the "Start" menu,
 so I had to do a hard shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How the computer will not open to anything when I turn it on. &nbsp;So, I guess I need to reinstall Windows 10 - maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello StephenG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that Windows Live Mail does not support background music or wallpaper stationary when you send an email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you verify on what steps did you do to add background picture and sound?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>Interesting, oh where, oh where is my Outlook Express?</p>
<p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>In New message</p>
<p>Click on Format .... background .... image. Browse to select desired image.</p>
<p>Click on Format .... background ... sound. Browse to select desired mp3 file. Choose desired
</p>
<p>repeat settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything works fine when viewed on originating computer. When sent image and sound</p>
<p>files not embedded/included.</p>
<p>Have been looking (forever) for a replacement email program that allows source code editing as did Outlook Express. Am I now to add two more reasons to renew my search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is the Windows Live team finally going to get their act together and remedy these drastic shortfalls.</p>
<p>I do believe that Windows Live Email is a good and could be a great program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still a loyal fan .... but for how long? Time to switch to Chrome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way to install Outlook Express in Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I am just now finding this issue myself, don't remember it being an issue in the past.&nbsp; I am also using (and have been for several years) Windows Live Mail 2009.&nbsp; I like (or did) like the program.&nbsp; Seems we are going backwards here.&nbsp; Did you find a way around
 this issue or go to another program?<br />

<p>Was unable to find a way for Windows Live Mail&nbsp;to facilitate what I needed but still use it for my primary email program. Use Windows Mail (from Vista) to create email with embedded videos. This link should get you started for this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Windows Update error 80072efd while checking for updates, the cause might be a connection interruption between your computer and the Windows Update servers. Close Windows Update, wait 10 to 15 minutes, and then run Windows Update again. You
 can also wait for Windows Update to run at its next scheduled time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It also means <strong>"0x80072efd WININET_E_CANNOT_CONNECT ".</strong> A connection with the server could not be established.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the solution from this &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/818018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB818018</a></strong>&nbsp;and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reply if you need any further assistance and we will be happy to help you.</p>

            <p>On 10 June, Windows Update stopped working. All I get is Error Code 80072EFD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the 'solutions' on the Microsoft website. Nothing works. I tried two hotfixes recommended. Neither works. I can (obviously) connect to the Internet, but cannot run Windows Update at all. And Microsoft has absolutely nothing that helps. I
 just tried KB818018. No help. I tried Troubleshoot Windows Update. No problems found (except that it could not update). The Hotfix WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcap said it could not fix the problem. MicrosoftFixit.wu.LB199357811184210106.1.1.Run.exe found no
 problems, except that Windows Update is unable to update, and it said since no problems were found, it couldn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suggestion was to disable proxies. I have no proxies. One suggestion was to use Windows Firewall. I'm using Windows Firewall. One suggestion was to empty the Windows Update Folder. This did not work at all. Now it thinks I have never run Windows Update
 ever. And I still cannot run Windows Update.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
To correct the problem, you might need to add the Windows Update website addresses to the blocking program's exceptions or "allow" list or allow Windows Update Service to connect to the Internet through port 80 and port 443.
</p><div>
To add the Windows Update websites to a firewall exceptions list
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows Firewall ships with this version of Windows and should already include these sites in the exceptions list. If you use a different firewall, refer to the software publisher's documentation to see how to add these websites to your firewall
 exceptions list: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>http://*.update.microsoft.com
</span>&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p><span>https://*.update.microsoft.com
</span>&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p><span><a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.windowsupdate.com</a>
</span>&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Hope it helps. </p>

            Hi,&nbsp; If all else fails and you can't figure it out.&nbsp; Just turn off Windows&nbsp;Firewall and download updates. Then turn Windows Firewalls back on.&nbsp;

<br />Alright, it certainly does sound like the USB slot is the use then. Often times there are small amounts of dust that get cluttered inside of the port. Ensure that it is clean, please look at the link below. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-clean-usb-ports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-clean...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work then I would recommend taking the device to a Microsoft location to get it analyzed by a representative. If that it not an option to you please contact the Microsoft support team to setup a repair for your device.
<br />
<br />Regards,

            Hi Cathleen,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode, you should be able to adjust scaling back to 100%
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC       
        </p>

<p>I've no idea why your update installation failed, but...</p>

</p><p>WRT to the broken links on the MSRT sites: Other users mentioned that too and I've asked the Forum Owners to escalate that bug or whatever it is to the responsible MS people:

            <p>Hi , Ken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer</p>
<p>1.After We started to use of Windows 10 's PC.</p>

2.I did not change before the isssue occurred.</p>
<p><br />
3.No error messages.</p>
<p><br />
4.I have not yet done any troubleshooting staps. </p>
<p><br />
Other informations:<br />
Basiclly we have following configurations.<br />
It's same about Windows7 and Windws10.</p>
<p>Group Policy:</p>
<p>NET USE H: /DELETE &gt; NUL<br />
NET USE H: \\Tokfsv01\H-drive &gt; NUL :DRVMAP</p>
<p>We have added following Registry Key and value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System Create a new parameter (DWORD type) with the name EnableLinkedConnections and the value 1
</p>
<p>1.The Issue has been occured when We take Windows10's PC to other office where we can't directory communicate with Windows server and shared folders.<br />
2.We enable windows cache logon.<br />
3.We use VPN connection to connect Windows Server and shared folders. Then we try to mapping to shared folders via VPN connection.<br />
4.We must drive mapping because our cad software needs drive letter.<br />
5.No probrem with Windows7's PC.</p>

<p>So you have been using CCleaner and it removed your driver, is that correct?</p>
<p>What was the driver which has been removed?</p>
<p>Normally, you may visit the PC manufacturer's website and install the removed driver.</p>

    <title>Surface Book dGPU Stopped Functioning, Causes Bluescreens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tombombadildo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book dGPU Stopped Functioning, Causes Bluescreens</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a weird issue with my Surface Book that is seemingly related to the dGPU in the keyboard base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the 256GB i5 model with the custom 940m dGPU in the keyboard base, and I've been having some issues with BSODs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I'm getting "Page Fault in Non-Paged Area" BSODs, caused by nvlddmkm.sys, every boot with the dGPU drivers being used. I was able to narrow the issue down to the dGPU being the issue, as the Surface will boot fine disconnected from the keyboard
 base, and if I disable the dGPU in device manager it'll also boot ok. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the folloiwing to diagnose/fix the issue:</p>
<p>Did a clean uninstall of the graphics drivers using DDU and reinstalling the latest Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>Clean uninstall again, and reinstall of the previous version of Nvidia's drivers.</p>
<p>Clean uninstall again, and letting Windows Update install the super outdated Nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>Running Chkdsk, no errors.</p>
<p>Running SFC scan, no errors.</p>
<p>Running memtest, no errors after 4 passes.</p>
<p>Checking SMART data to see if the SSD is corrupted, no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running the Surface Diagnostic tool, no errors detected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I haven't tried yet is a clean install of Windows, but I'd like to delay doing that at present as I have no way to currently backup some 100+GB of important work files.&nbsp;</p>

            So this happens only when you boot from a completely shutdown state, or from sleep/standby? What is the boot order in the UEFI and if you change it, does it make a difference? (As an aside, the Fall Creators Update is due out tomorrow and that might be better than a clean install if you wanted to jump of the bleeding edge).

<p>The two drivers were downloaded from Nvidia's own site. The Windows Update drivers were version 21.21.13.7667, which was dated as 1/15/2017, but as mentioned neither 3 worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue started Saturday morning, Friday night the device was working just fine and as expected. I don't believe any updates were installed that Friday night/Saturday morning before booting, nothing is listed in the update history besides a Windows Malicious
 Software Removal tool update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This happens from a complete shutdown, I can't actually boot into the system unless I disable the Nvidia device from safe mode, as I keep getting the BSOD before Windows even loadsa.</p>

            I am suggesting that as an experiment that you change the boot order in the UEFI. Turn on alternate boot order and maybe make USB storage first (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/manage-surface-uefi-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/manage...</a> ) - I'm not suggesting you actually boot from a USB stick, just trying to see if anything changes if windows boot manager isn't first on the list.

            Awesome so what I recommend is trying the surface firmware. Although then nvidia firmware works it could be cause it the bsod.

<br />
<br />-download and restart the surface 3 times. 
<br />
<br />To accomplish this make sure to disable the gpu in device manager like before. If this doesn’t work let me know.

<p>Did as suggested, still getting the BSOD.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Same as your suggestion, Barb. Changed the boot order, still getting the BSOD regardless.&nbsp;</p>

            I would honestly visit a store or call support. They retrieve diagnostics from the surface to see why it’s giving that error. Sometimes from my experience that issue is a hardware related issue. Still I would contact Microsoft and make sure not to reimagine the surface that way the crash dumps can be obtained.

            Well, checked with a MS store close by, and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Since my warranty has now expired, they wanted to charge me $250 to have it taken in and replaced, which is extremely unhelpful. Guess I'll stick with just the integrated
 graphics for now.&nbsp;
