    <title>N97 and firmware 12.2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N97 and firmware 12.2</h2>
                    
<p>Is it just me or did updating to firmware 12.2 really screw up the N97. It wasnt working all that bad for me before, but I figured I should update to the newer firmware. Now all the bugs they said the firmware would fix I am now having, and never had before.
 The phone takes at least 5 minutes to boot up, and goes to the home screen but the widgets dont load correctly. And if you try to open anything it will take forever and if you try to open the app viewer to close them it will completely lock up and have to
 be restarted. Once you have the phone up and running for about 15 min without touching anything&nbsp;it will become usable but exetremely slow. Just opening up a text message takes 30+ seconds and all the menus load very very slow. Plus it no longer will allow
 connections to the network, such as when I go to web browser it asks what connection to use and no matter what I choose it just says "Connecting" and never connects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very very annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight I am going to do yet another hard reset and reinstall the firmware. Hope it helps solve the problems Im having. Seems I always have to reinstall the firmware updates 2 or 3 times before they start working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm excited about this "big" update coming in september or october Hope it fixes all these issues instead of just adding more features to break.</p>

            ok always FIRST do the firmware update and then right after follow it with *#7370# default code 12345. not the other way around. there is no point of doing reset prior to firmware. and yes v12 is much more stable, faster and really trouble free for me
 so go ahead and try to reinstall followed by reformat.&nbsp;

    <title>Cropped picture area is note removed when compressing pictures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabriel camarena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cropped picture area is note removed when compressing pictures</h2>
                    
<p>Using Excel 2007 on Windows XP SP3</p>
<p>Before on Excel 2003 when I compress a picture and selected the "Delete cropped areas of pictures" after save the cropped area no longer existed in the document and the file size went down and after opening again, you can no longer reset to its original
 size before the cropping. Now in Excel 2007, if i do the same procedure, it seems that it's not deleting the cropped area since after the save the file size does not go down and even if you close an re-open the file you can still reset the picture to its original
 size before the cropping.</p>
<p>Is there an option I'm missing somewhere? Is there a new procedure to get the same result? or shold I just settle on cropping and compressing the picture before inserting it in to Excel (and any other office 2007 application for that matter).</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>---Gabriel Camarena</p>

            I was able to replicate what you are observing. When selecting to "Compress Picture," does selecting "Apply to selected pictures only" have the desired effect?&nbsp; It worked for me.

<p>thank you for posting in the forum. </p>

<p>May I ask for a little more info about this, please, so we can help you better?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you try and enter the password, your screen just goes into time out, yes? Does that ever happen when you type othat things as well (texts, emails)?
</p>
<p>What happens if you set your screen time out to 30 miutes? Please set it to 30 minutes and see what happens.

<h2>            FM Transmitter lost after N97 firmware update to v11.0.021&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently noticed that the FM transmitter application is lost on my phone after I updated my N97 firmware to v11.0.021. This is very strange because I didn't uninstall anything. I checked setting&gt;connectivity &amp; I didn't find it there. Also, I checked it
 through Music player through Music&gt;Music Library&gt;Now playing screen&gt;Options &amp; again I didn't find it there!</p>
<p><font><font><font>Can anyone please help me with this? I do not have any hardware issue (e.g, my mobile didn't fall, break&nbsp;or anything)</font></font></font></p>
<p>Is there a way to reinstall the application knowing that the device has the necessary hardware for FM transmitter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My model type is: RM-505</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any info...</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>To close this post, regarding the FM transmitter, I confirm it's a product code issue related to region/country regulations. Some countries do not accept FM&nbsp;transmission&nbsp;that's why some variants do not have it. Others countries, however, accept it.</p>
<p>This is what happened in my case. I had a product code that doesn't allow FM transmission different than the country I reside it. So when I updated the firmware it was simply gone.</p>

<h2>            Office Applications Crash - Cannot Verify Subscription</h2>
                    <p>For the last two weeks I have not been able to use any of my Microsoft office software. I have a valid 365 subscription, I am connected to the internet using a Mac 10.11.6 (El Capitan). All my other applications work fine. I have tried deleting and reinstalling,
 but the problem persist. I really do not know what else to do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I open Word, Powerpoint or Excel, I instantly get this message:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">"Excel <em>{or Powerpoint or Word}</em> couldn't verify your office 365 subscription. Please make sure you are connected to the Internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go for "retry" it gets stuck and crashes after 1-2 minutes (and usually even the Microsoft crash report crashes right after). &nbsp;If I instead choose "Remind me later" the application usually crashes within 1-2 minutes, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            It works now. I think there was problem with Word calling Safari to get to the login screen. I am not 100% sure though. At least after I changed some security settings with Safari, it suddenly directed me to the login screen.

            Maybe not yet.<br />
<br />
In general, unless you have a specific need to support someone on an older version you might as well uninstall it when you get a new version.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Right now there are 3 reasons for keeping the old version.<br />
<br />
One is that if you are moving from 2003 / menu to Ribbon it is a steep learning curve. So you may want to keep the old one around until you are comfortable with the new version. That way you can fall back to the older version when you are in a hurry and "just
 have to get work done ...".<br />
<br />
Second is that if you look through the forum, you'll see that there are many who are having problems with 365 simply stopping working "at random". With the older version, you have a fail safe you can use.<br />
<br />
Third is if you have imported custom menus/toolbars created in 2003 or earlier into your Ribbon version of Office, you will need the 2003 edition to edit and customize these toolbars in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
One disadvantage is the the September Windows Updates introduced a problem that reset windows defaults to point away from 365 to the older version if it was present.<br />
<br />
Another good reason for removing an older version is if your hard drive is limited on space.

<p>Sounds like you failed to uninstall Office 2007, a 365 Install does not upgrade or overwrite a 2007 install.</p>
<p>Uninstalling any version of Office has no impact on any data files, they all remain.</p>

            You appear to be attempting to delete those rows from tbl_Mc Lernons Final which have a matching row in [Tbl_Exception Summary form numbers.&nbsp; If that is the case, then I would normally uses the EXISTS predicate rather than a JOIN in this context:<br />
<br />
DELETE *<br />
FROM [tbl_Mc Lernons Final]<br />
WHERE EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT *<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [Tbl_Exception Summary form numbers]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE [Tbl_Exception Summary form numbers].[form number] = <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [tbl_Mc Lernons Final].Repeat);<br />
<br />
This assumes that tbl_Mc Lernons Final is the referencing table in the relationship.&nbsp; If it is the referenced table, however, and referential integrity is enforced, as it should be, then you will not be able to do so, as the DELETE operation would violate referential
 integrity.<br />
<br />
BTW, in your original SQL statement the WHERE clause is redundant as an INNER JOIN returns only those rows where there is a match on the columns in the JOIN clause, which in your case are the same as those in the WHERE clause.<br />

            <p>Hello Dorian:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with playing your Music Pass content.&nbsp; The error you are getting means there is something preventing the proper drivers from being seen or used.&nbsp; There seems to be several things that
 can cause this.&nbsp; It could be related to the app itself, the computer you are using, the OS installed or the audio device being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have noticed this happening with just Xbox Music I would&nbsp;like to start focus here.&nbsp; There are a couple basic things you can do to correct issues with this application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear your computer temporary files.&nbsp; You can do this by pressing and holding the Windows key + R and typing %temp% in the search box.&nbsp; Highlight all the folders and files and delete them.&nbsp; If any refuse to delete, please skip those.</li><li>Once the above is done, uninstall the application from your computer.&nbsp; After it has uninstalled, reboot the computer.</li><li>Upon reboot, go to the store and download and install the application again and try to access your content.</li><li>If the issue continues the last thing to try is to run the following application troubleshooter,
<span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a>&nbsp; .</span></li></ol>

            Hi Pampro,<br />
<br />
Not sure what "sharing an Office 365 subscription" means, but each of the user owns the same storage quota. Here are more details:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-your-OneDrive-for-Business-storage-quota-7448173d-a38c-48cf-acbb-09ac1b6237d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set your OneDrive for Business storage quota</a><br />
<br />
To check your storage, in OneDrive for Business page, click Gear icon on the upper right corner &gt; Site Settings &gt; Storage Metrics.<br />
To manage the storage settings for your organization as an admin, go to:<br />
<p><a href="https://admin.onedrive.com/?v=StorageSettings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://admin.onedrive.com/?v=StorageSettings</a>
</p>
&nbsp; <br />
If you share a document, in fact it is still located in your own OneDrive for Business library, and can be seen in other's Shared with me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jim

<h2>            Word 2016 won&#39;t save file on OneDrive, insists on Save as</h2>
                    <p>I have a file on OneDrive that I usually keep open on my Windows 10 PC. I never edit it from other devices, it's there as a fail-safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to save the file I often get the Save as dialog instead. It seems to happen only if the file has been open for a while, but I'm not certain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is peculiar is that I can overwrite the original file. That is not supposed to happen, so it tells me that Word is editing a copy of the file, not the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular file is password protected. I have a gut feeling that the decryption process forces Word to operate on a copy of the original. It pretty much has to work that way. I think Word is trying to save that temporary file, knows that it can't, but
 has lost the link to the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pain in the neck. Does anyone else see this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're an Office Insider, the fix should be in the latest release <strong>Version 1705 (Build 8201.xxxx).</strong> We will provide you an update as soon as it gets rolled out to all subscribers.</p>

<h2>            latest upgrade lumia 635</h2>
                    After the latest windows 10 upgrade to build 10.0.14385.0 my lumia 635 has lost the ability to use cellular data to connect to the internet. This includes Cortana, mail, etc. Can make calls, text OK. But also won't download attachments to text msgs. But
 it all works ok on my home WiFi. My carrier couldn't fix it and referred me to Microsoft tech support. All data settings are good and a hard reset didn't fix it. Am I the only one this is happening to. Mrs. has same cell and updated on the same day but hers
 is working fine.

<h2>            How can I get Skype to recognize my camcorder already connected to my PC with a HD PVR 2&#63;</h2>
                    I have an unusual setup and am looking to Skype friends in other countries with real-time instructional and interacting video calls. Is this possible? We use this set up to stream on FB Live already, but they are not able to use Facebook but they do have
 access to Skype.

<h3> linda bell_1960  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio does not play on first slide after converting PP 2016 to MP4.</h2>
                    I have inserted an audio file (MP3) to play music on the first slide. Beginning on slide 2, the slides are narrated with MP3 recordings. The Power Point plays fine in slideshow view, but once I convert it to MP4 and play it back in the Windows Media Player,
 the audio does not play on the first slide. The narration does play beginning on the second slide. I have changed the settings numerous times and I can either get the music to play on slide 1, but then the audio does not play on slide 2 or the music does not
 play on slide 1, but the narration works. Please help. Thank you!

</p><p>Does this issue occurs with the particular .mp3 file? Try with different audio file and check.</p>

                    So recently my onenote won't allow me to choose what folder I want to print a document in. I used to get a pop-up that would allow me to choose what folder to put the document in but now it jut puts it in the same folder and I have to manually move it
 to the folder I want it in. does anyone know why this is happening? I don't think I have done anything different recently it just started happening.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To convert 341113 to 1434/11/13 use the formula:<br />
<br />
=TEXT(14&amp;A1,"0000\/00\/00")<br />
<br />
To convert to a Gregorian date, see the following links:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.access-programmers.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=246559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.access-programmers.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=246559</a><br />
<br />
It provides a UDF for this: StDteGregOfStDteHijri<br />
<br />
The following linkn is an on-line convertor:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.islamicfinder.org/dateConversion.php?mode=hij-ger&amp;day=21&amp;month=1&amp;year=1434&amp;date_result=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.islamicfinder.org/dateConversion.php?mode=hij-ger&amp;day=21&amp;month=1&amp;year=1434&amp;date_result=1</a><br />
<br />
The UDF can differ 1 day from the on-line convertor.<br />

            In the Skype (UWP) App you can test your camera under the settings found when clicking on your profile picture.&nbsp; To test if the camera functions outside of the Skype App, launch the Windows Camera App.
