<h2>            Recovery of deleted files on Nokia Lumia 925</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 925 and accidentally deleted a few important photos and want to get them back. I tried some recovery tools, like Wondershare, but could not sense my phone (it was connected through the charger cable). Is there a way to recover my files
 without resetting or deleting any file??

                    <span>
                    <span>
Is there any way to include a signature line when forwarding an email based on a rule? I have set up rules to sort incoming mail.&nbsp;
Each email has these rules applied: 1. Apply this rule after the message arrives with ___ in the subject line. 2. Have server reply using ____. 3. Forward it to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. 4. Move it to the _____ folder. Each rule works perfectly. Based on the subject line, each sender is replied to with an automated response, "We'll get back to you as soon as possible...etc." The email is forwarded to the proper person based on the subject line. And the email is moved to the proper .pst folder based on the subject line.&nbsp;
However, I am unable to include a signature with the forwarded message. If I am forwarding a message manually, the forward signature works fine. But when the rule automatically forwards an email, there is no signature line included.&nbsp;

<h2>            excel opens slowly unless another file is open</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having a problem with excel 2010 on my XP machine. When a file is opened, either off the desktop or out of My Documents the application itself will open but the spreadsheet will take anywhere from 15 sec to 2 minutes to load. As I said this is NOT on
 a network drive, although the computer is on a domain, this is stored locally on the PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the file does open up, you can open up other files and they open up normally. So as long excel has a file open either a blank file or spreadsheet in use, it works fine.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I have tried changing&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\EXCEL.EXE" /e "%1" with no affect.
</li><li>I have tried changing the files to different formats .xls and . xlsx </li><li>I have tried repairing with no affect. </li><li>I have checked the OVM updates and they are up to date.</li></ol>
<p>If this was happening over the network drive I could see why there would be a delay but not locally.&nbsp;Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

Thank you for your response Harrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried starting it in safe mode with no effect. But I did not try deleting the files on startup. I will try that later this afternoon, when the computer is available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Harrow that was the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dug into this folder and a PERSONAL.xls file was in there. I backed that file up and deleted it,&nbsp;excel then opened up like it was supposed to.&nbsp; I put the file back into the folder and excel started&nbsp;opening slowly again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the user if I could just
 delete from her computer since it was backed up but then the user informed me that the file was were her macro's were stored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She deleted the macro's that she did not use anymore, including one that she made when the computer had Office 2003 on it. After deleting the macro that was created in the Office 2003 format, excel started opening correctly. Going to check tomorrow, but
 I think that was the problem.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's kinda been bugging me that the Insider Hub App doesn't work like it should've been. Pictures sometimes do not show up, Announcements get cut off at the bottom, do not display properly, or do not display at all, and my profile in the app shows that I
 have collected all achievements (but clearly, I didn't). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just hoping that maybe this is just a major bug in my part, but I wanted to know if others experience it too. Are there ways to solve these problems, or do I need to wait for the next build to show up?</p>

Check whether you can view the document completely in the print preview.<br />
Also change the default printer to XPS document writer and see if it works:<br />

<p>You may even want to update or re-install you printer driver and see if that takes care, Once re-installing and updating my printer driver took care of my printing issues.</p>

            Or [latest version] for your operator variant... If you have operator spesific phone it's SW releases are approved by operator and Nokia's updater apparently is kind enough to install only latest version of whatever your dear operator has approved for
 you. My 6680 (generic, non-subsidised version) updated to 5.04.07 just fine with the updater.

<p>Hello. I have an older HPC syncing to Outlook 2003 via AS 3.8, so I think it should work. You must have had it working prior to the hard reset, right? AS partnerships should be remade if you make significant changes to the PC or the device. Make sure you
 delete the partnership out of AS and the device and start fresh. You could upgrade to 4.5 but you probably like 3.8 because it still supports syncing over WIFI.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have O365 setup using AADC with the password sync option enabled (We do not have ADFS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did not invoke ADFS because we did not really require SSO within our domain environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently using Exchange on-premise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the original user facing issues if we moved to Exchange Online was that the Outlook client would prompt for credentials. However I now believe with Modern Authentication this issue is now resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to understand if ADFS is a requirement of Modern Authentication or not?</p>

            It's not a requirement. But the client needs to support Modern auth/ADAL, which in the case of Outlook means either 2016 or 2013 (not older than an year).

            <span>Hi UselessUser,<br />
<br />
Modern authentication brings Active Directory Authentication Library (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ADAL</a>)-based sign-in to Office client apps across platforms. This enables
 sign-in features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), SAML-based third-party Identity Providers with Office client applications, smart card and certificate-based authentication, and it removes the need for Outlook to use the basic authentication protocol.
 The ADFS service is not required.<br />
<br />
However, ADFS is just a standards-based service that allows the secure sharing of identity information between trusted business partners (known as a federation) across an extranet. You can refer to the article below for more details:<br />

You can also refer to the article below for more details about Modern Authentication (ADAL).<br />

            Assuming you just want the symbol and it doesn't have to actually do anything, look at the Wingdings and Wingdings 2 fonts, which contain several variations. If you want a working check box, there are other approaches, but to just insert a symbol, use
 Insert | Symbols | Symbol | More Symbols..., setting the font to Wingdings or Wingdings 2.

<h2>            Facebook app</h2>
                    Hey nokia you are providing windows phone 8 and 8.1 to lumia devices but you are not providing a perfect application on it specially Facebook application just look at android there applications are so efficient smooth .. In Facebook application there is
 no chat option yaa there has a messenger support but this the worst idea because the messenger is quite slow and it takes time to open the application and its quite hard to access Facebook in windows phone.Just move on nokia make a good Facebook application.

            Paulheu-the Facebook application of windows phone is not at all fine.The main thing is that it doesn't supports chat option in windows phone only it supports messenger its quite backward devoloper.

<p>As you clearly did not understand what paulheu wrote, here is another attempt to explain it to you - FACEBOOK have decided to remove the chat option from ALL apps for ALL platforms and replace it with messenger. As this is 100% FACEBOOK's decision, you should
 complain to them.</p>

That doesn't work because the program is no longer listed under the program manager.&nbsp; The program has been completely removed during the install.&nbsp;

            I had the exact same issue with my phone, so I uninstalled both Hotmail and Outlook apps, then went online and found the previous version of the Hotmail app (7.8.2.10.48.1206) in an APK file, I downloaded it and then reinstalled it. (just google Hotmail
 7.8.2.10.48.1206 apk) I disabled automatic updates on the Google Play app so it doesn't happen again, until they can find what is going on and fix all the bugs. Hope it helps!<br />
<br />
To be able to install this app you have to go in your phone to Settings&nbsp; --&gt; Applications&nbsp; --&gt; Check "Unknown sources" then you can install the app you downloaded from other sources (the web) instead of the Google Play store.<br />
<br />
To disable automatic updates, go to the Google Play app on your phone, then go to Settings, and un-check where it says "Auto-update apps". That should do the trick.<br />
<br />
By the way, my phone is an old LG Optimus One P500, with Android 2.2<br />

<h2>            Word 2007 - How do I create a parent document from which others &#40;child docs&#41; can be created, but also merge any future changes to the parent doc into the child docs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, here's my dilemma: I need to create a central document (template?) that contains core text and formatting from which I can create multiple versions to suit a variety of audiences, to be edited by others for their purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once these versions have been created, I was hoping that I could then merge any changes to the central document into the version docs without having to copy and paste the changes into each version doc.</p>
<p>Is this possible in Word 2007?&nbsp; If not, are there any workarounds, e.g. PDF editing?</p>

            <div>It sounds to me as if you need to create a parent document that contains specific chunks of text that can be bookmarked and then use IncludeText fields in the child documents. When you update the bookmarked content in the parent document, you should be
 able to then update it automatically in the child documents. For more, see&nbsp;<span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/includetextfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/TblsFldsFms/includetextfields.htm</a></span></div>

<p>
</p><p>I removed <strong>Messaging Everywhere</strong> (<strong>Beta</strong>) app on my Windows 10 insider. it was not syncing my SMS and also showing some old skype chat messages. tried to sign-out and sign in again but still same issue. so&nbsp; i planned to uninstall
 it so that all cache data, history can get clean and once re-install it i can have clean app. so i uninstalled it with simple thought that app will available in store to re-install it. But now its now showing store or unable to find any way to install it again.
 is there any way to install this app again except reinstalling / restoring windows.
