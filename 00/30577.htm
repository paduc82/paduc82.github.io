                    I recently installed windows vista 32bit on my home pc and I have set up my xbox as a media centre extender but whenever i turn my xbox on i get a window pop up on my pc asking me to find and install correct driver,now i have searched both on this site
 and over the internet and the only answers i get are about the 360 wired controller which is not what i want,so does anyone have any ideas.

            <p>WHY OH WHY OH WHY does no-one actually read what is written in these threads then,Well i guess obviously not BECAUSE where in there does it say XBOX CONTOLLER it doesn't,what i need is the correct driver because every time i turn my xbox on when my pc is
 on my pc wants to install a driver that cannot be found so if anyone has any ideas as to where this mysterious driver could be please respond to this thread.</p>
<p>IF YOUR GOING TO REPLY WITH A LINK TO THE XBOX WIRED CONTROLLER DRIVER STAY AWAY</p>

            Exact same problem. This is nothing to do with xbox 360 controller drivers. (stupid auto-response bots). For me it started popping up not too long after the last console update. Since then streaming from my PC has been a real hit and miss affair.

<h2>            Windows 10 hosts file used by another process</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I need to edit my hosts file but the previous methods I used on windows 8 or 7 will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>I have set the permission for the "hosts" file to full access for the current user. I have even taken the ownership. Current user is in Administrators group.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I have turned off UAC.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I have removed read only permission from the file.</p>
<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc&gt;attrib hosts
A            C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
</code></pre>
</li><li>
<p>I have disabled my Panada Antivirus. I have also stopped 3 panda services from Services palette (heck, I even uninstalled panda but no use).</p>
</li><li>
<p>I open an elevated Command Line (run as Administrator). Run Notepad and change the file. When I try to save the file I receive the following error:</p>
<p>"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I check the file using "Unlocker" and the software says there is no active lock on the file. I again checked with Sysinternals Process explorer and even that cannot find a handle to the hosts file.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?<br />

            I could eventually find the culprit. It was a program called "Tiny Firewall" (a windows firewall rule management software) that caused the problem.<br />
<br />
I am not exactly sure what does it do to the hosts file because none of the available software could show a lock on the file. I quit the UI and stopped the process (would not allow to stop, killed the process-tree and set to manual process).<br />

<h2>            when I try to open almost any executables I get the error message &#8220;Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item.&#8221;</h2>
                    <p><span>I am using Windows 7 SP1, upgraded over Vista. recently I had to install&nbsp; a large number of Windows updates, program updates, driver
 updates, and a couple of new programs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, after a restart, when I try to open almost any executables I get the error message “<b>Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission
 to access the item.</b>”<span>&nbsp; </span>I am the sole user and administrator. “Run as administrator” only allows me to open Firefox, IE and Chrome, and a few other not very helpful things like Notepad. I went back to a restore point several days before
 I installed all this stuff with no effect. Attempts to open C:\ give me “<b>C:\ is not accessible. Access is denied.</b>” Trying to change properties brings up “<b>The name ‘C:\’ specified in the Target box is not valid. Make sure the path
 and file name are correct.</b>” My antivirus is Symantec Endpoint Protection; I cannot open it and the start menu folder shows up as “(empty)”. My license may have expired because I got it from under an organization license which might not apply to me now
 but I also have Spyware Blaster and Spybot S&amp;D, both of which are up to date and neither of which have given me problems on my desktop either under XP or Win 7 or previously on the laptop under Vista. I tried to run Super Antispyware from a flash drive but
 still got the access message. The ‘remove hardware’ icon in the taskbar brings up “Open Devices and Printers” even though the tooltip is “Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media”. A download to my desktop also gives the “access” message and trying to delete
 it gives the “C:\is not accessible” message. I tried System File Check but again got the "cannot access" message. I ran it again in safe mode and it found nothing. I have tried everything relevant that I can think of or that I have found with a Web search
 and nothing helps.<br />

            Thank you, Anoop, for sticking with me.<br />
I tried as you said. Windows recognized and opened the flash drive. But attempting to open the Windows Defender file directly or as administrator brought up the same old
<span>“<b>Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item.</b>”<span><br />
I have tried to get several other things done with the limited functions I have available. Symantec Endpoint will not open up at all. Spyware Blaster will not update. Spybot Search &amp; Destroy also will not update. Neither will TrendMicro Housecall. I could not
 connect to VirusTotal either. I could not get the plugin for the Bit Defender Online Scan. Active X controls don't download for scanners that require them.<br />
I have not tried to run anything from a command prompt; I wouldn't know what to do without instructions but it's one thing I haven't tried that strikes me as a possible way to get around whatever is wrong.<br />

<h2>            Windows Security Center Services Won&#39;t Start...</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>This is Suvadeep here.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Premium 32 Bit Edition. Recently I am getting an error
<strong><u>"Windows Security Center Services is turned off".</u></strong></p>
<p>It won't start at any cost. I have scanned my PC with Avira, Malwarebytes Antimalware and whatever vrius was there was removed.</p>
<p>For safety I&nbsp;have changed my Anti-Virus to Avast and did a full scan and found no virus. Also tried Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Recently I scanned my PC with<strong><u> "Microsoft Safety Scanner".</u></strong></p>
<p>I don't think that after so many scan there is a virus in my PC, but the problem is still there.</p>
<p>I have also tried to start from Services.msc. Immidiately after I start the service, it will automatically switch off. Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards</p>
<p>Suvadeep Paul.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You should only have one major antivirus program on the computer at one time. Uninstall all except one<br />
and run their maker's removal tool and/or check their maker's for special removal instructions. Having<br />
more than one and even their remnants can cause strange issues.<br />

Some antivirus/security products could be&nbsp;causing this error. McAfee, Norton, Windows Live OneCare,<br />
Threatfire are a few. Which antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine now. And<br />
which have you EVER had on it even if you uninstalled them. (These leave remnants which can cause<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Avast is a very good choice. For others you have had on the computer during the present<br />
installation of Windows be sure to run their maker's removal tools and check for any<br />
special removal instructions. The remnants they leave behind can cause strange issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I did it last night when I downloaded the avira uninstaller...</p>
<p>Interestingly after the scan it came up with 3 registry entry which is related to Avast, my current Antivirus...</p>
<p>So I didn't delete that...</p>
<p>Then I tried this step:</p>
<p>Start - type in the Search box -&gt; Sevices find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Set Security Center Service to AUTOMATIC (Delayed Start) and STARTED<br />
<br />
Didn't work..</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to run the uninstaller from each of the antivirus/security programs you had on the<br />
computer. <br />
<br />
i.e. If you had Norton then run the Norton Removal Tool, if you had McAfee run the McAfee<br />
Removal Tool, if you had AVG then run the AVG Removal tool and so on. Do not run the<br />
Avast Removal Tool if you plan to keep that. </p>
<p>Many of the Avira registry entries look like Avast however they should not be. Check with Avira<br />
Support.<br />
<br />
Try all the steps including setting ALL the services back to their defaults.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried the way you have mentioned earlier, by running all the antivirus removal tools...</p>
<p>Even I uninstalled my current antivirus avast and run the uninstaller...</p>
<p>It didn't work...</p>
<p>One thing I want to share with you is that, Windows Defender is not working...</p>
<p>When I am trying to run a pop up is showing where its writing "windows Defender is turned off" and pop goes off...Nothing is happening...I tried to start it from Services.msc...Didn't work....</p>
<p>Yesterday after uninstalling Avast I tried to install Microsoft Security Essential...</p>
<p>To my surprise, same thing is happening as Windows Defender...Can't use that...</p>
<p>Except Microsoft Security Software, all antivirus and antispyware are working...</p>
<p>Don't know why...</p>
<p>Is there any way out or I have format my PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Possibly you have some undetected malware causing the situation.<br />
<br />
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

<p>Hi, I'm currently breaking my head over this problem I have. All of a sudden I am missing the "new text file" option in the context menu.</p>
<p>I mean , iv bloody had it just a few days ago and now all I can get is a Rich text document. Even if I rename .rtf document to .txt it still writes some bull ____ in it.</p>
<p>Anyway this isn't a real issue for me because I use notepad++ but still, I don't like when stuff on my computer happens without me knowing it so what I want is someone to explain to me on how exactly this could have happened.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 charging only when switched off</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the forum and net but could not find my specific case, I own a Surface Pro&nbsp;4 since a year and today It just started to not charge the Laptop when connected&nbsp;to the charging adapter. The light won't turn on and I also don't get any type of error
 such as battery not detected it simply not charge like it would when the plug is not inserted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I unplug&nbsp;and plug again the 2 pin connector to the wall the lights goes on charges for 10/15 seconds then stops, however, if I unplug from the magnetic pin connected to the surface it just not detect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I turn off the Surface and I&nbsp;unplug and plug the connector into the wall it charges the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel it likes a software problem&nbsp;because the battery holds the charge, but I am no longer able to charge the Surface while is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all the suggested troubleshooting,&nbsp;including uninstalling&nbsp;and installing the battery drivers no joy&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jivan</p>

 has access to many of my folders. Is there anyway to create a dedicated desktop for her, while not interfering with any of my files or desktop icons?</p>

                    I have no idea why it keeps turning off on its own but it does. &nbsp;I leave my computer on and it goes into rest mode at night, which means it is off. &nbsp;It seems like I have to turn the Windows Firewall back on almost every day now. &nbsp;What's the problem??

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have this exact same problem on my MacBook Pro. &nbsp;The camera works, I see myself, then when the caller on the other computer answers, my little square goes to a round circle spinning, and the video icon gets a slash through it and the other caller cannot
 see my video while I can see theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the privacy settings as you suggested, and they allow video from my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sure would be nice to call and talk to someone about this, instead of playing guessing games with a community that can't seem to solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype used to work just fine before Microsoft bought it. &nbsp;I used it all over the world. &nbsp;Now it doesn't work. &nbsp;Hmmm....</p>

I think i solved by<br />
<br />
Simply run a command prompt as an administrator (right-click on it and click<br />
"Open as Administrator") then enter the following command line:<br />
<br />
net localgroup "Administrators" "NT Authority\Local Service" /add<br />
<br />

<h3> dibby0078  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update killed my wireless</h2>
                    <p>I am on an almost brand new Lenovo desktop that was purchased with Windows 10. &nbsp;Everything has been working smoothly for the last 6 weeks until a recent update from Windows. &nbsp;I turned on the computer to find the screen greeting me with images words like
 " we've made changes" and "you're going to like this"....ugh.</p>
<p>So now, whenever my computer sleeps and then wakes up again - it cannot connect to the internet. &nbsp;The "Windows Wireless Connector" just will stop working - don't know why - no rhyme, no reason.</p>
<p>I have to restart the computer totally in order for the wireless to "turn back on" - it's BS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to do a system restore but the computer will not let me choose a date from a week ago - it's just reverting back to today/now as my only option.</p>
<p>

            <p>I think it'd probably be a great first step to go to the Lenovo website and re-download the wireless drivers for your model of computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Don't use Windows built-in "device manager" to check for driver updates, get them directly from Lenovo website itself.</p>

<h2>            Purchased content for minecraft won&#39;t complete downloads</h2>
                    I bought the master pack minecraft for Windows 10. Some of the included and additional purchased mashups and textures are stuck in the downloading phase. It will not let me stop or restart the download. It will not install by trying to start a new world
 with the packs. What can I do to get my content in my game?

<p>I am having the same issue. So, I ran the command&nbsp;Get-AppXPackage -Name "Microsoft.MinecraftUWP" | Foreach {Add-AppXPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}. I can confirm the command ran successfully. I then rebooted
 the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, that did not resolve the issue. My last purchase, "Wizard School" is still stuck at downloading 0%. So are two free items, "Inspiration Islan" and "Catastrophic Pandemonium."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other troubleshooting steps can be attempted.</p>

<p><span><span>Unfortunately, there’s no option for the Skype for Windows 10 UWP to be on the start-up or never been present in the Startup tab. Windows apps are not
 managed the same way as Win32 application. The classic Skype for Windows Desktop is a Win32 application, Skype UWP is not.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you close your computer without signing out of the Skype UWP application, then on next computer boot, Skype will auto run in the background. To maximize
 Skype UWP you will just need to click on the application icon. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            UPnp e porta 3074</h2>
                    
<p>Salva a tutti a volte ho non pochi problemi di connessione e quando vado a fare una prova di connessione,la xbox mi da questi suggerimenti:Abilitare UPnp e aprire porta 3074.Ho chiamato fastweb che mi ha detto che l'UPnp lo devo attivare io quando vado a
 fare la configurazione sulla xbox mentre la porte 3074 è già aperta.Allora vorrei sapere come fare questa configurazione così che sia attivato l'UPnp e come mai la xbox mi dice che la porta 3074 è chiusa e fastweb dice che è aperta.Grazie per le risposte</p>

            Skype for Windows 10 follows the language set as default in your operating system's Language Preferences, which may differ from the Windows display language. Please note that when you go through these steps, other applications may be affected as well.
<br />
<br />To use Skype for Windows 10 in a different language:
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, then the Settings gear.
<br />    Select Region &amp; Language settings, select the desired language and click on Set as default.
<br />
<br />    It will appear as the first item in the list of languages:
<br />
<br /> 
<br />    Restart Skype for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
<br />If the desired language is not already available in the list, you may add it by downloading a language pack:
<br />
<br />    Select Region &amp; Language settings, select Add a language.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />    Navigate to the desired language and follow instructions to download the language pack.
<br />
<br />        Learn more about the languages packs available for Windows 10.

<br />
<br />    Note: After a new language pack is installed for Windows, it may not display until Skype for Windows 10 updates again.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05776c28-38d0-4a85-93c4-e4e56424285d?upload=true" />
