<h2>            Camera issues Lumia 930</h2>
                    
<p>I have had a Lumia930 for about 6 montha and on the whole it has been great, but in the last few weeks the camera has developed a bit of a weird fault. When staionary, the camera seems to judder resulting in blurred photos 50% of the time and video clips
 which are constantly juddering. I have done a complete factory reset incase it is a sw issue and this hasn't helped. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>The last thing you can try is a full clean software reinstall using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Hey, I have exactly the same problem. I thought I may have damaged the camera itself. Have you had any luck with the clean software reinstall? Thanks

<h2>            My lumia 520 has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello!!</p>
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 520 and recently it has been running low on memory. Since yesterday it's functions have stopped working even though I deleted all my apps to free some space. Now, the wifi works, my whatsapp works, bluetooth, ringtones, flight mode,
 other apps like games, all of these work. But the messsages, contacts, photos, storage sense, camera, podcasts, app store, my email account, all of these have stopped working. Every time I tap on something, it loads, but immediately crashes. I need help!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried to reset the software by pressing volume down key and power key at the same time but it didn't help. Hope this detail is enough for you to help me solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s when I connect my phone to my laptop it doesn't open anything, like it shows the phone icon on the screen but when I open it, it's empty.</p>

            <p>Hi. Sorry to learn about your experience. To clarify, some of the pre-installed apps are no longer working, correct? Aside from clearing some space, it is also important to make sure that your phone's software is up to date. The detailed instruction on how
 to do that can be seen on this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/.</a> If you continue to experience the&nbsp;same&nbsp;issue even after updating&nbsp;its software, the next step is to restore it to its default settings. This process will delete all the information
 stored on your Lumia 520; hence, backup is a must. For backing up and resetting steps,&nbsp;visit this:

<p>
</p><p>As for your other concern, may we know why did you connect the phone to your PC? If you're looking for PC tools to transfer your data, you'll find all helpful info here:

    <title>Columns jumping all by themselves - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> schionatulander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Columns jumping all by themselves</h2>
                    I'm working with a spreadsheet with over 20,000 rows and about 50 columns. I've noticed twice that the content of one column for about 1000 rows (mostly continuous but not completely) jumps to the column to the right, replacing the content. Both times
 I noticed this by chance, and I'm not aware of having done anything myself to make this change. I occasionally save another copy, and the last "column jump" apparently occurred with the saving of the newest copy. What is going on? Has anyone else experienced
 this? How can I avoid this? Thanks for any help.

            Perhaps if you'd explain what "jumping" means to you, we may be able to help. perhaps Excel is trying build a table, and is using the "gap" to define the end. Try Excel preferences, Tables tab and uncheck Automatically expand tables as I type. See if this
 helps.<br />

            I mean that the content of, say, column "J" has moved to column "K". Column "J" is now empty, and the the content that used to be in column "K" is completely gone. It hasn't been happening as I've been typing, either. In the previous saved version, the
 content of these columns was where I had put it. What makes it even trickier for me is that it doesn't seem to be happening to content that I'm currently working on, but at many rows above where I've been working on. I only notice it if I happen to look for
 something outside the area I'm working on.<br />
<br />
What does "automatically expand tables" do?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Automatically expand tables allows Excel to assume you are working with a table. if you type an entry at the bottom row of a table and press enter or tab, excel will activate the cell at the top of the next column in wht it thinks is a table. If you are
 rapidly entering data and not looking at what is happening you may be running into this. Try turning the option off and see what happens.<br />

            Bob,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the explanation of tables. I've turned off this option, but I suspect it won't help. I've been working with this workbook for two years. I do rapidly enter data, but I also look at what I'm doing, so I notice things that happen immediately as long
 as they're in a section I can see. It's possible that I accidentally hit a key combination for a command, but I don't know what command would shift cell data. It's not something that happened as I was typing, anyway, because in the previous saved copy of the
 workbook, the content of these 1000 rows is as they should be.<br />
<br />
I can't just fix the worksheet by copying/pasting from the previous one because I don't know what I may have edited in the meantime. Is there a way to compare workbooks/worksheets comparable to Word's ability to compare documents for differences?<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yours is the first report I have ever seen that this has happened in Excel (like for over 20 years), so the problem is highly unusual. If it happens again, then something is wrong on your Mac. Otherwise I would have to say you accidentally did something
 to cause the data to move from one column to another. If the problem occurs again, post a new question with lots of details about your Mac OS update level, Excel update level, file format, file contents, and exact steps you took when the problem occurred.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For now, let's focus on the problem you are having with comparing documents.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As Bob said, there are hundreds of different ways to compare spreadsheets. Do you want to compare formulas? Data? Objects? If it's data, you might save each version (old and new) as CSV and then use Word's compare documents to highlight the differences.</p>

            Jim,<br />
<br />
Searching the web, I wasn't able to find any other reference to this problem. I thought maybe it's possible there are some keyboard shortcuts I'm not familiar with that would e.g. select a number of cells and another that would move them. Do such shortcuts
 exist? The peculiar thing, though, is that it happened both times in an area I wasn't working with.
<br />
<br />
Searching the web, I find all kinds of warnings against using Excel as a database but no real reasons *why*. I was intending to use it as a first step and then import the data into a database program, but this fluke is making me think it's time to make the
 move now, so hopefully the problem won't be occurring again.<br />
<br />
I did, btw, verify disk permissions and verify disk. Some permissions were corrected but the disk was fine.<br />
<br />
As for the comparison, I wanted to compare whether I had inserted rows in the new version vs. the old so that I could copy/paste the missing data accurately, but it might just be easiest to compare by hand.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips.<br />

            The problem is bigger than I thought. While trying to fix the messed-up columns, I noticed that the content of another column had also been overwritten by the column to the left without my noticing -- months ago. In this case, almost 6000 cells were affected,
 and the column to the left was hidden. I don't notice these things without carefully looking because many cells are blank anyway. I can only tell by comparing with earlier saved versions of the workbook.<br />
<br />
It seems a problem this old isn't an easy thing to solve. So my questions:<br />
<br />
1. Could an expert sitting in front of my computer be able to figure out more based on this "old data" and not based on the problem recurring today? (Looking at Console, I see for today "Microsoft Excel[490] &lt;Error&gt;: CGBitmapContextCreate: invalid data bytes/row:
 should be at least 7680 for 8 integer bits/component, 3 components, kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst.")<br />
<br />
2. Could this be caused by a worm/virus? (If so, I would suspect others would be reporting this problem.)<br />
<br />
3. Is it possible for the missing data to still be saved somewhere in the file, even if it's not showing properly?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>It sounds like you are now focused on trying to troubleshoot the root cause of the problem. Hopefully, you were able to untangle the data. Here are my comments about your questions:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. I doubt it. There are many possible causes for the problem of data jumping around. Three possibilities that are work exploring:</p>
<p>a. You have a RAM module that is failing. Boot to the system recovery disc that came with your Mac and hold the D key down to display the Apple Diagnostics. Do a complete test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. An Excel preference file is bad. I've never heard of a bad preference file causing the problem you have, but you never know</p>
<p>c. Something is wrong in Mac OS X. Use a disk utility to rebuild the volume headers and directory.</p>
<p>d. Something is wrong with peripheral hardware. A wireless keyboard's battery may be weak, for example.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Unlikely. Worms and viruses spread like wildfire and everyone would be reporting similar symptoms. So far you're the only one.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Unless there are hidden rows, columns or ranges, no.</p>
<p><br />

            Jim,<br />
<br />
Still working on the untangling. Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
a. Apple Diagnostics said everything was all right.<br />
b. I changed the "Main Identity", which I had seen suggested in other posts.&nbsp; Is there something else I can reset?<br />
c. Used Disk Utility to verify disk &amp; repair disk permissions. Some disk permissions needed to be repaired -- could the problem have been there?<br />
d. No wireless hardware.<br />
<br />
Still have to think of a way to verify the problem isn't recurring as I continue to use the file.<br />

<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac &#40;Office 365&#41; - no pkg-files can be downloaded during installation and Autoupdate</h2>
                    <p>My iMac running OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 does'nt "like" Office 365 for Mac, Home version any more. Until mid December everything ran well and Autoupdate performed as expected (although updated very frequently with huge files downloaded). This suddenly stopped
 and now all downloads - of pkg-files - stops shortly after download has been initiated; - no wellcome screen shows up. After a while the error is "Unknown error".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This applies to all Microsoft Autoupdater initiated updates and also to the full installation file from my account. I have tried to un-install the complete package also to completely un-install, both following Microsoft Support Procedures. The package was
 re-installed by a Microsoft Supported remotely connected by downloading to a USB-key on a PC and the installing from this. Activation was a bit muddy - required a couple of Keychain deletions - but it succeded. Until the next update were initiated - no download
 of the pkg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a common problem as I also run a MacBook Air with similar OS and Office - no problems at all! Fully updated Office 2016 for Mac and Autoupdater 3.3.0 running perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to get some qualified help in this forum - as it seems quite a few good people share this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Per</p>

            <p>This morning my until now fully functionally MacBook Air also denied to install Microsoft Updater 3.4.0 - after a while the "Unexpected error" came up. I decided not to do anything on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my iMac I now tried to run the Autoupdate in safe mode (remember to enter safe mode only after at least 10 sec complete shutdown - not just a restart), and actually the Autoupdater 3.4.0 installed successfully. Afterwards it installed Word 15.17.1 and
 Outlook 15.17.1 successfully, and no more updates were available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems as the problem has been solved.</p>

<p>I entered the DNS 8.8.8.8 - and as magic the Autoupdater was installed! So my feeling is: Try this as the first shot - but an explanation would be nice!!</p>

<h3> john_lam---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 slow charging on 2A car adapter since 8.1 Update 1 &#47; Cyan</h2>
                    
<p>My 1520 used to charge fast using my 2A car charger with a USB charging cable (i.e., no data). Since 8.1 Update 1 or Cyan (not sure which one) the phone now complains about charging slowly while plugged into the same charger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is definitely an issue as I can repro this on 2 separate 1520s that I have tried it on. Somewhere in the upgrade path from 8 to 8.1 Update 1 some software update now makes my phone charge slower. Last night I swapped out my old 1520 for the phantom
 touch issues that were driving me crazy for a new one (yay Microsoft Complete). On the drive home while running Windows Phone 8, phone charged super-fast. This morning after all of the updates to 8.1 Update 1 / Cyan, it now charges super-slowly and complains
 with the new slow charging dialog that only shows up in Cyan builds AFAIK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else seeing this? I can't imagine that I'm the only one here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-John</p>

<br />
Strange bit is all was working fine until I used a non-compatible USB cable to connect the device to my laptop last night. Charged the phone for a bit, but when I got home and connected the proprietary wall charger to the phone,I was greeted with the "phone
 charging slowly" message.<br />
<br />
Hope Microsoft is able to resolve this.

<h2>            gpedit.msc default settings</h2>
                    Hi. I have recently uninstalled a third party program and it has taken away a lot of my systems settings. I am gradually working my way through and it seems to be going well. I am currently running Win 7 Ultimate. I have found that all of the settings
 in the gpedit.msc Administrator template/System/Internet Communications Manager/Internet Communication settings are sitting at Not Currently set up. this is playing havoc with Windows Up Dates and Checking for Solutions. I have changed some but purely guess
 work. I want to set them to the default settings but don't understand which to choose. I do relies that there are 2 Administrator Template settings and again I am unsure which to use. To fix this problem will mean the program should look after its self. Any
 advice would be very gratefully received.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have run the Fix It program but I don't think it goes into this sort of detail. &nbsp;

            <p><font><span>Many thanks for getting back to me. Here are the answers to the questions you have asked:</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font><span>The program I uninstalled was Soluto. I purchased it to speed up my computer and keep it running at its best. When the renewal came up I decided it was not worth
 the cost as everything it does is covered by Windows Update and the Check for solutions program.</span></font>
</li></ol>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;I uninstalled the program using Control Panel / Programs / Programs and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Features / Uninstall or Change a Program. I completed the
 task and checked the / Action Centre / Maintenance / Check for solution to problem reports / Settings / Choose when to check for solutions to problem reports / and it was locked out at / Never check for solution (not recommended) /</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font><span>I could not change the setting to Automatically Update Windows or Automatically Check for Solutions.</span></font>
</li></ol>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font><span>&nbsp;I was recommended to down load the Fix it program and run / Fix problems with programs that cant be uninstalled or installed / by the very helpful Microsoft
 Community. I did this along with a recommended Clean Boot and Fix a corrupt User Account. None of the features had any effect.</span></font>
</li></ol>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font><span>I have been reading most of the posts on the Community site on a regular basis and found an article that had a similar problem and it was fixed by opening up
 the gpedit.msc program and making adjustments. I had nothing to loose as every day I was missing up dates or solution checks. I used the following: Local Computer Policy / There are 2 Administrative templates. One Computer Admin template and the other User
 Configuration. I then checked the System on each and looked at anything to do with Update / Diagnostics etc. Nothing was either Enabled or Disabled and everything is showing as Not Configured. I did something out of share desperation and now the setting for
 / Check for solutions / is set at automatically download but ask the Administrator first??</span></font>
</li></ol>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>&nbsp;I hope this information is of help as I just want the system to run as it should</span></font></p>

            Hello Ealg,<br />
<br />
<br />
If it asks you for your payment information when you are trying to download iOS apps, including the Office apps, it could be that you have a credit card information saved on your App Store that needs to be updated. If so, we advise that you contact Apple for
 further assistance, or post on Apple forums.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you have other concerns.

<h2>            Not able to edit charts in PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am not being able to edit charts created in PowerPoint 2016. The "Edit Data" and "Edit Data in Excel" buttons seem not to work at all. I am running Windows 10.

<p>Hi Fidel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could either be a missing or a corrupted data file that is causing this issue. We'd like to know more information about this concern so we could provide the best resolution. Kindly answer the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue? </li><li>Are you experiencing this issue on all of your Excel files? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you check this article for the steps on how to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>start your PC in safe mode in Windows
 10</strong></a> and perform the same task in PowerPoint. This will start Windows in a basic state with a limited set of files and drivers. If the same function worked in safe mode, this means that there's a program that's affecting PowerPoint's performance
 and a clean boot is needed. You can check this article for the steps on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>how to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></a>. This will eliminate any software conflicts that could be affecting PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, install and run the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (OffCAT) from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2812744/office-configuration-analyzer-tool-offcat-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for a detailed report of any known problems found by the tool when it scans your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Jaune, thanks for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, to answer your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I installed Windows 10 Fall Creators updat</strong>e (which according to other / similar questions seems to be creating the issue -https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_win10-mso_2016/unable-to-edit-data-in-charts-in-ppt-2016-using/c747c01a-155e-4a5d-a40a-18437e65c1cb).
<strong>I also installed Microsoft Project</strong></li><li><strong>The issue happens in PowerPoint, not in Excel, </strong>when trying to edit charts created in PowerPoint, I don't use Excel for creating or editing PowerPoint charts</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all your suggestions and the issue persists. Let me elaborate</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe mode:
<ul>
<li>PowerPoint does not launch in SafeMode, I got a "Something went wrong" message. Error code is 30068-4 (1084). This only happens in Safe Mode though. PowerPoint launches "normally" in normal mode, but chart editing issue persists</li><li>Uninstalled and reinstalled Office, and chart editing issue persists</li><li>After reinstalling Office, I tried launching PowerPoint in SafeMode and&nbsp;chart editing issue persists</li></ul>
</li><li>Clean Boot:
<ul>
<li>The problem with editing charts persists</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>OffCAT</p>
<ul>
<li>I run the diagnostic and nothing is coming out as an "issue". Below a screen of the report</li></ul>

<strong>Install Office updates</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the updater and I got a message stating "You're to date!...."&nbsp; No&nbsp; updates were installed. Also tried leaving excel open before opening PowerPoint. Unfortunately, neither work and still I am not able to edit charts in PowerPoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I found, not sure if related, is that when I run the Compatibility Checker, I got an issue stating that "a chart in this document may contain data in cells outside of the row and column limit", which is inaccurate as the data in the table was included
 in the first row and first column...</p>
<p>

<p>I contacted Microsoft Support. The agent suggested I bought Office 365 so I can have access to Level 2 troubleshooting, in essence pay more to solve an issue for a piece software I already paid for...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a solution to this problem, that not only was caused by an update to the OS, but also seems to be affecting many other people. I do not need buy a subscription to a different software</p>

<p>Uninstalling and cleaning the registry before reinstalling PowerPoint should fix this issue. You can refer to this article for a complete guide on how to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>uninstall Office from a PC</strong></a> and look for the steps to <strong>
Completely uninstall Office 2016 with the easy fix tool</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the above resolution and fix the issue with no good, try launching PowerPoint and perform the same activity on it on a different user profile to help us identify if there's an error or corruption on your current account. If the issue doesn't
 seem to appear on a different user profile, then we've concluded that your current user account is corrupted and it is best that you transfer all of your files on the user profile that you just created. In case that you don't have other user profile, you can

<h2>            Microsoft Phone  Lumia 520 passcode freezes then switches off</h2>
                    <p>I've just had to take the battery out of my phone as it completely froze. Now I've turned it on and I type my passcode in and it freezes for about 10-15 seconds. It then eventually goes to the start screen and after another 10-15 seconds it switches off.
 Then the phone kicks back into life. And the cycle continues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried turning it off manually and it turns it self back on despite being no charger plugged in!! Any ideas? It's a relatively new phone, only had it for about 4 months&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you are resetting because of an error or issue, restoring a backup will reintroduce that error.&nbsp; For the most part, after a hard reset, most programs are easily reinstalled because they are all on your PC.&nbsp; Once a new artnership is established
 you should be able to easily restore.&nbsp; The only issue is codes that might have to be e]re-entered so make sure you maintain a list of codes and programs.</p>

<h2>            N8 Shortcuts widget is acting up</h2>
                    
<p>I have a small problem with adding a shortcuts widget to my home screen. No matter how I try, there is always 1 or 2 "?" on it. I add the programs or bookmarks I want but there is always this question mark.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Possible Solution:</p>
<p>I guess the problems related to the shortcuts widgets are related to homscreen #2 and #3.</p>
<p>Delete the widgets in those homescreens.</p>
<p>Make a change in homscreen #1's shortcut widget.</p>
<p>Save.</p>
<p>Now insert a new shortcut widget in homescree #2 (or #3)...</p>
<p>The problem should now be solved ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least for me it is.</p>

            <p>If you are inserting the header and page number as building blocks, then each will replace the other. There are several alternatives. The first and simplest is just to double-click in the header area and type/insert whatever text you require. You can insert
 a PAGE field by pressing Alt+Shift+P.</p>
<p>If you want to insert a page number in a header building block that doesn't include one, place the insertion point where you want the page number and press Alt+Shift+P to insert a simple number or, if you want&nbsp;one of the fancy ones,&nbsp;use the Current Position
 setting for Insert Page Number and then choose from the gallery.</p>

            It seems that you have your Outlook mail account set to leave a copy of the messages on the server. Thus it will download them again next time you access them. Either turn that option off (it's amongst the advanced settings associated with the mail account)
 or set it to a much shorter value than indefinitely.<br />
<br />
As for all those old messages on the server, access via the server's web interface and delete them.<br />

<h2>            PowerApps - Change layout of App</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm watching / reading resources online regarding PowerApps in Office365. These suggest that I can change the BrowseScreen1 layout to something else?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not see these same options? Instead I see, Properties, Rules and Advanced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that the option has been moved to somewhere else with PowerApps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone inform me whereabouts the layout options have moved too?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>6680 Wellcome Tone- turning off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fsbg  say:</h3>
<h2>            6680 Wellcome Tone- turning off</h2>
                    Hi:<br />
I am wondering if anyone could tell me how to turn off the Welcome Tune on my 6680? This model does not seem to offer that option. I went to the Nokia shop, they didn't know either.<br />
I am sure that people do appreciate not disturbing others when turning on the mobile phone in certain places!

            i have never been able to do that on my 6680, however i do know that if you are in silent mode before you switch off you will be in silent when you switch on, so no welcome tone. its not to tricky to put it on general either, but i think i am like most
 others and have my phone on silent during the day

            Hi again!<br />
I don't use the phone often and it is usually in my handbag if I go out.<br />
I usually have it on virbationg alert and on accending volume.<br />
<br />
I'll never hear the phone ring if it is on silent mode!<br />
<br />
It is a poor decision and poor design for Nokia to change this option to no option!<br />
<br />
Thanks for writing.

            well, i guess its just a matter if taste, my phone is rarely off - in fact i dont think the only reason it would go off is if the battery died. i'm sure someone in castle nokia is reading up on this though and has noted it

When you turn on the phone, you can stop the welcome sound by pressing a key. So atleast you do not have to listen to it all.<br />

            Good morning - unfortunately, I tried it several times and it didn't work for me! Besides from the welcome tune, there were those noisy beeps when you turn it on or confirming entered pass codes, etc. (Silent Keypad does not include this function.) Putting
 the phone on Silent mode to avoid this procedure is a bit drastic and restrictive!
<br />
<br />
In the pass, at least I can over-ride the volume with a side button control, but now you can only do that once the phone is on.<br />
<br />
I think I am going to claim my old 6230 phone back from my husband!<br />
<br />
That was a great idea, thank you anyway.<br />
<br />
P.S. Does anyone know if Nokia actually monitors this site and taking in the plights of people with theri products? This is a real STEP backward for Nokia.

            yup, we are here and listening ;-)<br />
<br />
I will pass on these comments on the welcome tone, however you can disable the keypad tones and the warning tones on this phone.<br />
<br />
To do this go into menu - tools - profiles. Here you will see a list of the profiles on your phone, pick the one you are using (its normally General). You can turn off the warning and key pad tones in here.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            I've got my warning + keypad tones disabled but I still get the start-up jingle.<br />
<br />
So what I do is that I simply cover the top of my 6680 with my finger and hey presto, the sound is muted so at least it doesn't bother anybody else.

            Hi Karim:<br />
So you are listening for the big "N"! :-D<br />
<br />
I have already disabled the keypad when I first received the phone. Now I have disabled the Warning - so there is no beeping at confirmation. Thanks!<br />
<br />
It would be good if the "Company" can fix this start up tune problem for us!<br />
<br />
Thanks for explaining the S40 and S60. At this moment, it is not making any difference to my plights with the start up tune, the horrible builded in ring tones (hence I want to transfer the more pleasant ring tones from the 8230), and my question about the
 battery and signal indicators both showing 3 bars at the most.<br />
<br />
Over to you. <br />

            i dont think it will be possible to transfer ringtones from your old phone to your new one. i think other posts have mentioned that the phones that are built into the phone are there for good and cannot be transferred across.<br />
<br />
i have used nokia phones for quite a while now, i have had a 6100, 6230i, 6680 and now i have an n90. out of all these phones only the 6100 and 6230i allowed you to turn off the start up tone. i have never tried to do this on my 6680, and i just checked my
 n90 - i cant do it on that phone either. unless someone else knows differently, i dont think this can be done on a s60 phone?<br />
<br />
as for you question on the battery bars, whats the issue there? you prev posts dont seem to mention anything on this - or am i missing something?

<p>I have the same problem.. and i don't have more than 100 sms on my phone. I flashed it again with the last firmware without any changes. I think there is nothing to do, it's a bug because you can find a lot of people with the same problem on internet (here,
 maemo talk, search "delay messages"). Do you know if nokia will do an update for this bug? i hope so because messages and calls Must work, no excuses.</p>

Honestly this has got to be the stupidest thing ever! If you want to radically change the text messaging function, at least provide the option for users to choose how they want their text messages presented and stored. With the New Threaded Text Messaging,
 if you want to delete 1 message, you'll have to delete the whole bloody conversation!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No you dont have to delete the whole conversation, at least not in WM 6.1 Professional (Pocket PC).</p>
<p>All you have to do is select the message you want to delete and then go to "Menu - Delete".</p>

<h2>            In office 2010 &#47; Windows 7 I can&#39;t drag embedded objects such as excel or word objects to the file system.</h2>
                    <p>In Office 2007 on XP I could open a word document that had multiple embedded files (word, excel, acrobat) and drag those files from word directly to the file system.&nbsp; In Office 2010&nbsp; with Windows 7 I can't.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer some insight as to why that functionality isn't there.&nbsp; Would be great if it's just a setting I'm missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            This is a known issue you will not be able to drag objects from Office 2010 on Windows 7, this was working on Office 2003 with Windows XP.<br />
<br />
AFAIK there is no workaround, you have to open them manually and then save them....<br />

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3651751c-fb5c-4e08-80c2-e0b7ab155756" title="StephenFine">
<p>
</p><p>Yes, if you sign up with Skype using your Microsoft account, your friends can find you using your display name, email or your Skype ID (live:xxxx). The steps to find your Skype ID (live: xxxx) are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://secure.skype.com/ Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Sign in to the Skype website</span></a>.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down and click
<strong><span>Purchase history</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>The Skype Name of your account will be shown at the upper right side of the Purchase history page, before the Sign out button.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're contacts on Skype, you can start making and receiving calls with them. You
<strong><em>don't </em></strong>need a Skype Number to receive calls from your Skype contacts. You will only need a Skype Number if you intend to receive calls from phone numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>
