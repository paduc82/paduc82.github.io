<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker cuts out all sound in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I use it to edit videos captured with Fraps and Nvidia Shadowplay, but whenever I try to play the preview not only is there no sound, but all audio that my entire computer was playing cuts out, and I have to restart my computer to be able to hear audio
 from any source.

==================================<br />
There is a possibility that converting the clips <br />
to the WMV format using the following converter <br />
would improve the issue:<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail, some better than others...<br />
the following freeware&nbsp; is just one example that <br />
works well for me.<br />
<br />
Freemake can convert FRAPS video files<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8)<br />
(***Choose the Custom installation and carefully<br />
read *all* the install screens...there may be some<br />
items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
If a green Install button appears when you launch<br />
Freemake...you can ignore it and it should disappear<br />
when you import files.<br />
<br />
To download the full version instead of using the <br />
web installer...see the following:<br />
<br />
Freemake Apps - Offline version<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/</a><br />
(If you want to install Freemake freeware <br />
to your PC without the Internet connection, <br />
download these files)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
Good luck.....<br />

            <p>Hi Crometer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. In addition to the post of Volunteer J, I would like to ask some questions for isolation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue happen to videos captured using those softwares only?</li><li>What are the file types being used?</li><li>If you save the video and play it on a video player, does the issue still happen?</li><li>What is the version of your Movie Maker? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Movie Maker then click
<strong>About Movie Maker</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            It didn't happen when I used a .mov format, but I am not entirely sure if it happens all the time in the first place. &nbsp;The formats are .mkv and .mp4 respectively. &nbsp;If I save the video, not the project, and then use a player, it does not happen, and obviously
 a Movie Maker project file can only be opened in Movie Maker. &nbsp;I am using Build 16.4.3508.0205.

            I have been having this same problem. I downloaded and used MediaInfo as you suggested, and it said the audio codec was already installed. I am using WMM 12 with Windows 8.1. I haven't been able to find any audio files that play on WMM. Any suggestions?

            I guess this is blunt, but this is horsecrap. There is no solution? I bought this PC specifically to have an up to date tool for my video editing. I love the ease of use with Windows Media Maker and it works way better on my 6 year old all in one Dell
 that is way outdated. Never had any issues. I was in a major hurry tonight and didn't get what I needed finished after rebooting every time I get done with one video. I'm going to try some codec downloads but pretty aggravated and frustrated at this point.
 Time is money. <br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 secure boot disabled watermark. How to remove&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwbjnwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 secure boot disabled watermark. How to remove&#63;</h2>
                    I have an Asus Vivobook s200e, which I've upgraded to Windows 8.1 and I now have the "secure boot is not configured correctly" &nbsp;watermark.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I disabled secure boot so I am free to run anything &nbsp;such as Ubuntu which I've got installed alongside and enabled CSM so I can run OS's designed for bios, not UEFI such as Android 4.3 x86 which I have on a usb stick so I can use my laptop as an android
 tablet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's really good the way Microsoft went with secure boot, with the UEFI, as for the majority of people who only will use windows on the machine, it makes everything so much more secure, but then if there's no way to turn off this watermark without enabling
 secure boot, that is a bit silly because how can Microsoft expect you to use just windows? I like the freedom of choosing what operating systems I want to use, and I know a lot of people that have explored beyond windows also like that freedom.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just hope I can get rid of that watermark, as ok disabling secure boot opens the door to the possibility of getting root kits, but enabling it closes the door to Linux, and I have been using windows forever just like I'm sure a lot of us have, and I've
 never ever had a virus (other than ones that Avast picked up and got rid off before it even could do anything), let alone a root kit. So ok I do see this is a good thing having extra protection, but then you shouldn't be forced to use the exta protection like
 it seems windows 8.1 is trying it's hardest to do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other than this, I really love windows 8.1, especially the option to set the start background the same as your wallpaper which is extra nice if you have a slideshow</div>
                </div>

                    So i recently had problems with another BSOD and i found out it was because of DriverMax, it downloaded corrupt drivers or something like that so i uninstalled that and a whole bunch of drivers and reinstalled and that seemed to fix it. So a few days ago
 i was doing some stuff in the registry and other sketchy places that i don't know a lot about to see if i could make my disk usage go down and whatever i did seemed to work but now (and i don't know if this is just a coincidence) when i try to play my game
 which is on steam called "Rust" which uses EasyAntiCheat i get the BSOD. So please help me out guys:l

<h2>            Window 10 Pro, is taking about 24 hours from download to install to full deployment</h2>
                    <p>First time from MediaCreation64 bit; 24 hours to full deployment. Everything fine at first, besides start menu and task bar, glass colors (Transparency) did not work on other windows (cheese looking like Win95), then keyboard failed, only works at log on,
 followed by scanner failure and finally frozen with a PDF Adobe file, shut down twice, W10 did a startup repair, reverted to W7 Ultimate, my PC is in good health, waited for Notice, I figured maybe download from windows (App) update will be better rather than
 pushing with MediaCreation64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd time, got notice yesterday, started download around midnight, still at 17% ten hours later on the big wheel and 54% (installing features and drivers, configuring settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ASUS laptop only took few hours with W10 Home, no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, is it supposed to take this long, how Am I suppose to sit down and relax (that's what windows reads when it first starts to install) for 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions to this long install, is that what it really takes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>WLevy</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to debunk your theory, I rather wait my 24 hours than going to all these troubleshooting, in the long run, something&nbsp;will go absolutely wrong and loose all my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Installation fails or becomes non-responsive&nbsp;at certain point during setup 18%, 62%,75%</strong></p>
<p>Patience is a virtue, the system in not non-responsive, it still doing its thing, it is thinking&nbsp;just leave alone and it will install to its fullest capacity, yes it took 24 hours and a little bit more to full deployment, but it was worst all the wait, fortunately,
 I went to work, came back 8 hours later, it was at 75%, let it go overnight, when I woke up in the morning, it was finalizing the install.</p>
<p>This was after I stopped the install&nbsp;twice at 75% thinking it stalled, no I was wrong, I left it along and it finished.</p>
<p><strong>Why 24 hours on W10 Pro, I don't know, my laptop was W10 Home and installed in around 3 hours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, my computer has never been as fast as it is now, from start to full deployment in just few minuets, I wish I could say seconds, but edge on the other hand, is less than 10 seconds at first and anytime after that less than&nbsp;4
 &nbsp;seconds to full deployment, and browsing is fast.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Leave it alone, it will finish installing, believe me.</strong></p>

    <title>Skype account hacked by random Russian email. Skype support staff - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaley booth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype account hacked by random Russian email. Skype support staff tells me my only option is make a new account...</h2>
                    <p>I went to sign into my Skype account last week, and was told the password was wrong- weird, because I never changed it. Confused, I clicked to restore the password through email- and see that my recovery email has been changed too, to a random Russian email
 account! So, my account has been hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I filled out the account recovery form multiple times with ALL the info I have, from the same computer I've used Skype on for the past 4 years. I put in all the usernames I chat with, my original email and password, etc. I have the original emails saying
 my account information was changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the account to send or receive emails so that part of the form was N/A... and every time I'm denied access back to my own account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm frustrated. I see that this issue is very common, with many peoples Skypes being hacked, and Microsoft just shrugging it off and saying to make a new account. I don't want a new account- my information has been compromised and Microsoft is completely
 unhelpful. I've contacted Skype support and they simply tell me to fill out the form (which gets denied every time) again! I don't want some random hacker in Russia continuing to use my original account. Any help?</p>

            Ive been through the chat support 3 times, and no one has helped at all- just repeat the same useless information.&nbsp;I fill out the form with every possible bit of information I have yet im told i cant have my Skype account back every time! Ive even suggested
 i can send you a photo of me holding my ID with my name on it (the same name thats on the account,) I have receipts for Skype credits ive bought, i have the original email that says my recovery email was changed when i was first hacked, im using the same device
 that I have used Skype with for the past 4 years- and now theres a Russian IP suddenly linked to my account, but with all of this information I am still told theres not enough to recover my account. Ridiculous customer service, and since I see that there are
 TONS of people with this same hacked account issue, it seems Microsoft doesn't care about security at all.&nbsp;

            Exactly, Microsoft just shows complete indifference to a very obvious problem with their security. It definitely is ironic, they told me they couldn't do anything to get my account back, because "anyone can claim it is their account" and that they take
 security very seriously- I told them that they obviously didn't care about it that much since theyre allowing obvious hacking to occur and doing nothing about it. I don't even want to make another account at this point because of how they've dealt with this
 situation.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could be due to the display card driver not updated. Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system
 files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download
 the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

<h2>            NEW XBOX UPDATE &#40;DOUBLE TAP XBOX BUTTON GUIDE HOME&#41;</h2>
                    <p>OK I REALLY FIND IT UNNECCASSRY TO SWITCH FROM ONE BUTTON TAP TO GO TO HOME AND TWO BUTTON TAP TO OPEN GUIDE. EVEN IT WAS VICE VERSA, THE DOUBLE TAP IS A GOOD FEATURE THAT SHOULDNT BE REMOVED. ALSO I DO NOT LIKE THE MINI HOME SECTION INSIDE THE GUIDE. I PREFER TO GO TO THE HOME SECTION ON THE DASHBOARD. THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THE NEW UPDATE. I AM OK WITH HOW THE NEW GUIDE LOOKS, I AM OK WITH HOW THE NEW HOME SCREEN LOOKS, I AM NOT OK WITH THE MINI HOME SECTION IN THE GUIDE, I AM NOT OK WITH 1 TAP TO GUIDE 2 TAP DOES NOTHING. ALSO DISSAPOINTED THAT THE SNAP FEATURE IS BEING REMOVED BUT CANT DO MUCH ABOUT THAT.</p>

<h2>            Tracert always times out on Windows 8, Doesn&#39;t happen on Windows 7.</h2>
                    OK. I have this issue I have been trying to solve for a while now. I play online games, such as League of Legends, World of Warcraft and Starcraft II.&nbsp;
<div>Back a few months ago I had windows 7 on my PC, but decided to upgrade to Windows 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Windows 8, I get an excessive amount of lag, lag spikes and such while on general web surfing, or just playing videogames. I tried to repair drivers, make trace routes, log in on safe mode with network access and still cannot find the root of the problem.
 I'm about to just give up on those 40$ I spent upgrading to Windows 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have a similar problem? I'm running an ASUS G74sx laptop. Relatively new, a year ago came out. I'm sure every piece of hardware and software is compatible, because when I ran the upgrade manager, it told me everything was fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any clues as to where I can try to look to solve this problem? Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Windows 7 and above is required to run the latest desktop versions of Skype. Older classic versions of Skype (7.x and below) are no longer supported and have been retired. You will either not be able to connect or stay connected with such versions.

<p>My Antivirus can't find anything (TrendMicro), Malwarebytes claims I'm free of Malware, (it was the one that found the outgoing connections) I ran an anti rootkit check which also came up clean, I'm running low on ideas on what else to check, any help gratefully

            <p>Hello Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you are facing some issues with the Photos app also Windows Store is not working. Hence, we would like know if the computer is connected to any domain? Also, are you using any local account or Microsoft Account? And from when is the issue
 persisting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, as of now, the issue that you face could be due to some Windows app related files being missing or corrupt or maybe due to some internal corruptions. Make sure you have logged in to the PC using the Administrator Account. If the issue still persists
 then try to run the below App Troubleshooter and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app troubleshooter will try to diagnose and resolve any app related issues. Hence, please try to run the app troubleshooter and check if the issue persists. Please follow the below link to run the app troubleshooter.</p>

            Hi jokuroti,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
The Grub bootloader that Linux uses may be conflicting with the install program for Windows.<br />
<br />
I suggest formatting the partition you had Ubuntu installed on if your intent is to replace it.<br />
This should make the partition available to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
