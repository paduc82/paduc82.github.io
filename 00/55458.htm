            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Remove the battery with NO power applied. Then try to start the computer to see if that<br />
helps. Then remove the power again and replace the battery to see if it will start. If both</p>
<p>of those do not work then you need the help of HP' Support or a real computer&nbsp;shop<br />
(one that does its own in-shop service on HP laptops).<br />

    <title>how to disable weekly Family Activity Report email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fane grey  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to disable weekly Family Activity Report email</h2>
                    <p>Apparently there used to be a way of turning off the weekly family activity report email, but the existing instructions direct one to "edit settings" under the parent account, a link which doesn't exist. How does one manage these emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And on this contact form you must select a category, but there's no option for microsoft.com : why not? Why not have an "other" category rather than forcing people into preset bins, when obviously not everything is covered?</p>

            Hello Fane, thanks to contact the Microsoft Community. My name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />To disable the weekly activity report, go to the settings from the beginning.
<br />Then select the account on which you want to unhabit the weekly report.
<br />Go to Manage, and uncheck the option: Email weekly report to me
<br />
<br />Refreshing what he commented on the categories that are established, this is by design of the system unfortunately.

<h2>            Lots of Problems with Windows 7, 64 bit OS locking up</h2>
                    I just did a custom install upgrading to Windows 7, 64 bit from Windows Vista 32 bit.&nbsp; I have had nothing but problems since the install took place.&nbsp; My computer will maybe run for 10 minutes before it locks up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only common thing about the lockups
 is that it seems to occur when I switch Windows.&nbsp; I have done all that I know to get this thing working.&nbsp; I have gone to the manufactures site and got the proper drivers for my NVidea GeForce 6200 graphics card as well as my Brother MFC-685 all in one printer.&nbsp;
 I have scanned these posts and ran a memory scan as well as a system file scan through the command prompt, both turned up clean.&nbsp; I am also running Norton 350 Version 3.0 which, according to their site should be compatible.&nbsp; I have also installed Microsoft
 Office Home and Student 2007, but that should not cause a problem either.&nbsp; I have a Wireless Airlink 101 AWLH6070 card which may or may not be supported, but I have disabled that and I am still having problems.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I run the Event log, the main errors that I get is a printserver error telling me that I can't share my printer with itself (?) as well as the same message saying that I can't share my fax print with itself?&nbsp; My event log also brings up a DHCP Client error
 as well as brLog error.&nbsp; I assume the BrLog has something to do with my printer, but I have been unsuccesful in finding any information.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I am running an HP m8300f with 6 GB of RAM

            I am sort of confused now.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the source of my problem.&nbsp; I read all of the instructions and followed the instructions on the Windows website for a custom install.&nbsp; I backed up what I wanted to keep, I used that Windows Easy Transfer fully expecting
 to lose everything, but in the end nothing was really lost.&nbsp; All of my installed programs were lost and my drivers were changed, but no data on any drives was lost.&nbsp; I run windows from my c drive, but I also have an e drive and a d drive that was my recovery
 partition (I believe d is a partition on the same hard drive as c while&nbsp;e&nbsp;is a separate drive).&nbsp; Windows 7 simply took everything that was in the windows folder and put it in a windows.old folder.&nbsp; It did rename my D drive as my E and my E as my D, but data
 on both was maintained.&nbsp; I was then able to copy my files back out of my windows.old directory.&nbsp; Every folder on the C drive that was not in the Windows directory, was also unchanged.<br />
<br />
Winson,<br />
&nbsp;You mention a full reinstallation from scratch of Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I have purchased the upgrade version,&nbsp;do I not have to have Windows Vista on my system to use the upgrade?&nbsp; If I just reformat my c and e drives and then try to run the upgrade disk, will
 I not need to purchase the full version of Windows 7?&nbsp; Or does the upgrade have the full version on it as well?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Bluetooth to LG Soundbar not working</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 PC will no longer connect to my LG Soundbar via bluetooth. They pair okay, but the LG speaker does not show up in the list of available speaker output devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing the LG bluetooth device and then reconnecting to it, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>Other audio source devices, eg, ipod, connect, and work correctly with the LG soundbar via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has something changed in Windows that is now stopping this connection working? It stopped working about 3 months ago I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas</p>

            Hi Paul.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you'd asked when this first started we could have helped you isolate the Windows Update or Version update that caused it and hide or workaround it.  But unless you still have a System Restore point going back that far, or remember the date so you can check Installed Updates in Settings, we'll have to try another approach.
<br />
<br />Bluetooth Troubleshooting Steps:
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Sound Problems Troubleshooting Steps:
<br />
<br />Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I have the exact same problem, it thinks it is 'unplugged' so you are unable to enable it as the default playback device. There are no updated LG drivers available, I have been working to resolve this issue for 2 days now and have just given up until a
 windows update solves the issue (maybe).

<p>I am having the EXACT same issue. My LG Sound Bar used to work just fine with my Dell laptop although I am uncertain when this fallout has occurred as I use the LG Sound Bar only infrequently with my Dell laptop, but I would like the option for future uses.</p>
<p>Now, it says "Paired" on both speaker and Windows 10 and yet sound doesn't come from it, still laptop speakers. I have disabled MS Enumerator and LE Enumerator as other troubleshooting forums have suggested (since been re-enabled as they didn't help). I
 have uninstalled Bluetooth driver and rebooted for a fresh install of native driver. I even had high hopes when I went to Dell and obtained Bluetooth driver dated 11/06/2018. And yet, under "Sound" properties, and under the "Playback" tab, my "LG SOUND BAR"
 is listed and yet shows "disconnected" with NO OPTION to attempt to connect it. I tried using the "Sound Troubleshooter" and it says the device looks to be unplugged, which obviously is untrue as it shows "paired" on the speaker, and "connected" under Bluetooth
 properties Windows 10</p>

<p>Sorry I still haven't found a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>

    <title>Volume change is incredibly slow and when sound is accessed, causes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctorcitrus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume change is incredibly slow and when sound is accessed, causes the entire computer to slow down</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've had an MSi Apache Pro laptop for about a year and a half now. Just recently (within the last few weeks) I've noticed that the sound would have a very bad response time whenever I started to change the sound - It would change, but very very slowly
 any way I tried changing it, either through the hotkeys on the keyboard, the volume slider, or even via the control panel. What was also strange was that when I play games, when a large amount of separate sounds are being played within the game, it begins
 to stutter and run very slowly when this happens. I've also noticed that audio commands are run so slowly that when I manually mute the sound, it only mutes one speaker at a time and there is a clear delay between the two speakers muting/unmuting.<br />
<br />
When I first noticed this, I tried troubleshooting the problem, but to no avail. I figured it was most likely an obscure software/driver issue, so I did a System Restore to a couple of weeks before the problem came up. It fixed the issue; my sound changed perfectly
 smoothly and I had no more stutter in my games. However, that fix only lasted a few days. It's back to stuttering and having an overall lagging effect on pretty much anything I do on my computer, whether it be playing video games or just simply browsing the
 internet - it effects the performance of any program that has anything to do with sound.<br />
<br />
My question is, is there any way to track down this issue and fix it? I don't want to have to do a system restore every time this issue crops up again.<br />
<br />
Here are my specs, via dxdiag:<br />
System:<br />
Operating System: Windows 10 Home<br />
System Model: GE60 2PE</p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz (8CPUs)<br />

DirectX Version: 12<br />
Display: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600<br />
Render: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M<br />
Sound: Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you follow the below steps to uninstall the sound driver.</p>
<div>
<p>1.&nbsp;Right click on Start button and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Expand<strong> Sound, video and game controllers </strong>from the window. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Right click on the <strong>Realtek High Definition Audio driver </strong>and select<strong> Properties</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click on<strong> Driver tab </strong>and click on <strong>uninstall.</strong><br />
5.&nbsp;Restart the computer, the drivers will get automatically installed on your Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>If the issue persists then, I would recommend you to download and install the latest sound drivers in compatibility mode for the manufacturer’s website and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the result.</p>
<p>

<p>I have an r7500 and don't see this issue. What firmware version is the router running? Did you install the Netgear Genie software on your SP3? Uninstall it. Do you have hyper-v enabled?</p>

<p>Where did you buy your SP3, Europe or North America? What channels are available on the r7500 in Europe on the r7500?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Barb, I bought the SP3 in UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The R7500 has the following channels. 36,40,44,48, 52 (DFS), 56 (DFS), 60 (DFS),&nbsp;64 (DFS), 100 (DFS), 104(DFS), 108(DFS) and 112 (DFS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the non- DFS channels and no joy.&nbsp; I tried 60, still no good, I since tried 108 and it has been reliable since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may try some other channels, and the AC-87 which I haven't unboxed yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read up a bit and understand the higher channels operate on higher power, so this might affect things, despite them all showing a full 5 bar signal on the SP3 all through the property.</p>

            <p>Hi, yes I do have an update.&nbsp; I have been using the device every evening since 31st and it was great on channel 108, until this evening when it would not remain on the 5GHz network for more than a few minutes at a time without going into limited mode.&nbsp; I
 have changed the channel to 112 and will see how that goes for tonight.&nbsp; I will update tomorrow and will try the AC-87 router over the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do think there is room for more work to be done on this and further firmware update to get it sorted.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just thought I would post that I am experiencing the similar issues with a D6300 router. I can connect to 5Ghz however when recovering from sleep I have no connectivity. At first I thought it was a DHCP lease issue so I assigned a static address and tested
 again and still with the static address I couldn't ping the gateway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.4Ghz has no issues from what I can tell. I'm running channel 44.</p>

            Hello ErnieDe,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Press Fn + radio tower symbol key and see if that helps to turn off Airplane mode. 
<br />
<br />You can also try Network Reset:
<br />
<br />1. Open Settings app, click Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status &gt; Network reset link.
<br />
<br />2. Now click on Reset button on next screen. 
<br />
<br />3. In confirmation prompt appearing next, click Yes.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't works, try registry method mentioned here:

            Hi ErnieDe, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Let us try with the following suggestions:
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Windows key (Windows Button), and then press the r key.
<br />In the Run box, type devmgmt.msc, and then press Enter.
<br />Note: The User Account Control window may appear, if so touch or click Yes.
<br />Touch or click the arrow to the left of Human Interface Devices.
<br />Touch and hold or right-click Airplane Mode Switch Collection, and then select Disable.
<br />Note: When Airplane Mode Switch Collection is not listed, download the latest version from the Dell Support site (the driver is in the Network category). For more information, refer to Dell Knowledge Base article How do I download and install a device driver?.
<br />Touch and hold or right-click Airplane Mode Switch Collection, and then select Enable.
<br />Touch or click the arrow to the left of Network adapters.
<br />Touch and hold or right-click your wireless network adapter (the description should include the word wireless), and then select Properties.
<br />Touch or click the Select Power Management tab, and uncheck the box next to Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.
<br />Touch or click OK to save the changes.
<br />Restart the computer and check if Airplane mode can be turned off.
<br />Notes:
<br />Turning off Airplane Mode does not automatically turn on Wi-Fi. When the panel labeled Wi-Fi is still gray, touch or click the Wi-Fi panel (the panel should turn from gray to blue and should look like Figure 1).
<br />When Airplane mode still cannot be turned off after restarting the computer, proceed to Step 11.
<br />What the Network Icons Should Look Like
<br />Figure 1: Wireless Icons Example Settings
<br />Run the Network Troubleshooter.
<br />In the search box type, troubleshooter
<br />Touch or click Troubleshooting (Control panel).
<br />Touch or click Network and Internet.
<br />Touch or click Network Adapter.
<br />Touch or click Next and follow the prompts.
<br />Make sure the BIOS is updated to the latest version. For more information, refer to Dell Knowledge base article What is BIOS and How to Download and Install the latest BIOS?
<br />Make sure the most current wireless drivers are installed. For more information, refer to Dell Knowledge Base article How to Download and Install the Latest Dell Wireless Network Adapter Driver.
<br />Note: When the affected device has no Wireless connectivity to download a driver or BIOS, you will need to do one of the following to get the driver on the affected device:
<br />
<br />Connect the affected device to your router using a network cable (when that is an option).
<br />
<br />Use another device that does have Internet connectivity to download the driver and use a USB Flash drive to transfer the driver to the affected device.
<br />
<br />When neither of these options are available, perform the following steps (this process may remove your wireless profile, when it does, you will need to recreate the wireless profile that connects the computer to your wireless network. For more information refer to Dell Knowledge Base article Getting Started and Connecting to a Wireless Network).
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Windows key (Windows Button), and then press the r key.
<br />In the Run box, type devmgmt.msc, and then press Enter, (the User Account window may appear, if so, touch or click YES).
<br />Touch or click the arrow to the left of Network adapters.
<br />Touch and hold or right-click your wireless network adapter (the description should include the word wireless), and then select Uninstall (do not check the box next to Delete the driver software for this device).
<br />Touch or click OK.
<br />Save any data, close any open program(s) and restart the computer (during the booting process the driver for the wireless adapter will be automatically installed).

            Hi ErnieDe,
<br />
<br />I'm an INDEPENDENT ADVISOR
<br />
<br />If the airplane mode is resisting you, try to right click on the airplane icon and then click on Solve problems. This opens a Windows troubleshooting assistant that will try to solve the problem.
<br />
<br />The problem diagnostician will look for connectivity problems and ask you if you want to apply the solutions you propose. Click Apply this revision every time you propose something to try to disable airplane mode.
<br />
<br />Let me know

            Here are few things you may want to try if you face issues. Before you begin, make sure that if your device has a physical Wi-Fi On/Off button or switch, it is set to the On position.
<br />
<br />A] Try pressing the Fn+Radio Tower key. it’s between the F12 and the PrtScr key.
<br />
<br />B] Maybe something is interfering with its functioning. Restart Windows 10. Do not log in. At the login screen, you will see a Wi-Fi icon in the lower right side of your screen. Click on it and see if you can turn on/off Airplane Mode.
<br />
<br />C] Unplug everything, including the cables, power cord, USB, etc. Remove the Battery. Power down the device. Wait for a minute. Put the battery back, power it on and see it has helped.
<br />
<br />D] Open Device Manager. Under Network adapters, see if any WAN Mininiport has a yellow mark against it. If so uninstall and reinstall it again.
<br />
<br />E] Type regedit in Taskbar search. Right click on the result and select Run as administrator. Navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class
<br />
<br />Right click on Class and press Find. Search for RadioEnable. Make sure its value is 1. If not, change its value to 1. If RadioEnable does not exist it, create it.

<p>Someone else told me to set Radioenable to 0. <span>I did try all the recommendations that were given before going to the geek.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, long story short, took it to the geek squad at best buy and initially they could not fix it. They wanted too much to keep my laptop and research and repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came home, literally played with it in "admin" and then "myself". Don't know how I fixed it, the last step was clicking on to "open normal" and restart. Not sure if that did it. Airplane if now off for the time being. I never use it but don't know if I could
 delete it entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks to all in the community for reaching out and helping!&nbsp;</p>

<span>Method 1: Updating the driver software from the Device Manager</span>
<ol>
<li>
Right-click on the&nbsp;<span>Start Menu&nbsp;</span>button or press the&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.withlovenregards.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">W</a>indows
 Logo&nbsp;</span>key +&nbsp;<span>X&nbsp;</span>to open the&nbsp;<span>WinX Menu</span>, and
 click on&nbsp;<span>Device Manager</span>.</li><li>
In the&nbsp;<span>Device Manager</span>, double-click on the&nbsp;<span>Network adapters&nbsp;</span>section
 to expand it.</li><li>
Right-click on the very first adapter listed under the&nbsp;<span>Network adapters&nbsp;</span>section, click on&nbsp;<span>Update
 Driver Software…</span>, click on&nbsp;<span>Search automatically for updated driver software</span>, and wait for Windows to conduct the search. If Windows finds new drivers
 for the network adapter, they will be automatically downloaded and installed.</li><li>
If there is more than one network adapter listed under the&nbsp;<span>Network adapters&nbsp;</span>section, repeat the previous step for every single one of the listed adapters.</li><li>
Once done,&nbsp;<span>restart&nbsp;</span>your computer and check to see if the problem persists when it boots up.</li></ol>
<span>Method 2: Getting updated driver software from the manufacturer’s website</span>
<p style="color: rgba(44, 47, 52, 1)">
If Windows was unable to find updated driver software for your computer’s network adapter (or if you simply prefer getting the job done manually, for some reason), the same result can be achieved by downloading updated driver software for the network adapter
 from the manufacturer’s website and then installing it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Make your way to the&nbsp;<span>Downloads&nbsp;</span>section of the official website of either the manufacturer of the affected computer or the manufacturer of the affected computer’s
 network adapter – the driver software should be available on both of their websites.</li><li>
Search for driver software for the affected computer’s network adapter and Operating System combo, and check to see if a version of the driver software that is newer than the one the computer already has is available.</li><li>
If a newer version of the driver software is available, simply download the installation package for it.</li><li>
Once the installation package has been downloaded, navigate to where it has been downloaded to, launch it and go through the installation process to install the newer drivers for your network card.</li><li>
Once the newer drivers have been successfully installed, remove the Ethernet connection from the affected computer,&nbsp;<span>restart&nbsp;</span>it and check to see whether
 or not the issue has been resolved when it boots up.</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(44, 47, 52, 1)">
If, for some reason, the affected computer can’t connect to the internet even through an Ethernet connection, fear not as there is still hope. Simply get yourself on a different computer with a working internet connection and repeat&nbsp;<span>steps
 1</span>–<span>3&nbsp;</span>from&nbsp;<span>Method 2</span>. Once the installation
 package has been downloaded, navigate to where you saved it, move it onto a USB or another portable storage medium, connect the storage medium to the affected computer, move the installation package to the affected computer, launch the installation package
 and go through the installation process to install the updated driver software. When the updated driver software has been successfully installed on the affected computer,&nbsp;<span>restart&nbsp;</span>it
 and check to see whether or not the problem has been fixed when it boots up.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(44, 47, 52, 1)">
In the event that you cannot update the drivers for the affected computer’s network adapter, no new drivers for the network adapter are available or updating the drivers doesn’t resolve the problem, there is one more solution you can try that many users affected
 by this issue have found to be highly effective – starting the Radio Management Service. In order to start the Radio Management Service and make sure that it starts up automatically every time you log in to your computer, you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the&nbsp;<span>Windows Logo&nbsp;</span>key +&nbsp;<span>R</span>&nbsp;to open a&nbsp;<span>Run</span></li><li>
Type&nbsp;<span>msc&nbsp;</span>into the&nbsp;<span>Run&nbsp;</span>dialog and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>
In the&nbsp;<span>Services Manager</span>, scroll down and locate a service named&nbsp;<span>Radio
 Management</span>.</li><li>
Double-click on the&nbsp;<span>Radio Management&nbsp;</span>service once you locate it.</li><li>
Open the dropdown menu in front of&nbsp;<span>Startup type&nbsp;</span>and click on&nbsp;<span>Automatic&nbsp;</span>to
 select it.</li><li>
If the&nbsp;<span>Radio Management&nbsp;</span>service is currently stopped (which is probably is), click on&nbsp;<span>Start</span>.</li><li>
Click on&nbsp;<span>Apply</span>, and then on&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</li><li>
Close the&nbsp;<span>Services Manager</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>restart&nbsp;</span>the computer.
 When the computer boots up, check to see whether or not Airplane Mode has been successfully disengaged.</li></ol>

No that is not possible. Use of a sufficiently long and complex encryption key/password/passphrase is your only security.</p>

<h2>            Strange Dead zone on the upper left-hand corner of my desktop</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe82fb67-47de-46e8-9559-7333f2234f3b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe82fb67-47de-46e8-9559-7333f2234f3b" /></a></p>
<p>I have this strange dead zone on the upper left-hand corner of my desktop. I believe it covers the Recycling Bin icon but, as you can see, it's not perfectly sized to cover just that icon; it covers up some of the text in "My Computer." Also, removing the
 Recycling Bin Icon through Settings-&gt;Personalization-&gt;Themes-&gt;Desktop Icon Settings does not change anything. It is always present when my computer boots. I can hover the mouse over it, but left-clicking does nothing and right-clicking does not bring up an
 options menu. When I try to drag something into it, the cursor turns into a black circle with a slash through it. The dead zone is only present on the desktop. Other applications load over it just fine, and that area of the screen is clickable within them.
 In looking up support for this, I found a suggestion to try alt-tab to see if there are any strange windows running, but I did not find anything of the sort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an image of all the information in "About my PC"&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4c44966-2dac-41a5-8689-1305699e5a56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4c44966-2dac-41a5-8689-1305699e5a56" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I realize the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Since when are you facing this issue?</li><li>Did you make any changes in prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>This issue occurs due to the corrupt user account profile or due to the conflict between any third party applications or due to some corrupt Windows system files on your system.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to follow these methods below and check, if it helps.&nbsp; </div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check, if it helps.<br />
System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption .The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or
 damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please click on the below link and follow the procedure to run SFC Scan.&nbsp;<br />
Click on, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Disclaimer: Do not close the Command Prompt Window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists, follow method 2.<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>Please follow these steps below to resolve the issue.<br />
I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check, if the issue occurs. If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, I suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check, if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to refer the article and check, if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode).</strong></div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, perform a clean boot and check. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows. </strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If the issue still persists, follow method 3.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong>I suggest you to create a new user account profile and check, if it works.<br />
<strong>Create a local user account in Windows 10:</strong><br />

            <p><span>Hello Chamila,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you need assistance for checking Intel HD Graphic 4000 compatibility with Windows 10. I will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the
 issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. How did you check the Intel HD Graphic 4000 compatibility with Windows 10?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices, so your device is most likely compatible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the <strong>Get Windows 10 app</strong> to do a compatibility check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get Windows 10 is an app that’s designed to make the upgrade process easy. It checks to make sure your device is compatible, and it reserves your free upgrade; it also has information to help you learn about the features in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For devices running Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update with Windows Update enabled, the app shows up automatically as a Windows icon in your system tray at the bottom right-hand side of your screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the <strong>menu</strong> in the upper left of the app, and select “<strong>Check your PC” or “Your PC is good to go</strong>.” This displays any compatibility issues we find and recommends a resolution; while we don’t have info on every app
 or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information, please refer to the below Microsoft articles:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade?OCID=win10_null_vanity_win10upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Upgrade to Windows 10 for free</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows 10 Q&amp;A</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also like suggest you that if the compatibility report shows that Intel HD Graphic 4000 is not compatible with Windows 10, then you may install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the following Microsoft Help Article below to make older programs compatible with this version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the above article refer to the section install the drivers in <strong>
Compatibility mode </strong>(holds good for Windows 10).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I missed a step in the fix above (now corrected). After installing the Windows Update, customers may need to re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser. This will happen automatically within a day or it can be run manually from an&nbsp;admin command prompt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've replied to a few of the other threads as well.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>I know you've replied. But after running the above from admin cmd, the intel 965 video is still reported as a no go. The fix works for **** but not the 965. the 965 is DirectX 11 compatible</p>
