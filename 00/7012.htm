            That sounds like your document is set to print two sided flipped on the short side.

            It seems to print differently on different printers: on the canon it prints fine; on the HP it prints every other page upside down. The printer settings are the same for both, yet they print the doc differently.<br />

    <title>Parameter Query with Combo Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mallorz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parameter Query with Combo Box</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have made a parameter query to search for a certain product upon opening. Under the Criteria parameter, I have written: [Product:] &amp; "*" which currently allows the user to type in a product. Instead, I would like to have them select an option from a combo
 box. I see in the&nbsp; Properties window there is a Lookup tab, and within that a Display Control option with various displays (text box, list box, combo box). When I choose combo box, nothing happens. I also don't see anywhere that I can input values for the
 combo box under the Product field.<br />
<br />
Could someone direct me?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            I am very confused by your post. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Are you building a query or what? &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Where did you put &nbsp;<b>[Product:] &amp; "*"</b> &nbsp;?</div>
<div><br />
<div>What do you mean by <b>"I would like to have them select an option from a combo box."</b>? &nbsp;A query does not contain a combo but can refer to a combo in a form.</div>

            A parameter query "displays a dialog box that promps the user to enter one or more criteria values when the query is ran."<br />
<br />
To begin, I made a simple query. Under the 'Product' field, I set the <i>Criteria
</i>parameter to be <b>[Product:] % "*" </b>. What this does is each time to open or run the query, a message box is displayed that says 'Product:' and contains a text box that allows the user to type in. The query then displays whatever fields match the user
 input.<br />
<br />
I would like to do something very similar, only I do not want the user to type in input; I want them to select a search option from a given list. This is to prevent them from getting blank results.<br />
<br />
Make sense? Is that possible?<br />
<br />
I think the reason this field has a 'Lookup' tab is because it is a look-up field. When populating it with data you must choose a category from a given selection. What I am trying to do here is make that message box that pops up upon opening have the same given
 selections to search.<br />
<br />
When this is done, I will create a form off it.<br />

            <p>There are two types of parameter: a prompt such as you used, and - much more useful! - a form reference.</p>
<p>Create a little unbound form named, say, frmCrit. Put a combo box on it named (say) cboProduct. Put a command button on the form to launch a Report or a Form displaying the data that you want to see.</p>
<p>The criterion would be</p>
<p>=[Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct]</p>
<p>Do not use the asterisk - it's usable only as a wildcard in a LIKE query, which is not appropriate for a numeric (concealed) Lookup Field ID number.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm</a> for a critique of the Lookup Field datatype, which a lot of us consider a "misfeature".</p>

            That's it. I'm not sure where that criteria goes though.<br />
<br />
I made a combo box and filled it with selections and also created a Filter button. Is there any other way to link them besides what you said? I ask because I am still learning, so I would prefer not to use any advanced methods. Think beginner! Also, is there
 a way to do all this with in one single form? <br />
<br />

            I created by button as a 'filter by selection'<br />
<br />
When I click on event -- on click, the macro is this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RunMenuCommand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Command&nbsp; ApplyFilterSort<br />

I deleted that and tried this:<br />
<br />
ApplyFilter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Filter Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Condition = [Forms]![frmTest]![cboProducts]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Name<br />
<br />
<br />
Which also didn't work. I'll play around a bit but it someone could spare me some time I'd appreciate it.<br />

Yes, you would put the combo in the form header and the criteria would be in the query as John said --
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=[Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct] &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp;the combo would use an event such as On Change to Refresh the form.</div>

            <p>You can indeed filter a form using a combo box on the same form, and you don't even need a button.</p>
<p>Instead, use some VBA code in the AfterUpdate event of the combo box. (If that's what you call "advanced methods", well, you're doing an advanced task!). Let's say the combo box is named cboFilter (it doesn't matter in this case what the form is named).
 Open the form in design view; select the combo box; view its Properties; and click the ... icon next to the line that says "After Update" on the Events tab. Choose "Code Builder". Access will give you the Sub and End Sub lines for free - edit the code to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub cboFilter_AfterUpdate()<br />
If IsNull(Me!cboFilter) Then<br />
&nbsp; Me.Filter = ""&nbsp; ' Clear the filter if the user clears the combo<br />
&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = False <br />
Else<br />
&nbsp; Me.Filter = "[ProductID] = " &amp; Me!cboFilter<br />
&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>This assumes that the relevant fieldname is ProductID, and the combo box has the same product ID as its bound column.</p>

            I understand what you were saying before now with the criteria going in the query. Missed that part before. I think I will continue with that method and see what I can come up with. If all else fails, Google, right?<br />

            You might like to take a look at the fileComboDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This little demo file is intended to illustrate the use of correlated combo boxes, i.e. where a selection in one limits the items listed in another, and includes an option to open a form for 'drilling down' through hierarchies.&nbsp; This form has three combo boxes,
 via which the rows returned in the form can be restricted progressively.&nbsp; It does this by means of parameters in the form's query which reference the combo boxes.<br />
<br />
In your case, as you wish to use only a single combo box the query would be much simpler, but in principle the same, e.g.<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM [YourTable]<br />
WHERE (ProductID =[Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct]<br />
OR [Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct] IS NULL);<br />
<br />
The important thing to note here is that the expression in the WHERE clause tests not only for the ProductID value being equal to the value of the combo box, but also for the combo box being Null.&nbsp; This means if nothing is selected all rows will be returned,
 if a selection is made only rows which match the selection will be made.<br />
<br />
In query design view you'd enter:<br />
<br />
[Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct] OR [Forms]![frmCrit]![cboProduct] IS NULL<br />
<br />
in the criteria row of the ProductID column.&nbsp; The cboProduct combo box in the form would be set up along these lines:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT ProductID, Product FROM Products ORDER BY Product;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the last one.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; In the combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure requery the form with:<br />
<br />
Me.Requery<br />
<br />

            Alright, last question on this. I have it working where you have to type in at least the first word of a product and may just leave it at that. But, for the sake of knowing and trying, I watched a YouTube video and tried to give something else a go.<br />
<br />
Here is what I've done ...<br />
<br />
I created a new form, no longer connected to a 'parameter query'. I've added a Combo Box (cboFilter) and assigned the following on it's 'On Change' parameter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SetFilter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filter Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Condition = [Product] = [cboFilter]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Name<br />
<br />
The outcome if this semi-works. When I go into Form View, and select an item given from the Combo Box a window pops ups. It reads "Enter Parameter Value" across the title bar and contains the text cboFilter with a textbox below. If you type in the exact selection
 as you chose from the combo box, it filters correctly and shows you all results. If you leave it blank or choose cancel, it returns nothing.<br />
<br />
Whats up with this box? My intention was where the product equals the selected filter, display. I just don't understand why you have to type it in again exactly after selecting it.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How can I disable the request to &#34;insert smart card&#34; in Microsoft Word&#63;</h2>
                    How can I disable the request to "insert smart card" in Microsoft Word?&nbsp; This request from MS Word has just started happening within the last month.<br />
When I start MS Word, or try to open documents, I am requested to "insert smart card".&nbsp; I can cancel this request, but then have to accept the document as "trusted", even though some of these are doc's I created, and I'm even asked to 'trust' a blank, new doc.
<br />
One significant example of how inconvenient this is comes when using our PDF writer.&nbsp; When I am using Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro to created a combined PDF file from multiple MS Word doc's, I have to babysit the computer, hitting cancel and accept the document as trusted
 before each Word file can be opened, printed and closed.<br />
This just started happening a month ago, though I've had this Dell E6400 laptop with Windows 7 for 16 months. No one else in my office of 55 people is having this problem, though several are using the same type of laptop.<br />

            <p>Another possibility is 3rd party vendor software:</p>
<p>If found an issue where folks that have IBM's Rational Doors 9.3 have this issue after they install IBM's software. What clued me in was this article:

It should be titled, "These aren't the droids you're looking for." I found that the IBM's, door.dot, template gets placed inside

<h2>            ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs gives Runtime error &#39;1004&#39; - the file could not be accessed - Excel 2016, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem with macro, step where one big Excel file produces a small file and tries to use this line:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:=path&amp; "\Bruts\Param_" &amp; study&amp; "_" &amp; injection &amp; ".xls", FileFormat:=xlExcel8</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears <strong>ONLY </strong>on my computer, when I <strong>work locally (on my hard drive)
</strong>and <strong>not when I work on server</strong>. We have already checked the references, security, macro enabled and we ran out of options. I'm logged in as an administrator, the drive doesn't have any special attributes. I'm clueless.
Does any of you have an idea, or faces the same problem, how I can fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p />

<p>It will be necessary for you to test as follows and try to find the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the&nbsp;VBA editor, use Ctrl and G to open the Immediate window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run your code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the code stops on the problem line of code, Click Debug and leave the error line highlighted. (Don't end)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the following part of the line. (Ensure it is only the part as follows from path to the double quotes following .xls</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>path &amp; "\Bruts\Param_" &amp; study &amp; "_" &amp; injection &amp; ".xls"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Immediate window enter a question mark and then paste the copied part of the code immediately after the question mark and press Enter.&nbsp; Like the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>? path &amp; "\Bruts\Param_" &amp; study &amp; "_" &amp; injection &amp; ".xls"</p>
<p>
</p><p>End the VBA routine (Click the square reset button on the toolbar of the VBA editor)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Change back to the worksheet</li><li>Turn on the VBA code recorder. (Record in the same workbook that is being saved)</li><li>Use SaveAs to save the workbook. (You will need to select the correct folder and enter the correct file name in the SaveAs dialog box and select the file Type.)</li><li>Close or stop the code recorder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>See if the recorded code for the path and filename is the same as the result when you used the Question mark etc to display the path and filename in the Immediate window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;also&nbsp;try the following and&nbsp;compare the results. Again in the Immediate window, enter a question mark followed by ThisWorkbook.FullName as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>? ThisWorkbook.FullName</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above line should return the entire path and workbook file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The variable path might be hard coded with a path that is not accessible from your computer.</p>

<h2>            Re-installed Outlook and need to connect to existing data files</h2>
                    <p>Because of a Windows 10 corruption I had to re-install Office on my C: drive. I have two email addresses and the data files for those are stored in a folder on the D: drive at D:Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal email points to Outlook-Email.pst, the personal files are at Mailbox-pers.pst, and then there is my business email CCFNCA.pst.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to continue to use POP3 if that makes a difference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have two questions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm temporarily using Office 2007. How do I point the two email accounts to their proper files on the D: drive.</p>
<p>2. I'll soon be using Office 2016. I'm planning to uninstall 2007, install 2016, re-create the email accounts and re-point to the proper data files. I am aware that 2016 will install over 2007, but I want to completely get rid of 2007 remnants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest an approach?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>1) Is the D:\ drive an internal? - using a usb connected drive for connected pst data files is not recommended. If so and the mail accounts are pop mail accounts, Control Panel&gt;Mail Applet&gt;Data files...... remove the currently used data files, when you restart
 Outlook it will give an error msg relation to missing data files, you will then have the option to browse to and select the data file.</p>
<p>2) Installing 2016 does not upgrade or 'overwrite' 2007 you would need to uninstall 2007</p>

<h3> hanvroon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2013 x64 won&#39;t play a mp4 video</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a group of Windows server 2008 R2 desktop servers with Xenapp 7.6.<br />
Office 2013 x64 is installed, a choice made half a year ago to solve a lot of Excel issues.<br />
Of cource, a lot of other software is installed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now someone wants to play a Powerpoint presentation with an embedded MP4 video.<br />
According to VLC it is a H264, MPEG-4 AVC file, 1280x720, framerate 25.</p>
<p>I know about the missing 64-bit codec issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just wondering:<br />
I extracted the video from the pptx file by opening it with an unzipper.<br />
I see two times Windows media player installed, under Program Files and Program Files (x86).<br />
If I start C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe, I can see in the taskmanager that wmplayer is 64-bit (not *32 behind the process name). I can play the video.<br />
So I assume that a 64 bit codex is present, otherwise the video wouldn't play. Is that assumption right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still in PP I get the message "Cannot play media".</p>
<p>In attempts to get to a working situation from scratch I started with a fresh 2008 R2 server, installed Office 2013 x64 and at first got a different message while playing the video in PP: Codec not available.<br />
That was before anything was installed. I then got it working by installing a standard k_lite codec pack.</p>
<p>Installing the k-lite codec pack on a copy of those production desktops didn't work. I get the idea that "Cannot play media" doesn't have anything to do with a missing codec, but something else...<br />
Does anyone have an idea?</p>
<p><br />

            Isn't that the holy grail for us video lovers! ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've collected some information here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://portablevideo.blogspot.com/2008/03/how-to-become-better-video-editor_11.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portablevideo.blogspot.com/2008/03/how-to-become-better-video-editor_11.html</a><br />
<br />
And here:<br />

<br />
Truth is this information is not forthcoming from Nokia.<br />
<br />
So far I've only confirmed bits and pieces. H264 is only Baseline Profile that is supported. Main and Extended are not supported in any device. Sorenson or Spark is also not supported.

            Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
Is the lack of support for Main &amp; Extended profiles a strategy of Nokia's? Also, you would think that with a different OS in the tablet devices, N810 for example, that there might be hope to support a wider variety of encoding schemes.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Maybe in the future. I don't think it's a strategy, but more of a delay.<br />
<br />
maybe Nokia is waiting and hoping that one codec will start to dominate (like FLV for example). And then focus their efforts in the dominating codec.<br />
<br />
Right now there are just too many codecs and options for any device to support all.

    <title>Language setting in text boxes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> betalogue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language setting in text boxes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Take a Word document containing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) some text in the body</p>
<p>2) some text inside table cells</p>
<p>3) some text inside text boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use "Select All" to select entire document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Tools &gt; Languages and change the language setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: language setting change has been applied to the text in the body of the&nbsp;document and inside the table cells, but not to the text inside text boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to manually change the language of the text in the text boxes is to enter each and every text box, do "Select All" inside the box, and change the language. Tedious. (One could use styles, but when one has to work with EXISTING documents whose
 original author did NOT use styles, that's not really a solution either.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the logic here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The same, of course, applies to other text formatting options, such as bold, italics, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But surely language is a special case. It's not even in the "Format" menu. It's in the Tools menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's quite obvious, when I do "Select All" and I chose to change the language, that I want to change the language of the entire document, include the text boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the idea is to treat text inside text boxes separately, why not the same for text inside tables?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word's behaviour doesn't make much sense here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>

            <p>You can solve your issue with a macro that performs a search and replace in every part of the document. Here is a link with an explanation and sample VBA code. The sample searches and replaces text, but you can revise this to search for the LanguageID property
 and replace it with your preferred Language ID:</p>

<p>I'm ready to throw my MSFT phone (HTC Imagio) out and buy a Droid and "go" Google.&nbsp; I particularly wanted to have my Outlook Calendar available on my phone and although I know I can't access Hotmail's calendar, felt secure that I would have my Outlook Calendar
 available via Window's Office Mobile.</p>
<p>Unless I'm doing something wrong (a distinct possibility), I just can't find the answer.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to access my Outlook Calenda?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have installed Outlook to your computer, then you can sync the Outlook-related data to your windows mobile phone via<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/activesync-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Activesync</a> (for an XP computer)
 or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Mobile Device Center</a> (for a Vista or Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>Have you installed Outlook to your computer?</p>
<p>Have you installed Windows Mobile Device Center to your computer (assuming you have a Vista or Windows 7 computer)?</p>
<p>If you've got both Outlook and the appropriate syncing software (Activesync or WMDC) installed on your computer, then all you need to do is connect the windows phone to your computer. Your computer should recognize the phone as a new device, the syncing
 software will then open up and prompt you through setting up a partnership between your computer and your phone.&nbsp; It is at this time, you can select the specific items you want to sync.</p>

<p>Thank you Prof Julie -</p>
<p>Outlook 2010 is installed on my computer as is the Windows Mobile Device Center.&nbsp; I have been synching since purchasing my phone but if the calendar is coming over, it's hidden somewhere as I only items I can access are the Tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just checked again and Calendar is clearly checked in the Mobile Device Center to be included in any synch.</p>
<p>Any further thoughts will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Can you try this?</p>
<p>Delete your existing partnership between your computer and phone</p>
<p>Then set the partnerhip up again.&nbsp; This time only select Calendar as the data type you want to sync.&nbsp; Let the device sync and then check to see if the calendar items get synced over to your phone.&nbsp; Also pay attention to any messages you see on your computer
 while the sync is occurring.</p>

<p>Are you syncing any other calendar items - maybe contacts?&nbsp; If so, do they come across with Tasks?&nbsp; This could also be caused by a corrupt item in your calendar, assuming that the date&nbsp;on your device correct.&nbsp; To check you profile, you could create a new
 profile (without deleting your current one), and enter a test calendar item.&nbsp; You would have to end the partnership on the device, and on your desktop, follow the steps in the KB article at the link below to create a new profile, enter a test calendar item,
 set up your partnership again, and see if the test item comes across.</p>

<p>OK--be patient.&nbsp; It will work (i.e. sync with Outlook Calendar).&nbsp; I had the same level of frustration with the HTC Imagio and--like you--was ready to throw it out.&nbsp; There is lot of complexity and this phone takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>My Email provider is ATT--and I do find that--while my Email is synced wirelessly&nbsp;over their 3G network, my Calendar tasks are NOT being synced.&nbsp; I have to physically connect to my laptop--and then my Calendar will sync.&nbsp; (Note: This I perceive to be a limitation
 of the Email service and not of the phone itself. I'm not really connecting to an "Exchange Server"--just a POP Email server.)&nbsp; If you are lucky enough to connect to a true "Exchange Server" (e.g. corporate server), I think your Calendar will sync without
 issue.</p>
<p>So, syncing with the PC may be the best you can do--to get your Calendar items.&nbsp; What follows are some things to check if you wish to use a hard-wired connection to your laptop and synch with your "Windows PC".</p>
<p>In the Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC), go to Mobile Device Settings/Change Content Sync Solutions.&nbsp; (If you don't have WMDC running on your computer, you will need to locate it online and download it.&nbsp; It gets patched occasionally.&nbsp; So--even if you
 have it, you might download the latest version.)</p>
<p>In this Change Content Sync Solutions dialogue,</p>
<p>Make sure "Calendar" box is checked</p>
<p>Click on "Sync Settings"</p>
<p>Make sure "Windows PC" is checked&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then---plug your phone into a USB port and sync should begin.</p>
<p>If it does not begin, you can initiate it manually--</p>
<p>From the phone, click the (middle) Microsoft menu button (at bottom of phone).&nbsp; On this menu click the green circle with two arrows (Sync icon).&nbsp; If you don't have this icon, click "All Applications" and go find it there.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Have faith--once you work through some configuration issues--and understand the limits of your Email server, this is a pretty good phone.</p>
<p>Bonus Information: While you are in "All Applications", check out the game called "Teeter".&nbsp; I am not much for games but recently ran across it.&nbsp; Pretty nifty game--when you have some time to kill.</p>

<p>Thanks Ed - but I ran into a myriad of issues.&nbsp; Just FYI, my provider is Verizon.</p>
<p>Started by reinstalling WMDC successfully but it wouldn't allow me to go to Mobile Device Settings/Change Contact Synch until I connected my phone.&nbsp; I checked the "Email box" as instructed but couldn't find any reference to "Windows PC".</p>
<p>With the phone unconnected, there are only two options in WMDC available under "Mobile Device Settings": "Connection Settings" and "End a Partnership".</p>
<p>Unless you have some other advice, I guess I'll get my gumption up and try the advice B_Sherrell offered above yours.&nbsp; As you can tell, I'm not particularly savvy and this is daunting.</p>
<p>My wife just got her Droid x and isn't having any issues whatsoever.&nbsp; I picked a Microsoft phone specifically so I could access Outlook and am very disappointed.</p>

<p>I am running Outlook 2007 on Windows Vista Home. I use recurring tasks in Outlook 2007 (specifically, created with the 'regenerate new task' option under recurrence).</p>
<p>When I sync with my Windows Mobile 6.1 phone, these tasks don't appear on the phone although all my other 'normal' tasks do.</p>
<p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you tried creating another tasks folder, moving those tasks that do not sync, sync and then moving them back until you find the ones that do not sync?</p>
<p>Have you tried editing the tasks to see if that resolves the issue? Sometimes bad RTF formatting can cause this issue.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your idea. I have tried a few combinations of editing, deleting recreating and copying my tasks in a new folder as well as in my original one as you suggested.</p>
<p>Whatever I tried, recurring tasks simply do not appear on my phone if they are created using the 'regenerate new task' option. Recurring tasks that don't use this option and other non-recurring tasks sync without problem. Unfortunately I use regenerating
 task a lot so this is a big issue for me.</p>
<p>Any other ideas? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Johor - You may want to Run Detect &amp; Repair or Office Diagnostics under the Help menu in Outlook to see if that resolves your issue.</p>

<p>Mary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having this same, exact, problem. I have used Detect &amp; Repair, no problems were found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I googled extensively and discovered this is a VERY common issue. It seems to be understood as a bug in Windows Mobile, one Microsoft will not admit to. Can you confirm or deny if NEVER syncing "recurring tasks that re-generated x amount of time after completion"
 is a known problem? From my testing and research, it certainly seems to be!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you re-escalated my issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand though how come that after seven months I haven't received the support and the fix I would expect. Furthermore, and this is what upsets me the most, the issue to investigate is related to 100% Microsoft products which are Outlook.com and
 Outlook 2011 for Mac.</p>

</p><p>There's plenty of fantastic people on this forum, helping out a lot.</p>
<p>Since it's a Microsoft forum too I would expect to find MS engineers to help out when necessary.</p>
<p>Apparently in seven months I've been able to reproduce the issue on more than a machine, on more than a Outlook 2011 client, in more than one Country, and Microsoft could not reproduce it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a strange way to help customers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Alden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you want to know; yes the delay is less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>To be exact is between 2 and 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this said then i think we're good. Are we?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually not, I would say I feel being joked on this matter from Microsoft Engineers and Support.</p>
<p>It took you 8 months to say <strong>"sorry pal it's normal for Outlook.com taking 15 minutes to fetch an email message in your inbox"</strong>. Then why didn't you say so right away 8 months ago instead of asking me settings testing and acting like you would
 care something.</p>
<p>And if for Microsoft and its employees it's Ok in a world of exchange and push to have a mail service that takes 15 minutes to get there... well done guys, that's why Google wins hands down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again i have to admit the most reliable and supporting people on this forum are not Microsoft Employees. Then why is this forum hosted by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had enough with Outlook.com</p>
<p>And if I can help my fellow Mac users, stay away from Outlook.com, it really sucks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very disappointed user</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint says I&#39;m missing fonts that aren&#39;t even installed on my computer.</h2>
                    <p>&gt;I made a PowerPoint document on my Mac</p>
<p>&gt;I opened it on a PC</p>
<p>&gt;I edited the document</p>
<p>&gt;When saving, I was given the following warning:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a483d2ec-dfbb-4499-96e2-b6778e88edf7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a483d2ec-dfbb-4499-96e2-b6778e88edf7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Sans is not installed on my Mac or the PC, and has never been installed, or used in the presentation in any way. I even remade the document from scratch, and still got this warning. How is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much.<br />

<p>Thank you for the response, Peter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a little confused because my issue is that&nbsp;<strong>Open Sans has never been installed on either computer, and I have never used it in a presentation.</strong> I do not want Open Sans to be in this presentation or any presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Replace Fonts" in PowerPoint and it will not let me replace Open Sans no matter what I try to replace it with.</p>
<p>

<p>Also, in "Replace Fonts" on my Mac, it does not show Open Sans as existing within the presentation. It is only on the PC that it shows Open Sans as existing within the presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I mentioned above, when I try to replace Open Sans on the PC, I choose another font, I press replace, and nothing happens. It is still there,&nbsp; and I still get an error upon saving.</p>

<p><span>Hi Noah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply. As you mentioned above you never&nbsp;installed&nbsp; Open Sans on PC, please go to&nbsp;C:\Windows\Fonts and search whether&nbsp;<span>Open Sans is in there.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Meanwhile, you can go to(on PC) File&gt; Export &gt;Change File Type&gt;Save as Another File type(Like PDF). To do this is because this issue may be caused by file type.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Have you tried suggestions like safe mode or update PowerPoint I provided above? If they didn't help , please create a new test PowerPoint file and see if the same issue will happened.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Any updates please post back.</span></span></span></p>
