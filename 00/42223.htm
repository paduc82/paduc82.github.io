Thank you Greg in responding to my request.&nbsp; The actions you describe do not work for me.&nbsp; Maybe I am a bit slow in getting things done the way people say but there doesn't seem to be a way to move my files from 6 old fashioned IPODS (10 year old).&nbsp; I have
 been using these for music &amp; they are just about to give up the Ghost on me &amp; I want to put the files onto a laptop before I loose them.&nbsp; I do not use "the Cloud " &amp; I do not want to commit to apple equipment for further storage even though these Ipods have
 been great.&nbsp; Is there any software that will do the job for me?&nbsp; Regards, Terry

            Yes, Terry, transfer the music from the devices into iTunes and then it will be available on your PC from iTunes.
<br />

<br />
<br />There is nothing to worry about, they make it easy to move your music around so you can listen to it wherever you want:  iPod, phone, PC.

            Hello my name is Brad and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I wanted to assist my colleagues on fixing your issues with rescuing your music from the iPods.
<br />
<br />Because of the limits of this interface please refer to the tutorial linked below, after noting the disclaimer, that has step by step screenshots with instructions. 
<br />
<br />Part of this process involves searching for specific folders within the iPod that store music and they are generically marked, however, this tutorial is rather detailed and will show you which ones have the music you need to rescue. 
<br />
<br />*Before beginning the process, please be sure that one iPod is connected at a time to your computer via the correct USB cable. 
<br />*Also, if possible, it's best that each iPod have at least 75% battery charge prior to the beginning of the transfer, as transferring information may take a long period of time and sudden shutdown of either device could corrupt the music you're trying to save. 
<br />

    <title>SERIOUS PROBLEM - NOT HAPPY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yoshi x elite  say:</h3>
<h2>            SERIOUS PROBLEM - NOT HAPPY</h2>
                    
<p>When I tried to download todays update&nbsp; it failed several times even thoguh my connection is flawless. It did this for the previous update too so like that one I went on xbox.com and downloaded the usb version. After this had been installed I cannot view
 messages, friends list (anything to do with online) and after a long loading circle I get the message : This feature is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later Status Code: 80072ee2.&nbsp; I have tried numerous times through out the day to the same message.
 I see this as unacceptable for a paying gold account as everything I haver paid for are unavailable. In addition, I cannot play online as evey game I launch, I am disconnected promptly and cannot sign in until I restart the console. If I do not recieve a reply
 I will ring and complain for this lack of commitment to paying Live customers. </p>

<h2>            New Microsoft Designer Keyboard volume control key stops working</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a new Microsoft Designer Bluetooth keyboard. After I have left it for a while, or rebooted, it stops functioning. The normal keys start working after a delay but the volume controls and other special keys will not function unless I remove the device
 and then add as a new Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Also, if I press the volume control or other special keys this also locks the keyboard for a short while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have set the Bluetooth Support Service and the Human Interface Device Service to be on and to start automatically.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The Designer mouse is fine. The computer is new (HP Envy All-in-one) and Windows 10 and the device drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Microsoft Support but they were less than helpful.</p>

<p>We appreciate your time responding back to us. We would like to know if you've upgraded from an older version of Windows to Windows 10 or it is already installed when you bought your device. Also, did you experienced the same issue on your old keyboard?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you've encountered this issue after a driver update, you can refer to this
<strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732648(v=ws.11).aspx?ppud=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to roll back that specific driver to its previous version and see if the issue is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed. </p>

<p>This is a brand new computer (HP All-in-one) which I immediately upgraded to Creator edition. All updates have been installed and there are no specific driver updates that need rolling back. The keyboard that comes with the computer has volume control function
 keys and works with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried another new designer keyboard in case this one is actually faulty.&nbsp; The same fault is exhibited on both the new and the existing keyboards</p>

<p>I have the same problem descripted above by PugwashXP with Windows 10 Version 1703, Build 15063.540 both with an HP Spectre X360 bought six months ago and a brand new Microsoft Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>It's veri strange, because I never had this problem in the past with the Microsoft Designer Keyboard.
<span><span>The problem was born after the last Windows Update (maybe
</span></span>KB4034674 and/or KB4034662)<span><span>.
</span><span>I tried rolling back to the old drivers as you write but it is not possible because the button is off.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note that if I quit the association with the keyboard in the bluetooth panel and then I join it again, all works for about half an hour but then the problem reappears</span></span>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<ul>
<li>raised this question</li><li>raised a technical support request</li><li>talked to technical support on several occasions</li><li>I have had a call terminated by MC tech support twice with no explanation</li><li>I have been told that the only solution was to buy a keyboard from a different manufacturer</li><li>and so on....</li></ul>
<p>My solution was to return the keyboard - no I have no more problems!!</p>

</span><br />
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash, when you are up and running
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8 startup goes to last user logged on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zachb x86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 startup goes to last user logged on.</h2>
                    <p>When I startup my computer, Windows goes to the last person logged on (there are five different accounts, two require passwords). For example (lets call the account "X"). Someone that was on my computer logs off of their account and goes to the lock screen.
 They click to unlock and then press the shutdown button on the bottom right of the screen. When another person turns on the computer, it bypasses the lock screen and logs on&nbsp;to the account that was last&nbsp;being used&nbsp;("X"). This is the same with an account that
 requires a password to log on. For example I use a password to log on.&nbsp;When I am done using the computer I log off and shutdown. When another person logs on, it goes to the lock screen and when they unlock it, it goes to my account and asks for a password.
 To get back to the screen with all the names&nbsp;they must hit the back arrow on the top.&nbsp;Also when I shut down from inside my account that requires a password, the next time someone turns the computer on it goes into my account and they didn't even&nbsp;have to enter
 a password.</p>
<p>What I am trying to ask is how can I make the page that has all the users for the computer to come up each time after clicking the lock page after startup? In Windows 7, anyone who had an account could just shut down from inside their account and the next
 time the computer started up it would bring up the screen that had all the users. It never went to the last person logged on.</p>
<p>I just am tired of when I turn on my computer it goes to the last person logged on and then I have to log off and then log into mine. I just wish every time I turned the computer on it would let me see the screen that you can choose which account you want
 to log on with.</p>

            <p>I have the same question. Several people in my household use the computer. I would like for it to go straight to the logon screen FOR ALL USERS after coming out of sleep. As it stands, it goes to the last person who was logged on if they have a password.
 If they don't have a password then it automatically goes to the desktop of the last person who was logged on. This is very annoying on a desktop. The only band aid that I have found so far is to give every user a password but it still goes to the last person
 who was logged on to ask for a password. You still &nbsp;have to click on an arrow to see all user accounts for the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is so annoying about this? Well, my wife doesn't like to take the time to log in to her account so she just logs in to mine and I usually have a bunch of IE pages open. When I go to log in I end up finding a bunch of clothing store websites open. I
 now, politely, have to ask her if she wants me to keep the sites open for her before closing them out. My kids also all have passwords now... which I want to avoid. This is a major fail for 8.</p>

<h2>            Driver power state failure after resuming from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Ever since a Microsoft Windows update last week, about half the time my computer resumes from sleep mode, within 1-2 minutes it will get a BSOD with the "driver power state failure" error and restart, but interestingly I never get the error the moment I
 wake up the computer. I'm using a Lenovo IdeaPad Y510P with Windows 8 64-bit. I already tried uninstalling the Intel HD 4000 driver, restarting computer, and installing the one on Lenovo's site (as this was suggested on the Lenovo forum as a common fix) but
 it didn't help.</p>
<p>I used Microsoft's WinDebug tool to collect the BSOD crash dump, which is uploaded here:&nbsp;<a href="http://textuploader.com/0fe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://textuploader.com/0fe4</a></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />

            <p>&nbsp;Or... you could just be made aware that MANY users report problems with PCs (usually Laptops) coming out-of Sleep modes... generally because one of your many HW devices has a Driver that was poorly coded (not following all of the extensive MS-required Driver
 'model'). You 'could' play with Crash Dumps for how many hours you have available to 'waste'...&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;And, just <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">stop</span> using Hibernate and Sleep modes altogether. [Google how-to 'disable' them.] Shutdown your Windows OS each time you are done working, right-<em>after</em> you Defragment your files. And at
<em>every</em> Restart, always Update your AntiVirus application 1ST(!), before doing any work.</p>
<p>***FYI, Windows 8.1 itself is a well-written and reliable OS (compared to W7 or earlier).</p>

            <p>Uninstalled Avira, turned on Windows Defender, and uninstalled DaemonTools Lite now.</p>
<p>Anything to do next or do I just wait for the next BSOD upon waking from sleep?</p>
<p>Also from the WinDbg and BluescreenView a "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ntoskrnl.exe" seems to be the problem. What exactly is that and do I need to do anything about it?</span></p>

            <p>Now we wait and see if the crashes have stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
ntoskrnl.exe is not a driver, etc, but simply a variant of the Windows NT kernel. If it's labeled as the fault in a crash, it's not true, and it's due to the fact that corruption occurred in the kernel, and Windows didn't know what caused it. Because of this,
 it has but no choice to fault the kernel as it can't not fault nothing at all.</span></p>

<h2>            New Microsoft EPub books</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;I recently purchased an EPUB book through the new feature in EDGE. &nbsp;I would like to read this book in another reader and store the book with the rest of my EBOOKS on my OneDrive. &nbsp;I found the EPUB book on my harddrive but when I try to open it with
 another reader it is illegible. &nbsp;I don't get an error, I just see a bunch of control characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can I not read the book I purchased on any reader I choose?</p>

            Based on the screenshot that you've provided, it is possible that the UPUB file&nbsp; could be DRM protected and can only open on supported devices or with OneDrive. In addition, the EPUB file could be in a format that cannot be opened by the reader that you're
 using.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post again if you have other concerns.<br />

<p>Does Microsoft DRM protect the books they sell?&nbsp; If so, I want my money back.&nbsp; That's ridiculous.&nbsp; And Microsoft EPUB books can only be opened by EDGE?&nbsp; Again, I want my money back.</p>

<p>Would like them to go back to the way RtW started. I'm not trying to simulate A behind-the-scenes life of a WWE Superstar. That bored me to tears last year, running around and starting random fights. It was like playing a modern version of "Just Bring It!"
 or "Shut Your Mouth!". Both games I loved respectively for their time, but I'd rather be treated to the broadcast type RtW from 09 and 10, where it felt like an actual episode of Raw or Smackdown that I was directly involved in. Not a bunch of garbage that
 doesn't seem to even be televised backstage.</p>
<p>Also giving us back all the moves they took away! GIVE ME BACK THE GOLDBERG SPEAR!!!!!!</p>

<p>I hope that they bring back weight classes. I can't remember which WWE game it was but I remember one of them had it that it was not possible for smaller wrestlers to pick up bigger wrestlers. I know the old N64 wreslting games had it but one of the SVRs
 had it too. It's getting kinda silly seeing Rey Mysterio tossing the Big Show all around the ring.</p>

<h2>            Thumbnails have small grey box with white slash</h2>
                    <p>After editing a photo with photo shop elements 12, I found all the thumbnail in the same folder have an overlying grey box icon. The icon also sappears on pictures in the pictures folder that are not in a sub-folder</p>
<p>The file association has not changed, and I do not let adobe organise the files - but something has obviously happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in the properties box, the same icon appears.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My dad has had this problem for a while. Adobe was suspect number one, since they make some crappy software. The culprit turned out to be another close-to-malware though: Norton. Go to settings in Norton and disable "Backup Status Indicators". In my dads
 case, the problem was gone immediately after.</p>

    <title>Importing Outlook Express 6 mail into Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evilh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing Outlook Express 6 mail into Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
This has been addressed many times before, but I'm hitting errors each time I try to perform an import.<br />
<br />
I've pointed Win7's Live Mail in the direction of a perfectly-good folder contain both XP's Outlook Express 6 *.dbx files, and have imported these files into Outlook and exported them to a *.pst file (into the same folder).<br />
<br />
When attempting either import I'm receiving the same message:&nbsp; "No messages can be found in this folder&nbsp;or another application is using the files".<br />
<br />
Considering the process is so simple I can't work out what I'm doing wrong.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

</blockquote>
<p><br />
You have to import Outlook's pst files into OE, not the other way around, and then copy the OE message store to the new machine.<br />
<br />
Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>For messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>

<p>if the operating system is otherwise functioning well, then the service that failed to start is likely unneeded by your sytem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the error you have is&nbsp;likely a service you added to the system when you installed a third party program.</p>
<p>what you can see and do is:</p>
<p>click start &gt; run &gt; msconfig</p>
<p>under the services tab&nbsp;you can see the services available on your system.</p>
<p>try clicking the "hide" option box and see what services&nbsp;remain on the revised list.</p>
<p>you could disable all of the services on the revised listing&nbsp;if you wish, since they are not specifically required by the operating system.</p>
<p>but you can alsio review the listing and see which service is "enabled" but is not functional or start-able.</p>

    <title>AVI media files not supported by Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chelsea s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVI media files not supported by Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I just purchased a REALLY expensive recording pen. The media files it creates are AVI format, which is theoretically compatible with Windows 10. The first time I connected my pen to my computer (after a series of "practice recordings"), at least half
 the files opened. As for the ones that didn't, I just assumed it was operator error. Now, however, I actually have important recordings that will not open. Each time I try to open these media files, I get an error message that reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Can't play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try playing something else. This item's file format may be unsupported, the file extension may be incorrect, or the file may be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc00d36c4 (0xc00d36c4)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The indicator lights on this pen tell me it's charging and I know it recorded everything I needed it to. So it's operating and connecting just fine. Where is the problem and how do I fix it?</p>

            If the mail app will not stay open, it may be that the app needs to be reset or reinstalled or something of that nature or maybe try to boot in clean mode then try again. 
<br />
<br />First, Clean boot: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the app again. If that didn't work, continue. 
<br />
<br />2nd, reset/terminate/etc. You can do this by searching for mail in the windows search bar &gt; right click it &gt; app settings &gt; scroll down and click terminate  then do a reset. Try the app again.

    <title>Windows activation tech popup, unknown publisher for all .exe, several - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sumup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows activation tech popup, unknown publisher for all .exe, several seemingly un-repairable, corrupt files found with &#34;sfc&#47;scannow&#34;</h2>
                    It seemed to have started with the "Windows activation technologies" popups about a month ago. &nbsp;Several times a day it will tell me that my version of Windows is not genuine. &nbsp;I did upgrade to Windows 7 64-bit a year ago but haven't had any trouble since
 then. &nbsp;I went through the online steps to resolve it through the popup. &nbsp;It would download something but right at the end of the download it would say that it couldn't complete and that would be the end of it... &nbsp;But the popups continue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also noticed that I am asked to confirm that I want to run certain programs, allow programs to make changes, because they are apparently from unknown publishers. &nbsp;This includes cmd.exe, msconfig, etc. &nbsp;This made me think that these files could be corrupted,
 lost signatures, idk. &nbsp;So I ran "sfc/scannow." &nbsp;It found files that it couldn't repair. &nbsp;But I don't know how to read the log it generates in notepad to find a particular file that needs attention. &nbsp;I did notice that some of those logs noted the file couldn't
 be repaired because it was in use so I re-ran "sfc" in safe mode with programs turned off wondering if that would help but no.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So... What do you think?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

                    I've seen this posted before with no real answers. My XBox turns completely off. Then I can't wake it up by saying "XBox on." Is there a certain option you have to set to make it go to standby? Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Touchscreen &#40;touch panel&#41; not working after windows 10 upgrade - asus zenbook ux501jw</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I upgraded my Asus Zenbook Ux501JW to Windows 10, now my toucscreen no longer works. The touchpanel worked fine before the upgrade to windows 10. Now the system acts as if it does not have a touchscreen display.&nbsp;<span>The
 pen and touch options are nowhere to be found, in the system info panel it says "No pen or touch input is available for this display" , and the touchpanel is not listed in teh device manager.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I have contacted Asus support, who advised me to look for and enable 'HID-touch panel' in the device manager under 'Human Interface Devices' but this device is not listed. The only items listed under 'Human Interface Devices' are:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>HID-compliant wireless radio controls </li><li>USB Input Device</li></ul>
<p>Asus support then advised me to download and reinstall the chipset drivers from (<a href="http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;s=770&amp;m=UX501JW&amp;os=&amp;hashedid=Z9AuwwfsrmavyQi6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;s=770&amp;m=UX501JW&amp;os=&amp;hashedid=Z9AuwwfsrmavyQi6</a>).
 I did that, and it did not fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run windows hardware troubleshooter and it found no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no devices with errors in the device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers and bios are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other solution offered by Asus support was to revert back to windows 8.1.... I do not want to do that if possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a software issue where the system is recognizing the touchpanel as something other than an input device... but I do not know how to fix that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help - I do not want to revert back to windows 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to download and install the touchpad&nbsp;drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the driver setup file and then select “Properties”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Choose the “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Place a check mark on “Run this program in compatibility mode”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Choose “Windows 8 or 8.1”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on “Apply” and then “Ok”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Try to install the drivers and check the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>You may also install available Windows Updates and see if it makes any difference.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran windows update and my system is up to date.</li><li>According to Asus support, there is no separate driver package for the touchscreen, it is installed via the chipset package.</li><li>I tried your suggestion and re-installed the Asus chipset drivers in windows 8 compatibility mode. This did not fix the problem.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Note: When I select "show hidden devices" in the device manager, I can see "HID compliant touch screen" in the list of Human Interface Devices, but it is greyed out. &nbsp;When I view its properties, the status says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)</em></p>
<p><em>To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."&nbsp;</em></p>

</p><p>I know the touchscreen is connected and functioning, so this makes me think the system thinks it is a different device and therefore not recognizing it as a touchscreen ...But i'm not sure how to make the system recognize it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is appreciated!</p>

            <p>Thanks, but this did not help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run windows update regularly and my system is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my previous post shows, the "HID Compliant touchscreen" device is hidden because&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)</em></p>
<p><em>To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the hidden "HID Compliant touchscreen" &nbsp;device and restarting my computer. but it did not reinstall - probably because it doesn't think it's connected. &nbsp;Now "HID Compliant touchscreen" does not show up under Human Interface Devices even
 when I show hidden devices.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>JD_Mik ---- </p>
<p>I had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM but it occurred after I upgraded to windows 10 successfully. My touch worked fine after upgrade. I have an Acer Aspire R7-572-6805 laptop running 64-bit W10 currently. I have no idea when the touch stopped in last 4 days, but
 it was fine between 8/5/15 (W10 upgrade) and 9/12/15. It was not working today 9/18/15. I tried rebooting - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>I did a system restore to 9/12/15 (Windows critical update)
</strong>- no change - Hidden device in device manager - HID compliant touch screen &amp; pen still grayed out and showing:

</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>rebooted again</strong> - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I was about to do a restore to earlier point OR open laptop to assure some imaginary touch cable wasn't dis-connected...&nbsp; then my husband had a brilliant idea.&nbsp; I actually did not consider it would work... but this last part did!</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>UNPLUG ALL USB DEVICES (mouse/flash drive/etc.) -&gt; PLUG IN HDMI CORD CONNECT TO TV DISPLAY (mirror screen; he did this twice with no change) -&gt; CHANGED FROM BALANCED POWER PLAN TO PERFORMANCE then REBOOT LAPTOP WITH HDMI

<p>
</p><p>That is it. Upon a restore point and above and one last boot with HDMI plugged in, the onscreen keyboard popped up normal. Unplugged the HDMI cord from laptop and changed the power plan back to balanced (I dont know if that did any thing at all but I explained
 what <em>he </em>did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow he tricked the display to reset/find itself again using HDMI port. I dont think its windows update. I think I disabled it using shortcuts or something. I plan to re-install critical update without concern. Please advise if this helps!!! I hope so

            <p>I tried all the different steps I saw on these threads. When I uninstalled the hidden driver from Computer Management - Device Manager it didn't show up anymore. Even tried some strange advice from this thread, didn't work for me:&nbsp;http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2125051/touchscreen-stopped-working-asus-laptop.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I installed the new BIOS from ASUS (version 210). When it was complete, the touchscreen was not working, but the last USB Input Device under Human Interface Devices in the Device Manager was disabled. I enabled that device and now the touchscreen
 is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/ZenBook_Pro_UX501/HelpDesk_Download/</p>
<p>Driver &amp; Tools &gt; Windows 10 64bit &gt; BIOS &gt; Version 210 - BIOS 210 (Update EC FW)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see that BIOS Version 209 fixed the error, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Fixed eDP Panel Power Sequence not correct after S3 resume, Panel will abnormal
 after wake up0 from panel-off."&nbsp;</span>Maybe this bug is what fixed the touchscreen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the BIOS using the WinFlash utility but you can also do it using the Asus Live Update that would be installed at the factory. The cryptic error "adapter is not connected to the device" meant that I needed to plug the power cable (can't update BIOS
 update on battery).</p>

            <p>If it's Asus UX501, try updating the BIOS. I updated to version 210 and touchscreen became fixed.</p>

<p>Personally, I'll stick with STEAM. 6 full retail games for just over $35. M$ certainly can't beat that.

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I received a mail shown that now we can install Window 10 for free.</p>
<p>So, I went to the website&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-my/windows/windows-10-upgrade</p>
<p>And click on "Get started" it started to download a .exe file named&nbsp;GWXWebWindows.exe</p>
<p>After the download finished, I opened the file and it automatic open a new tab from my browser and showed
</p>
<p>"We are sorry, the page you requested cannot be found".</p>
<p>Please let me know whether the server is too busy or anything that I need to do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
