<blockquote>It was installed without it and when i shut it down i still get the error. I do have a router. Do you think that is interfering with outlook?</blockquote>
<p><br />
You're modem and router were going to be next on my list. Try resetting both. If they don't have reset buttons, just unplug for about 15 seconds and plug&nbsp;back in. Do the router first and then the modem.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, can you bypass the router at least for testing purposes?</p>
<p>Some other things to look at.</p>

                    This happens on 2 PCs. How do I have it logged in? I haven't cleared cache or anything - just shuts down.

</p><p>Let me just get it more clear, when you sign in to Skype, your PC shuts down or the Skype application, correct? Also, can you give us the exact Skype version that you are currently using right now?</p>

            Skype application keeps shutting down - one at home is 7.40.0.151 and one at work as well, always closes. The one at the office asks me to try the upgrade so I did and that constantly closes so went back to the earlier version but that closes down. Isn't
 it supposed to be in my startup and always startup and stay open?

</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, when you say&nbsp;"<strong>Skype application automatically shutdown</strong>", does it means the application suddenly force stopped and&nbsp;froze that you need to sign in again? Or do you want the Skype application to automatically start up when you
 boot your device?</p>

            Yes would like the app to automatically startup when booted and prior versions when closing the application remained in the system tray as opened but now it closes completely.

</p><p>That specific feature is still available with <strong>classic </strong><strong>Skype v7.40</strong>. Make sure the

<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps below on how to check.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the Skype application, click <strong>Tools &gt; Options.</strong></li><li>Click General settings &gt; tick <em>"Start Skype when I start Windows"</em></li><li>The click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ul>

<p>The only way can do the change that you are wishing for is by logging to the email service of the account you are using. Go to the account settings options make the changes and check.</p>

<br />I HAD A TYPO IN MY EMAIL ADDRESS USED TO ACTIVATE OFFICE 2013, NOW I AM STUCK!

<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt; When activating Office 2013 home and business I had a typo in my email address domain name.  Now I am stuck because the verification email isn’t going to an actual email box, so I can’t verify.  If I try to start over the product key is rejected as it is already in use!
<br />HELP!!
<br />
<br />Update, after waiting 90min on hold MS the fix is to install the product (I happened to have the download) and then click “I want to activate with product key”, then put a bogus code in so it will switch to give you a ‘I want to activate by telephone”.  Call the number on the screen and explain everything, then they will activate your OFFICE 2013!  The last step is to start a new live account and switch accounts.  What a pain MS! &lt;/snip&gt;

<br />
<br />Answer
<br />“Now why would anyone ever want to do something like that”  &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;
<br />
<br />Sorry, but apparently MS did not think that anyone would ever want to do that when it designed the Office 365 activation system.  There is no easy fix for your question
<br />Move Office 365 University to a New Email Account - barely possible 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_account/moving-office-365-university-subscritpion-to/053401f9-2f7b-4684-90d2-2e876873fd96">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum...</a> 
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />Well after nearly 2 hours of hold time, someone finally picked up.  I explained my situation and he said he’s been getting a flood of phone calls in the past week regarding the issue.  He explained that many people have registered for Office 365 with incorrect or misspelled email addresses/accounts and they currently have no power to change this.  He only offered to escalate the issue to the next level and take down my contact information. 
<br /> 
<br />For anyone with the same issue, you should keep calling and make some noise over this because it’s insane that MS locks in your account, giving you no ability to change it.  If I get no reply back on this in a few days, I will try and cancel my Office 365 University subscription.
<br />However, I am now running into a roadblock because they require me to re-verify my university status.  When I go enter my .edu address, they tell me it has already been used for verification of the 365 subscription that customer support just cancelled.  I’ve emailed them back about it and hopefully they can correct this.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;

            Hi Thomas, your best option is to create another user account with the correct details and then delete the account with the wrong details . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Family and other People
<br />
<br />Click 'Add someone else to this PC'
<br />
<br />Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new User Profile
<br />
<br />Then log out and into the new User Profile
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the old account in the resulting dialog
<br />
<br />Click 'Remove'
<br />
<br />That's It!

<h2>            My nightly back-ups to the Western Digital External Hard Drive are working fine....... but each night, I LOSE 1 GB OF FREE SPACE ON THE C-DRIVE</h2>
                    <p>I have a support contract with Dell's "Premium Support" group.&nbsp; They have solved many complex&nbsp; PC &amp; software problems, but have been unable to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that a Community Member has seen and solved this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 18 months, I have done nightly Back-ups to the Western Digital 2 TB External Hard Drive.&nbsp; It works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know when this bizarre situation started, but here's what I'm experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each morning, I would check &amp; confirm that the Backup to the Ext. Hard Drive was successful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a spreadsheet log I created,&nbsp; I recorded the C-Drive Free Space for that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 2 weeks (possibly longer), the Free Space on the C-Drive was reduced by ~ 1 GB each night !</p>
<p>
</p><p>So over the past 14 days, the C-Drive has lost (is using) 14 GB of Free Space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that a renegade App. on the C-drive is causing a backup of&nbsp; all my files, and putting that data - each night -&nbsp; back on the C-Drive ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this loss of Free Space of 1GB/night trend continues,&nbsp; possibly in May or June 2019,&nbsp; there will NO FREE SPACE left on the C-Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give some guidance on where to look;&nbsp; what to look for ? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a Diagnostic or Logging App. be used,&nbsp; to "monitor" what's happening each night, READING FROM and WRITING TO the C-Drive so we can see the file movements ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warm regards from NH,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

            There is no direct way to check which files led to an increase in C drive's space. However, it is a good idea to cleanup files using disk cleanup.
<br />First of all, eliminate all useless files on C:/ by using Disk Cleanup.

<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response ans guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the recommended Disk Cleanup, and eliminated many useless files on C:/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the TreeSize app.&nbsp; and began to use it. &nbsp;&nbsp; It's showing me which&nbsp; files and folders are taking up the space.
</p>
<p>But I want to know what NEW file(s) &amp; folder(s) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
since last night,</span> have been newly-stored onto the C:/, causing it to lose 1GB of Free Space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh....I disabled the Western Digital nightly auto backup for the past 3 nights.&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm still losing 1 GB of Free Space every night&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's not the WD software making this problem....but something else...I don't know how to resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a current subscription for $149 for "Microsoft Assure". &nbsp; But have no notes on how to access this service.&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the best way for me to contact the group and get a technical support expert ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span>We're getting closer to solving this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I used TreeSize to record the size of all the largest files on the C-Drive. &nbsp; Did it overnight: 4/ 9 evening;
 and then on 4/10 morning (today).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Western Digital Backup happened as scheduled, at 1:30 AM.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Overnight, the data shows we used 1 GB of ADDITIONAL space in the "System Volume Info" folder. And the growth
 seems to be in 2 NEW files, each at &gt;1 GB. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They may be the target for my drill-down....you agree ? &nbsp;&nbsp; What's putting those files there ?&nbsp; Where are they
 coming from ?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Far below you can see data on page.file and hiber.file.&nbsp; There was no change; but are their sizes OK ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<h2>            Photo Gallery has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Live Photo Gallery slide show not working</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a problem with Windows Live Photo Gallery not working at all. I have mostly fixed this by repairing Windows Live Essentials but still the slide show is not working. It is a black screen, obviously going through the photos but not showing them. Also
 I have done the Microsoft 'Fix-It' which recognised the problem but could not fix it. The error says the correct driver or graphics card is not installed &amp; yet the slide show has worked in the past.</p>

            I have done this &amp; reinstalled Windows Essentials 2011. When I try &amp; load WLPG, it comes up in the background faintly but with an error message saying 'WLPG has stopped working'. If I load Windows Essentials 2012 &amp; try &amp; load Photo Gallery, I do not see
 PG even in the background &amp; the error message is 'Windows Essentials 2012 is not working'. I have tried reloading Photo Gallery from the website but it always loads it with Essentials 2012, which obviously there is a problem with. Don't know what to try now.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for uploading the log files. I checked it and found out that you missed to provide the System Event logs due to error when uploading. What I can suggest is for you to try uploading the file again in the private message area or use your SkyDrive account
 by following the steps <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a>. After uploading to SkyDrive, get a public link through the steps
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/skydrive/change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a> and paste the link in the private message area for privacy purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for it.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>I have done the system file check as you described. As for the Windows update, I have auto update on so only have some optional updates waiting. Do you want me to do those? At the moment, Photo Gallery is still not working.&nbsp; Movie maker does nothing when
 I click on the icon. I have not loaded Windows Live Mail. Do you think it is to do with the driver, although I have, in the last month or so, updated both the drivers? My game will not play &amp; when I try it, the error message is that d3d file is missing. This
 is what came up when I eventually got the diagnostic log file for you&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation. Let's see what we can do. As my colleague said, we request that you do a full Windows Updates. This will help us&nbsp;isolate the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you suspect that this issue was caused by your video card drivers, <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<font>go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
1. Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.
<br />
2. Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know how things turn out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No free and legal&nbsp;download is&nbsp;available.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your Computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

</p><p>This didn't start when I updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, it took a few days to begin acting like this. I haven't made any major change to my computer... other than connecting it for the very first time via HDMI, but this problem is not happening

<h2>            Computer in a rebooting loop </h2>
                    There was a recent update to Vista ultimate 64bit, that I installed in my computer. Yesterday, I noticed the update 3 of 3 0% complete do not shut down your computer screen. Sat there for a few minutes then it rebooted on it's own, did the same thing again
 and again. Tried to get in this morning same thing, tried to boot to safe mode unable to and the last know good configuration. Any suggestions what to try next?

<h2>            Missing features in Windows Backup</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi guys,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you please tell me, whether the following features will ever be added to Windows Backup or one should use 3rd party software (which is pretty annoying, given the cost of Windows 7) or just switch to a Mac?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ability to set up the Backup Utility to make only 1 full backup and from there on only incremental backups (I have over 500GB of data on my PC and a full backup takes more than 12 hours!)</strong>
</li><li><strong>ability to resume a canceled backup - e.g. one had to shut down his/her PC and if a backup was running, it should be resumed after starting the PC</strong>
</li><li><strong>background backing up - every hour or so - just like the Apple's Time Machine</strong>
</li></ul>
<div><strong>Without these features I find the Backup Utility almost completely useless..</strong></div>
<div><strong>Thank you in advance!</strong></div>

<ul>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can do a full backup of your computer and then set Windows 7 to do automatic backup. With automatic backups,
 you don't have to remember to back<br />
up your files. You can change your automatic backup settings (such as how often you back up, the type of storage you use, or the types of files you back up) whenever you want.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-or-change-automatic-backup-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-or-change-automatic-backup-settings</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot resume a cancelled backup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can set Windows 7 to Backup Your Computer Hourly</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Make sure Backup and Restore has been set up and is scheduled to back up your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.Let’s open the Task Scheduler by going to Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and then click Task
 Scheduler.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.In the left column you’re going to expand a few folders by clicking the arrow on the left of each folder. Expand
 Task Scheduler Library, Microsoft, <br />
Windows, and then select the WindowsBackup folder. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.Double-click AutomaticBackup in the top section of the center column.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.Select the Triggers tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.Select the trigger (you should only have one) and then click Edit.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.Set it to happen daily.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: If you want the hourly backups to start now, change the start time to the next hour on this day.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.Check off Repeat task every, set it to 1 hour, and for a duration of indefinitely.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9.Click OK to save the changes.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Radeon 3650 HD AGP. ATI Catalyst 10.5 Display driver doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I currently have a Radeon 3650 HD AGP card. &nbsp; A week or so ago i updated my driver and it worked fine for several days but now have serious issues.&nbsp; I'm using windows xp home. when i bring up my dxdiag and click on display it shows no device name and N/A
 to everything else.&nbsp; It shows my driver is vga .dll 5.012600.0000 instead of ATI Catalyst 10.5 Display driver.&nbsp; When i right click desktop and go to properties just the theme tab shows up.&nbsp; no screen saver or desktop tab to change resolutions.&nbsp; when i click
 Catalyst control center nothing happens and when i click ATI hyravision it tell me it will only run when an ATI driver is present.&nbsp; How can this be fixed?<br />

<p>Just reinstall the driver package.</p>
<p>If it install normally then OK or if it prompts to repair installation then repair it. After repairing/reinstalling you should restart the machine to get the effect.</p>
<p>Make also sure about that you have latest DirectX9.0c installed in your XP platform.</p>
<p>For latest DirectX visit:</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The compatibilty information of MX3000 with windows 7 is not available.<br />
You can click on the following link and check:</p>
<p>I suggest that install latest drivers compatible with windows 7 from the manufacturer's website.
<br />
To do this, click on the following link: <a href="http://www.universalremote.com/faq.php?faq=34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.universalremote.com/faq.php?faq=34</a></p>
<p>You may also try updating the driver manually.<br />
To do this follow the steps in the below link:<br />

            Hello GeoffYoung2
<br />Plese follow these steps 
<br />Once you have your font downloaded (these are often .ttf files) and available, just right-click it and click Install. That’s it! I know, uneventful.
<br />
<br />Install Font windows 10
<br />To check if the font is installed, press Windows key+Q then type: fonts then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />open fonts
<br />You should see your fonts listed in the Font Control Panel.
<br />
<br />Fonts Control Panel
<br />If you don’t see it and have a ton of them installed, just type in its name in the search box to find it.
<br />
<br />find font
<br />That’s all there is to it. Now you can create stylish and unique documents with some of your favorite fonts not included in Windows 10 by default.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps       
        </p>

            Hi Geoff,
<br />
<br />Download that font
<br />
<br />If it is in a zip file, extract the form from that zip file
<br />
<br />Close all open applications
<br />
<br />Right click the font file and choose Install
<br />
<br />If the font does not install for you, in Windows File Explorer, copy the font file to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Install the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Download the Game
</span></p>
<p><span>b) Right-click on the Game and click on ‘<b>properties’</b>.</span></p>

            <p>If you upgraded to Windows 8, make sure you have the latest driver for your graphic card, which is very much responsible for performance and hardware-accelerated graphics.&nbsp; This could be the source of the slowness, especially if your computer didn't come
 with Windows 8 drivers already loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get your video card driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that.&nbsp; That was my best guess.&nbsp; Honestly Windows 8 has the same graphics system as Windows 7 so it really "should" be about the same, or even better considering the newer DirectX and less graphics memory spent rendering transparency for the desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't have any other ideas.&nbsp; Before you launch the game, can you open task manager and see if any processes are using more than 1% or so of your CPU resources?</p>
<p><br />

            I noticed that before I launch the game no process are using more than 1 % ( excluding Task Manager itself).

    <title>Can&#39;t log back into my Microsoft Live Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragynwyllow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log back into my Microsoft Live Account</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I had an update last night to my Windows 8.1. At this point I already couldn't log into my MySMS app. I was told that "We couldn't connect to this service right now. Check your internet connection and try again later." Even though I have a direct
 connection to the internet. Today, I get some messages after getting the update that I need to verify my account. I go in, change some pics for my login and added a pin just to do something new. Then I reaffirm my password and go back to my desktop.
<br />
<br />
When I'm on my desktop, the action center window pops up that says I need to verify my account. I click on that that and it takes me to the start screen like a separate app and asks me to put my password in. I do so and after a few seconds, it says that "We
 couldn't connect to this service, please check your network connection and try again later." So I come here but no one directly addresses this issue; it's usually BECAUSE they can't update or they fundamentally changed something in their computer (moving a
 user file, moving .exe files, using command prompt, etc.,). Microsoft keeps referring me to pages that indicate the user simply doesn't know how to REACH the logon screen or haven't set up their account yet. I've had this laptop for about a year or so, now,
 so that's not it. Then I see that someone else had some trouble verifying their account and switched their account to a local account, and then switched it back to a Live account and that synced up everything he had.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided I'd do that, as well, but now when I try to switch back to my Live account I get "Sorry we couldn't connect to Microsoft services right now. If this problem persists, search for "network problems" on the start screen." I did so but my computer
 can't find any network problems. The first time I did it, it told me that the network wasn't accepting some sort of information. So I restarted the computer, and tried again. I got the same error that "we couldn't connect", and tried looking for network problems,
 but now the computer repeatedly can't find any problems. I still can't log on to my Live account, however. I tried to do a refresh of my computer but there are far too many files for which I don't have the discs any more, or no idea what sites I may have gotten
 them from, so I really would like to avoid that option if at all possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thank!</p>
<p>

 me that "they", whoever "we" are, can't connect to whatever it is they need to connect to. I would like to know what they need to connect to so I can connect them and get back to my apps!<br />

            No that should certainly not happen.&nbsp; Can you try creating a new local account on the computer and see if it works from inside there?&nbsp; Perhaps your profile is just corrupted.

            <p>No, unfortunately. I get the same screen as if I were trying to sign back into the live account. I could make a whole new local account, even make it an administrator account, but it won't let me make it Live. And the same thing happens in that local account,
 the LAN settings are reset, even when I go back to make sure they stay the same, and click OK.<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

            find the software for it on the CD that (should have) came with it, or check the manufacturer's website(most only have the software the allows it to run, the driver, online, but you should have a disc with a full featured program on it.).&nbsp;

<h2>            Action Center Keeps Popping Up.</h2>
                    <p>Every DAMN TIME I click or move my mouse/touch pad, the Action Center pops up on the right and literally COVERS a whole 1/3 of my screen. PLEASE for the love of god help me disable this as I have NO IDEA how.
</p>
<p>This has become a really big problem to me and it has started to stress me out because I have exams in two weeks and this issue has prevented me from studying peacefully. I am growing more and more irritated each time it happens so please someone come up
 with a solution as I could be studying right now but I am raging at this Action Center which has popped up at last 7 times while i wrote this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANKS. x</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Again stuck at 79%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again i got stuck at 79% of "configuring" or "preparing" (in polish it`s "konfigurowanie"). After first failure I checked for any missing updates (wasn't this update supposed to be unavalible in store if sny updates are missing?). There were two updates
 so I installed them, rechecked for any more, even rebooted and rechecked and there was none more avalible... so I tried to update to 8.1 once more.... and here I am again, writting on my tablet and stuck at 79% for over and hour (first time it was half night).
 Great update... I see tons of ppl have diffirent problems with it.... btw my laptop is samsung np700z5c

            i had this problem for a few months and managed to overcome it yesterday. I did the following things (but im finally not sure which was the key problem amongst these)<br />
<br />
1. i updated all device drivers.<br />
<br />
2. disconnect any other peripheral other than mouse and keyboard<br />
<br />
3. under control panel -&gt; Troubleshooting -&gt;System and Security -&gt; Run - Fix problems with Windows Update. for me it fixed a couple of things.<br />
<br />
4. ran and installed all windows updates.<br />
<br />
5. under control panel -&gt; Windows Firewall. I disabled both firewalls completely.<br />
<br />
6. I disabled my antivirus software.<br />
<br />
all the best!
