<h2>            Contacts lost when linking MSN account to Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Apparently this is the only way to contact support here, so here it goes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the MSN Messenger servers were apparently shut down a few days ago, I had to merge my MSN and Skype accounts. On doing that (after a long and weird procedure), I finally had all my contacts showing up in Skype... except they're not all here! I can
 see at least 2 of them disappeared, and most probably more than that. I can't even check since I can't get my contact list as it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried contacting Skype support, where they told me I had to contact Microsoft support.</p>
<p>I tried the contact through 'Account &amp; Billing' on the Microsoft Support page that the Sky support rep gave me, and was told that they couldn't help, and I had to contact MSN support.</p>
<p>I went to the MSN support page they gave me, where there is absolutely no option to contact anyone.</p>
<p>I ended up on the phone, being told that the only option was to post a question here to get a reply...</p>

</p><p><span>I am sorry to know that you have lost few contacts from MSN account. And I appreciate your time and patience as you had to go through different support teams before posting a query here.
</span></p>
<p><span>How did you try to sync emails either by logging into Skype or by logging into msn.com?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To make sure that you have all the contacts you can log into people.live.com and check if you have all contacts. Then try to share with Skype.</span></p>

            <p>Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>- I didn't try to sync emails in any way. I am talking about MSN Messenger and Skype, there are absolutely no emails involved.</p>
<p>- I already took a look at people.live.com as it was suggested on a few forums/blog posts that I found on this issue that it may be possible to restore them using the "Restore deleted contacts" option in there. However, it showed no contacts to restore.
 The contacts I lost are not appearing there either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few more info on this:</p>
<p>- To link the account, here's what I did (this is pretty cumbersome, and I have no idea why it's done this way):</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Log on using the Skype app, using my MSN account -&gt; only my MSN contacts are showing up, and it created me a Skype account on the fly</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Sign out, quit Skype</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Go to my Skype profile on the Web</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Unlink the MSN account, thus destroying the Skype account that was created on the fly</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Return to Skype, re-log using my MSN account</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Then suddenly, the option "I already have a Skype account" shows up (no freaking idea why it's not showing up the first time...)</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I choose that option, log in my Skype account</p>
<p>&nbsp; -&gt; Accounts are merged, and I lost some contacts... great job!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- For one of the contacts I lost, I had actually talked to him the week-end before. Interestingly, the history of that conversation (done on MSN) is shown on Skype, with anID in the form of '1:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'. However, that contact is not showing up anymore
 in the contact list or on people.live.com. Other contacts, who I have not talked with in a while, also disappeared and I have no way of knowing who they are or getting back their MSN account address...</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm apparently not the only one having these problems. In particular, you can take a look at those links:</p>
<p>June '13: http://community.skype.com/t5/Modern-Windows-archive/lost-msn-contacts/td-p/1718321</p>
<p>January '13:&nbsp;http://community.skype.com/t5/Windows-archive/MSN-contacts-missing/td-p/1254892</p>
<p>And these are just a few examples... You can see on the 2nd that someone is saying Skype was able to somehow resolve the issue. In my case, they failed to answer and just redirected me to you.</p>

<p>Hi Carissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your detailed explanation, @ MMichela. From your clarification, the issue is caused by the Form add-in. In this scenario, since there's no such feature to disable the daily update of the Form, you may try to unfollow the channel so that you
 won't receive all the notifications as a workaround. Or you can click the Share More to Feedback and share the experience or expectations with the development team. We appreciate for your kind understanding.</p>
<p>

            Those addresses are stamped by the default address policy in Exchange Online, you cannot remove them when you are using Hybrid. Only way is to temporary disable dirsync, remove the alias and enable dirsync again.

                    In a previous PowerPoint 2007 slide show, I used the same style bullet for level one and level 2, although level 2 was indented. In the current show, it doesn't appear as a choice for the second level, and I don't see it as a symbol or picture. It's the
 closed arrow that points to the text. How can I have that as an option? (I've tried on the slide and on the slide master.)

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for replying so quickly.</p>
<p>Mail provider is Microsoft 365 Exchange server.</p>
<p>You pose a good question re: using 64 bit set up.</p>
<p>Since my question, I reinstalled a 32 bit Windows 10 OS and 32 bit MS Office and everything is working as expected.
</p>
<p>It's quite clearly a Windows 10 Edu 64bit OS with Office 64 bit problem on a new clean install system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am very dissipointed with MS support staff. They just understand the problem or didn't want too. I was passed around diffrent departments. I never got a solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now running a 32bit system. what a waste of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank again</p>

<h2>            Locked out of 365 personal account by employer</h2>
                    <p>Hi all hoping someone here can help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I began working for employer I was given an Office 365 small business account. I subsequently opened a personal account with the same credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have left employer and both personal and business accounts have been suspended and I cannot figure out to to access my personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone help advise me on what to do? Also does my employer have access to my personal information held on that account and is there any breach of contract if so by accessing it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

            Hi DB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can deactivate your business Office 365 account on the device and use only your personal account by signing in with it.  See how here:  <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deactivate-an-office-365-install-767e3560-96ed-4b1c-806d-2fe01c529b1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deacti...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Your PHONE MEMORY is probably full.<br />
<br />
Open File Manager and then select Options-&gt; Memory details (or something like that)<br />
<br />
This should tell you how much free memory you have int he Phone Memory.<br />
<br />
To free some Phone memory:<br />
<br />
Uninstall Themes or programs you no longer use.<br />
Delete Messages (sent, received, inbox, drafts, etc)<br />
Open the Browser and select Options Clear Cache and delete the cache.<br />
<br />
You need about 3 MB or more of free Phone Memory to run many of the applications or just do basic stuff.<br />
<br />
IF you can't free up the memory you may need to format the Phone Memory (you will lose all your contacts, messages, programs, themes, etc) enter *#7370# and then 12345

            The only other thing is that you are running out of RAM.<br />
<br />
There are not many ways to free up RAM.<br />
<br />
* Choose the default theme.<br />
<br />
* Ensure that you have not installed any programs that run in the background (like SMS spam blockers, anti-virus, etc.).<br />
<br />
* Don't use a Wallpaper or screensaver.<br />
<br />
* Don't load up images in the Browser, or use the Services browser intead of the other browser (N91 comes with two internet browsers).<br />
<br />
Other than that I can't think of anything else.

            i have not done any additions to the phone<br />
its the way it had come in<br />
everything is still default<br />
how can i run out of RAM then<br />
<br />
how do i get about this problem<br />
it is really annoying....<br />
<br />
all the problems faced from this brand new phone are:<br />
<br />
1. when i mark all the music it shows memory full (the problem above)<br />
2. takes more than a minute in the music player when i have to type in something to search, and if i have to press a key more than once to go to the next letter or something then it just takes the first letter and moves on..<br />
3. the call key does not function at times when i am calling a number by selecting the name in the contact book, have to either restart or type down the number to call it (this happens quite often)<br />
4. the folder in which all my music is does not open through the PC Suite file manager on the computer, so everytime i need to save music on the phone i have to create another folder and i can delete it only through the phone and not the computer....<br />
<br />
Didnt expect a brand new phone to have so many problems....please help<br />

            TIPS:<br />
<br />
- Don't use PC Suite, Use Mass Storage or File Transfer is much faster and more reliable.<br />
<br />
- You may have some data corruption on the hard drive or otherwise in the music database, you may want to delete the
<b>private</b> folder in the hard drive to force the phone to re-create the database.<br />
<br />
- You may want to consider formatting the hard drive and re-load the music using Mass storage instead of PC Suite.<br />
<br />
- About the green key not working always, this may be a problem with the device, but I've never heard about this one...<br />
<br />
Look at the tips here:<br />

<p>In your case, I would like to confirm whether the students have an

<li><span>Regarding the error message you mentioned, could you capture a screenshot?</span></li><li><span>Confirm whether this behavior occurs with all the students you added into that class notebook.</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur with other existing class notebook?

Use the Format Painter</a> it said when you to stop formatting, press ESC. But based on my test on Mac Mojave 10.10.3 on Safari and google browser have different&nbsp;performance. On Safari when I have finished the format painter, whatever I go near the cursor have
 a brush. but on google browser when&nbsp;I have finished the format&nbsp;painter,&nbsp;there is only a cursor.&nbsp;&nbsp;May I know that you said you can't turn it off it means see the brush near the cursor but the OneNote it still work?</p>

<p>Hi Clark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I use OneNote on Safari and like in your first image I get the brush icon next to the cursor but then can't make it go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as you can see in this picture, on the OneNote version I have there is not paragraph spacing option??</p>
<p>

<p>It seem that OneNote online doesn't offer the range of formatting options that the desktop version does. This seems to be a deficiency in the online version so I will be moving away from OneNote online for now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That does not seem to have made any difference.</p>
<p>I can get an arrow at bottom left hand side but it is unstable and sometimes reduces the whole page.</p>
<p>Also if I click on the tool bar at the top I can occasionally get a split screen with the spreadsheet on the RHS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I should be able to reduce the height of the sheet so that it only uses the bottom half of the screen.</p>
<p>I have data on another screen (in photos) that I can use to input data into the speadsheet.</p>
<p>I can do all of thison another computer but not on mine !</p>

<p>I do mean chart size.</p>
<p>If I look at the link you give it suggests using sizing handles&nbsp; they are not there.</p>
<p>It also suggests using the "format "tab -I do not appear to have that either.</p>
<p>I want to resize it so that it takes up the bottom half of the page.</p>
<p>I can do all of this without any problem on another computer at the library but not on mine.</p>
<p>I suspect it is something to do with Excel in Office 365</p>

            Try the online repair, which will reinstall Office.&nbsp; If that does not work it must mean that something else is affecting your Office.

<h2>            Microsoft Teams &#34;Settings&#34; icon missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting to grips with Microsoft Teams,&nbsp; but&nbsp; I can't find a "stings" icon which I think should be available (I need this to&nbsp; change notification settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what a training video suggests I should see (with the "settings" icon highlighted):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c80cacba-c921-44d9-ba4a-da257f6cee34?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c80cacba-c921-44d9-ba4a-da257f6cee34?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is what I actually see:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe30e482-4ecf-4d6e-a43a-3f6e1525f6fa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe30e482-4ecf-4d6e-a43a-3f6e1525f6fa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see a "Settings" icon on either desktop or online Teams .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>We have changed the UI interface recently and the Settings icon was moved to the upper right now. Click your own profile photo on the upper right&gt;Settings&gt;Notifications. See following screenshot:

<p>The 2nd and 3rd reset will definitely rsult in loss of data but as a precaution you should always backup your phone before performing resets as your data may be lost.<br />
<br />
a.) *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default</p>
<p><br />
b.) *#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
c.) 3 finger hard/deep reset. With the phone powered off, depress and hold these three keys simultaneously "*" "3" "green phone" and then power on phone using the on/off button whilst keeping the three keys depressed until you hear start-up tone.</p>

            1. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data)<br />
Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for all operations listed here is 12345<br />
<br />
2. *#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
hard reset - hold the following buttons *, 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding
 all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, GREEN/RED/CAMERA keys pressed all at once on power up. )<br />

<p>In theory it should do all that. However, in practice, I would not recommend restoring the settings because you may end up restoring the bug you were trying to get rid off in the first place. If you are resetting to get rid of a bug the you should only backup
 the bare minimum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do in terms of reset ? Should it be step 1,2, or 3 ? Also when you say just back up what I need ? Do you mean only data and then set up/download apps manually ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry One question , Is Factory Settings option under&nbsp; Settings&gt;General same as step 1 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The 2nd reset should resolve that for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup just personal data, such as your contacts, messages, notes, calender etc. Applications can be installed separately and yes the factory settings is the same as step 1.</p>

<h2>            Retain table formatting and column name changes on data refresh</h2>
                    <p><em>Note: My question is similar in spirit to
</em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/how-do-i-add-formatting-to-a-pivot-tableie-borders/b53bb2a7-86f8-4254-a9fb-5bcd8361be9a"><em>this one</em></a><em>, but I'm not working on a pivot table.
 It's a primary table generated from a SQL connection.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an excel&nbsp;table whose data is generated from an external SQL connection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’d like to format the table nicely by (e.g.):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Changing some column names</p>

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Changing some column widths</p>

<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Applying conditional formatting to the data in the table.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I “refresh all” on the spreadsheet, #3 is retained, but #1 is set to the value from SQL, and #2 is reset to the default column width.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is what I’m trying to do possible?&nbsp; Does it require some amount of indirection to a new table?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 date format after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrispy128  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 date format after Windows update</h2>
                    DEC 19 I updated my Windows 10 and all of my formatting for DATE in Excel 2010 has turned-off. I have my dates in columns A-B formatted as "long date" which should read "December 19, 2017" but now (after the windows update) my dates are showing as 12/19/2017
 - how do I get the dates to go back to showing long date December 19, 2017 rather than 12/19/2017 ??? I already tried changing the date format on the menu bar, and I've tried changing it in region settings, is there something else ?

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the issue happened after <strong>Windows Update</strong>, we advise performing an online repair via
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. Doing so will fix any issues you are experiencing in Excel.&nbsp; Here's the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> where you can find the steps on how to perform an online repair. However, if you would like to use a formula to format the dates in Excel, you can use the
<strong>TEXT function</strong>. You can find the instructions on how to use the TEXT function through this

            Thanks your your reply, however I ended up calling tech support and it took him 45 minutes to correct the error. The problem is with the coding on the short date format. My tech John H, performed multiple fixes over a 45 minute period and discovered that
 the latest windows update had coding which changed the long &amp; short date formats. I suggest you have your programmers take a look at the coding for Excel, in particular the formatting for the Long &amp; Short date formats, because the coding is WRONG. I'm fairly
 certain that if I am complaining about the date format, that thousands of other people will too, get it fixed, the error is within the latest Windows update!<br />

                    <div><i>language preferences</i></div>
I am having problems with the language preferences in word, I have set it to english (AUS) but word keeps turning it back to english (USA) and checking the "Do not check spelling" tab. I have tried to change it in preferences, and saving the NORMAL template,
 but it keeps reverting back to it. Its very frustrating! any advice? Thanks

            What do you mean by "...word keeps turning it back"?<br />
<br />
If you launch Word then in the new blank document go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Tools&gt; Language</span>, what is indicated? That tells you what your <span style="font-weight: bold">
Default Language</span> is set to for <span style="font-style: italic">new</span> documents yo create.<br />
<br />
If what you're actually referring to has to do with existing documents, your Default Language has no bearing on them or on the
<br />
Those are Formatting Attributes of the text in the document. IOW, Word does not arbitrarily change the Language formatting of the documents you open to match the Default Language you use for creating new ones any more than it changes the Bold, font size or
 any other formatting in the document to match those defaults. It <span style="font-style: italic">
recognizes</span> what the content of the document is marked to be.<br />
<br />
If an existing documents [or parts of them] are formatted for the improper language you need to select that content then specify what should be used instead. That can be done on a direct basis or [preferably] by modifying the Styles use to format the text.

            I have gone through the steps you suggested and tried modifying style templates. I have saved and restarted. The default preferences are saved as english AUS, then while editing the document, it stops spellchecking, so I go into TOOLS &gt; LANGUAGE and the
 'do not check spelling' is rechecked and the language has reverted to US.&nbsp;
<div>Thanks for your answer but it hasnt helped.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I have the same problem with UK English. If I go and look at my preferences it says UK English enabled. The 'set as default' option is greyed out. When I start typing 'Labour' or 'favourite' it underlines them in red and suggests I spell them 'Labor' and
 'favorite'. I go back to my language preferences and see that it is still UK English, so WHY is Word giving me US spelling?

</p><p>It seems there might be a problem with the language preferences of your word application. I'll recommend you to delete the word preferences by doing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go &gt; Go to Folder &gt; type ~/Library/ &gt; Preferences &gt; Delete <strong>"com.microsoft.word.plist"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open again your word application&nbsp;and try to set as default English (AUS).</p>

            <p>Jim Gordon suggested a possibility but he didn't tell you how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User have different&nbsp;experience with setting Computer or even application preferences. Some like myself go to preferences at least once a week if no more often to tweak&nbsp;system or application. Some probably have never open system or application preference
 &nbsp;for fear of causing system or app crashing and burning. And Many with in between experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you are using one of the last 4 versions of OSX (OSX.7, 8, 9, 10) her is what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>click on main menu bar a very top of screen.</li><li>Click on the  menu.</li><li>Click On Language &amp; Region.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a9b054c-e553-48dc-8596-0f3dc4db3366" /><br />
</li><li>Set Desired version of your Language<br />
(English-Primary is same as US English) AUS, British, Canadian English, French, French Canadian, etc.)</li><li>Then &nbsp;set Region<br />
(Country you live) USA, Britain, Canada, Australia, France, etc.</li></ol>
<p>If you are living in another Country and and using another language then you would choose the country you live in and language you having to use for your business or schooling.</p>

            <p>I think these will be automatically set as default if <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/983b0d7f-3dcc-43c6-92b0-d357fd15cf79" title="belleborrelle">
 of dictionaries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On that same setting you have to make sure that you select&nbsp;and highlight all the text that you want to have English (AUS) as your preferred language first for changes to be applied (or just simply select all then make the change for the preferred language)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work, you have to remove com.microsoft.word.plist from ~/Library/ &gt; Preferences</p>
