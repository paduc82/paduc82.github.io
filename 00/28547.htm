            While I agree with Doug, you do get one "custom" setting in the gallery. If you use the Page Setup dialog to change the margins to something other than the choices offered, your settings will be included at the top of the Margins Gallery as "Last Custom
 Setting."

<p>Adding to the comments of Doug and Suzanne, many of the galleries really are collections of Building Blocks. Margins is not one of those galleries. In fact, it is not really a Gallery, in that when you hover over a choice, Word does not show you a preview.
 This makes it more of a traditional menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know of no way to add to the selections available. You could, though, save your custom margins as a default. This only would change new documents based on the Normal template, though. Most of my documents are based on custom document
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Templates</a> and already have margins set where I want them for that document.</p>

            <p>The purpose of having a gallery of margin settings (whether or not it is "really" a gallery -- well observed, Brother Kenyon) is that we often want to use two or more margin settings, depending on context.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem with the existing gallery is that it is in imperial measurement.&nbsp; Many of us using metric like to have our margins as, say 2cm, rather than 0.78740157".&nbsp; Our "Last Custom Setting" can be in even metric figures, but we can't toggle between multiple
 metric settings.&nbsp; Which makes Word less functional for metric users than for imperial users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While all of the respondents above came up with useful workarounds, the issue is that Word is not "really" a global product.&nbsp; And Microsoft "really" doesn't care.</p>

<h2>            Indexing issues - always have to re-index and now missing 1 year of emails in search</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise there have been a lot of emails and questions about Microsoft Outlook indexing in the past, but I haven't had much luck with doing the steps mentioned (at least, what I've understood).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use MS Outlook 2010 with my work email, and started doing so in August 2012 (technically, April, but 2 years ago, all emails from April to July 2012 disappeared from my account so I'll say August).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem is that every few weeks, my instant search function suddenly stops working and says that "Outlook is indexing my items." This takes several hours as it seems to construct the index from scratch, but usually works ok after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, yesterday, I had the same issue. It took several hours to rebuild the index. Now, it seems, when I use the search function, it will only find emails from August 2012 to February 2014, and from January 2015 up until now. I'm at a loss to understand
 why it is not giving me emails from March 2014 until December 2014 in my search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scrolled through the emails from the missing period, and they are there in outlook - the only issue is that they are not in the search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and rebuilding my index, but so far this has not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice that can be given for this, as well as any advice to avoid the problem every few weeks of having to re-index everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karan</p>

            <p><span>Hello Karan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to resolve this issue we need some information about the email account type in Outlook 2010. Let us know the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the type of email account configured in Outlook? For example POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange. To check the type of email account configured
 in Outlook 2013 click on <strong>File &gt; Info </strong>&gt;<strong> Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down. EAS account refers to Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com email accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case you are using a POP/SMTP email account then this repeated issue might occur due to a corrupt PST file in Outlook 2010. In order to resolve this issue I would suggest you
 to repair your default PST file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps in the following Microsoft article to repair the PST file.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/272227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/272227</span></span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Before repairing the PST file make sure to make a copy of the PST file and save
 it locally on the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope the above information helps to resolve the issue.

                    <p>I have searched and tried all the suggestions already posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to update from Version 14.0.0 to 14.1.0 and upward.</p>
<p>The Microsoft AutoUpdate bars go all there way across but fails to install the update and a message pops up that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"One or more update packages could not be downloaded. Please try again. These applications were not updated: Microsoft Word Microsoft Outlook &nbsp;Microsoft PowerPoint &nbsp;Microsoft Excel"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling (&lt; with appCleaner) and reinstalling.</p>
<p>I have tried repairing Disk Permissions.</p>
<p>I have run the Microsoft AutoUpdate several times with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On a MacBook Pro 2015 running macOS Sierra 10.12.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Mac:Office 2016 installed from which I run Outlook 2016, Word 2016 and PowerPoint 2016. I hate Excel 2016 and prefer Excel 2011 mainly because of no need to type + when adding between cells in Excel 2011 v Excel 2016 which requires it and my Personal
 Macro Workbook in Excel 2011 enabling keyboard shortcuts. (IMO, Excel 2016 crippled the best features of Excel 2011).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Yahoo Calendar not Linking to Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>I was able to link my Yahoo account to Outlook such that all my Yahoo emails are being delivered to Outlook. &nbsp;However, my Yahoo calendar is not linking to Outlook. &nbsp;When I go into the calendar in Outlook, my Yahoo calendar shows up under "My Calendars",
 but when I click on it, there are no calendar items populated in the calendar in Outlook.</p>
<p>So, my question is, how do I set up Outlook so that all my Yahoo calendar items populate in Outlook??? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I think you need to import your yahoo calendar to an ical file and then import it to the office 365 calendar.</p>
<p>Please see the below link to see instructions to export your calendar as an ical file.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wincalendar.com/help/index.html?setup_yahoo_ical.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wincalendar.com/.../index.html</a></p>
<p>Also see the below article for instructions to import your ical calendar to outlook.</p>

<p>Hi JohnNestor,</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, if we set up our email accounts in the Outlook client via POP/IMAP connection, some features like calendar items and contacts cannot be synced. This may be the cause.</p>
<p>Moreover, to ensure you get the expert assistance, I suggest you post in our Outlook client forum since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online services. Here is the Outlook client forum link:</p>

<h2>            outlook.com go back to live.com</h2>
                    <p>help my windows phone is messed up now. I accepted the free offer to migrate to the new outlook.com online email service from microsoft.&nbsp; My windows 7 phone is set yup on the original live.com address and requires that address be functional, it has all of
 my purchase history, find my phone and other stuff. </p>
<p>I need to reverse the migration to outlook.com as it has now screwed up my phone. I can do a factory reset on the phone and add the new address as the main address but that will still lose my purchase history. It amounts to many many many albums of music
 bought through Zune using my live.com account</p>

<p><br />
I setup the Outlook.com account but chose to set it up and did not link it to my Live account although&nbsp; I expect I will at some time in the future. My understanding is that doing what you did will bring all your information over BUT even though I have not made
 the change, my understanding is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Outlook.com provides a "<b>warning</b>" during the rename procedure, which is:
<i>You might not want to rename an address if you've used it to set up a Windows Phone. On your phone, features that use this address will stop working, including Marketplace, Xbox LIVE, SkyDrive, email, and others. To use these features again on your phone,
 you'd need to restore it to factory settings, which erases all personal content.</i></span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>If a user does choose to rename an account that is linked to Windows Phone, they'll want to follow these articles:</span><span>
</span>
<ul>

</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><span>To manually reconfigure "mail" to sync, the work around is that after the user signs in with the @outlook.com address is that they can go to Settings &gt; Email+Accounts, tap the account and tap to enable "mail" under content to sync. Mail for their
 Outlook.com account will now sync.</span> </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps Phil.</p>

 problems with but I want the app)<br />
Yes, the app updated this morning.

<p>
</p><p>After getting nothing useful on here I rolled back my build of Windows 10 to the last public release and it worked for a while but it's happened again so I have 2 theories as to what causes it:</p>
<p>The current build for slow release previews (15063.413) which is what it happened with when I was on the fast release. In which case it'd be a case of hoping another build fixes it.</p>
<p>Or it's when you work in offline mode and move to online (which I was doing at the time of it stopping working this time.)</p>

<h2>            Cannot get Mail Merge to merge correctly on template &#35;8160</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an HP computer; Windows 10; Microsoft Word (current version).</p>
<p>I am having trouble with mail merge (which never happened before because I've previously had no issues).</p>
<p>Bought the Avery Address Labels-Template #8160 (used to be #5160).</p>
<p>Created the database and clicked "Create Mail Merge". When the window pops up asking if you want to use a letter, labels, etc., I chose "labels".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scrolled down the list to find "8160" and it is not on there, and neither is #5160 (it used to be).</p>
<p>So, I downloaded the template #8160 from the Avery website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started the mail merge by manually adding each address block (i.e. #1; #2; #3, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I put in address block #2, it changed address block #1 (in the first label) to the name and address of person #2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I DID hit the arrow, when choosing which person, and clicked it to #2..etc, before hitting ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to help me? Or, how I can use template #8160 normally?</p>
<p>Thank you so much,</p>
<p>Wendy</p>

<p>For one thing, the 5160 and 8160 product numbers are in Word in Office 365, as they have been for more than a decade. The "trick" is that the list of numbers is in "alphabetic" order rather than "numeric" order -- all the numbers that start with the same
 digit are grouped together regardless of how many digits there are.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bb65f2f-fe5d-42ac-8ea3-528e06a973b5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bb65f2f-fe5d-42ac-8ea3-528e06a973b5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With either Word's 8160 label or the Avery template you downloaded, you need to change the way you're inserting address blocks.
<strong>Don't </strong>manually add another address block in the next cell after the first one. Just insert the address block in the first cell, and then click the Update Labels button:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6514d772-01cb-4671-8076-1c602dcc404c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6514d772-01cb-4671-8076-1c602dcc404c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That will add the&nbsp;«AddressBlock» merge field to all the other cells. If you want to see what the merged labels will look like before starting the actual merge, click the Preview Results button. Be sure to turn the preview OFF before you click the Finish
 &amp; Merge button.</p>

<p>When you select Labels from the Start Mail Merge dropdown and the Label Options dialog appears, make sure that the Page Printers radio button is selected and that you have Avery US Letter selected from the Label vendors dropdown.&nbsp; Then you WILL find the
 5160 Address Labels </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a002bf5a-337d-441d-9281-7f84867115ad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a002bf5a-337d-441d-9281-7f84867115ad?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and also the 8160 if you scroll further down the list</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a998f1b-2188-49ee-ab5c-db86a042e988?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a998f1b-2188-49ee-ab5c-db86a042e988?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While it does not matter which one you use, it will be easier to use either of them than the template that you obtained from Avery as it will not be setup with the necessary «Next Record» fields in all of the labels on the sheet EXCEPT for the first label.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If on the other hand, you want to continue with the document that you have, you will need to insert the «Next Record» fields from the Rules dropdown in the Write &amp; Insert Fields section of the Mailings tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, once you have set up the necessary merge fields in the first label on the sheet, you can use the Update Labels button to replicate that setup to the other labels on the sheet.</p>

<p>Some common reasons why Outlook will not shut down completely when you click either the X or Exit:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; PDA synchronization software with your PDA in the cradle. (activesync,<br />
iTunes, etc.)<br />
2.&nbsp; WinFax Pro (especially 10.02 in Outlook 2003) - contact their support <br />
for an alleged fix.<br />
3.&nbsp; COM Add-ins.<br />
4.&nbsp; Mail reminder add-ins that keep a stub of Outlook open in the background<br />
to check for new mail and fire reminders.<br />
5.&nbsp; Anti-virus/firewall programs that are set to scan incoming and outgoing mail (always disable email scanning).<br />
6.&nbsp; Skype<br />
7.&nbsp; Infuzer<br />
8.&nbsp; Google calendar synch.</p>
<p>Disable all COM addins and remove the integration with your firewall and AV.</p>
<p>Open Outlook in Safe mode and start/stop Outlook every time after adding <br />
back in your add-ins one by one.&nbsp; The first one you have enabled and the <br />
error message occurs again, you know what to do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i had configured my cpanel imap account to outlook 2016, until our cpanel server ip is changed. it is because of a hardware upgrade by the provider.</p>
<p>only ip is changed. all other settings remain 100% same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now after this upgrade, outlook is not connecting to providers imap account. it shows :</p>
<p>"We couldn't connect to the incoming (IMAP) server using the specified encryption method."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Task 'Synchronizing subscribed folders for&nbsp;</span>khan@****<span>.' reported error (0x800CCC0E) : 'Outlook cannot synchronize subscribed folders for&nbsp;</span>khan@****<span>.

<p>
</p><p>we tried all the options (with ssl, without ssl, auto etc.). no luck. also tried pop. same problem.</p>

<p>Hi FazihuzzamaanRasheed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to some conflicts the server or Internet connection settings. Could you clarify if you already tried contacting your

<p>Did anyone else have this page address replace your home page address in IE options on IE-10? This happened Thursday 4/4 and no one could get their home pages to come up, and after replacing it with msn.com several times, it would replace msn.com again with
 this address. </p>
<p>Then Friday morning, all was well again.&nbsp; Affected several of us in 2 different counties.&nbsp; Comcast says must be an issue with IE. Am using Win 7 64bit, but happened to several using 32 bit also.&nbsp; It replaced the IE options address no matter what browser
 page was entered, ie: Google.com, Yahoo.com etc.&nbsp; Today, I replaced my msn.com with the above address and it brings up msn.com but with no&nbsp; http(S) .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

That's probably Ok.&nbsp; E.g. it logged you in and then redirected as you specified (with your ru= parameter.)

    <title>PowerPoint 2013 Music not playing through slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetbradsher  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2013 Music not playing through slides</h2>
                    <p>Before posting this, I google'd all the ways that this problem could be resolved and followed each one with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a 40 slide PowerPoint collage for my aunt's memorial service yesterday and I have picked out 4 songs to play in the background while the slides went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the Transitions tab and made sure all of the slides were not hidden and I also put a duration time of 20 seconds per slide giving me the idea of which slide to introduce each new song.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started simple with the first song which would have played through 12 slides. I did the Insert, Audio, selected the MP3 song I had downloaded, and checked play in the background, play through all of the slides, made sure all of the slides was selected
 - I followed all of the rules and tips given, and at the most, my song would play through slides 1 and 2 and then the slide show would stop while the song still played. Sometimes, it would only stay on slide 1 and not go any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I distribute this memorial collage to the children and grandchildren, I would like to incorporate the music into it so it is complete for them. I can send over the file if it sill help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this isn't my first time with PowerPoint. I did a collage for my uncle's memorial back in 2009 and did the exact same thing and was able to incorporate 3 songs with the slide show and it worked great - no issues of any kind at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Glenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your second question is Yes, did all of that. The answer to your first question is No and it is not allowing me because it is all grayed out. In fact, everything is grayed out on the Animation Pane except for "Reorder Animation".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had wanted the animation to fade or do something interesting like old PowerPoint used to but I spent so much time trying to get the music thing fixed and failed, that I was not able to do animations of any kind so it was a boring page by page presentation.

    <title>Excel &#61;COUNTIFS function problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenmb1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel &#61;COUNTIFS function problem.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using the '=COUNTIFS' function on excel, and the formula seems ok but it's not giving me the right answer, I know there is two rows with the details I asked, but it came back with 0 for some reason.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The formula is as follows </p>
<p>=COUNTIFS(Quarter,"Q1",FinancialYear,"2012/13",AA5:AA19,"'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$A$25",AC5:AC19,"'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$33,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$37,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$38")&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have asked it to do is analyze four columns of information and tell me how many rows fit all four criteria, but something isn't wotking properly within the formula, please can somebody have a look at it and help me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

=COUNTIFS(Quarter,"Q1",FinancialYear,"2012/13",AA5:AA19,<br />

"'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$33,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$37,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$38")
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
First, you have too many double-quotes.&nbsp; If want to count when each of AA5:AA19 matches the value in $A$25 of worksheet 'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1', do not put double-quotes around the latter cell reference.&nbsp; The correct syntax is:<br />
<br />
=COUNTIFS(Quarter,"Q1", FinancialYear,"2012/13",<br />
AA5:AA19,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$A$25, ...)<br />
<br />
where "..." is the rest of the COUNTIFS parameter list.<br />
<br />
Second, something is missing or garbled after that.&nbsp; After you remove the incorrect use of double-quotes, the following syntax is
<br />
=COUNTIFS(..., AC5:AC19,<br />
'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$33,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$37,'Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$38)
<br />
<br />
It is unclear what your intention is.&nbsp; I suspect you want to count when each of AC5:AC19 matches
<br />
If that is the case, you cannot use one COUNTIFS expression to do that.&nbsp; Instead, you might use the following SUMPRODUCT expression:<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT(--(Quarter="Q1"), --(FinancialYear="2012/13"),<br />
--(AA5:AA19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$A$25),<br />
--((AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$33)<br />
+(AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$37)<br />
+(AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$38)&gt;0)) <br />
<br />
Caveat:&nbsp; Beware of minor syntax errors on my part.&nbsp; I have not actually entered that expression into Excel.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; The double negative converts TRUE and FALSE to 1 and 0 respectively, which SUMPRODUCT requires in order for the expression to work as intended.<br />
<br />
any</span> arithmetic operation converts TRUE and FALSE to 1 and 0, which is why (AC5:AC19=...$B$33)+(AC5:AC19=...$B$37)+(AC5:AC19=...$B$38) works as intended, returning 1 or more if one or more conditions are true.

<div>If you are receiving #VALUE! errors with the above, try this alternative method of converting
<i>boolean</i>&nbsp;TRUE and FALSE to <i>1</i>&nbsp;and <i>0</i>,<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT((Quarter="Q1")*(FinancialYear="2012/13")*(AA5:AA19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$A$25)*((AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$33)+(AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$37)+(AC5:AC19='Data for D.D.Menus for Page 1'!$B$38)&gt;0))<br />
<br />
The <i>double unary</i>&nbsp;(i.e. <i>double minus</i>&nbsp;or --) method was choking on the named ranges for me when one was a single cell and the other was 15 rows high. Multiplying the TRUE × TRUE and TRUE × FALSE seems to convert them to
<i>1 × 1</i>&nbsp;and <i>1 × 0</i>&nbsp;properly.</div>

<h2>            the program used to create this object is excel... that program is not installed...</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running Office 2016 Professional Plus MSO (16.0.4549,1000) 32-bit in our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having a strange problem with Word and embedded excel objects. &nbsp;We have the same issue on all machines that are running Windows 10 and office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A document we use has an embedded excel object in it. &nbsp;When I open the document and double click on the object i get the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29df1905-2fef-49ae-97ad-35bf6fd8f7cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/29df1905-2fef-49ae-97ad-35bf6fd8f7cc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading online and through these forums and checked literally everything i can see. &nbsp;I've tried removal, reinstall, repair.. opening word in safe mode. &nbsp;Un-ticking all add-ons etc and the same error occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried opening as admin, and logging into the machine with a new profile too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test i created a new document and inserted an excel object (it worked fine), i also added some items to the excel and some formulas which worked fine too. &nbsp;when i save, close and reopen the document i get the same error message as above. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested this same procedure in another environment, windows 10 and same office version and the document works every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this or had any luck fixing it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            It's a long shot, but make sure that Excel is not set to ignore other applications. This setting is at
<strong>File | Options | Advanced: General</strong> and should affect only DDE and not OLE, but who knows?

            I was able to fix this issue on a windows 10 machine when it wasn't the addin issue. If you go into Apps &amp; features in settings. Look for "My office" and uninstall it. That resolved the issue for me.

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade not available to install in Upgrade Advisor for Lumia 830&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I purchased the Lumia 830 with Windows 8.1 over a year ago (January 2016) and told at the time that Windows 10 would be available soon to download. I recently decided to upgrade to Windows 10 as there are a number of Apps I need to use which required
 Windows 10. I installed the Upgrade Advisor and ran it but it comes up that Windows 10 is not yet available for my phone at the moment. Looking on the web I have seen numerous posts which state that Windows 10 is available&nbsp;to download for the Lumia 830 for
 some time now. I am based in Ireland and know other people who were able to download it months ago without issue, also my network provider has stated that it should be available and to contact Microsoft Windows team. Is there a reason why this would not be
 available or is there another way to upgrade to Windows 10?

<p>
</p><p>you need to <strong>turn off </strong>any data access (turn flight mode on) before you start upgrade advisor.</p>
<p>Lets search for win10 update in upgrade advisor and you will be able to enable Windows 10 update...</p>

<h2>            Pivot table, Field Value Settings&#39; &#34;Show values as&#34; &#37;Of &#35;N&#47;A error</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;table of project timesheet entries with date, hours, and person name amongst other columns. I've created a pivot table from this which displays the total weekly worked project time for each person&nbsp;for each week. What I actually want is not the total
 but the percentage the total is of the standard working week 37.5 hours. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this I clicked in one of the data cells and altered the Field Value Settings' "Show values as" setting to "%Of" a base field and base item in the original table with the value 37.5. I've checked the MS help file and this should give me the sum of hours
 for each person for each week as a percentage of 37.5. What I get is #N/A. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was a one-off I'd create another table based on the first but I'll need this every week and so want a pivot table that will grow with time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any body know how to get round this problem? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok thanks, So&nbsp;the file you sent&nbsp;has a workaround where the %age is worked out for each entry individually in a new column in the first table and then added up in the Pivot table. It works I was hoping to do it directly using the Show values as, which doesn't
 seem to work as it should.</p>

<h2>            Valid emails being sent to junk even when told not to</h2>
                    
<p>We have emails from one specific organization that keep getting moved to the user's junk mail folder, even though we have a rule setup in the Exchange Admin to bypass spam filtering for this domain. &nbsp;You can see in the header below that the&nbsp;X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL
 is set to -1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this domain has been added as a safe sender on the Outlook client side. &nbsp;It is not listed in blocked senders. &nbsp;There are no client side rules either. &nbsp;But even still, these emails keep getting moved to the junk folder. &nbsp;We move them to the inbox, just
 to have them move back to the junk folder within minutes.</p>
<p>What is causing this? &nbsp;Why is our 'safe-sender' setup being ignored?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>I need some information to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>1.Are the emails move to junk email folder both in OWA (Outlook Web App) and the Outlook client?</p>
<p>2.Are emails move to junk folder if users in the specific organization send emails to other organization or other types email accounts?</p>
<p>3.Have you checked message trace result in Exchange admin center-&gt;mail flow-&gt;message trace? Please send us the message trace results.</p>
<p>Besides that, please check if the specific organization have been added to the spam filter block list. To check that: Login to Exchange admin center-&gt;protection-&gt;spam filter-&gt;double click the default one or you created-&gt;block list</p>
<p>I have sent you a private to collect the message trace results. To access it:</p>
<p>1.Go to “Your details” section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2.Click Private messages.</p>
<p>3.Click the subject title (request information) of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hi bob,</p>
<p>i understand that the emails from 1 specific organization keep going to the user’s junk mail folder even though you have set up a rule to bypass the spam filtering for this domain.</p>
<p>to narrow down the root cause of the issue further, i’d like to confirm some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;by saying “we have emails from one specific organization that keep getting moved to the user's junk mail folder”, do you mean that only a single user in your organization encounter the issue? how about other users in your organization? did the messages sent
 from the specific organization go to their junk email folder?<br />
2.&nbsp;regarding “this domain has been added as a safe sender on the outlook client side”, did you add the domain as a safe sender in the owa (outlook web app) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/owa)</a> and the allow list under
 “spam filter” in the eac (exchange admin center) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp)?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/ecp)</a> to check it, please go to
<strong>eac</strong>-&gt;<strong>protection</strong>-&gt;<strong>spam</strong> <strong>
filter</strong>-&gt;<strong>default</strong>-&gt;<strong>allow list</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b931a598-333b-46d8-bd35-f639d9c0e713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db931a598-333b-46d8-bd35-f639d9c0e713" /></a><br />
3.&nbsp;did all the messages sent from the specific organization go to the junk email folder or only part of them?<br />
4.&nbsp;can you receive emails from other organizations normally? can users in other organizations or other types of email accounts receive emails from the specific organization correctly?</p>
<p>your time and continued efforts are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
mouran</p>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>#1 - The outside organization only sends to this one user. &nbsp;I have requested that they send me a test email to my GMail account.
</p>
<p>#2 - Yes, and yes. &nbsp;The domain has already been added to both the OWA Safe Sender list and the EAC Allow list.</p>
<p>#3 - All emails from that domain are being sent to junk.</p>
<p>#4 - We are able to receive all other emails normally, it's just this one domain. &nbsp;I do not know if the outside organization is having trouble sending to other domains - we have asked but haven't received an answer yet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much assistance we will get with this problem from the outside organization - I have no influence with them.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that we keep moving these emails from junk into the inbox, and they keep automatically moving back to junk.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Bob</p>

<p>Hi Bob, </p>
<p>I notice that you have requested the outside organization to send an email to your Gmail account, can you receive it?</p>
<p>Also, you haven’t received an answer from the organization telling you that whether they have trouble sending emails to other domains. Please post back once you have an answer so that we can continue to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts.</p>

<p>The outside org did send answer our requests - they sent a test email to my GMail account which I received just fine in my Inbox. &nbsp;They also said that they have not had any problems sending to anyone else.</p>
<p>One thing we tried was to completely turn off junk mail filtering for my user - I turned in off in OWA and then ensured it was also off in the Outlook client. &nbsp;After turning off junk mail filtering, we then moved the emails in question back to the inbox
 - but they STILL moved back to junk automatically. &nbsp;I have triple-checked his blocked senders list, and this orgs domain is NOT listed.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there is some junk still going to his junk email folder, even though we've turned off the junk mail filter.</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>Since the specific organization has no problems sending emails to other kinds of emails accounts and other users in your organization can receive emails fine from the organization, it means the root cause of the issue is related to the specific user.</p>
<p>Also, I’d like to know if the issue “moving emails from junk into the inbox, and they keep automatically moving back to junk” happened in Outlook client only, OWA (Outlook Web App) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/owa)</a>
 only or both Outlook client and OWA. If this issue happened only in the Outlook client, you may refer to the following article to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2885002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../2885002</a></p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please let me know when you have time.</p>

<p>I just confirmed that this issue does continue in OWA with the Outlook client closed.</p>
<p>I do plan on upgrading this user from Outlook 2013 to 2016 in the near future, but it appears that is not the problem.</p>
<p>The user does access this mailbox via their iPhone - is it possible that the phone is what's causing the issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How synch works wirelessley</h2>
                    
<p>HI There</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know or have an explanation as to how active synch works over the air?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to know as much information as possible, this is what I have so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>The software is set to synch as items arrive</div>
</li><li>
<div>As I am aware this means the device/software contiunally asks the server for any updates. Does anyone know how often the software does this?</div>
</li><li>
<div>I am presuming it only does this one way i.e Device asks phone for updates not the other way round</div>
</li></ol>
<p>If anyone knows where there is a flowchart explaining this that would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards </p>
