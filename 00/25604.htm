    <title>weird activity with the SMS alert about outlook account being hacked - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            weird activity with the SMS alert about outlook account being hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received 4 sms for 4 of my accounts on outlook. The subject was that someone was trying to get accessed to my account.
</p>
<p>The 4 smses didn't come through at once but one by one with some time between them.</p>
<p>So I changed all the security options (password, QR code, ...). </p>
<p>I then checked the recent activity but there was no activity besides mine recently(couples hours). So I checked from further in the timeline and I've seen this:
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f585f61-b721-453f-9b85-3622dd459160?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f585f61-b721-453f-9b85-3622dd459160?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>belgium that's normal. </p>
<p>What I can say is that I have no proofs of having been hacked. The time of 12:35 is corresponding of the time that I upgraded my routers.
</p>
<p>Another fact is that one of my host has a whonix VM linked to TOR network, so my interpretation is that since the principal internet link didn't work, it tried the whonix link and maybe that's the UK ip.
</p>
<p>Are the localisation accurate? how does it work? because if I use another website to localise 185.220 it's in finland and it's a tor exit node.
</p>
<p>In the mean time I don't understand the india location.&nbsp; Does the iphone use the IMAP protocol with the outlook ios app?&nbsp; would outlook for pc use imap too ? is there any other software using imap besides thunderbird? The mail app from windows 10 for example?
 would that be a trace of hack?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I don't understand the SMS, why have them been sent today in place of yesterday? Or was the sms sent because of something else? As I said there is no other strange activity today.
</p>

            Dear vigilian,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />If you are using TOR, VPN or Proxy it can trigger system to sent alert messages since system checks also IP from which you are using to login to your Microsoft account and if he will find it odd , system might block access to Microsoft Account.
<br />First of all I would suggest changing your passwords to more secure <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026406/microsoft-account-how-to-create-a-strong-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402640...</a>
<br />and afterward contact Microsoft Account Support for them to check the account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a>
<br />Also please do not share your account and password, pay attention to suspicious emails and do not access links there <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />You can also find this article useful <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/my-outlook-com-account-has-been-hacked-35993ac5-ac2f-494e-aacb-5232dda453d8?omkt=en-001&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-001&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/my-out...</a>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it does not answer to my different questions. as I said I did change all that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as you can imagine from my description every security options are activated and managed. and my passwords are between 45 and 64 char including symbols at all time. So no need to remind me about that, I'm using passwords managers for a long time now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can imagine I did not share either. My questions were pretty much more specific than just guidelines. I wanted to know why a 24 hour delay, which kind of app could use IMAP etc.
</p>
<p>Please read the questions carefully and and not doing a superficial answer, </p>
<p>thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: by the way I'm pretty sure that contact agent won't be any help because they don't have really the interface to know which informations have been accessed etc.

            Dear vigilian,
<br />In order to answer your questions about 24H delay and which kind of app could use IMAP and etc. I suggested contacting Microsoft Account support as they have the means and tools to actually check this (as I know from my experience, they were able to check all IP's and devices that were used for sign-in). Additionally, I can imagine but I cannot assume that you are familiar with all the articles and all the information. I am sorry if you felt yourself offended, but I am just trying to help. If you want me to stop, just let me know.
<br />If you want to fully secure your Microsoft Accounts (and make it almost impossible for anyone to hack them), you can do the following:
<br />1. Login to your Microsoft Account and create alias <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/microsoft-account-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/...</a>
<br />2. Make that alias primary
<br />3. Go to sign-n preferences and disable login to your account from previous account and leave access only by alias
<br />After this whenever someone will try to login with the account he will be receiving error and will not be able to login in. But please remember that it will be applicable for everyone, including yourself, so please try not forget the new primary alias. Please remember not to delete the previous primary alias, as if you will delete it you will lose your inbox and you will not be able to receive emails.
<br />I am sure that you are familiar with this article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a> and here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/microsoft-account-help-protect-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12410/...</a> and this one as well <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026473/microsoft-account-how-to-add-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402647...</a> and with compromised account <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10494/...</a>
<br />Also please do not share your account (new alias) and password, pay attention to suspicious emails and do not access links there <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />Hope this answers your question and will help secure your account.

<p>okey good to know about the fact that Agents can have access to those kind of details.</p>
<p>I contacted them, will see if they answer it during the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your case about the alias option would be only if it gets the address from somewhere else than a wireshark capture or a malware on one of my host right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you don't know which king of connection is between the sync connection kind and connection kind?</p>

            Dear vigilian, 
<br />In case with aliases, until someone will find out the actual login (by all means possible), they will not be able to even try to get into the account. If you will forget new login, you will also be unable to login.
<br />As for connections and kind of connections - I do not know the answer. You may try to ask this question in TechNet <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/ms376608.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/ms376608.as...</a>
<br />Hope this helps.

<p>well, unless they wireshark somehow one of my host or phone, then they'll get my login information. OR through a malware on one of my host. If they have been an hack I don't see which different way they would have acquired my application password or the
 master password + the qr code to generate one time password that I've set up previously. So they could exactly do the same for the alias.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyway, do you know or does anyone know here if the microsoft customer support repond to "reply to" messages? Because I didn't get any news from them yet since their first message so I'm wondering if I need to do a second resquest of support?

<h2>            Word 2010 - Show hidden text by default in specific document</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am creating templates in Word 2010 (and 2003) and I have to insert instructions in hidden text format. This hidden text has to be displayed by default by anyone who opens&nbsp;the document so that they get the information on how to fill out the document, regardless
 of their settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this be done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You can do it with a macro, but there is no way that you can force users to run the macro, as that would open the door to no end of malicious code. Given that the default for hidden text is not to display it, you have a bit of a dilemma.
<br />
<br />
Rather than alter the users display options, I suppose you could toggle the display of hidden text by creating a paragraph (or character) style - call it 'Hidden' and apply it to the text to be hidden as a appropriate. I would also add a distinctive text colour
 to that style to differentiate it from the required text. Then use the following macro to toggle the display of that style<br />
<br />
Sub ToggleHidden()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveDocument.Styles("Hidden")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Font.Hidden = Not .Font.Hidden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
You would still have to indicate to users they could hide the coloured text by running the macro.<br />
<br />
Better still I would choose another method of displaying user instructions. You could use content controls or a userform, both of which can contain information on how to fill them - the former without the need for macros.<br />

            <p>Thank you Graham! I'm going to look at a macro for the time being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I am curious about using content controls so I looked into it. I inserted a
<strong>Rich Text Content Control</strong> where&nbsp;I pasted my instructions. The only problem I can see is that this control is printed and can be seen in a print preview. Is there a way around that? Ultimately, I would like my users to see my instructions (on
 how to fill in the template) but then to not print them when the document is final. Is this possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot use a form as users will have to add things to the document, whether it's text or tables and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can find a better way of creating these documents without having the users use macros and whatnot, it would be so much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            Try changing the date on your phone to December 3rd 2017. If you then get a different error - 805a01f4, this usually indicates temporary problems with the store. Hopefully they are working to fix the certificate error 80070020 which affected hundreds of
 users. You need to wait for a few hours.<br />

<p>Hello Toscan Nicola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be either software or hardware issue. Is your Lumia 930 running Windows 10 Mobile or Windows Phone 8.1? Also, are there any recent changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, check if your device has a new software update available. For Windows 10 Mobile, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Phone update
</strong>and tap <strong>Check for updates</strong>. For Windows Phone 8, go to <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update </strong>and tap <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no new software update available, it's better that you bring your device to our partner at
<a href="https://support.b2x.com/bring-device/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>B2X</strong></a> to have it thoroughly checked since you've already performed soft &amp; hard reset, and tried using the Windows Device Recovery Tool to recover your phone software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're here if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>Anyone have the issue that once they installed XP service pack 3 ActiveSync stops working? It's the only change to my computer and phone (that I can think of), and now ActiveSync does not recognize my phone (Samsung
 i760).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <span>OK I have exactly the same problem. After installing SP3 the active sync stop working. The mobile device found and the network connection was established but I can not sync.<br />
<br />
The device get IP address 162.254.2.2.<br />
<br />
I have already tried every possible solution and nothing works.<br />
<br />
When a uninstalled the SP3 everything was OK. Then I installed again and by mistake I did it twice and now I can not uninstall it. So I think that there is an issue with SP3 and active sync at least for some devices.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution either unistalling SP3 EventID error 4325 and file not found. Or better a solution with SP3 and active sync.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <span>To support why I believe that this dehaivor is because of the SP3 installation.<br />
<br />
1. I have uninstalled ZoneAlarm and run the PC without firewall (windows shut down). I have remove Active Sync 4.5 reboot and then installed again Active sync 4.5 reboot but still no sync with the WM5 device.
<br />
2. I have tried the hotfix from MS about the DNS KB951830 without difference.<br />
3. I can not disable the Advance Features in WM5 because there is not such an option.<br />
4. I have changed every possible combination on TCP/IP settings (manual IP address, DNS, WINS etc) again nothing.<br />
<br />
I am going to research I bit more because I did not need the PDA for now.<br />
<br />
My last effort would be Windows XP repair but my CD is without Service pack so there is a lot of work for me and I would like the SP3 installed.<br />
<br />
Finally if I am right about the cause of the problem be SP3 this would be a major BUGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; because is between 3 MS product SP3-Active Sync-Windows Mobile 5.0.<br />
I think that they must fix this ASAP.<br />

            Try renaming your device. Then reboot and connect again. Let me know if this helps.

            <span>No renaming the device does not work.<br />
<br />
To add more information I can ping the device successfully.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the problem might be NAP (Network Access Protection). Does anyone have any suggestion about. I would look it up and post again.<br />
<br />
The reasons I suspect NAP are:<br />
<br />
1. Is the only feature from SP3 that can block network traffic.<br />
2. The mobile device is connected and trying to exchange packets with the PC but something block them and it is not the firewall.<br />
3. Also I can not except incomings connections from torrents. That means that there is not active sync problem but&nbsp; TCP/IP problem<br />
<br />
I have tried with all other network connections disabled and did not work.<br />

 any problems.</p>

            <span>Here is the first good news since I have installed the SP3.<br />
<br />
I can connect and sync with mobile device through IR without changing anything which is not surprise for me.<br />
Still I can not connect with USB but now&nbsp; I can wait for a solution. I will try to find out why and post again. If I tried with USB connected to sync through IR no sync.<br />
<br />
My advice to anyone is uninstall SP3 if you need the sync NOW.<br />
Use Bluetooth or IR as an alternative until a solution comes up from MS.<br />
<br />
It is SP3 BUG so there will be a solution.<br />

<br />
The connection with Bluetooth or IR try them with no usb cable connected and use your Windows Mobile option connect through IR or Bluetooth for sync.<br />

<p>I had the same problem, and also the device manager would not display anything.&nbsp; I call Microsoft and they told me it was a problem if Norton was installed.&nbsp; I corupted some register entries.&nbsp; First the gave me a
 link to a file to fix the register, and I was told to uninstall and reinstall the Norton products.&nbsp; Doing what they suggested worked.&nbsp; Good Luck.</p>

1. I do not use Norton I use ZoneAlarm.<br />
2. Reading about Norton I have tried with ZoneAlarm uninstalled and it did not worked.<br />
3.I had installed the hotfix and did not helped. <br />
4. I can see the device in the device manager (deleted reboot reconnect etc).<br />
5. I also get Local Area Connection # is connected when exploring from PC the network connections<br />

            What model IPAQ do you have?<br />
What OS is running on your computer? Vista? XP?<br />
What version of ActiveSync are you using?<br />
What version of Outlook are you running on your computer?<br />
What is the exact message you receive when you attempt to sync?<br />

<h2>            Count a number of incidents that are open using the date they are opened and closed</h2>
                    <p>I am tracking and reporting on the number of incidents that are open each month.</p>
<p>Some issues are open in more than one month before they close, and are counted for each month they are open [but only as the same issue]</p>
<p>In the table below, each item shows a start and end date.</p>
<p>For example, issue 1 was only open during Jan 2013, so it counts as 1 open issue in Jan. Issue 2 was opened in Jan 2013, but did not close until Feb 2013, so it counts as an open issue for both Jan and Feb.</p>
<p>I need to be able to count total open issues for the entire year, monthly, by date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;I am not even sure if I am asking my question the right way.</p>

<p><span>Hi Arie123,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to create a registry key for Page setup orientation in Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to print in Landscape?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, to print in Landscape in Internet Explorer you have to manually navigate to File and select Page Setup and select Landscape.<span>&nbsp;</span>There
 is no longer a registry key that can manually set the orientation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are trying to change the print settings to landscape or Potrait, you may also consider changing the print orientation settings
 through the Printer’s preferences. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also contact the printer manufacturer to check how to change the print orientation through Printer’s preference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to turn off read only protective mode</h2>
                    
<p>We open word docs from our intranet but they open&nbsp;in read only compatability mode.&nbsp; Despite going to the trust centre and deselcting all the options in the Protected Views section the docs still open as read only.&nbsp; I have also added the intranet site as
 a trusted&nbsp;location in the trust centre but still the docs open as read only.</p>
<p>How can I turn this off?</p>

            <div>Compatibility mode simply means that the documents have been saved in Word 97-2003 format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As far as read only is concerned, the cause might be an access rights setting with Windows. Or are you saying that the problem is specific to Word files and that it doesn't happen with, say, Excel spreadsheets?</div>

<p>Stefan,</p>
<p>They come up as read only as they are from an untrusted source, ie our intranet.&nbsp; If I add our intranet site to the trusted locations it makes no difference they still come up as read only.&nbsp; Save the doc to the desktop and it opens as a usual editable document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no excel sheets on the intranet but I guess they would behave the same.&nbsp; So how can I get Word to open these docs on the intranet so that they are not read only?</p>
<p>On their old XP office 2002 platform the users would open these up as editable files no problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<div>Thanks for the contact. &nbsp;I have Office 365. &nbsp;I purchased the computer from Best Buy in 2014 and paid them to install my Office program.
<div>I use Word and Xcel very limited. &nbsp;I was going along and had no problems. &nbsp;After being reminded that I should download Microsoft 10,</div>
<div>I finely did about two weeks ago and shortly after received notice that my Office program was expiring and I needed to re purchase</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best Buy was working on my computer (late last year) and said I lost my Office program and needed to purchase a new one. &nbsp;I said no and search my&nbsp;<span>computer and found my Office
 documents and brought them up and did an update. &nbsp;Since I bought my computer from</span></div>
<div><span>Best Buy, I did not have the Office disc, nor did I have a number for the program.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>After downloading Microsoft 10 I started getting notices that my Office program has expired. &nbsp;I would gladly let you take back Microsoft 10 if I could have my office program
 back.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I admit that since I am 77 years old, I am not real computer savy, but that should not be held against me.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks for your response, and please help me</span></div>

            <p>I have reverted to Office 2013 which I am happy with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft feel they have to Terrorize older people (I am 77 years old) by shutting down part of the&nbsp;</p>
<p>computer and demanding that we pay for something we don't want or need. &nbsp;If I did upgrade it was because Microsoft sent out an upgrade, it was never explained at that time that I would accept a payment or you would shut down part of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be reasonable , we are not all Geeks with unlimited funds to spend on the latest thing. At your first alert</p>
<p>that you wanted payment for an upgrade, why not offer me to keep what I had and let me alone.</p>

 another folder named "Personal Folder" I can see all my backup data but I lost all my rules and new mail is not getting into this folder. I located the main folder (one of the Archive folders) where new mail is entering and renamed it. How can I reload my
 old rules (dragging sub-folders to this folder is not doing it) or – how can I make the Personal folder to be the default main one? And last, how to delete the unnecessary archive folders (right click + Del, the folder is still there…) thanks for your help!

<p>You've probably done a good job of damaging your mail profile.&nbsp; There's no need to import a PST for restore purposes.&nbsp; Just open it.&nbsp; Importing loses data and is meant primarily for moving data between Outlook and a non-Outlook program, not for moving data
 between Outlook instances.&nbsp; On top of that, manipulating PSTs outside of Outlook while those PSTs are part of a mail profile can cause Outlook to lose track of things in the PST.</p>
<p>Were I you, I'd start with a new mail profile and make whatever PST contains the data you want the delivery location (i.e., default PST).&nbsp; You'll have to recreate your accounts and rules.</p>

            <p>This would seem to be a Word question rather than an Excel question.</p>
<p>If you create the mailmerge master document in Word, inserting the fields you require in the first label and view the field codes (Alt+F9) you should see&nbsp;{NEXT} at the&nbsp;start of&nbsp;each label after the first.</p>
<p>If you remove the {NEXT} from the second to the fifth columns, I&nbsp;think it should give what you want.</p>
<p>

<h3> 1ann435  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why will my printer only print out the first page of any print command&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent 50 minutes on the phone with a very patient and helpful employee/troubleshooter from Brother who is the manufacturer of my multifunction copier, fax, phone, printer, scanner.&nbsp; She and I determined that my printing issue must lie with
 my Hotmail account, as printing works in other ways we tried.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; My problem (and I think it seems to have coincided with the "new look" of my Hotmail account) is that I am unable to get a multi-page document to print any other pages than the first one.&nbsp; I have selected "all" as well as a page range "from 2 to 2" or
 "2 to 3" but still only get the first page to print out.&nbsp; Please offer some suggestions to correct this problem.&nbsp; It does NOT lie within my printer.<br />
Thanks...annie&nbsp;

            <p>Hi 1ann435,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad to assist you with your concern regarding being unable to print all pages of your emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to print your emails using Outlook.com, please click on the elipsis (<strong>three dots</strong>) next to Categories and then select
<strong>Print</strong>. This prints the "proper" email. If issue persists, please try to use a different printer and inform us if the same issue happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
        </p>

            This may be another manifestation of the same error that is causing tables to paste unformatted, Paste Special options to be unavailable, copied material to paste as unformatted text, etc. If so, then several apps have been implicated, including the Firefox
 and Chrome browsers, but especially the Skype Click to Call browser add-in (which may be what is actually making the browsers appear to be at fault). At any rate, closing the browser(s) and/or disabling or uninstalling the add-in seems to solve the problem.

            <p>In that case I would suggest that you are pasting unformatted text (whether you mean to or not). If it's not the Skype add-in causing this, then perhaps some other add-in is the problem. Try starting Word in Office Safe Mode (press Ctrl while loading and
 answer yes when asked if you want to use Safe Mode). If you are able to copy and paste with footnotes/endnotes in that mode, then you know the problem is caused by one of these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damaged Normal template </li><li>Damaged Registry key (usually Word Data) </li><li>Damaged or incorrect printer driver </li><li>Poorly written add-in</li></ul>
<p>In this case, the add-in is the most likely culprit.</p>
