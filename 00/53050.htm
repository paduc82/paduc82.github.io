<h2>            Updates whilst sleeping</h2>
                    <p>How can I prevent updates occurring whilst my computer is sleeping?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday night, I put my laptop to sleep, as I do most nights. I then went away for the weekend. On returning this evening, I find my computer where I left it, sat on a pillow on the sofa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be usually be fine, but apparently Windows decided to wake my computer up on Saturday morning to install a 'vital' update and then rebooted, and was stuck on the login screen. So, instead of sitting there serenely sleeping, it's been sat on the
 pillow cooking itself for 48+ hours. It was dangerously hot to to the touch due to the lack of ventilation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a problem. Computers shouldn't just reboot at will whilst sleeping - I had a few open documents and some other stuff I was working on that I've now lost a little work on, as well as the fact that it's obviously not good to have a computer
 powered on for 48 hours with the fans covered. The most irritating thing is possibly the 'MS know better' attitude to updates and reboots. It's my device, I'll reboot it when I see fit thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find a way of preventing this. If I put my computer to sleep, it should remain that way until I wake it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if that happens whilst travelling or when not plugged in, and I return to a device with no battery life?
</p>
<p>Why is windows waking computers up whilst they are asleep? </p>
<p>Can this be avoided?</p>
<p>Who thought this was a good idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is otherwise great apart from the awful updates. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>There are quite a few things that will wake a sleeping computer and unfortunately in win 10 there is very little that a user can do to prevent them.&nbsp; Besides the obvious (not leaving a sleeping computer on a soft flammable surface, one thing you can do is
 to mark the connection as metered so it does not download updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things that will wake a computer are maintenance, a network connection, etc.</p>

            <p>Thanks ZigZag,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand many things can wake a sleeping computer, but in this case it was definitely the update process, as when I logged on there were 'updates were installed' notifications, and the event log confirms the wakeup time and cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be the only one who considers this a problem, surely? What if the machine was sleeping whilst in it's case, as often happens? If it woke up in there and updated on battery power than sat on the login screen until it ran out of juice, I'd be fairly
 annoyed, would other users not be too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can non-user initiated reboots be a thing? If a computer is sleeping, put there by the user, it should stay there. I can almost understand brief periods of activity to check something, but at the very least it needs to go back to sleep, not fully reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands, that means that you can no longer be sure that when you close the lid of your laptop you'll come back to a working system. This hans't been a concern since the long forgotten days of windows XP<br />
</p>
<p>Other than disabling the windows update service, are there any other settings you routinely change on a windows 10 system to get it to behave?</p>

            <p>Nothing of course, but clearly sleep is more convenient than a full shutdown when it comes to using your computer again - open lid, type password, done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'd been aware that it was going to wake itself up to to install updates I would have, of course have shut it down, but I just did what I always do, which is close the lid and leave the machine unattended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This hasn't been a thing in any other version of any other OS I've used, machines should *not* wake themselves to install updates and then reboot themselves without any user intervention? Surely?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can set your WiFi as metered connection to stop automatic updates.</p>
<p>To do this,</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong></p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Advanced options</strong></p>
<p>3. Turn on <strong>Metered connection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will prevent system to download updates automatically.</p>
<p>Whenever you want to update your system, you can turn off metered connection any time you want.</p>
<p>

            <p>Are you sure you even want to upgrade it? If its only intended to do specific job of being a media server, there are no immediate benefits upgrading it to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a minimum, I would at least back it up before attempting:</p>
<p><span><span>When making significant changes to your computer such as updating the operating system, you should always backup.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you have a spare monitor you could connect to it then perform the upgrade? Can you remotely connect to the machine then initiate the upgrade? You setup Remote desktop if its Windows 8.1 Pro or you could install VNC then remotely perform the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headless means simply that no possibility exists to connect screen, mouse, keyboard.</p>
<p>PC used for more that just media so I regularly access&nbsp;the PC used as a server&nbsp;by using Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running Win 8.1pro upgrades to Win 10pro some access to progress the installation is required
<p>Hence my request for assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to why upgrade. Win 10 is for me a significant improvement over Win 8.1Pro (security, storage space features etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts</p>

            Even in companies, headless servers are taken offline if they cannot be remotely managed. In your case, you need to take it offline, then connect the appropriate peripherals then perform the upgrade.

<p>I can very successfully manage my windows 8.1 pro system on the headless PC that I&nbsp; access remotely with out any problems. That's not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I explained in earlier communication I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver incompatibility can cause display issues after waking your computer from sleep. We'd like to learn more about the situation at hand so that we can provide the correct resolution. We just have a few questions for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which specific build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. For example, 14393.1066. We'll need this information to isolate the cause of your concern, especially since you mentioned that it only started happening after an update.</li><li>Are you using multiple monitors? If yes, does the issue happen if you're only using one monitor instead of two?</li><li>What graphics driver version is currently installed on your computer? To find out, go to
<strong>Device Manager &gt; Display adapters </strong>&gt; double-click your graphics adapter &gt; go to the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab.</li><li>Just to confirm, did you download the updated driver from the manufacturer's website, or did you update it from the Device Manager?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If installing the latest driver version update from the manufacturer's website and updating the driver from the Device Manager didn't work, we suggest reinstalling the driver by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Click <strong>Device Manager. </strong></li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters.</strong></li><li>Double-click your graphics adapter.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Driver</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer and Windows will reinstall the driver automatically.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response and the result of the reinstalling the driver.
</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 requires credentials after restart</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I use Office 2016 as part of my Enterprise Office 365 license. I have domain credential on my computer. (SSO enabled for our Office 365 login)</p>
<p><br />
Every time I restart my computer and Skype for Business starts - it asks me for credentials. Even if I check remember ... it asks again.</p>
<p>This was not happening before I upgraded from Office 2013.</p>

<p>Can you please advise steps to fix this?</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Danail</p>

<p>Hi Danail,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the question here. Before isolate this issue, I’d like to understand the version of your Skype for Business version, it’s a standalone version or a click-to-run version? See
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj822172.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business Online Service Description</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are using a click-to-run version, please make sure you have tried the several steps:
<br />
1.Try remove the credential to check if the issue persists.<br />
•Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then click
<strong>Credential Manager</strong>.<br />
•Select <strong>Windows Credential</strong> section click on your Skype for Business credential.<br />
•Click Remove.</p>
<p>2.Remove all Skype for Business cache, and re-enter the credential.<br />
3.If it happens again, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Turn-on-error-logs-in-Skype-for-Business-Lync-eaf6602b-95e0-4c27-869f-36017475806c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable Lync log </a>and send us the logs via 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Zoey</p>

<p>hi danail,</p>
<p>i didn’t see any credentials via private message. about credentials, i’d like to let you know they aren’t used for saving conversations. if your skype for business is a click-to-run version and settings of red square are the same as mine, conversations will
 be auto-saved in conversation history folder in outlook.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f55be4a-dbeb-4cfe-a0be-103f529a4d12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f55be4a-dbeb-4cfe-a0be-103f529a4d12" /></a></p>
<p>moreover, you can back up all credentials before removing.</p>
<p>if you are using skype for business 2015/2016, click “delete my sign-in info” to remove the cache.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fae49dd7-1a2b-429f-a618-ca6aaa01fc2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fae49dd7-1a2b-429f-a618-ca6aaa01fc2f" /></a></p>
<p>if the issue persists after removing all skype for business cache, and re-entering the credential, please provide the skype for business version and lync log.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>The suggestion to delete sign-in info and re-start the Skype worked for my computer, but only for a day or two. After that everything went back to normal.</p>
<p>Also on my colleagues computers this did not made any difference.</p>
<p>Can you re-check and let me know?</p>

 computer.<br />
</p>
<p>2-Readyboost</p>
<p>The maximum file size for session "ReadyBoot" has been reached. As a result, events might be lost (not logged) to file "C:\Windows\Prefetch\ReadyBoot\ReadyBoot.etl". The maximum files size is currently set to 20971520 bytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3-Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error querying for the IVssWriterCallback interface.&nbsp; hr = 0x80070005, Access is denied.<br />
. This is often caused by incorrect security settings in either the writer or requestor process.
<br />
<br />
I would remove Avira and use the built in defender in its place, disable readyboost, and run a system file check</p>

    <title>Request Assistance with Trivia bot and contest - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dankmemerkingjames  say:</h3>
<h2>            Request Assistance with Trivia bot and contest</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently have been posting quite a bit and asking for support everywhere I can, and lately nothing has helped. My problem comes from the fact that I got a message from a Skype bot saying I won a contest I entered some time ago, the link here is
 the page where I found about said contest. After receiving the message that I won I proceeded to type in my Skype ID and real name, but misclicked and instead provided the bot with the wrong messages that it then took as real. Is there anything I can do to
 fix this, or anyway I can contact anyone from the Skype team or Microsoft to try and fix this and receive my reward? Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>

            You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to get this resolved.

            <p>EDIT: I have recently received support from a Michael from the Skype live chat service, and was unable to leave a proper review for him and how helpful he was. He was not able to fix my issue but he was extremely friendly and helpful regardless and so I
 just wanted to say my views here do not express towards him and I hope he gets the commendment and credit he deserves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried for quite some time now to get in contact with anybody working on the Skype team for assistance with my account and a sweepstakes I was supposed to win hosted by them, and over all my efforts nobody was able to successfully help me when the
 issue is completely fixable and by no means am I asking for anything crazy. I was notified a few weeks ago about winning a free Xbox One S from Skype because I answered trivia questions properly and won the sweepstakes, the bot however was unable to receive
 my address or Skype ID so I simply asked for Skype support to try and fix or restart the bot somehow, or maybe send a new one or even just ask for the ID myself. I showed proof of me winning and yet no one was of any help, they only said to ask someone else
 or just dodge the question. It's already pretty poor that Skype offers no email support or phone call support of any kind from what I see and so to see that the live chat has failed as well for something so easy to fix is honestly just abysmal and heartbreaking.
 I was really looking forward to that Xbox and if I can't have it because of all this hulabaloo I at least hope they gifted it to somebody else and the bot actually worked for them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If there are any members of the Skype team at all who care about this situation and leaving a good mark on your company, please reach out to me. I'm only so harsh because I expected so much better and can't believe I still haven't received what Skype was so
 generous to give away in the first place. And to anyone thinking about receiving help from Skype yourselves or using their services, I highly recommend against it as if they can't help with something as simple as this I worry about what will happen to people
 with other more hard to handle problems. Until my issue gets fixed I just can't recommend Skype or Skype support to anyone. That is all.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. If you got a message stating that&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/payment-and-purchases/payment-declined-cant-change-payment-option" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the payment for your
 Xbox subscription was declined</a> you may want to log into your Microsoft account to check for any previous outstanding balances. If you do see that this is the case, then you may wish to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/pay-past-due-balance-on-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
pay the past due balance</a>. If you find that there is no past due balance, then you'll simply need to change your method of paymentto begin the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out! Please let us know the results!</p>

<p>HI there,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also which game are you trying to purchase?</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being the payment instrument is in decline, that means there was an issue in the past with that payment instrument on the account. You will need to speak with a support agent in this matter.</p>
<p>When you go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> to get it to request a callback follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select see more options then subscription changes</li><li>Step 3-----select show contact options<br />
</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.<br />

</blockquote>
There is a NAP-agent service (network access protection), maybe you simply have to start it, check it under "services". &nbsp;Under the requirements tab (right click, properties, &nbsp;dependencies) it lists RPC as required. &nbsp;If one of these two services is shown as
 "disabled" instead of "manual" or "automatic" it can't work as expected.
<div><br />
<div>NAP is an Internet Protocol, in essence it checks that a client (you) has the security patches required to use a server (your office). &nbsp;Otherwise the server is supposed to show you a page with working links to whatever it takes to get the required "posture".
 &nbsp;Microsoft wouldn't offer the NAP-agent if their own MSE (security essentials) can't do that, you don't need third party software for this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But the server might insist on a third party solution working with its own "NAP" ideas. &nbsp;Ask the system admin at your office how that works. &nbsp;I've never used NAP and read an Internet Draft in the "last call" (before publication as RFC) years ago, so actually
 I don't know what I'm talking about ;-) &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Someone added himself in windows family</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>The last few days I received windows notification about the family feature, I didn't really cared so I just removed them.</p>
<p>But today, I clicked on the notification and I got on the family page for windows and there someone I don't know who added himself in my windows family.</p>
<p>So my question is how do I remove that person?I don't have any link to click to remove that person.</p>
<p>That person is also listed as an adult in my windows computer setting and have a no connexion message on it.</p>
<p>Thanks all,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have checked the link you posted yesterday and I am still unable to remove that person.</p>
<p>In my settings on my computer the user who added himself is considered as an adult and have the mention "Impossible to connect"(Not the exact sentence, I had to translate it because my computer isn't in english).</p>
<p>I also have the choice to authorize that user. I haven't seen anywhere the remove button either on my computer or the microsoft website for the family settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, thank you for the help you provided the last days. :)</p>

            <p>Because&nbsp; I didn't have an external keyboard, I tried TamDac's method 2. The Synaptics pointing Device driver version 19.0.9.5 was uninstalled from control panel/uninstall a program. After&nbsp; reboot, i tried to install Synaptics TouchPad Driver version 15.2.11.1,
 which was downloaded from &lt;http://files.ecp.toshiba.com/2016/08/19/0502/26/tca0057900e.exe&gt;<br />
<br />
An &lt;Error&gt;&nbsp; message prompted up, it said<br />
[a newer version of the synaptics pointing Device driver is installed.<br />
<br />
if you went to install the old version of the driver, please uninstall the current synaptics driver by selecting "synaptics pointing Device" from the Add/Remove Programs" control panel, then run Setup again.]<br />
<br />
The newer version 19.0.9.5 driver has been uninstalled, however old version 15.2.11.1 driver was not allowed to be installed.<br />
<br />
My laptop battery is dead. I didn't do anything, my laptop lost power abnormally. After the laptop was restarted, It was completely unexpected that the keyboard works! It is weird. It looks like the operating system made a system check and recovery.
<br />
<br />
Synaptics pointing Device driver version is 19.0.9.5, which is installed on 3/18/2017.<br />
Standard PS/2 Keybaord driver version 10.0.14393.206 and driver date is 6/21/2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For unknown reasons,unfortunately, my laptop keyboard has incorrect key behaviors again after it worked for less than 24 hours! I did a system restore to the point that keyboard worked but system restore failed "An unspecified error occurred during System
 Restore.(0x8007009)."<br />
<br />
Synaptics TouchPad Driver version 15.2.11.1 is installed without any error message but the program is not listed in "control panel/uninstall a program" so that touchpad doesn't work.</p>

 rid of the outline then I can only use monotone backgrounds or the text is unreadable.&nbsp; This is the 2nd time that a windows update has made other apps or programs which previously worked perfectly well no longer functional.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned "Developer Update," we would like to get more information about your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you currently in Windows Insider Build?</p>
<p>2. Which build version are you currently using?</p>
<p>3 Can you send us a screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you run the compatibility troubleshooter, you may check this

<p>Okay.&nbsp; So maybe I used the wrong language.&nbsp; I am using the regular windows 10 home version.&nbsp; By "developer update" I meant update from Microsoft for the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home, Update 1703, OS Build 15063.502</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e68001f-e0a7-4038-8c44-287d630fb136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e68001f-e0a7-4038-8c44-287d630fb136" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I said earlier I have been using this program (Opensong) for 7 years and on this particular computer for 3 of those years and the problems with lag time occurs after a Windows update though not every one.&nbsp; Twice I have had to take it in to a service
 tech at the local Staples to get it running correctly after an update and this time everything seems to work fine EXCEPT for this one program (Opensong).&nbsp; Unfortunately the Opensong program is the primary application that I use on this computer so it doesn't
 work to have that program not functioning correctly.&nbsp; I have run compatibility trouble shooter with this program and it did not correct the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give additional details the program has font options which include bold, italics, underline, border, and shadow.&nbsp; I found out (via a german user) that the problem only occurs when the text includes a border (see below).&nbsp; I have since tried all the various
 text options and this is indeed the case.&nbsp; With the latest windows update I can no longer use borders on the text for my presentations which means I can also only use dark or monochrome backgrounds or the text is too difficult to read.&nbsp; Since this problem
 did not exist before the update, I think it is safe and fair to say that something in the update has caused this.&nbsp; And therefore it would be appropriate for Microsoft to attempt to solve this.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It means that the latest update is not compatible with that specific program. You may contact the software developer of the Opensong app and ask if that will work with the latest build of WIndows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booting from GPT is only supported for 64 bit editions of Windows 7 (and Vista) on UEFI based systems (UEFI – Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer does not support UEFI, delete all the hard drives partitions and create a new partition:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Boot from the Windows DVD </p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Install Now </p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)
</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Drive Options </p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the partition(s) you want to format</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Format - this will delete EVERYTHING on that partition
</p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Create a new partition and select a partition to install Windows on.</p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Continue with install.</p>

    <title>Creative Arena Surround headset surround sound compatibility problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon n simonsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creative Arena Surround headset surround sound compatibility problems - with newest driver.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a Creative Arena Surround USB Gaming Headset, because i noticed that a windows 7-compatible driver had been released for it</p>
<p>I've checked that the driver i installed is the newest version number. When i bring up Device Manager, the driver shows up as Driver Version 1.0.18.0, which as far as i can see is the newest one.</p>
<p>While the driver does <strong>work</strong> in windows seven, it does not give me full functionality - the Arena Surround headset is a Surround Sound headset, but Speaker Setup in windows 7 only allows me to choose "Stereo" under Audio Channels.</p>
<p>How do i fix this?</p>

</p><p>At the moment, when I double-click on a .php file I get the "How do you want to open this file" dialog with NoteTab as the first option, and "Look for an app in the Store" as the second. The box "Always use this app to open .php files" is ticked. I have
 to select the "NoteTab" option then click "OK".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose the "Look for an app in the Store" and install a recommended app from the store - that does become the default. Unfortunately all the store apps are less than satisfactory.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I have discovered that I cannot change the default app for
<strong><em>any </em></strong>application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 1713.345)</p>

            Hi Mike, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help!
<br />
<br />Another way to change the default app associations is through the Settings app.
<br />
<br />Click Start, then type "default app settings". Click the first result, then click "Choose default apps by file type". You can scroll down to find .php and choose NoteTab as the default program.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't resolve the issue, please let me know and I'll see what else I can do to help! Thanks!       
        </p>

    <title>Locating Win 10 Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rynam3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locating Win 10 Product Key</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Product Key but I can't "reveal" the ID in-order to re-enable it as a genuine copy and as it was on the computer itself; it has since rubbed off from frequent military transfer from base to base.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I want to be able to find this&nbsp; Product Key in-order to use it on my recently upgraded Computer that was upgraded from Windows 7 (and offered a free Win 10 upgrade-and wasn't any longer available unfortunately). As I recently bought this Product Key
 and barley used it due to deployment blah blah blah I didn't really feel like buying two for only one computer ultimately.

<p>Okay., well the software that you suggested provided me with my Product Key without fail

<p>
</p><p>After typing in the Product Key it had said it was an invalid product key. Since my other computer is the Product Key I am trying to pull this off of and use it on this one (not activated-that one is) do I have to wipe that computer clean of the OS in order
 to make the Product Key available to use again on another device? Or is it a "once you use it; you have to use it on that device" sort of thing?</p>

<p>You always have to use the same edition (Home or Pro) for the licence key you have and it must be a retail licence to transfer from one device to another.</p>
<p>If the original licence came with the device (OEM) then it cannot be transferred anyway.<br />

            Hi CollaBeauty
<br />
<br />It depends on how you want Skype to integrate on your website and how you have made your website
<br />
<br />Either way, you need to be able to add a small piece of HTML code you your website . . .
<br />
<br />If you want the user to contact you from inside your webpage, use this link to create that code, you will need to add your Skype ID and that will generate the HTML code
