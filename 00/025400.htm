<h2>            How do I keep Equation Tools visible&#47;usable in the ribbon so I can insert an equation as I take notes in my statistics class&#63;</h2>
                    I am taking notes using Word in statistics class and would like to be able to create/insert the appropriate equation as the teacher is lecturing. &nbsp;Rather than having to go to Insert and then to Equation each time I want to do this, I would prefer to have
 Equation Tools available in the ribbon and be able to select them to create the equation and deselect them to continue taking normal notes.

            <div>I set the shortcut to <b>EquationInsert </b>to something that is easy for me to hit while typing so that I do not lose my flow in typing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This can be done by the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>1.</b> On the top menu bar go to <b>Tools -&gt; Customize Keyboard...-&gt;All Commands</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>2.&nbsp;</b>Look for and select&nbsp;<b>EquationInsert</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>3.&nbsp;</b>Click in the <b>Press a new keyboard shortcut </b>box</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>4.&nbsp;</b>Apply the keyboard combination you prefer (make sure it is not a set of shortcuts you already use or like, i.e. if you use command-Q for a mac, or alt-F4 for windows you will not be able to use those to exit...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is the cool part (this is coming from a 24 year old college student feeling like he sounds old saying "cool part" to such a thing...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can save this shortcut to your general document shortcut library (Normal.dotm) OR, to a specific document. (I saved it to my equation sheet template document) so that the other documents retain the default, or previously set keyboard shortcut.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mind you, I used to like using OpenOffice's equation editor because I could type like I am coding and whip out a formula sheet in mere hours. Unfortunately I have found that formatting it is less convenient than MSWord, hence why I use it.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>My goal is to learn LaTeX because I hear it is even more powerful, but alas, exams, work, and research keep a student like myself tied down. Best of luck!</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
I am using Office 2011 for Mac.
<div>I also use Office 20xx for Windows x (depends on what computer where and when, but I've used most all since the early 90's)</div>

<p>OOPS Lumia 635 and windows phone 8.1 . . I have 2 of these phones with the same problem, while I can still log onto skype with the skype client on my win 7 computer . . one of the lumias logs in ok, but when I attempt a call it just keeps trying, with no
 ringing sound.&nbsp; the other phone, the one I deleted and then reinstalled the skype app, refuses to log in at all . . . sigh
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now thanks to your post, and links provided therein, I see win 8.1 has been sunsetted, and win 8.1 users are now outta luck . . . unless someone has a clever work around for the unsophisticated likes of myself . . . ????</p>

    <title>Hyperlink associated with e-mail address corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> porthome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink associated with e-mail address corrupted</h2>
                    
<p>I have found a strange situation in a worksheet that I receive containing club member addresses. One column is for e-mail address, which also hides a link so a click will bring up a pre-addressed e-mail template. However, in many of the records, the hidden
 hyperlink is not the same as the displayed address. I suspect that over time, records have been added by inserting a new row and entering the data. Could the insert function copy the underlying hyperlink without displaying it? Where is the hyperlink information
 saved in the worksheet, and can it be made visible? How can the problem be avoided in future?</p>
<p>This symptom is present in all versions on Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions</p>

<p>The hyperlink address should appear when you point the cursor at a cell containing a hyperlink.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways to create a hyperlink.<br />
a) Have Excel do it for you when you type an email address in a cell (requires Tools &gt; AutoCorrect Options &gt; Autoformat as you Type &gt; Internet and network paths with hyperlinks.<br />
&nbsp; - the cell content and the hyperlink will be consistent<br />
&nbsp; - however, if the cell content is subsequently changed by someone who does not have that option set they will become inconsistent<br />
<br />
b) Use Insert &gt; Hyperlink.<br />
&nbsp; - the user specifies separately the text in the cell and the hyperlink so they may not be consistent<br />
&nbsp; - if the cell content is&nbsp;subsequently changed by someone who does not have the Autocorrect&nbsp;option set, or if the new cell content is not an email address&nbsp;they will become inconsistent<br />
<br />
c) Use the HYPERLINK worksheet function.<br />
&nbsp; - the user specifies (as a quoted string, or as a reference to a cell) the text to display and the hyperlink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. =HYPERLINK("mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***","*** Email address is removed for privacy ***")<br />
&nbsp; - if a cell reference&nbsp;is used for one of the arguments but not for the other, it is possible for the displayed text to be inconsistent with the hyperlink</p>
<p>If you want to display the hyperlink address in a cell, to aid checking, you could use this VBA function;<br />
<br />
Function ShowHyperlink(C As Range) As String<br />
&nbsp; If C.Hyperlinks.Count = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowHyperlink = C.Hyperlinks(1).Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If C.Hyperlinks(1).SubAddress &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowHyperlink = ShowHyperlink &amp; "#" &amp; C.Hyperlinks(1).Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ShowHyperlink = ""<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Function</p>
<p>Enter =ShowHyperlink(B2) in a cell, to&nbsp;show the hyperlink address (if any) in B2.<br />
Copy the formula down to&nbsp;show hyperlinks&nbsp;for all cells in a column&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft discontinued the Game Voice Product in 2003. Microsoft has not released the hardware specifications so that an open source driver could be developed.</span></p>
<p><span>However have a look at this website if there is any update available for the product.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://store.microsoft.com/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://store.microsoft.com/home.aspx</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hence, I suggest you to search the drivers or software for the product using your favorite search engine to see if any other third party Software provider will provide
 the software for this product.</span></p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection from Mac to PC Does Not Connect Via Computer Name</h2>
                    I'm attempting to connect from my Mac to a PC on my local network via Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. When attempting to connect via Computer Name, I get an error indicating, "The Mac cannot connect because the Windows-based computer cannot be found.
 &nbsp;Verify that you typed the correct computer name or IP address, and try connecting again."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I type in the local IP address, the connection works with the following message, "The server name on the certificate is incorrect. &nbsp;Do you want to connect to this computer anyway?"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched all over for solutions, but nothing has corrected my ability to connect from my Mac to a PC by using the computer name. &nbsp;I've set the Workgroup as the same in the WINS tab in the Network Preference, however this is still the sane result.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Mitesh,<br />
<br />
For most Office 365 subscriptions you cannot install Office 2016 with Office 2013. When Office 2016 is installed Office 2013 will be removed. This also applies to standalone applications like Visio, Project, Skype for Business, or OneDrive for Business. For
 detailed information, please refer to "<em>Question: Can I use Office 2013 side by side with Office 2016?</em>" in
https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/officeapps/office-2016-problems-and-solutions-and-frequently-asked-questions<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to confirm what&nbsp; subscription and version of the Office client are installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
If it is the Click-to-Run version Office 2013, you can use the following link to install the standalone OneDrive for Business:

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation Copy. Build 10074 shut down sound</h2>
                    <p>I Know a lot of folks don’t like Windows sounds. But I depend on them when I can get them to work. Example: I am running 3 machines, Windows 7 converting a home movie to DVD and when it finishes (Maybe 2.5 to 3 hours) it will shut the machine off and plays
 a shut down sound that I have set for it to help me know which machine has finished.. Windows 8.1 also converting a home movie to DVD and when it finishes (Maybe 3 to 4 hours) it will also shut down, But with no sound. Unless I am looking at it I will not
 know when it finishes. I am using Windows 10 to copy pictures and make DVD labels and covers with OCR for the text. Windows 10 also has no shut down sound. Do you know how I can get the shut down sound on Windows 8.1 and 10 to play?</p>
<p>This is shot of Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation Copy. Build 10074 sounds setup. When testing the sound plays, but when shutting the system down, no sound!

<h2>            Word Documents Crash When Clicking The File Tab In Office 365 ProPlus On Current Channel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My office has several users (Windows 10 Pro 64-bit and a couple of Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit) using Office 365 ProPlus on the Current Channel that are having an issue with several dozen Word documents. When you click on the File tab, Word crashes. This doesn't
 happen to those still on the Deferred Channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further investigation, if I add the Print Preview, Save As or File Open to the Quick Access Toolbar, they all allow me to access the sub-tabs in the File tab, with the exception of the Info tab - which causes a crash of Word. I have tried Word in safe
 more, in safe mode in Windows safe mode, disabling all add-ons, disabling hardware acceleration, quick repair and online repair (which just uninstalled Office without reinstalling it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken to Microsoft 365 support and Microsoft Office support with no resolution. I am putting this issue out to you, the community to see if someone has come across this before and how they resolved it or if someone has some ideas on how to resolve
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note, I was advised to install the Current Channel to resolve another problem - a severely laggy keyboard, which it did, but created this problem at that same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - Be VERY careful disabling &#34;less secure apps&#34; in Google</h2>
                    A week ago, I updated some security &nbsp;setting Google suggested. I clicked on "Disable Less Secure Apps". Big mistake... I did not make the connection between my action on Google's web page and my Outlook program no longer working. Two phone calls and three
 and one half hours later a very patient Microsoft customer support person named Ruth fixed my problem. She "enabled" less secure apps.

            Well... It took me 2 days of figuring this one out on my own. I fail to understand why Google considers Outlook 365 a less secure app? Should I be concerned with Microsoft 365? This is year 2 of my service but if it is not safe I will find another suite
 of applications.

            <p>They reason why Microsoft Outlook is considered a less secure app is because you let it remember your password. For desktop users that keep their computers at home, it's not that big of a deal.
<br />
<br />
But say, you use a laptop, and say you travel around with your laptop and it gets stolen, if the thieves get into your operating system, they could easily get into MS Outlook since it remembered your password. Same thing goes for apps like Windows Live Mail,
 Mozilla Thunderbird, etc. because you are letting them remember your email password for your convenience. That's not to say webmail absolutely is more secure because you can also let your browsers save your passwords and you're falling in the same trap.

</p><p>The only more secure way to go would be to use webmail and not have your browsers remember your password so only you can enter it each time (as long as there isn't a key logger spyware program or someone looking over your shoulder). For sure it's inconvenient
 to have to enter your password each time which is why people like letting MS Outlook, Live Mail or Thunderbird, or even your browsers to remember your passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gotta weigh security vs. convenience.<br />

<p>Outlook is a less secure app because it only does a simple username/password login. Apps that are "more secure" also use an OAuth authentication token. This allows you to approve the specific app before it can connect. It also means you only give your Google
 password to Google; Outlook never sees the password directly. It's like a slightly weaker two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And speaking of two-factor,<em> IF</em> (and only if) you enable two-factor authentication on your account, it's probably okay to allow those less secure apps, like Outlook. The second factor can take the place of the authentication token you'd get via OAuth,
 because even if someone compromises your Google password via Outlook or similar, it won't do them any good. If you do NOT want to use two-factor authentication, I **STRONGLY** suggest you use something other than Outlook to access your e-mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I administer both a Google Apps (G-Suite) and O365 domain for a small college, and I really wish **both** that Google's administrator dashboard would allow me two require two-factor for users when (and only when) they opt to enable Less Secure Apps, **and**
 that Microsoft would add OAuth support to Outlook.</p>

<p>This is only sort of true. It's not just that Outlook remembers your password. Not allowing "Less Secure Apps" mean you use OAuth, and with OAuth, Outlook would never have to see your password at all. Instead, you log directly into Google. Only Google sees
 your Google password. Google sends you an OAuth token, and from then on Outlook would use that token.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is important even for desktop users at home. Allowing Less Secure apps opens up your account to brute-force attacks from users who are nowhere near your home that would fail otherwise. I manage a Google Apps domain without 1800 users, and I get reports
 from my users all time asking about a "Blocked Sign-In Attempt" message they received from Google. These are cases where an attacker successfully brute-forced a password, but was blocked from using it because Less Secure apps were disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the stolen laptop scenario, it's not just that thieves could use Outlook to get into your e-mail account. Apps like Outlook must store your password using reversible encryption (or worse, no encryption), allowing the thieves to eventually recover that
 password, where they could use it to also log in via the web interface. With Less Secure apps disabled, Outlook (assuming they add support for this) would never need to store the password at all. It would store an authentication token, which you can revoked
 at any time. Thus, you can lock out the stolen laptop even after it's stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth noting here that Outlook.com also uses OAuth.</p>

<p>Boo. OAuth does nothing but foster a false sense of security that scares people away from services that don't use it and back into the arms of Google. Without Oauth, you still get a notification every single time your account is accessed from a new device
 complete with the ip and geo coordinates etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want really want to secure your accounts, use 2FA. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you lose your computer on a business trip, just change all your passwords dummy.

<p>Hi, thanks for the effort. But my mail applet is empty since I am using IMAP settings in Outlook directly and never used the mail applet. I also can not find and send/receive settings in the tab send/receive. If I press send/receive all, my deleted mail

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
It is possible that there are corrupted components in your Outlook that's why it is still showing the deleted email account. That being said, we advise performing an online repair via Control Panel. Doing so will fix any issues you are experiencing when using
 any of your Office apps. Here's the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> where you can find the instructions on how to do so.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need additional assistance.</p>

</p><p>Now I presume that this is the same reason why my update to 2 different versions keeps failing and resulting in a looping crash of explorer.exe.</p>
<p>There's no way for me to get a log after upgrading to the newer versions as even safemode doesn't work and can't access anything due to the crash loop.</p>

<p>Hi Sonya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest thing to a table in Sway is to insert a Grid card (from Group tab on the the + popup on the Storyline) and then insert Text/Image cards into that grid to get a table-like layout.&nbsp; Another option is to create a table in Word and then upload that
 Word document into your Sway:&nbsp; this will cause a picture of the Word table to appear in your Sway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>

</p><p>Since 'upgrading' from Office 2011 I am unable to navigate through multiple sheets of a workbook by holding down the navigation arrows at bottom left of the screen. That is, I need to click 20 times to move 20 sheets. The only keyboard shortcut I can find
 that affects navigation is cmd-click which navigates to either the first or last sheet.</p>

<h2>            Home Media Server &#40;uPNP &#47; DNLA&#41;</h2>
                    Hi there!<br />
<br />
I've been playing my my N95-3's upnp capabilities for a while now. However I seem to have hit an issue which I am at the moment thinking may be a bug.<br />
<br />
From my N95 I can 'serve' music to a media renderer (my laptop at the moment). I can also copy music from my laptop and my desktop.<br />
<br />
However, I am unable to use my N95 as a 'controller' to play a song from my desktop on my laptop. The capability to do this is in the UI however the player says "opening" and then does nothing.<br />
<br />
I know this is possible as with a third computer i can open the program "Cidero UPnP A/V Controller" and then instruct my laptop to my music from my desktop. I would like to be able to do this from my phone (as my desktop has by far the largest media library).<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />
Zach Goldberg

            Hi Scoobyman! Yes indeed I am using the latest firmware on my phone and the latest simple center.<br />
<br />
The document that you linked seems to indicate that I definitely should be able to do what I'm trying to do from the phone! (It also works from another computer so I'm confident simple Center is capable as well)<br />
