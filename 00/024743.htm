<h2>            Lumia 1520 firmware update on WDRT</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;a Lumia 1520 with firmware 02540.00019.14484.37004. The phone shows OS 10.0.10586.494 but WDRT shows OS 10586.13333.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WDRT shows that an update is available with firmware 02540.00019.15234.50005 and OS 9651.14219.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I install this update my firmware goes up but I revert back to windows phone 8.1 correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get this firmware update without going back to windows phone 8.1? Or is there any way to streamline the process i.e. get this firmware update with WDRT and then upgrade to Windows 10 and restore settings etc.?</p>
<p />

            <p>WDRT will always revert back to it's original OS that was on the phone when it left the factory.</p>
<p>That means in your case idd windows 8.1 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is with WDRT on other way than back to 8.1.</p>
<p>Perhaps some third party unofficial tool can do it.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 rebooting</h2>
                    Hey guys! I have a lumia 950 and have had it since it came out. In the past 2 weeks it has decided that it wants to reboot 30 or more times a day!!! I can't handle it anymore. I have tried everything literally everything in the book to get it to stop yet
 it persists. By far the worst experience ever!! I like the Windows experience and would love to have a phone that works correctly, but if this can't be fixed i'm afraid that I will have to ditch Windows for one of the other 2 options (Gag) Help!!

    <title>Spacing of cards in Sway - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gthawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spacing of cards in Sway</h2>
                    When using the default layout in Sway, with images on the left and text on the right, things tend to get too close together, making the proper association between an image and the appropriate text confusing.

            <p>Gene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's exactly correct.&nbsp; Sway gives a layout optimized for the screen it is being displayed on so you can't count on them being in the same relative position for everyone.&nbsp; If you make the text a caption, it is guaranteed to be associated with the image,
 but it may not always be in the same position.&nbsp; If you want to keep the text from ever being beside the image, you can also try grouping the text card with content below it and not with the image.</p>

<h3> pjcogs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing to OneNote 2016 works locally, does not sync to OneDrive or other devices</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my update from OneNote 2013 to OneNote 2016 via the Office 365 subscription, printing to OneNote is not working as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically you can be in any type of document, email, PDF, picture, web page, etc. and choose "Print to OneNote 2016" (desktop client version). The image does in fact print, however, when that notebook synchronizes up to OneDrive and then to any other device
 such as an iPad running the OneNote for iOS app, the image never renders. It simply shows up as a red "x". You see that same red "x" if you open the tab directly on OneDrive. So it appears the printer driver associated with OneNote 2016 is different than the
 one from OneNote 2013. I rely on this feature as one of the main purposes of capturing information. There are extremely painful workarounds, but bottom line ... OneNote 2016 is broken and sending to OneNote 2016 only maintains the printed images on the locally
 synched notebook, rendering useless the ability to view the info on OneDrive or any device that synchs that same notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please log as a bug.</p>

    <title>Chunks of emails missing from Outlook after account migration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fjord kirk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chunks of emails missing from Outlook after account migration</h2>
                    <p>I work for a network management company and we recently migrated several of our clients over to Office 365 and set them up with Business Essential licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For most everybody the migration went off without a hitch. Almost all of them were already using Outlook as their primary email. We went in one by one, created a new mail profile in Windows that pointed to their new Exchange profile, backed up all of their
 pst and ost files, installed the most up to date version of Office, got everyone to sign in to their new Office profiles and made certain that when they opened Outlook that they were signing into the right profile there too, and then began importing all the
 pst files from their previous account so they wouldn't lose any of their old emails. Again, for most people, this went over perfectly smoothly; everything syncs fine, no emails were lost in the process, everything appeared on portal.office.com, all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here's my question/problem. There are three users with two different problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem one:</p>
<p>After migrating to the Outlook/Office one of our users had her folder structure and archives disappear on her. We can add the previous pst files and archives but her current list still doesn't adopt or import the folder structure. All of her separate folders
 are still there in the old files but her inbox now has thousands of emails that were previously all separated out into organized folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to recreate that folder structure without copying over all her old emails? And ideally: we could just recreate all the folders for her manually, and that will probably happen, but is there any way to automatically filter all of her old emails
 (that are still in the inbox, not the pst/archive files) into the folders they use to be in? If not then she will have to do that manually as well and that doesn't make for happy clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem two:</p>
<p>Two other clients are now missing emails. We migrated their accounts, merged all of the pst files over, got them signed in correctly everywhere, all that. However several days after importing all the old emails two of our clients noticed that they were missing
 chunks of their emails. Specifically they are missing about a month and a half of emails. The migration happened near the end of last month, the missing emails for both clients span from around the middle of March to the end of April. But they don't simply
 disappear up to right when we did the migration, they both have about a week's worth of emails from right before the migration. We've looked through their systems and pulled out all of the pst and ost files, looked through them, and they do not have the missing
 emails. We've forced their Outlook to sync with Exchange servers, we've looked through the OWA, nothing. Does anyone know what may cause this?</p>

                    My nokia e51 is hardly 24hrs old &amp; im already experiencing problems.The phone fails to capture signals when I move from bad network area to a good network area.I have to manually restart the phone to recapture the the signal in a good network area.Also
 i've noticed the phone freezing at least 3 times.The dedicated calender,contacts and message keys are unresponsive.Only the menu/home key works.I've experienced this with the music player as well,fails to exit.After that i have to restart with the power key
 on top.I use a vodafone connection.I've heard issues of incompatible sim cards but it doesn't seem to be the problem coz after restarting it works perfectly.That is until i walk into a bad network area...Anybody have a solution.Really appreciate it.Plzz suggest
 i spent more than a whole months salary on this fone..Grrrr

            if those keys you mention are not responding, bring the phone back I would say.<br />
<br />
If you want to know if it is the memory card, take it out and see if the problem is solved. If your phone works normal without the memory card, switch the memory card.<br />
<br />
I heard ppl have problems with Kingston cards and some report problems with cards over 4 GB.<br />
<br />
Others have Sandiskcards of 8 GB and say their phone works fine on it.

    <title>Hotmail now Outlook.com&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cwr64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail now Outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Running current W10 64bit desktop PC. &nbsp;I've used hotmail as my email for many years. &nbsp;This morning after booting, for the first time ever, when I clicked on my favorites button to go to www.hotmail.com and it took me to &nbsp;to do the actual login at login.live.com,
 and then it then popped a new screen that I had not seen before that told me it was "opening your mailbox" (or something close to that). &nbsp;Then it showed me my email inbox in a slightly different format than my old hotmail inbox display. &nbsp;The url showing in
 the browser is https://outlook.live.com/owa/ rather than hotmail. &nbsp;And, the bar at the top of the screen shows "Outlook Mail" &nbsp;So has Microsoft switched me on-the-fly from hotmail to outlook.com email - even without notifying me? &nbsp;If not, what is going on
 here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help..&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Run dxdiag.exe. Save all information to a text file. Paste the contents of the text file.</p>
<p>2. From a command prompt run "netsh wlan show d". Copy and paste the output of the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have you updated the firmware on your WDA to the latest? If not, go to the Windows Store and install the "Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter" app. Connect to WDA and run the app. It will allow you to update the firmware if there is a newer one available.</p>

    <title>how to know if you have been blocked or deleted with someone in your - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgiamichaels  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to know if you have been blocked or deleted with someone in your contact list.  Latest version &#40;12.1815.209.0&#41;</h2>
                    In previous editions, when I've been blocked or deleted as a contaact, it would say "this person has not shared information with you" and there was a grey question mark near their name, so I would know there was no point in writing and it was fine because
 I clean up my list too when I no longer need to contacts on my list anyway.&nbsp; Now it seems that old and blocked contacts have the same appearance on my contact list.&nbsp; How can I know if someone has blocked me or deleted me in this new version?&nbsp; When I sign into
 the current web version, it says "offline" with a gray circle. &nbsp; I want to keep previous conversations for my records, but I cannot now tell who is and is no longer able to be in open communication with me.&nbsp; Every one looks the same, which is not the slightest
 bit helpful.

            The new version may not show that. I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem. 
<br />
<br />1 ) Go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />2) Click the drop-down arrow in the blue download button
<br />
<br />3) Select Get classic Skype
<br />
<br />4) Run the downloaded program

            Great idea, however do you know whether or not that would remove preceding conversations with the contact?&nbsp; Some where I read that, but it sounds like a not so wonderful idea to have designed it in such a way.

            They use two different databases for storage of conversations, so it's possible. However, classic Skype (version 7) will stop working Sep 1, 2018 as Microsoft wants everyone to move over the the newer version 8.

            In addition,&nbsp; if you somehow know that a person in your contact list was online recently and on their profile it says "last seen days ago", you may assume that you have been deleted or blocked. As far as I know, that status is shown after five days of
 someone being constantly offline or invisible. Otherwise, if that contact was online at a time more recent than that, it shows the exact minutes, hours or days that contact was last seen. It has happened me to see a contact of mine being online, then a bit
 later, after they had signed out, their status was "last seen 40 min ago" and suddenly, it changed to "last seen days ago"! Apparently, I assumed that the moment their status changed from "last seen 40 min ago" to "last seen days ago", was when they deleted
 me.

            <p>If you install Windows 10 on a separate partition than your Windows 8.1 partition, you will not lose your 8.1 installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Start by downloading the preview from here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</p>
<p>After downloading either make a bootable USB or DVD then continue to install, making sure during installation that you select your new partition.

<h2>            Outlook will not work with my Yahoo biz email</h2>
                    I have a biz email through Yahoo. Everything works great inside Yahoo, but I need to use Outlook for Mac 2011. Below are the settings I have used, or the way I've configured things. I took these settings straight from the biz email control panel inside
 Yahoo mail:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Incoming mail server (POP3): pop.bizmail.yahoo.com</div>
<div>Use SSL, port: 995</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outgoing mail server (SMTP): smtp.bizmail.yahoo.com</div>
<div>Use SSL, port: 465, use authentication</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can get mail but can't send anything. Everything just sits in the Outbox. The error message says "Outlook cannot connect to the server".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how to fix this?<br />

            <p>Hey Microsoft,</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of the phrase: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it?" Or, more to the point: DO YOU REMEMBER "New Coke" and the fiasco Coca-Cola went thru to ADMIT ITS MISTAKE, remove it from the market and REBRAND IT AS "COKE CLASSIC?" all because
<strong>it was so detested?</strong> Or were the brainiacs behind this "HOTMAIL BAD - OUTLOOK GOOD" conversion still in diapers when that happened? THOSE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND HISTORY&nbsp;ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT applies equally in the CONSUMER WORLD as it does in
 the POLITICAL SPECTRUM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not GOOD ENOUGH that "Microsoft sent at least TWO emails explaining this change...blah, blah, blah. So HOW DARE YOU UNDERLINGS BE CONFUSED? THE GREAT OZ HAS SPOKEN!!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is SO ELITIST. Give us all a break. It may be a free email service, but we have been an OPEN BOOK to your millions of advertisers FOR 10-15 YEARS and made you what you are, so you have gotten a HUGE RETURN on your investment in us....now, we're just
 yesterday's garbage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can't you offer a HOTMAIL CLASSIC for your EXTREMELY LOYAL CLIENT BASE, which would include those of us (most over age 40) who just want AND ONLY NEED&nbsp;simple email features? Surely there is room in the VAST CLOUD for us too. To coin your own phrase,
 this would "give us the best experience" as we intertwine our daily lives with all of cyberspace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could CARE LESS ONE BIT about Skype and IM and "seeing what my friends on Facebook are doing in real time." I'm too busy actually LIVING to waste time&nbsp;PRETENDING I should have my own Realty TV show IF ONLY Hollywood would "discover" how clever I am and
 how cute my dogs look in Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am one of the 6 Billion People on Planet Earth who has CHOSEN not to have a FACEBOOK account. The world&nbsp;does not need to keep&nbsp;track of every time I floss my teeth or have insomnia.&nbsp;(Note to young FB users about to go on Spring Break: That includes current
 and future employers, thank you very much.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am simply NOT INTERESTED nor do I have the TIME to keep RELEARNING THIS CRAPOLA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SIMPLE, BASIC, ONE-STEP EMAIL</strong>: <strong>Compose, Click send. Wait for friend to reply. REPEAT.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MY PROPOSAL FOR "HOTMAIL CLASSIC." I'll even let&nbsp;Microsoft take credit for that very clever name, with apologies to Coca-Cola.&nbsp;(Gee, maybe I
<em>should</em> be on FACEBOOK. Hollywood's calling my name.)&nbsp;&nbsp;THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR SUBSCRIBERS WILL REWARD YOU FOR IT.
<strong>Or, continue down the same path unabated and ALIENATE everyone with your superiority complex</strong>. Or is it an inferiority complex because you're not APPLE? Maybe we've stuck with you, Microsoft, because you're not Apple. Have you considered that&nbsp;possibility?&nbsp;Your
 Choice...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Report footer being forced to the next page on a two-column report</h2>
                    I have a report that is set up with two columns per page.&nbsp; &nbsp;The detail goes down and then across to the second column.&nbsp; &nbsp;When there is only enough data to fill the first column on a single page the report footer appears on the same page.&nbsp; Problem is that
 when data fills part of the second column the report footer is forced to the next page - all by itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to keep the report footer on the same page.&nbsp; "Force New Page" is set to "none".&nbsp; Not sure what else to do.&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Microsoft Word android&#58; font and language</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a problem with my Word on my galaxy tab s4 with the font style and the language. And this is not the first time to happen.</p>
<p>At first it worked fine, I used Arial and just Dutch, but after typing for a long time it suddenly changed to the font 'Iskoola Pota' with the language 'Sinhala'. And that's not all, the letters are in bold. the worst is that I can not change this. It's
 stuck on these settings and it is stressing me out, because of this I couldn't hand in a paper on time. I have tried changing everything, I even deleted the app and installed it again and it was still stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to continue on an other device, my computer, but it still had the same problem. I can set the settings like I want, but if I type something it immediatly changes to 'Iskoola Pota' and stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I or you fix this?</p>

<p>Hi KaidoLorenzo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to ask, when you said <strong>you tried to continue on another device, my computer</strong>, do you mean a Windows 10 PC? To verify, the issue happens in your Android device and computer. Are you encountering the same exact issue on each devices?
 If you're experiencing the same exact issue in all of your devices, we can say that the only common denominator here is the account that is signed in across all of your devices. Can you verify if this is the case? If so, kindly try to sign out and in of Office
 on your devices, and see if the issue still occurs. It is very unusual for one’s signed in account to affect the settings of an Office application but let us isolate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update me with the status of this issue.</p>

<h2>            OneNote iPad constantly freezing</h2>
                    <p>I reported this before, but haven't seen any updates in quite a while. This is a chronic issue for me with the iPad version of OneNote. When I open stored notes I find the note frozen. It will not scroll or let me make any changes. It is quickly resolved
 by closing and reopening the app. This happens a dozen times per day. (or more)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have replaced paper notes with OneNote on an iPad Pro 10.5. These notes are typically handwritten or a word document that has been annotated with handwriting. It almost always is a continuation of a previously created note.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or something I can fix?</p>

<p>Hi Dougp1122,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This concern might be an issue with the OneNote application or if you have <span>
corrupted system files. Let us perform the troubleshooting steps below to isolate the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Check if there's an available update for your OneNote.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Reset the OneNote app on your iPad. </span>Ensure that the OneNote app is closed. Go to Settings &gt; find the OneNote app and select it &gt; scroll down to reset OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If still the same, uninstall and reinstall your OneNote to refresh the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you will still experience freezing issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If you can create a right-to-left document in Word for Windows, Word Online or other software, you can then bring that over to your Mac and save it as a template. The right-to-left function will continue to work in 2016 for Mac.

            The full solution for now is to have patience. Microsoft is in the process of making Office 2016 compatible with Arabic. No time frame has been announced for completion.

            I just installed Office 2016 and initially was happy to find that yes finally it can write Arabic smoothly without any problem on Word, Outlook and Excel. But it is very weird to find that only PowerPoint is not supporting Arabic. As mentioned here, we
 only have to wait. Thanks for this post for raising this point.

            Then all that can be done is use other products until the RTL update is released.

<p>
</p><p>Firstly, why does Microsoft insist on taking away features everytime updates are rolled-out!&nbsp; In the world of business, your features are adopted to ease the way we operate.&nbsp; Removing these creates unnecessary issues and frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Company has heavily invested in the use of OneNote.&nbsp; We&nbsp;use&nbsp;the draw&nbsp;feature to&nbsp;highlight page titles, specifically to provide easy identifiable (to the eye)&nbsp;follow up and categorisation.&nbsp; This was recently removed.&nbsp; Adding 'Show Page Previews' to the
 Page List is a poor workaround.&nbsp; This is not as visually clear and is only available when viewing in landscape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please bring back this feature?</p>

<p>Hi Mark, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I have tested this, we couldn't show the <span>highlighting the page title.</span></p>
<p><span>I could understand your feeling. It is more convenient if we can display the highlight of the title.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given the situation, </span><span>we suggest you vote for your requirement to
<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304942-word-for-mac?query=check%20hyperlinks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UserVoice</a>, which will help better our products and services.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are more people voting this, our related team maybe develop the feature.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            I agree! That feature was so helpful with organizing my progress and to-dos. It gave a great, quick visual all in one list. Why on earth would they take it away? It couldn't have been hurting anything and should be simple to re-instate.&nbsp;

            I figured out that if you draw the title with the actual draw feature and then select all the words, you can click the highlight button in the home tab and it will highlight the words you drew. It's not perfect but it works.

    <title>Sharepoint QuickLink Image Doesn&#39;t Work for External Sites - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sharepoint QuickLink Image Doesn&#39;t Work for External Sites</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/829d8f97-7d97-44aa-ba38-9e048ca3ac2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/829d8f97-7d97-44aa-ba38-9e048ca3ac2e" /></a></p>
<p>I'm creating a SharePoint site in Office 365. &nbsp;On the home page, I've added the "Quick links" web part and am trying to populate it. &nbsp;This control allows you to add links as tiles (an image with text below it). &nbsp;When the user clicks the tile, it takes them
 to the target you defined.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The control allows the user to include an image to be used in a tile. &nbsp;When I do this and the link is pointing to an internal target (some other location within the same sharepoint site), the image displays fine. &nbsp;However, when I create a quick link that's
 pointing to an external site (I need one to point to Asana and another at Instagantt)... the images I attempt to upload for those external tiles don't display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the&nbsp;sharepoint site's home page and click "Edit"</li><li>Position the cursor on the page so as to add a new web part and click the plus sign</li><li>Select the Quick Links option</li><li>In the Quick Links control that has just been added to the page, click the "Add" button</li><li>The Create Link dialog appears.</li><li>Add a URL pointing to a document, list or something else within the <strong>current
</strong>sharepoint site.</li><li>Click "Change Image"</li><li>Select "Upload"</li><li>Find a suitable image file on your harddrive and click Open</li><li>Click "Add Image"</li><li>Back on the Create Link dialog, click "Create"</li><li>Observe that the tile has been added to Quick Links, displaying the image you just uploaded.</li><li>Repeat the previous steps, but in step 6 use a URL <strong>external </strong>
to your site (e.g. "http://www.msn.com/")</li><li>Add an image (I tested with the same and different images) and complete the process to add the Quick Link.</li><li>Observe that the tile has been added to Quick Links, but the image is not being displayed on the tile.</li></ol>
<p>Hopefully this all makes sense to someone. &nbsp;I'm trying to find out if this is a bug or if I may be doing something wrong. &nbsp;Anyone seen this before? &nbsp;Suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi HankRearden22,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for the screenshot and the reproduce steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To clarify the situation, could you provide the following information?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>1.Change other browsers to create the Quick links and add image to external links, do they work?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.<span> </span>
</span></span><span>Create a new SharePoint group site and do the same steps to add image. Does the same problem occur to the new site?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Kimi</span></span></p>

<p>Well I don't know whether to be glad, confused or frustrated - but now it's working and I don't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began checking what you suggested. &nbsp;Previously I was using Chrome, so I went back in to add another Quick Link tile using Internet Explorer. &nbsp;I uploaded an image and everything worked! &nbsp;So I was about to reply to you and tell you it looks like a browser
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I then went back to Chrome and tried it again there - and now it appears to be working too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm not sure what's going on. &nbsp;I know our admin and I have been messing around a lot with permissions on the site over the past couple days (we're having a different problem where we can't get the system to allow us to share the site with external users,
 but I write that up separately). &nbsp;My point is, I wonder if we may have tripped some sort of permission that made the images start working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it appears to be working now. &nbsp;I just can't say why or what changed.</p>
