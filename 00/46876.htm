    <title>Desktop Icons and Taskbar icons flashing constantly - only when PDFs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop Icons and Taskbar icons flashing constantly - only when PDFs icons are present</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an incredibly strange issue.&nbsp; Whenever I open Windows Explorer, and navigate to a folder that has a PDF document in it, all icons flash continuously.&nbsp; Including desktop icons, taskbar icons, and icons next to file names in explorer.&nbsp; This does NOT
 happen if I navigate to a folder that does not include any PDF files.&nbsp; Same thing occurs if I save a PDF file on my desktop.&nbsp; Originally, I suspected that it was an issue with default programs. So I deleted Microsoft Edge and set Adobe Acrobat DC as the default
 for all file types it could open.&nbsp; Here are some of the other solutions I have attempted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Start in safe mode (still occurs)</p>
<p>- Delete iconcache.db and restart explorer process</p>
<p>- Delete all iconcache files in user/local/appdata/microsoft/windows/explorer</p>
<p>- uninstall any other software that can open PDFs, other than Adobe Acrobat DC</p>
<p>- Ran an sfc scan</p>
<p>- Uninstall Adobe Acrobat DC</p>
<p>
</p><p>All latest Windows 10 Pro updates are installed.&nbsp; I have ruled out this being a hardware acceleration or driver issue, considering it only occurs when explorer is open and in a folder that has a PDF in it - no other file types cause the blinking of the icons.&nbsp;
 As soon as i close the folder, the blinking stops.&nbsp; This has happened two other times, and each time it occurred after I opened a PDF in Edge or Chrome, and then reset the default back to Acrobat.&nbsp; The ONLY solution that has worked for me is to recreate my
 profile, however, that involves reinstalling all programs and a few days of work to get the profile back to where i need it to be.&nbsp; I thought I would check on here to see if someone else might have some possible solutions that I could try to avoid having to
 go that route.&nbsp; TIA!</p>

<h2>            Pause between tracks when burning CDs using WMP.</h2>
                    When I burn a CD that has songs that flow into each other (ie: live music), I notice a brief pause between tracks.&nbsp; How can I avoid this?

<p>Hi twozillas,</p>
<p>Some CDs, when some of their songs are ripped, may include one or more seconds of silence in the ripped music file after the music ends. Other CDs may include silence gaps at the beginning of some songs. Many CDs mark the beginning and ending of songs with
 the introduction and end of audible sound on each track. The Player automatically adds a two-second gap between songs when burning audio CDs to keep the next song from beginning immediately after the end of the previous song. The extra silence gaps included
 in the music files from the ripped CDs can create long, inconsistent pauses between songs. Since the Player's two-second pause cannot be turned off, the only way to resolve this issue is to use an audio file editor to remove the silence gaps in the song recordings
 themselves.</p>

<p>I just bought COD black ops 2 and it needed an update. It auto-signs me out of xbox live, but when i try to download the update it says it cannot connect to xbox live and I hould check my connection but the update made me sign out in the first place and
 my connection is just fine. I have borrowed this game in the past from friends and it would always update just fine. Please help and tell me if its an issue with live or if its just that i have a bad copy of the game or something.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'd first try and see if it's a corrupt file or something of the sort in your Black Ops 2 game folder. You can check to see if this is the case by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Select your storage device &gt; Games and Apps &gt; Black Ops 2 &gt; Look for anything
 that has a ( ! ) icon (it's the symbol for corrupt or incomplete items). If you find something like that delete it. If you don't find anything like that then try to delete the title update(s) in that folder and then restart your console and see if that works
 out the next time you start the game.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work either, try the steps below:<br />
<br />
Please try the everything in the&nbsp;<strong>exact</strong>&nbsp;order it's written in:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">delete your profile (profile only)</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clear&nbsp;system&nbsp;cache&nbsp;(3

 restart your console&nbsp;<strong>(important)</strong>, download your profile again.<br />
<br />
See if the above works for you.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Upgrade to Windows 10 - GTX 980 Ti &#39;Your Display Won&#39;t Work&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'm so sorry to be such a nuisance by posting this question, but I simply couldn't find any posts asking this. I've just built myself a new rig from scratch, and installed Windows 8.1. Everything works like a dream, however, my upgrade to windows 10 icon
 didn't show up. It's an i7 5930k w/ 2x GTX 980 Ti's in SLI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, I managed to fix this issue, however, when I load the upgrade icon from the system tray, and go to 'Check your PC' I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>&nbsp;' </strong><strong>This PC Can't Run Windows 10</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn't meet the system requirements</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Here's why Windows 10 can't be installed on your PC:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce GTX980 Ti - Your display won't work</strong></em>'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the screenshot of this:&nbsp;http://postimg.org/image/xjckeiuzp/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this is probably a niche problem, given that the 980 Ti's were only release 1 month ago, but with the release in a week of Windows 10, I want everything to be working in preparation.&nbsp;Any help would be graciously accepted and appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            The most likely reason is that the card is too new for windows 10 and it doesn't recognize it yet. Check the manufacturer's site for info. &nbsp;Even the Windows 8.1 Compatibility Center doesn't recognize it yet.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The minidumps all point to netr70.sys which is the Ralink Wireless Adapter Driver so look for<br />
updates or re-install the old one. If needed and possible disable the Ralink and use another<br />
WiFi device or use a Wired Connection.<br />

<p>No video editing program can add looping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the *playback* software that determines whether it loops. For example, in Windows Media Player, Ctrl+T toggles the function where your movie either plays once, or it loops indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are making a DVD, the authoring software can either have the video loop back to the menu or loop back to the start of the movie. But again, it is the playback software, not Movie Maker that does the looping.</p>

    <title>Are USB 2.0 HID High Speed, High Bandwidth, Endpoints supported for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waqasbutt_889  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are USB 2.0 HID High Speed, High Bandwidth, Endpoints supported for windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a .Net Application which reads USB data from an HID device continuously in User Mode. The HID device uses a report size of 1024 Bytes and is configured for 3 Transactions per micro-frame. The interval is also configured correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally the USB should be able to receive data @ rate 24MB/s. But my application can only receive data @ rate 8MB/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i wanted to ask if its a windows or drivers related issue for high speed high bandwidth HID devices, or can it be overcome using kernel mode drivers. Or if there is anything else that i may be missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>(On USB 3.0 hub the device successfully communicates with the PC @ 24MB/s. So i don't think its a device related issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to all those who try to help :)</p>

<h2>            Wow I bought microsoft points and now they are gone thanks to xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought 2400 microsoft points, which at first I downloaded escalation map pack because my friend had it and wanted to play the new zombies map. That same night when I went to bed, I let the first strike map pack download. This morning I was excited to play
 because those have my favorite multi-player maps. I went to the playlist and first strike wasn't showing up anywhere. Then I went to the store on the game right which is right under xbox live when you start up multi-player. It said I have both map packs downloaded,
 but first strike is not showing up? Please help otherwise I just lost about 15 bucks on NOTHING. Much appreciated.
</p>

<p>yea it didn't work. You know how when you don't have the map packs the name of the pack still shows up on the playlist even though you don't have it. well escalation was on there when I first played black ops but first strike wasn't. I got escalation but
 when I download first strike it doesn't show up at all. Also, how do I delete my profile, without deleting my &nbsp;saves and stuff, and how do I recover it afterwards?</p>

<p>OK I will try that. I also just found something new out. &nbsp;I can play ALL of the maps, but I have to be in a party and the party leader has to search for it. Even though they don't show up. I can also play ascension because that shows up the only things that
 don't actually show up are multi player maps, yet I can still play them? xD Kinda frustrating</p>

<p>Also for an extra bit of information, let's say I'm in a party, and say someone hasn't gotten the first strike map pack at all. It will only say, first strike map pack disabled for those people, not for me. It is so confusing, and I have tried EVERYTHING
 you guys told me. there must be a better way.</p>

Since the Win10 update my scanner is not being recognized by my laptop. I uninstalled and reinstalled printer twice to no avail. Went onto Epson support and downloaded a newer scanner driver, made sure all the Win10 updates were updated onto the printer from
 Epson support. Printer prints fine, just won't scan. Aggravated. Found a thing on the Epson support saying the scanner will only work with Win Vista or 7. I ran troubleshooter and changed to those but still get the same error message:&nbsp;
<strong><em>Cannot communicate with the scanner<br />

Can anyone help me find the solution?&nbsp; I had an Epson Network icon with my printer install on my former laptop. Is this maybe the problem? If so, why isn't Epson Updater patching this???<br />

            <p>I am replying two years after my post on 24 Aug 2015. I just got a reply from Microsoft into my inbox. FYI I could never fix the problem. I alerted Epson, and I am sure I was not the only one. Last year, 2016, they must have done a patch or update. I can
 scan again. So all is well. None of the "fixes" or comments here or anywhere I googled had an answer.
</p>
<p>Thanks anyway to those who responded. I am a bit gobsmacked that someone responded to this post two year later though. I mean, what's the point...?&nbsp; Cheers!

<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since the Win10 update my scanner is not being recognized by my laptop. I uninstalled and reinstalled printer twice to no avail. Went onto Epson support and downloaded a newer scanner driver, made sure all the Win10 updates were updated
 onto the printer from Epson support. Printer prints fine, just won't scan. Aggravated. Found a thing on the Epson support saying the scanner will only work with Win Vista or 7. I ran troubleshooter and changed to those but still get the same error message:&nbsp;
<strong><em>Cannot communicate with the scanner<br />
<br />
</em></strong></div>
Can anyone help me find the solution?&nbsp; I had an Epson Network icon with my printer install on my former laptop. Is this maybe the problem? If so, why isn't Epson Updater patching this???<br />

<h2>            Screen goes black when opening certain programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this issue started recently. No software or hardware changes were made around the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 monitors, and whenever I open certain programs, one of the side monitors will go black.</p>
<p>I have ruled out loose connectors, and other hardware issues, as it's usually the monior the program is on that goes black.</p>
<p>For instance if I open spotify on my left monitor, it will go black, and my monitor says that it has no input.</p>
<p>As soon as I click on another window, or my desktop, the screen turns back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone have had similar issues, and/or have a solution to my problem.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />You will need to restart your computer after the above steps.

<h2>            Windows 10 wireless mouse, keyboard and wireless printer slow downs</h2>
                    <p>My two desktops which are using wireless mouses, keyboards and a wireless printer are experiencing wireless slow downs which vary from annoying to really slow. They were both fine until about three Windows 10 updates ago. I tried the troubleshooter but it
 was no help. Everything works fine if I use a USB connection. I tried researching the problem online but none of the suggestions I came across were any help. I also tried updating the drives but was told they were up to date and the best ones by the Microsoft
 message. I see there seem to be others with the same problem. Is Microsoft working on a cure for this problem or am I stuck?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. My mouse and keyboard didn't stop working, if they did I think it would be easier to find the problem. I would have to use a restore point which is far to old and it makes me uncomfortable since this started about 3 updates ago. I would
 have thought this would be simpler to fix. The other references in that link I tried. Thanks for you help however.</p>

<h2>            How to show &#47; hide shell extensions namespace in &#34;My Computer&#34; explorer window on Windows 7 dynamicly &#63;</h2>
                    Hi , can anyone help&nbsp;us ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the title ,&nbsp;we want to show or hide&nbsp;shell extensions namespace in "My Computer" explorer window on Windows 7 dynamicly .<br />
We have one application . It will show or hide our shell extension in "My Computer" explorer window.<br />
We are not sure if there is some Windows API can do this , so our app just modify the registry&nbsp;to show or hide the extension . But it&nbsp;only succeeds&nbsp;on XP.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On win 7 , our application can't modify the registry , so it can't show or hide extension .<br />
We added level="requireAdministrator" into manifest , but when our app launches , windows will popup an UAC dialog , we don't want this dialog pop up .Actually the app , we used to control extension to be shown or hidden ,&nbsp;will be launched automaticly when
 OS is launched .But if we added level="requireAdministrator" into manifest of the app , the app can't be launched when OS is launched .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that possible to show or hide extension automaticly on win 7 ?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes ,how then ?<br />
<br />
Really Thanks<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Shell Extensions are in-process COM objects which extends the abilities of Windows operating system. Most shell extensions
 are automatically installed by the operating system, but there are also many other applications that install additional shell extension components. For example: If you install WinZip on your computer, you'll see a special WinZip menu when you right-click on
 a Zip file. This menu is created by adding a shell extension to the system. </span>
</p>
<p><span>The ShellExView utility displays the details of shell extensions installed on your computer, and allows you to easily disable and enable each shell
 extension.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these links:</span></p>

            Petracia , Thanks for you answer , but it is not what&nbsp;we expected .<br />
<br />
Currently , we do can hide or show our namespace extension successfully on XP . But on windows7 , we can't . Unless we add "level="requireAdministrator"" into manifest of our tool.But this will generate a UAC dialog when we launch our extension tool .<br />
We don't want to a box popup when the tool is launched .<br />
<br />
Ok , let's see the tool ShellExView .Yes, it's a good one . It can enable /disable extension on XP . But on windows7 , just like our tool ,<br />
The ShellExView contain "level="requireAdministrator"" in its manifest , so it can enable / disable extension .But when it launches, windows7 generate a UAC box,&nbsp;what&nbsp;we dont expect this box , and actually it is the reason we ask question here .&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for your quick answer .<br />
We first want to know if our request is possible to be implemented .<br />
:-)<br />

            <p>You don't get one, you get a Digital License which is attached to your computer/device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home &#40;digital license&#41; to Pro &#40;key from Dreamspark&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My laptop came with Windows 10 Home (digital license), and I have a key for Windows 10 Pro from Microsoft Imagine (Dreamspark) as allowed for by my school. If I do upgrade my laptop from a clean install of Win10 Pro, can I re-activate my laptop with the
 Win10 Home digital license it came with with a clean install [of Win10 Home]?</p>
<p>2. Does the Windows 10 Pro from Dreamspark expire once I graduate from school, or can I use it for good?</p>
<p>3. Can the Windows 10 Pro license be transferred from my current laptop to a newer laptop in the future?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>No, Windows 10 Home cannot activate Windows 10 Pro. The Windows 10 Pro license is its own full license. If you perform a factory reset, it will restore the system to its original Windows 10 Home install, which will be automatically activated. Of
 course, the system will now have a Digital License attached it because it was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</strong></p>

</p><p>2. Does the Windows 10 Pro from Dreamspark expire once I graduate from school, or can I use it for good?</p>
<p><strong>No, it does not. You can use it forever. Its similar to a retail license. Don't lose the key.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Yes, it can be, but you might have to use chat support to get it reactivated.</strong></p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There maybe few reasons why you are getting the "Setup Platform Deployment failed with hresult: 0x8007001f" error, you may use the link provided below for you to be able to update to the Creators build. This link will provide you with simple instructions
 that will enable you to properly update to the Creators build with the use of the Media Creation tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, but I finally got around to setting up the Media Creation tool. Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to solve my problem. When I run the tool from boot, it tells me that I can't do the "Upgrade option" unless I launch the tool already
 logged in to the OS. When I launch from my desktop, after it checks for updates, it says it's beginning&nbsp; to install for a long time, and then finally it fails out stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't tell if your PC has enough space to continue installing Windows 10, Try restarting Setup".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this like 3 times.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;disconnected my external hd and everything except the flash drive&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Media Creation Tool. So once again I am stuck, and unable to get the Creators Update.&nbsp;</p>

            It is best to do a backup on an external drive.
<br />Windows 10 has a nice backup tool. Go to the Search box, type "backup" it will take you to the built in tool. Select Automatically backup my files, click on "more options" you can then select the folders you want to back up, how often, and the location.

            Hi  Azam,
<br />
<br />Honestly there is no point in creating a partition and backing up onto that - a lot of users do that. 
<br />
<br />The problem with that is your data and your backup will be on the same physical disc and if the hard drive breaks, all your data and your backups are gone, which defeats the purpose of a backup
<br />
<br />You should backup to an external hard drive or USB Flash Drive, then if your hard drive ever fails, your data is safe . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Backup and indeed File History are fine for now, but will be retired in the future . . .

            One good way is to purchase backup service from any number of cloud backup services, like Carbonite or Amazon. These are fairly inexpensive, particularly if you use a service like Amazon's Glacier. Google also offers 15 GB free storage and the Google Backup and Sync app.
