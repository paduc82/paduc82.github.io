    <title>Beep sounds from the console, and auto shut-down. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Beep sounds from the console, and auto shut-down.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought my console about &nbsp;a week back, and right &nbsp;from the first day there was a beep sound emanating from the console, and this is generally followed by the console shutting-down. The light around the power button goes off, and the one on the adapter turns
 green from orange. The beep is the same sound that you hear when you turn on the console or press the eject disc button. To solve this issue I contacted the retailer, who upon testing it said it was a power issue at my place. I've tried using a 6A to 16 A
 converter socket, and have even installed a separate socket for the same. The problem however, still persists. I live in Chennai, India. How do I solve this issue? Do I send for a replacement PSU or is there some other way to go about it?</p>

            <p>Hey there Pond! Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>To start things off, here's a handful questions to help us better understand the situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What style of console do you have (Xbox 360 S, Xbox 360 E, etc)?</li>
<li>Did you buy this console new or used/refurbished?</li>
<li>Where did you purchase this console (meaning what region was it made for)?</li>
<li>Can you link us to the converter you're using?</li>
<li>Where is your console located? Is it in a well ventilated area (not on carpet) where it won't overheat?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll work with you from there. =)</p>

<p>Hey Cerb, </p>
<p>First off, thanks for the response. Sorry about the delay in my replying. </p>
<p>My console is a new Xbox 360S which is designed for India, which is where it was bought (Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India). I'm not able to find a link to the converter that I'm currently using as I believe it is a local firm which manufactures it and thus doesn't
 have a website which lists its products. It is however, supposed to convert the 6A supply that the electrical set-up in my house is designed to offer, to the 16Amps required by the Xbox. And I've made sure that my console is placed in a well ventilated area
 and am still facing the same problem of random beep sounds and the console shutting down abruptly.</p>

<p>Hey there Corneal,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear you're having power issues playing your console.<br />
<br />
The amperage rating is more of the maximum current that can pass through the cable. From our support article on

<p><br />
<br />
We generally don't recommend using adapters for your console as we can't guarantee their performance.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may want to contact your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-IN/contact-us#1:8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Bug check description: This bug check indicates that a fatal hardware error has occurred. This bug check uses the error data that is provided by the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).
<br />
This is likely to be caused by a hardware problem problem. This problem might be caused by a thermal issue.
<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.
<br />
<br />
<br />

Conclusion</strong>
<hr />
</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One crash dump has been found and analyzed. No offending third party drivers have been found. Connsider using WhoCrashed Professional which offers more detailed analysis using symbol resolution. Also configuring your system to produce
 a full memory dump may help you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Read the topic&nbsp;&lt;removed&gt; for more information. <br />
<br />
Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is responsible for crashing your system or that the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers belong
 to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help you
 investigate this further. <br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Lexmark is a printer and any issue with that would normally not be part of the Camera's functioning<br />
as expected.<br />
<br />

<br />
Could be you have a hardware issue.<br />

You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />

<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL -&nbsp;check the box<br />
to&nbsp;REMOVE&nbsp;DRIVER - when completer REBOOT - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

                    Today, I received an email from MS saying that I have been using Skype version 7 and that I should upgrade to version 8.&nbsp; When I checked the "About this version" in the version I have installed, it says I have version 12.1815.210.0.&nbsp; Not having a clue
 what is going on here, I went to the Microsoft Store to download the latest version.&nbsp; Only, it does not say what version is available there.&nbsp; It just says that whatever version there is already installed.&nbsp; So what version do I really have installed?

    <title>Horrendous frame rate across several backwards compatible titles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimes-d2c4aa63-41f3-45d9-8e7f-6292803d3a02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Horrendous frame rate across several backwards compatible titles</h2>
                    
<p>Is anything being done about this? There are many people experiencing this, but I cannot seem to find any comments from Xbox regarding this. Here is what's happening:</p>
<p>Ever since the last update, two and half weeks ago, every single backwards compatible game I have played (along with my friends) has experienced sudden frame rate drops that have essentially rendered the game unplayable. When this happens, gameplay comes
 to a complete stand still. One frame per second, sometimes even longer! The ONLY option you have is to immediately quit out of the game and perform either a 1) Hard reset of the console, or 2) Clear the Xbox 360 Saved Data from the console (which essentially
 hard resets the console anyway). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon doing this, you can re-launch the 360 game and play it, typically for 1-2 hours before the problem arises again. Or, if you restart that game a second time (after a hard reset of the console), the horrible frame rate issue will resurface, only to be
 temporarily fixed by another hard reset. It appears that a hard reset of the console must be performed for every 1-2 hours of gameplay (on average).</p>
<p>From the info I have gathered, here is a list of games this issue is effecting (but probably not limited to): Left 4 Dead 1 and 2. Red Dead Redemption, Halo Wars, Portal 2, Far Cry: Blood Dragon, Witcher 2, and Perfect Dark. My experience has been primarily
 with Left 4 Dead 1 and 2. I play more of L4D2 and it is absolutely abysmal. Games tend to last for an hour or so, so I can barely make it through one game before this frame rate issue occurs. Once it happens, it is impossible to continue.</p>
<p>Deleting and reinstalling the game has no effect. Switching from external to internal has no effect. It seems like this is caused by the saved data or some sort of caching issue with the BC games. Basically, whatever they did in that last update has completely
 ruined BC games for my friends and I (and apparently other's too).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Excalibur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, your friend's Minecraft is updating but yours is not showing up in the Updates section of your game library, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still don't see the update then it may just take some more time to become available to you.</p>

<br />
<div>HDD manufacturers have utilities which can be downloaded and run.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bear in mind that zero filling will remove the recovery partition if you presently have one..</div>

<br />That website is perfectly safe, all ISO's are sourced directly form the Microsoft Servers, all MVP's on Community recommend that site and even confirmed with Microsoft that the downloads were safe
<br />
<br />Believe me, I would not link you to a download that I did not know for sure was safe . . .

<h2>            Windows 7 irql_not_less_or_equal minutes after login</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am new to this forum.<br />
<br />
My PC is having a irql_not_less_or_equal BSOD a few minutes after login in Windows 7. The only programs running are Quickbooks POS, Excel, Notepad and HWMonitor. After two or three reboots the computer runs normally.<br />
I have tested and switched ram, no errors (Memtest 7 passes)<br />
Tested the hard drive, no errors<br />
Cleaned the dust<br />
Checked the PSU<br />
Unistalled and clean installed several nvidia drivers in safe mode<br />
<br />
No BSOD on safe mode<br />
<br />
Because of the error code and no BSOD on safe mode: <br />
It should be a driver issue.<br />
<br />
Could someone please tell me what I need to update, unistall or install?<br />
<br />
My system specs are:<br />
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64<br />
CPU: AMD Athlon II X3 425<br />
Motherboard: ASUS M4N68T-M<br />
RAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 2GB 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333<br />
Graphics Card: Galaxy 64TGF8HX6FTZ GeForce GT 640<br />
Hard Drive: Samsung 500 GB SATA II Hard Drive HD502HJ<br />
PSU: LEPA N Series N500-SA 500W ATX12V Power Supply<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the attached DMP files are of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</strong></span> bug check.<br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</em><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.<br />

</p><p class="contentStandard">^^ Asus ATK0110 ACPI Utility (a known <span>
BSOD</span> maker in Win7 and Win8). Also a part of many Asus utilities. The pre-2009 driver is very known to cause BSOD's, so please update ASAP -

</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>2. </strong>If you're still crashing after the above, please enable Driver Verifier:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect a printer to your PC or add a new printer to your home network, you can usually start printing right away. Windows supports most printers, and you probably won't have to go out of your way to install special printer software. If you're using
<span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>or Windows RT 8.1, additional printer support and drivers are available through Windows Update.
</p>

            Hello RobinD45,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is not something that's within the capabilities of any Operating System not only Vista.&nbsp; What's happen to your channels has more to do with how it's being broadcast and encrypted from it's source (your cable provider).&nbsp; Most of
 the world is switching from analog to totally digital signals and this will cause all non-digital tuners to not receive channels.<br />
I would suggest contacting your cable service provider for more information on how to receive any channels that you are no longer getting.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.

    <title>Computer won&#39;t recognize USB ports at all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linnachan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t recognize USB ports at all</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason my USB ports won't recognize anything and show up in the Device Manager with a yellow exclamation mark.&nbsp; The description of the USB ports (4) say:</p>
<p>Intel(R) 82801DB/DBM USB 2.0 Enhanced Host Controller - 24CD</p>
<p>Intel(R) 82801DB/DBM USB 2.0 Enhanced Host Controller - 24C2</p>
<p>Intel(R) 82801DB/DBM USB 2.0 Enhanced Host Controller - 24C4</p>
<p>Intel(R) 82801DB/DBM USB 2.0 Enhanced Host Controller - 24C7</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling the ports according to the Microsoft support site (uninstalling all of them and then restarting the system) but all it does is reinstall all the drivers with the same error.&nbsp; I've also tried running the Microsoft Fix it 50052 which
 does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>When I right click on Properties and under Device Status it spits out the error:</p>
<p>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39) and to use the troubleshooter which just says it can't answer my question.</p>
<p>I have tried looking on google (all of the links bounce me to windows update which doesn't show anything new) and on the intel site for the drivers (which says that it can't find any driver by this name).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm completely at a loss because I don't even know why the driver isn't working in the first place.&nbsp; The only change I made recently was that I upgraded my Antivirus from Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 to 2011(yesterday) and I updated itunes to 9.2 tonight
 (which was when I noticed the problem, but the last time I connected my ipod to my computer was last week.)</p>
<p>I have tried just plugging in two different flash drives (which light up when they're plugged in like usual but nothing shows up in My Computer) and whenever I attach my ipod it lights up but doesn't sync or show up&nbsp; in My Computer either. (It also doesn't
 charge from the USB port)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have experienced exactly the same problems as you and despite searching everywhere cannot find a fix!</p>
<p>I have a Dell Dimension 4550.</p>
<p>I suspect that Kaspersky 2011 maybe the culprit - I have only suffered this problem since upgrading from kis 2010 to 2011!</p>
<p>I also have itunes 9.2 but this was updated a few weeks ago before the problem occured.</p>
<p>Sorry no solution! - but a common theme which may assist in finding one???&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Linnachan - I have now searched the Kaspersky Forum and found that there can be a problem with KIS 2011 when there is still KIS 2009 hanging around??</p>
<p>I had both KIS 2011 and KIS 2009 in my program files</p>
<p>I removed KIS 2011 using this removal tool and after a couple of re-boots the drivers for all the USB controllers started working again!</p>
<p>Removal tool at <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/kis2010/service?qid=208279463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/kis2010/service?qid=208279463</a></p>
<p>Although this tool should do it - I am still having problems removing the KIS 2009 - so unwilling to put 2011 back on. May have to back to 2010 to give me protection???</p>
<p>Hope this helps you?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft  says copy not genuine because it is MSDN. But  my box says it is OEM license.  Why this mix up&#63;</h2>
                    about 2 years ago I bought &nbsp;a PC. It has been running for the last 2 years with no problems. Until today...suddenly my genuine copy has become not genuine...fine.. chatted with support and was told my copy was a MSDN copy and was to be used by developers
 only.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But my copy on the box says OEM. It a single CD with the hologram circling it. back of the CD around the inner circle says Puerto Rico. And the box says Made in Singapore... it all looks genuine....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what could the problem be? Microsoft getting licenses mixed up?</div>

    <title>Why is Windows Firewall showing still on in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teaare2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows Firewall showing still on in TaskManager&#47;Services&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Vista 32 bit Home Premium, Vista SP 2</span></p>
<p><span>Desktop PC</span></p>
<p><span>NIS 2010 17.7.0.12</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ok I have the NIS installed with the firewall on. <span>
Just concerned, I don't want there to be 2 firewalls on at the same time</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I&nbsp; I check at <strong>Control Panel&gt; Security&gt; Windows Secu</strong>rity&nbsp;<strong>and click security Center</strong></span></p>
<p><span>under Firewall it shows Norton Internet Security on. When I click "Show me the firewall Programs on this computer" It shows</span><span><strong>Norton on and Windows off.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>When I&nbsp; I check at<strong>Control Panel&gt; Security&gt; Windows Secu</strong>rity&nbsp;
<strong>and click Windows Firewall</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>it says</span><span><strong> windows firewall is off</strong></span></p>

<p><span>But when I go to<strong> Windows Task Manager&gt;Services Tab&gt; and then click the services button in the lower right hand side</strong></span></p>
<p><span>when I scroll down to the item</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Firewall</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Status Shows STARTED&nbsp; and START UP TYPE IS AUTOMATIC</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>So is the window firewall really still on? I just don't want there to be conflict. I thought NIS would stop the Windows Firewall and change the start up type to manual</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Is there something I'm missing? Do I need to change the start up type myself? Or is this part of Windows Firewall doing some function different than the "Firewall" part?</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Hello TeaAre2011,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>No, the Windows firewall is turned off when you install and turn on the Norton Firewall. When you install a third party firewalls on your computer,
 Windows firewalls automatically turns itself off. There is no conflict with the Windows Firewall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What you are seeing under the service is the Windows Firewall service, always run on startup. You can check the status of the service from the services.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Start, type ‘services.msc’ in the search field.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 and open the services panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Look
 for the ‘Windows Firewall service’.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the service and disable it if you like.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, this is not required and is not recommended and you will have to manually start the service when you uninstall the Third party firewalls.</span></span></p>

<h2>            I have access to Xbox live gold features but it says I don&#38;&#35;39&#59;t have Xbox live gold</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to play destiny with my friend and he couldn't join my fireteam so we tried working around it (we are at this point talking in a party) and it tells me that I need xbox live gold...now I'm on destiny and can see other players live in the game
 im in a party chat two things that you can't do without Xbox live gold but anyway my account says I had a purchase for Xbox live gold yesterday but it still says pending I can't do anything about it I've tried for hours upon hours I have money in my account
 and I can't cancel the payment since it's obviously not working but it seriously shows me the Xbox dashboard as if I am currently on Xbox live I can see all my friends that are online and if I try to join their party it tells me I need Xbox live gold to join
 a party But I join the party anyway and can talk to them but I then have no way of leaving the party I can't even cancel my card and put it back on there because "I cant Cancel it until the transaction goes through" or "I can't cancel it with a subscription
 active" at this point I moght have to just get a new bank card in order to cancel this..it shows a pending transaction for 06/10 for 9.99 or whatever and then one for 05/10 for 9.99 which mind you isn't even possible for that to be pending because I've been
 playing on destiny literally all month with my friends so literally Xbox live gold has to have been active up until yesterday&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there, firstly I would suggest going to the following link and making sure your subscription is all good with no pending amount owing or something:
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If that all looks good then I would suggest a physical power cycle if you haven't already by following the steps here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../power-cycle-console</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If that still hasn't synced things up I would then suggest deleting your profile from the console and downloading it again.
</p>
<p>Delete profile: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../remove-profile-from-console</a> </p>
<p>Download profile: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-xbox-one-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-xbox-one-console</a>
</p>
<p>Most of the things above are aimed at refreshing your profile in the hopes your Xbox live subscription syncs properly, if all else fails I would be calling phone support:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bunkered, Call Xbox Support @ 1800-4MY-XBOX. more then likely theyre is a pending balance on your account because of XBL subscription. they will be able to move the balance to your "new"(im assuming" card, and fix the issue, if not they have more tools then
 are available to you in this situation.</p>

<h2>            Application reports MVSCR71.dll missing DLL but it IS present</h2>
                    My application comes up with a system&nbsp;error&nbsp;saying "The program can't start because MVSCR71.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem"
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The last time I used this application it worked fine (22 Feb 2012) and I've not done anything to it since then, no updates, no patches etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The "missing" DLL is in&nbsp;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322 where presumably it has always lived.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can only conclude that something has led this dll to become unregistered?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Reinstalling the application is not an option, it would take hours with no&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;it would fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried using regsvr32 but get "the module was loaded but the entry point DllRegisterServer was not found"</div>
<div>I have tried regasm but this errors saying "failed to load....because it is not a valid .net assembly"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Assuming there is nothing wrong with the dll how can I fix this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Doesn't matter if its Windows 7 Home Premium with SP1 or without SP1. As long as it is the same edition, the product key should work just the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is this an upgrade version of Windows 7 Home Premium:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

<h2>            blue screen &#34;thread stuck in device driver&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title says I'm getting BSOD more and more frequently. It all started around a month ago but it was one BSOD per a week. Then a day I got 2-3 BSOD a day, I decided to reinstall Windows and it was good for a week until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue is with the graphic card or with it's driver but I'm not 100% sure. Here are the things I noticed when my pc was crashing:</p>
<p>-the crash happens when I'm using media application, watching video/stream in web browser or launching application ( like twitch app, discord, steelseries mouse engine app) but it never happens when I'm playing a game.</p>
<p>-after the crash, my pc restarts and my monitor is not getting a signal, in the past I turned off the pc and the power supply, waited a couple of minutes then it was fine but not even that works anymore</p>
<p>-when I was getting&nbsp; 2-3 crash a day I reinstalled Windows and it worked perfectly for a week</p>
<p>-today before the second BSOD the display amd driver crashed four times between 15 seconds(there was a couple of second when the screen not only got frozen but pixelated too) but I didn't get BSOD right away, since the mouse cursor stuck in place ( I was
 able to use the mouse but the pointer stuck) I tried to restart my pc but I was getting the BSOD meanwhile my pc tried to restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last crash I've taken the graphic card out and using integrated graphic, no BSOD since then (3hour not much time to really test this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help me identifying the problem as I'm still hoping the issue isn't with my GPU but with conflicting driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved some logs from the crashes, I have multiple kernel, radeon and dwm appcrash folder in my \ProgramData\...\WER\ReportArchive that was generated when I got BSOD and after the restart.</p>
<p>I can provide these logs and MEMORY.DMP (which is 554 Mbyte is it normal?) but please specify which files are needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my english, I have hungarian windows, the reason why I'm asking for help here first is because I'm hoping more people visits these forums.</p>

            Thanks for the link I tried many things before reinstalling my windows like memtest but these didn't give any error but also didn't check graphic card as far as I know.

            Already tried that before I reinstalled the Windows. After windows reinstall obviously I installed the up to date amd driver. I don't know if this information any use but I should add that after working fine for a week I installed a game on Steam called
 PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and the BSOD started to happen again this could have been irrelevant to this issue and I never heard that game's framework files like vc redist, directx could cause these issues.

            Related to AMD video driver.
<br />Completely remove everything of Graphics driver using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.

<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
