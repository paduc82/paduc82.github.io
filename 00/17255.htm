<h2>            autoupdate on mac not showing a schedule</h2>
                    <p>So this started a few months ago where suddenly Microsoft AutoUpdate on the Mac does NOT have a interval as to when to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running 3.6 (160803) right now and at least once per day, if not 2-4 x per day, AutoUpdate pops up. Help on-line states:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">"</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
Schedule automatic checks for updates</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
You can set AutoUpdate to check for updates automatically on a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Automatically</strong>, and then on the&nbsp;<strong>Check for Updates</strong>&nbsp;pop-up menu, click the schedule that you want.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
Ignore optional updates</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
When you set AutoUpdate to ignore optional updates, AutoUpdate will not ask you to install an ignored optional update again unless you reset ignored updates.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</p>
<p>Click the optional update that you want to ignore, and then on the&nbsp;<strong>Updates</strong>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Ignore Update</strong>.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
Reset ignored updates</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
You can display a list of all available updates for your computer, including those that you previously ignored.</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>Updates</strong>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Reset Ignored Updates</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Well folks, none of these options exist anymore! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this as it is very very annoying. And telling me to change it to Manually check is not an option in my opinion as so many times updates include security fixes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Camera is too dark</h2>
                    Camera is dark but you can see some faint outline images of me and the background.&nbsp; I tested my camera outside of Skype and it works fine.&nbsp; I was also told when someone tries to call me it rings once and then hangs up.&nbsp; I can call someone and see them
 but they can not call me or see me once we connect.

            Thank you very much for the hint. I had Skype removed by the time I received the instructions. The first time after reinstalling it didn't work and the second time it did. So I am glad it's all back to normal.

            Hi Jerry,
<br />
<br />I often recommend MathType to others and am sorry you are running into problems. The best place to get help with this is the company, itself.
<br /><a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I would try to see if I could get Windows to repair it or do an uninstall/install.

<h2>            2 things&#58; leave email on POP3 server and addition of proper caldav support&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;entered the Windows Phone 8 camp with a Nokia Lumia 1020! Just&nbsp;trying to get away from Apple because I feel that they want, too&nbsp; much, to be in control of MY affair's. Microsoft don't follow that path!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are,&nbsp;among others, a few&nbsp;things that I seek in a client (tablet, PC, smartphone) and my Lumia 1020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one I would like for the email account setup in WP8,&nbsp;to&nbsp;re-introduce the ability to have&nbsp;the POP3 mails be left on the POP3 server! VERY important since I have several clients that access my POP3 mail accnt and only one PC that actually downloads all
 email to Outlook 2010 and then deletes them from the POP3 server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly please introduce CALDAV as it should be implemented (not only Google Calendar). I have had&nbsp;a CALDAV server running on my NAS for a few years now which I would also like to use with my MS devices (PC's [Windows 7 - 8.1], Surface Pro, Lumia 1020).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading (and hopefully, implementing),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am probably oversimplifying things here, but wouldn't the POP3 issue be solved by preventing your PC from deleting emails from the server after downloading?&nbsp; If you only delete emails you want to delete, then all of your devices will be in sync with each
 other.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not a matter of syncing. It's a matter of retreiving. If I'm on the road I'd like to get my mail on the different devices at hand. When I'm at home and I retrieve the mails on my PC then I don't need them on my other devices anymore. And I don't want
 my other devices (iPhone, Lumia 1020, Surface Pro etc.) to delete my POP3 mails.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is also a matter of not being in control of my own devices&nbsp;anymore.</p>

            <p>I just brought a Nokia 1020 Windows Phone to replace my 3 year old Cheap Android Phone and have just experienced this issue. Not Happy! :( yes I no IMAP but my emails don't support it only POP3 and my Android phone never does this..
<br />
<br />
I deleted a email on my phone but urgently needed it back but though like my old Android phone it would appear in my desktop PC Emails so would be fine, when it didn't appear I thought it was strange. To make even worse I thought oh... at least I'll be able
 to find it in the 'Deleted Emails' folder on phone!... But hey Microsofts mucked that up too!!!... as soon as you press that 'sync' button it deletes it from your 'Deleted Email Folder' on your phone too!!! Yippy!!!! Thanks Microsoft!! you really made my life
 better!<br />
<br />
Just can't believe there is not an option to keep copies of downloaded emails on my PHONE!!!!! Android has had this for past 3 years even on my cheap phone!!! so disappointed in Windows Phone experience.<br />
<br />
I also reported an issue in Windows 8 that when you press the 'back button' in a email folder like 'Sent emails' that it quits the app rather than going back a page, and this is still broken in Windows 8.1!!!! its a joke.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling Microsoft will never fix any of the issues has been nearly a year since your post and based on my short experience with Windows Phone its not likely to change or get better. Waited so long hoping Windows 8.1 would be all people are saying and
 fix all these annoying things but it was not to be.<br />
<br />
I so wanted to like My Windows Phones and support Windows OS but feel I am loosing faith.
<br />
<br />
I don't think I will buy a Windows Phone Again.<br />

<h3> ancsika35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2013 - Slideshow - clickable thumbnail images</h2>
                    <p>If I create a slideshow in Power Point, how can I add that slideshow to my Publisher website? I would like the slideshow to automatically run when the webpage is accessed. I am trying to create a photo album on my website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, is there a way to make some of the still images clickable so that they open into a larger picture on the same page? Again, the website is built in Publisher. It currently just has small thumbnail pictures that are not clickable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help! Thank you!</p>

            <p>It used to be that you could export a html PowerPoint file but I think I remember reading that they quit doing that with PP2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest looking at almost any third party image editor, even Irfanview, and they will offer the ability to produce slide shows that you can upload to your site and link to from Publisher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the Porta slide shows: <a href="http://www.stegmann.dk/mikkel/porta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.stegmann.dk/mikkel/porta/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other slide shows available...just google.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be moot if you are hoping to embed the slide show in your Pub 2013 site using an iframe or some other way that requires the 'insert html code fragment' tool as you have discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the free version of Serif Webplus and play with it. Within a couple weeks they will start to offer you huge discounts on the newest versions.

    <title>Validating office pro 2010 after reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> senior guru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Validating office pro 2010 after reinstall</h2>
                    Purchased Office pro 2010 over the internet. Received Iso image and key. Installed on Dell XP laptop. Office worked fine. Laptop crashed. Lost almost everything. Purchased HP laptop with Office 2007 student trial(I think) trial ran out. uninstalled it.
 Installed 2010 and used key from last time (Dell laptop XP) installed fine. When tried to use it wants to validate. It fails the activation wizard and it says "this product cannot be activated because the product key is not valid" and sends me to a officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidClientActivationError?clid=1033&nbsp;
 link(or close to that) that does NOT exist. I try to reactivate by phone it asks me for all the numbers and it says my software MAY be counterfeit (it is NOT, I used it before)and it sends me to a genuine advantage page. Is there a way to tell microsoft that
 the old Dell died and I can install this software in this HP?

 sometimes you don't know if you are in "the 3rd group" or "finally the last group" and neither at the beginning nor the end did it give me an option for a live person. Is there a number I should push? Thank you.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>            Minor version limit exceeded, but no minor versions to delete</h2>
                    An Excel file says "UPLOAD FAILED The minor version limit for this file has been exceeded", but when I access the file's version history&nbsp;in the browser and attempt to delete minor versions, I get a message box saying "There are no previous versions to
 delete".

<h2>            Subscription Change</h2>
                    I was paying monthly and then in October I was not getting the deduction on my credit card. &nbsp;I logged in today and it says that my renewal will be Jan 27th. &nbsp;Does that mean my monthly payments will start back up again or did my account get switched off
 of the monthly payment without me approving it????

<p>Hi&nbsp; - I have been using WMDC with my HP PDA for months with no problem - now it has just stopped working (probably following an automatic update)

I have tried re-booting, re-installing WMDC, running repair and some of the other suggestions elsewhere on the forum but with no luck. My last sucessful sync was on April 24th - so whatever caused the problem must have happened since then.<br />
<br />
Any Ideas on what I can do to get things working again ?</p>

            Have you tried another USB port on your computer? Did you delete the partnership on both the device and computer, then reboot both?

            <p>I lost the connectivity to my device when I upgraded to windows 10 some time ago.</p>
<p>After deleting the device and uninstalling nokia suite, I downloaded and reinstalled the latest version and synced the contacts via Bluetooth first since I didn't have cable. the next time I had the cable and I wanted to sync photos/ videos and got the 80100022
 error tried to repair sync, but after successful contact sync, photos sync failed again with code 80200008.</p>
<p>generally, windows can identify the device, but nokia suite cannot see it.</p>
<p>i tried various USB ports, and cables, it seems that it is Nokia suite issue. syncing via bluetooth is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that the main problem is E7-00 driver for windows 10. and the ultimate solution would be to trash the good old E7-00 for the favor of some android freak.</p>

    <title>E71 Keyboard Change - Help Please - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E71 Keyboard Change - Help Please</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an E71 with an Arabic keyboard and have just changed it to a standard English keyboard. However, the letters and symbols on the English keyboard are not aligned with the actual functions of the keys, e.g. pressing the&nbsp;new ? key creates a period
 (as on old keyboard). Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            2 Excel workbooks at once</h2>
                    I have 2 screens &amp; i want to be able to have 2 Excel Workbooks open (1 on each screen) but i cant do this unless i go the long way &amp; open a blank Excel Workbook &amp; open the one i want from there. This seams to be a long &amp; tedious way of getting what i want.
 Can someone tell me how i can do this just by clicking on each workbook &amp; opening them then dragging one to the other screen?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please try this and let us know your feedback?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open one Excel</p>
<p>Goto Run -&gt; Windows Key+R -&gt; "Excel"</p>
<p>Another Excel.</p>
<p>You can keep both the excel in different monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There &nbsp;are some backdrops also for this.</p>
<p>You cannot use functions in between these 2 different excel files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kiran</p>

            <p>Yes Agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After opening 2 different (both from Run Separately) open files from open dialog box (Ctrl+0) or you can simply drag and drop&nbsp;Separately</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot directly open 2 excels in different files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do this when I connect a desktop monitor to my laptop. you can extend the view, in my dell laptop it is Fn + F8 . Basically this function is used after connecting the projector and then you will see four option and just select extend. Then you can drag
 it across on your right/left and that file will move to the second screen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ecmobeaner  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 Will Not Load</h2>
                    <p>I don't care to use Edge, and my preferred browser is Chrome. IE11 allows the use of Java while Edge, Firefox and Chrome do not. I use an app to deposit checks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select IE 11 and it doesn't load either from the task bar or Start. However, it does start from the directory under Program Files, and I can complete the transaction with issue. I cannot find IE 11 under Programs and Features to do an unstall. I can deselect
 it under Turn Windows features on or off, but am hesitant to do that due to adverse impacts on other Windows progams.</p>
<p>

            It appears as if no one wants to take a legitimate shot at a possible resolution other than getting a new board. It's not a critical issue, so you can close or delete the thread if you wish.

<h3> lauriestrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013&#58; Multiple authors tracking changes</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with the track changes function in my 2013 version of Word (Microsoft 8.1). &nbsp;My friend John sent me a document with tracked changes and I want to add my own changes in a different color, but I am having trouble. &nbsp;John's changes are
 in red and when I hover my cursor over them Word says the change was made by "author." &nbsp;Using track changes, I made additional changes and the text came out out orange (good). When I hover my cursor over the orange change it says my name (good). &nbsp;Then, when
 I save the document my changes turn red and say they were made by "author" instead of me (Bad). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have used track changes previously, the document indicated the names of the previous people who had made changes instead of just saying the changes were made by "author." &nbsp;Is this part of the problem? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>

            To add to what Stefan has said, if you didn't use the Document Inspector (which I assume you would know that you had done), then the problem is that John did. You need to tell John that he shouldn't do this, as it defeats the purpose. Once you've cleared
 the check box Stefan mentioned, then you'll be sending the doc back to John in a form that distinguishes your changes from his, but if he runs the Document Inspector, then you're back where you started.

            <p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Where exactly do you mean by <span>‘<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Word turns the end quote backwards’?</span></span></p>
<p>2. Provide us the detailed steps to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would want to replace the ‘Straight quotes with Smart quotes’, then open Word &gt; click on ‘File’ &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; click on ‘Autocorrect Corrections’ button. Under ‘Auto Format’ tab, check the option ‘Straight quotes with smart quotes’ of ‘Replace’.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, reply with detailed information and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I am working on a document which has defined terms which appear like this:&nbsp; (the
<strong>"Notes"</strong>).&nbsp; The term Notes is crossed referenced.&nbsp; With multiple people working on the document, some people were using straight quotes.&nbsp; When I did a search and replace of straight quotes to smart quotes, this is how that definiton now&nbsp;appears:&nbsp;
<span>(the “<strong>Notes</strong></span><span>“).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The end quote is now backwards.&nbsp; I am assuming since the cross-referencing
 code contains quotes, Word is replacing the end quote based that.&nbsp; Is there&nbsp;a way to avoid this or quickly correct?&nbsp; The document I am working on is about 100 pages containing many crossed-referenced terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>

FROM qryTaxIncome INNER JOIN tblStudent ON qryTaxIncome.StudentID = tblStudent.StudentID<br />

            <p>How do you want to join them? Side by side, so each student has a record and you can see that student's WinterFees and FallFees as separate fields?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, save these two queries as qryWinter and qryFall respectively; then create a new third query. Add both of these saved queries (using the Queries tab rather than the Tables tab when choosing), and join them by StudentID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If instead you want to join them "end to end", to see all of the fall students with fees, then all of the winter students with their fees, you can use a UNION query:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT tblStudent.StudentID, tblStudent.LastName, tblStudent.FirstName, Month([InscriptionDate]) AS WinterMonthFrom, [WinterMonthFrom]+3 AS WinterMonthTo, qryTaxIncome.Fees AS WinterFees<br />

            <p>Thank you. I am testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have said that it is to prepare data for an XML file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Identification fields:<br />
....LastName<br />
....FirstName<br />
....Street<br />
....etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then come some other fields:<br />
....WinterMonthFrom: If January 1, 2012*, then "1"<br />
....WinterMonthTo: WinterMonthFrom+3="4"<br />
....WinterFullTime: If certain conditions, then "X"<br />
....WinterPartTime: If certain conditions, then "X"<br />
....WinterFees: for example, "653.00" for a specific parttime student in Winter<br />
....FallMonthFrom: If September 1, 2012, then "9"<br />
....FallMonthTo: FallMonthFrom+3="12"<br />
....FallFullTime: If certain conditions, then "X"<br />
....FallPartTime: If certain conditions, then "X"<br />
....FallFees: for example, "1475.00" for the same student who was&nbsp;fulltime in Fall<br />
&nbsp;<br />
* Because the IncomeTax has to be declared one year after, in 2014 there should be a formula which should say ActualYearDate() minus 1.<br />

            <p>All of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because a student may have studied only one term&nbsp;or two terms.</p>
<p>A student may have been fulltime in the two terms or fulltime in one term and part time in the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the the list must appear in the future XML file, but some fields may be null.</p>

<p>The database has been built more than 20 years ago and contains now 1011 students. I will use now the true names of the queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2012, altogether&nbsp; 144 individuals studied at our school: 68 during the winter (Hiver) term and during the fall (Automne) term, 30 during the winter only and 46 during the fall only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the following SQL query based on 2 queries I am near the solution. I have the 68 ones who studied during winter and fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I need to add the others 30 and 46?</p>

                    What is the quickest/easiest way to transfer music from either the phones internal memory to the memory card, or from PC to phones memory card?<br />
<br />
Simple step by step please as not very technically minded.<br />

            The simplest and easiest way that i know is copy-paste method. Just mark the files that you wanna put into card and then right click mouse and highlight copy. After that locate yourself inside the memory card root menu and paste the files.<br />
<br />
NOTE: depending of the number of files and the power of your PC, is the time that the transfer will last.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try these steps:<br />
<br />
- First, plug the phone to the USB.<br />
<br />
- Go to Menu&gt; Settings&gt; Connectivity&gt; USB data cable&gt; Data transfer<br />
<br />
- There should be a pop-up prompt that a removable device has been connected.<br />
<br />
- Open up the removable drive, and as usual just do the drag and drop facility to put up files onto the memory card.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)

<h2>            &#35;VALUE&#33; Error Using Array Formula to Bin Data - Excel 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I have a large table of data (times in seconds grouped in bins by speed and torque) which I am trying to reduce down to a smaller table (with wider bin limits).&nbsp; I'm trying to use an array formula (in my new smaller table) to automatically extract (and sum)
 the time values from the larger table, but my formula gives me a #VALUE! error.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; Here is the upper left corner of my worksheet (showing the corner of the large table):</p>
<p><a href="http://s254.photobucket.com/albums/hh115/chrysler-mrf/?action=view&amp;current=ExcelTable1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi254.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fhh115%2fchrysler-mrf%2fExcelTable1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The value of 98017.2 is the sum of times in the entire table, and it is in cell A1.</p>
<p>Here is the smaller table I am trying to populate.&nbsp; Note that it is transposed versus the original table (speeds in rows and torques in columns).&nbsp; The values in the shaded "header" cells are my new specified bin limits.&nbsp; The values in the table are just
 dummy numbers at this point.&nbsp; I've only entered a single array formula so far (where the #VALUE! error is, which is cell F52):</p>

<p>My array formula is: {=SUM(IF((OFFSET($A$1,ROW($F$6:$BX$46)-1,3)&gt;=F$50)*(OFFSET($A$1,ROW($F$6:$BX$46)-1,4)&lt;=F$51)*(OFFSET($A$1,3,COLUMN($F$6:$BX$46)-1)&gt;=$D52)*(OFFSET($A$1,4,COLUMN($F$6:$BX$46)-1)&lt;=$E52),$F$6:$BX$46,0))}</p>
<p>I am trying to sum the values from the original table, where the speeds and torques both fall within my new bin limits.&nbsp; All the cells in question are formatted as General and the entire table contains only values (no text).&nbsp; What is going on?</p>
<p>I also tried changing the formula, to substitute a single cell reference ($H$7) for each of the table ranges: {=SUM(IF((OFFSET($A$1,ROW(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1,3)&gt;=F$50)*(OFFSET($A$1,ROW(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1,4)&lt;=F$51)*(OFFSET($A$1,3,COLUMN(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1)&gt;=$D52)*(OFFSET($A$1,4,COLUMN(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1)&lt;=$E52),<strong>$H$7</strong>,0))}.&nbsp;
 This formula, if entered as a NON-array formula, gives the correct result (27.6).&nbsp; But if I Ctrl-Shift-Enter it as an array formula, I get #VALUE! again.</p>
<p>I've checked all the OFFSET functions individually and they correctly&nbsp;find the min and max bin limits in large table.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks......</p>

<p><br />
Can't tell what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>This formula:</p>
<p>{=SUM(IF((OFFSET($A$1,ROW(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1,3)&gt;=F$50)*(OFFSET($A$1,ROW(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1,4)&lt;=F$51)*(OFFSET($A$1,3,COLUMN(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1)&gt;=$D52)*(OFFSET($A$1,4,COLUMN(<strong>$H$7</strong>)-1)&lt;=$E52),<strong>$H$7</strong>,0))}</p>
<p>Is essentially saying:</p>
<p>=SUM(IF((D7&gt;=F$50)*(E7&lt;=F$51)*(H4&gt;=$D52)*(H5&lt;=$E52),$H$7,0))</p>
<p>I'm thinking you can probably do this with combinations of INDEX/MATCH.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;it looks like all of your ranges overlap.</p>
<p>Vertical ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - 10 </li><li>10 - 20 </li><li>20 - 30 </li></ul>
<p>The 10s overlap. The 20s overlap. Etc.</p>
<p>The same thing with the horizontal ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - 100 </li><li>100 - 200 </li><li>200 - 300 </li></ul>
<p>The 100s overlap. The 200s overlap. Etc.</p>
<p>Typically, you'd want to setup the ranges without overlaps. Something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - 10 </li><li>11 -20 </li><li>21 - 30 </li><li>&nbsp; </li><li>0 - 100 </li><li>101 - 200 </li><li>201 - 300 </li></ul>

<p>You have a bad data design - you should use a database.</p>
<p>Select the cells E5 to BX46 and run this macro to convert your cross tab table to a database. When you are done, select the new three column database, and use it as the source of a new pivot table. When you create your pivot table, put your "row" values
 in the column area, your "column" values in the row area, and your "value" values in the data area. Then use Grouping on both the row and column areas ot get your larger bin sizes.</p>

<p>Biff,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I know about the table limits (overlapping limits), but actually they are OK (the 100-200 bin is really "greater than or equal to 100 and less than 200").&nbsp; This is a moot point anyway - I've been given the "large" table and need to
 reduce it to the "small" table.&nbsp; Whether the limits overlap or not is not a concern - I just need to sum the existing data into larger "data bins."</p>
<p>Cell F52 (where my array formula is) should&nbsp;show the sum of all cells in the large table with speeds in the 0-200 bins, and torques in the 0-80 bins.&nbsp; So cell F52 should wind up showing me the sum of cells F6:G13.&nbsp; I want the array formula to say, "Look
 at all the cells in the large table, and give me the sum of all the cells which have corresponding speed and torque limits within the new bin limits I specify (in the new "small" table)."&nbsp; I want to paste this same array formula into ALL the cells in the body
 of the "small" table, and if all works correctly, then the sum of all the cells in the "small" table will equal the sum of all the cells in the "large" table.</p>
<p>I just can't figure out why it keeps giving me the #VALUE! error.&nbsp; The formula works correctly when entered as a non-array formula (referencing a single cell instead of the range).&nbsp; But whenever I make it an array formula (whether referencing a single cell
 or the entire "large" table) I get the error.&nbsp; The table is all numerical values - no text.&nbsp; So why does it give me this error?</p>

            <p>here is your answer:</p>
<p>it looks like the data has&nbsp; been downloaded from another software, some software add specific characters to some cells.&nbsp; The solution is to save your spreadsheet in a different format first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 1. save file as csv-msdos and save, answer yes to the question about formats, close the file and don't save it this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 2. open this file in csv format and look for a character that does not belong. use the find/replace feature to remove all this characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 3. copy back you range to your existing excel and voila!</p>

<h2>            Onedrive Business Sync Extremely Slow</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using onedrive for business on a broadband connection with speeds of 100mb upload and download. When placing a new file in the shared folder on the drive it is only syncing at max 98kb/s meaning the 200mb file takes over 30 minutes to upload. Download
 sync speeds to shared users are worse. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the tip of doing it in smaller folder batches but the speeds are constantly slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no limits on the onedrive network connection so i know it is not limited by the program config, fresh install of the program also has no effect. This is apparent on windows 7, 8.1 and 10 devices so cant be O/S related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use dropbox on my computer and the same file takes seconds to upload and download if i put it in here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats the solution microsoft?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to clarify as the original post says, this isnt isolated to one PC or version / download of the onedrive client so i fail to see how this will help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i reset it and it wants to sync all my files again i dont have the time to do this based in the poor speeds, i dont seem to be the only one with this issue judging by the amount of posts on the subject.</p>

<p>Hello Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like we are suggesting the same things over again when actually, if you look through various chats there are more people experiencing the issues with speeds than me, it seems like microsoft are limiting the speeds unless it is escalated higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear i can use dropbox and obtain upload and download speeds close to our 100mb connection speed, where as onedrive gets no where near. Onedrive does this on multiple PC's so is not a local client issue therefore these tips on resetting conenections
 are irrelevant and when tried do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i actually get this escalated so it gets resloved, or do we as a user and businees buy a product from someone else that actually works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help to confirm the following information for further investigation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Make sure the version of your OneDrive sync client<span>&nbsp;
</span>is the latest(17.3.7073.1013). </p>
<p>If not, please uninstall it and install the latest one in
this article</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.How is your OneDrive deployed? Did you download and install it by yourself or is it deployed by your administrator?</p>
<p>If OneDrive is deployed by your administrator, you can try to modify the related registry key value to change the speed of Uploading or downloading.</p>
<p>Please refer to<span style="font-weight: bold"> Set the maximum upload/download throughput that OneDrive .exe uses</span> parts in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Group-Policy-to-control-OneDrive-sync-client-settings-0ecb2cf5-8882-42b3-a6e9-be6bda30899c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#setmaxuploadtput" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>3.If the speed of uploading or downloading files is still slow which is like the screenshots you provided before(showing 1 file remaining), please move the affected file both from local
 sync folder and online location.</p>
<p><span>After the sync</span><span>ing</span><span> status disappears from the OneDrive menu, put the file</span><span> back</span><span>
 in the sync folder again to restart the synchronization.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Besides, please also try to create a new file (for example, Word document), drag the file to local sync folder, check if the speed is still slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.For the previous affected files, are they created and stored in your local computer? Or they are shared files? Please help to clarify it.</p>

<h2>            Newbie Needs Help With Macro</h2>
                    <div>Windows XP Pro -&nbsp;Version<span>
</span>5.1.2600 Service Pack 3 Build 2600</div>
<div>Office Professional Edition 2003&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
My company uses an Excel spreadsheet where the Operations Department enters individual employee payroll data and then sends the spreadsheet to our finance department where they execute a macro ("<i>Export Utility</i>") within the spreadsheet to export the data
 to another program. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was asked to make some modifications to the spreadsheet to make data entry in Operations a more efficient process and after making the changes the macro does not work (imagine that). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a newbie to VB and I am unable to make sense of what the macro is doing at a level where I can determine why it will execute on the original spreadsheet and not the modified version. &nbsp; When I run the macro on the modified version of the spreadsheet
 I get the error message "<i>Program encountered errors. &nbsp;Are you sure you are on the correct sheet?"&nbsp;Please try again</i>".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I realize that you will need to see code and the two spreadsheets to be able to help me but I don't know how to post them here. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have provided some cut and paste code from the VB Editor for the "<i>Export Utility</i>" Macro (Module1) and the ThisWorksbook Object which I think sets the macro up as a tool bar item when the spreadsheet is opened.<br />

            <p>An Excel error in a cell is the most probable thing that will stop the code on the line you have highlighted.</p>
<p>Continue as Hans suggested with On Error Goto 0 (Disables the On Error) and run the code again.</p>
<p>When the line is highlighted in the debugger, open the Immediate window while the line is still highlighted (Ctrl/G to open Immediate Window) and type the following in the Immediate window. (Note the dot between c and Address.)</p>
<p>? c.Address</p>
<p>It will return the cell reference that has stopped the code and you can then look at the worksheet and see if you can work out what is the problem from there.</p>

            Hi Debra,<br /><br />I don't see a screenshot but it appears that you are being asked to verify your account. Typically you will need to supply your mobile number where you wl receive a text message. <br /><br />Do you have 2 step authentication enabled?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />-Jeff
