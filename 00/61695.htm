<h2>            Repair process issue - please help</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I would like to share with you my story with xbox 360 customer service and repair process.</p>
<p>I have bought xbox360s with Kinect on November 2012. Enjoying it with family for a couple of days. Bought more games. Then first hard freeze hit my console. No panic things happen. I purged hdd cache. All looked fine for next couple of days. But console
 started to freeze more frequently that put myself on xbox customer support. They told me what to do and I made whole troubleshooting. I was unable to recreate freezes. It took us more than 2 weeks to investiagate but we were sure that xbox is the root cause.
 Meanwhile I have checked possibility of replacement faulty xbox with shop MediaMarkt. They refused to replace this xbox which being frank looked like broken out of the box. So I had no option than trust xbox customer agents and send my console for repair.
 Meanwhile Ive phoned xbox customer support line and faced 3 different approach to fix my issue. All 3 were different. I still don`t know which version is valid.</p>
<p>After a few days I got back console. Different console. This unit looks like some cheap, second-hand, used for months xbox. I guess its refurbished or rebuilt. I have sent photos of the console I have sent them and photos of the console I have received with
 complain on visual quality. Let me attach 2 photos to judge it by yourself.</p>
<p>What I have send to service centre (yes I even have not removed the stickers): http://imageshack.us/a/img21/4549/frontnewconsole.jpg</p>
<p>What I have received back (chipped plastic at front panel, rear panel looks like some blind person was trying to plug cables using force): http://imageshack.us/a/img832/3858/frontrefurbishedconsole.jpg</p>
<p>Currently I am more than disappointed on the service quality and refurbished console I have received after less than 2 months since I bought faulty one. I have bought xbox which was broken out of the box and have got refurbished at the end. If I would like
 to buy refurbished console I would do it in November I would save money and maybe put 3rd party modification on it... but I have paid for new console and I expect top quality and acceptable service delivery from MS.</p>
<p>I am really tired of this struggle. </p>
<p>Anyone of you had similar experience ? What action steps could I take ? Anyone could&nbsp; help or this works as designed, BAU and EOT ?</p>

<p>For one thing I share the same experience, except with Sony for my old PS2 (when they were the current generation system). What I did (except again in my case it was Sony): Call Microsoft, not Xbox (as Microsoft is the maker of Xbox) and ask for a supervisor
 and explain the story to them. Ask if there is anything they can do, money back, new console (being it was a gift for the holidays perhaps, etc...) Then email Microsoft (much like you're doing here). Then wait for a response. Also you want to call up, email
 or go to the store you bought the Xbox 360 at, and explain what has happened, you bought a console which was marked new but they gave you a faulty one. There's always a lawsuit possible for scenarios like this. Another case, call a news agency and explain
 your story, being its around the holidays you may be able to get the store where you bought it on the news and they'll feel obligated to get you a new system. I hope this helps. Do not be afraid to seek legal help if no help arises. best is non profit b/c
 you're only obligated to pay them a fee if you win the case. In the long run, for future purchases, buy consoles from companies like Amazon or big box stores (Bestbuy) or from Microsoft/Sony themselves. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have got received an answer from escalation agent.</p>
<p>They will replace plastics or compenaste it with 400 MSP and 3 Months of Live Gold subscription.</p>
<p>I will not sent this working unit to service again as they could cratch it more or damage something else. I dont trust Xbox support anymore.</p>
<p>I have bought xbox with hiden flaw - Your product was broken out of the box as it freeze first time within 1st week.</p>
<p>I have wasted my time to troubleshoot issue instead of replace xbox on new one in shop - You misled me in my options over chats and phone.</p>
<p>I have sent console in perfect visual condition - You have sent me cheap looking unit.</p>
<p>What was sent to service centre:</p>
<p>[View:http://imageshack.us/a/img838/5134/rearnewconsolelarge.jpg]</p>
<p>What they sent me back</p>

<p>[View:http://imageshack.us/a/img204/3858/frontrefurbishedconsole.jpg]</p>
<p>You have failed 3 strikes in the row. If xbox support is unable to rise to the occasion I will have to make some decisions as you underestimate whole situation I was put in.
</p>
<p>I will sell it and buy other unit... or try PS3... or ask 3rd parties to modify this refurbished unit to compensate my struggle.</p>
<p>If you can not reconsider your approach then close this case and leave it as warning for others. You can definitely ruin the fun.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yaroslav.</p>

<p>It seems that freezing issue came back and prooved weak support from xbox department.</p>
<p>It went back to service again ... this time with Hard Disk Drive accessory.</p>
<p>I kept xbox advocacy team promise that they will replace all plastics and put more attention to service quality on next visit. I have sent them reminder.</p>
<p>Well, console came back.. with the same plastics but its much more quiet. I called polish xbox customer care and asked for explanations. Officialy they ask me to send it back to service centre that console will be replaced to another one (refurbished) with
 no guarantee that its visual condition will be tha same compared to the one I have sent as 1st back in 2012.</p>
<p>I am really afraid to send it back to them again as they have failed twice already. So far xbox customer support and xbox advocacy team are not willing to propose anything. They did not even attached 1 month xbox gold card this time to compensate. I dont
 feel anyone is treating my issue seriously.</p>
<p>So far my 3rd console is quiet, I get used to it... but it already freezed 2 times in last 3 days (BF3 when joining team and watching Machinima movie clip). I think it might be the reason of using USB flash drives and not having HDD installed. Patiently
 waiting for new HDD.</p>
<p><strong>What should I do to finally receive reliable support ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maybe I am asking for too much ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why am I struggling for so long ?</strong></p>

<p>I had a similar experience when the 360 first launched and my console red ringed and I got back one in a state worse than the one I sent in. I called Xbox Support directly and requested a replacement and actually requested that it be a new console.</p>
<p>I sent back the console they sent me and they did indeed send me a new console including all the retail protective stickers.</p>
<p>Just remember, Xbox Support isn't the same as the repair centre so be nice to them and they'll tend to hook you up with what you are asking for :)</p>

<p>Every console I have sent in for "repair", a different console has been returned to me with a different serial number, in absolutely atrocious condition, and none have lasted longer than six months before conking out again. All four Xbox consoles that I
 have paid full-price for since 2002 have failed on me, as have all the refurbs. This should be a sign right there that Microsoft do not know how to make a fully functional console if their lives depended on it. It's bad enough that these things fail randomly
 but to get such a non-service is an insult to the loyalty that us gamers give them for our hard earned cash. They seem to forget that and think our pockets are deep enough to keep replacing consoles. I wish really wish them luck with the 720 because their
 gonna need it big time. But yes, you want to know steps that you can take to alleviate the problems? There is only one: Switch console brands. Simple as that.</p>

<h2>            Connecting MS Surface Pro to HDMI TV</h2>
                    Hi, I am trying to connect my Surface Pro via the HDMI port ( mini on Pro) to one of the HDMI ports on my Panasonic and Philips TV's. In the Control Panel under Hardware and Devices - the Surface recognises the TV as a Generic PnP Monitor but I cant seem
 to extend the screen on the Surface to either TV's. I have used my Surface with VGA cables and have been able to connect to TV's and Screens although the monitor settings to take some adjustment to configure both the Surface and the Second Screen. Has anyone
 had any similar issue when connecting to HMDI

<p>Do you see them making a franchise out of this? I know there was a poster in the game that said RAGE 2 and Doom 5 50% off. Plus the ending left it kind of it open for a second game.</p>

<p>I agree with Riven..NO dont make a #2..after the let down of this one i wouldnt buy a 2nd..the story is was undercooked the online could have been part of the MAIN game and not some tacked on side quest/mission BS,the "deathmatch car racing" is flawed..lag,
 un-even player lvl balance ( lvl 1-4 vs 10-20's) and gets repetive rather quickly..unless they overhaul the the whole game play as it stands imo its pointless for another one.</p>

<p>I think the OP was being a little tongue in cheek, but any original IP game that sells well gets a sequel because the industry like any other is driven by sales, so yes there will be a sequel in one form or another. We may have to wait a while considering
 how long this one was in development and they still have the Doom and possibly Quake franchises still going.</p>

<p>I am so confused, why do people think the story sucked? I thought it was clever and interesting... The story wasn't delivered properly but it makes you think more and I thought it was interesting. The references to Doom towards the end were awesome.</p>

<h2>            Screen is too YELLOW after update&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, last night got an automatic update when shutting off my computer, "Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1", but when I turned my computer back on in the morning the screen was extremely yellow.
<br />
I restarted it to see if it was just a boot error and when it loaded back up it was normal for a second or two then got really yellow saturated again... Help?

<h2>            Download Music from OneDrive&#47;Xbox_music to my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all! If it isn't noticeable, I'm new here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a simple scenario. Recently, I uploaded the music on my PC to my OneDrive, to take advantage of 1TB of storage. In the process, I accidentally removed the song files from my hard drive. Is there any way to download my music back to my PC without losing
 the organization of songs, albums, artists, etc.?</p>

            <p>It won't actually. &nbsp;Group shows groups, but Arrange will use the stacks. &nbsp;In Windows 7,&nbsp;<em>Arrange</em> was on the toolbar, but in Windows 8+, you have to right-click a blank white space inside the Music library (not folder) to see it. &nbsp;Only libraries get
 to take advantage of the content database. &nbsp;I forgot to mention that, it's a function of libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see libraries on the left, right-click a blank area on the left nav bar to show them.</p>

<p>I am interested in this but maybe i don't get it because they want TC in every game . Although &nbsp;some games work well with Total Control like FNR i do think some not like Skate series. I love the series but some movements are really hard to do ; specially
 when are combined. IMO.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</p>
<p>Step 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</p>
<p>Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</p>
<p>If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Step 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</p>
<p>Step 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Just remove my files.</p>
<p>Step 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Reset.</p>
<p>Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).</p>

                    <p>I plan to buy Adaptative Controller and I want to figure out my requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- On RT and LT what's the potentiometer ohms value I should use with 3.5mm jack?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- If I use XAC with Copilot and another standard Controller as primary, does the rumble feature still work on Std controller?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Does XBox with the Thrustmaster steering wheel still support Force feedback when using XAC as Copilot controller? And if I plug SW in USB left XAC joystick option?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows update error 0xC1900101 - 0x30017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dani kid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update error 0xC1900101 - 0x30017</h2>
                    Updating from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 through the Store and it downloads starts the install and reboots. It will then reboot a few times until in finally freezes a the screen with the new blue Windows icon that has the blue dot that move in a circle.
 The whole system become unresponsive and does nothing. After two hours I power it down holding the power button. Again it goes back to the same screen, let it set for 30 minutes, force it off again. After a few times my Windows 8 is restored and I am given
 a message the Windows 8.1 failed to install error 0xC1900101 - 0x30017. Tried the process again and I'm getting the same issues. Reading online I am seeing some info for 0xC1900101 - 0x##### but none for my direct error code. Well except one blog post that
 had a Dell computer with the same error, but the fix was that some Microsoft Tech ran some software on their computer and then 8.1 install for them. Which is not a lot of help except to hint that it could be a software issue with my system. Any ideas what
 this error code means so I can start troubleshooting those parts?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also I have some out of the ordinary changes on my system. If someone who has a strong understanding on the changes I made could help determine if they are likely the cause of the issue or if I am looking in the wrong place. First, I use multiple hard
 drives in my system, each different. I'm telling you this so the next changes make since. My OS is on a SSD, but I have moved the Documents, Downloads, Music, Movies, Pictures, Contacts, and Favorites folders to a different drive. &nbsp;Then I created a junction
 for each "MKLINK -j" of those folders so the OS still thinks that they are on my SSD. I do not know at what level the junction link works and if it would be understood by the update, or if the Windows 8.1 update would even care about that. The other change
 is that I have 3 locations for programs that I install. First location is on the SSD that the OS is installed, next location is a high rpm HDD, third is a standard desktop HDD. Critical programs go on the SSD with the OS, games and important programs that
 don't benefit from SSD go on the high rpm HDD, and programs that don't need a whole lot of hard drive access are installed on the third. There is no good reason I have this setup other than I get a new hdd every 3 - 4 years, so I have built up a few and wanted
 to make use of them (I know the dangers of using old HDD). I also have two GPU, Nvidia. They are different chips so can't SLI. I use one as a phyx engine the other is the gpu. That is about all of the odd things that come to mind that might cause an issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is anyone knows the answer, that is great, or at least any insight about this error and where to troubleshoot. I have also seen a few comments about the Windows 8.1 update having bugs due to being rushed. Does anyone have any sources that can confirm this
 and if my issue is related.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for reading.</div>

            <p>I have finally managed to install the 8.1 update.</p>
<p>Here are the steps.</p>
<p>1) Installed the video driver from manufacturer site.</p>
<p>2) disabled my antivirus&nbsp;( AVG ). Microsoft antivirus is already disabled.</p>
<p>2) run msconfig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) on third tab ( services ) checked the button "hide all Microsoft services"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) marked all remaining services and clicked "disable all"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) on tab "startup" clicked on "link" open task manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) on task manager window clicked each one of the services and disabled them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; e) close the task manager and click ok for msconfig.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the step 2 can be found&nbsp;with internet search "clean boot".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>reboot and do the 8.1 upgrade. </p>
<p>I&nbsp;have 30GB space available on boot disk.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;I did again the&nbsp;step 2 and "undo" the disable's.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this will help.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Judy4444,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Install the security component update and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To install the security component update, follow these steps from the below article. (Steps for windows vista)
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check the workaround from this article.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/919589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/919589</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>As an alternative step you may try to reset the DRM store on the computer.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>If Windows Media Player 11 is running, exit Windows Media Player 11.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Locate the DRM folder on the hard disk, and then rename the DRM folder to DRMbackup.
<br />
<br />
By default, this folder is in the following location in Windows Vista: </span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\DRM</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Visit the following Microsoft Web site:
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp</span></a><span><span>
 (http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp) </span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Follow the instructions on the Web site to update the security component of Windows Media Player 11. This procedure enables you to obtain new licenses
 for media content. You can also reset licenses for purchased content so that you can play that content on a computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> On a Windows Vista-based computer, you must run Internet Explorer as an administrator before you update the security component of Windows Media Player 11. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>All Programs</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> You must contact any third-party stores from which you purchased
 music to reset the licenses for that music. If you have copied CDs to protected Windows Media Audio files, those CDs must be copied again.</span></span></p>

            Thanks for your prompt reply.&nbsp; Already disabled it, but I also would like to block this at the firewall level just in case it really hasn't disabled everything.&nbsp; Can you advise of the domains or unique ports to block?<br />

            <p>According to the "Windows 10 Privacy and ****" pastebin batch script ( http://pastebin.com/K8Ww4j8z ) the following domains should be blocked, I'd suggest to block any protocol and port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As they all refer to domain names and might resolve differently at different times, it is more easy to block DNS resolution request concerning these domains. So, for a network you might want to create authoritative DNS responses to localhost or such for
 these domains, on a host level I'd add these to the hosts file, just as the "Windows 10 Privacy and ****" Batch script does.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you receive this popup when you open word document or during the start up?<br />
<br />
If you receive this popup during the startup, let's perform clean boot.<br />
<br />
<p>We recommend you clean start the operating system to determine if other programs are interfering with Microsoft Word.
<br />
</p>
<p><b>To do this, see this article on how to clean start your computer:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>If you receive this error when using Microsoft word, refer to the steps suggested by
<b>Raju S Das</b> from this</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/microsoft-word-has-stopped-working-everytime-i-try/71f4b95d-7180-45ac-97bd-808cadebb0dc?msgId=5970986d-6509-4e7d-ab11-dd77b7fbf1b9">

<p>Hey Kain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see you are having some trouble with your 2 latest recorded clips. Make sure you have enough storage available for your clips. Try recording a new test clip and see if you are able to access it afterwards. Let us know! :D</p>

<p>Hi Kain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply! Good to know that you have storage available on your console. When you're attempting to view the clips, are you doing so via the Upload Studio app on your Xbox?&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/apps/upload-studio-managing-clips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Finding
 your game clips </a></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the guide &gt; <strong>Broadcast &amp; capture</strong> &gt; <strong>Capture</strong> &gt;
<strong>Manage Captures</strong>.</li><li>The default filter shows everything already published on Xbox Live.<br />
To see clips youve captured but not yet uploaded, select the filter <strong>On Xbox Live</strong> and choose
<strong>On this Xbox</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you are, and they are still not found, then you may wish to try the troubleshooting available in the following articles:</p>

            I have a similar issue and it all started after appearing offline for quite some time.&nbsp; Now I am appearing online and want my clips to be available for everyone to see.&nbsp; Nothing new gets posted on my activity feed, I've tried the privacy settings and activity
 feed settings and everything is set correctly.&nbsp; I can see the clips myself if I go into my captures on my xbox however, I cannot see these new captures on my xbox app.&nbsp; And not to mention my activity feed has been completely blank 2 months. Please help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>More than one device is performing network address translation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sveach  say:</h3>
<h2>            More than one device is performing network address translation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new hp all in one windows 8.1 machine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I was setting it up, I did not go with all the recommended settings for sharing/privacy, etc.&nbsp; I think this may have to do with some of my problems, but not all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing that I did was try to set up QuickBooks on my home network (and set up the home network with my other computer).&nbsp; I have been unsuccessful in getting Quickbooks to communicate with both machines.&nbsp; But I am also getting an error with HP simple
 pass, and Bluetooth.&nbsp; I could not install the update for Bluetooth.&nbsp; And can't log in to simple pass. When I ask to reset my password, I do not receive the email they send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran HP diagnostics for my network and sharing settings. The result told me to reconfigure my network settings, and "More than one device is performing network address translation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like starting over.&nbsp; Is there a way to reset the factory settings?&nbsp; Do I need to do that, or does anyone know a way to fix things with out resorting to that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sally</p>
