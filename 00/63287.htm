<h2>            After 2&#47;17 Update - External Monitors plugged into Surface Dock don&#39;t always wake from sleep&#47;hibernate</h2>
                    <p>Thanks Surface Team for all the fixes in 2/17's update! It's now SOOO close to being a machine I can just use instead of having to fuss over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is however a new problem that I can't seem to get rid of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More often than not, when I wake my Surface Book from sleep (or hibernate if it was sleeping for more than 2 hours), the monitors plugged into the Dock do not turn on. When I go into Display Settings, they show up as detected, but the settings are changed
 with them set as "disabled". If I try and change them to "extended" (as they were before sleeping), nothing changes and I get an error saying the settings could not be changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have to close everything out, reboot, and unplug them and re-plug them in a few times until they finally all work at the same time again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fully patched, and the patches all installed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other big issue I hope you'll fix: Please ignore the power button when the lid is closed. Currently bumping it in my bag results in the Surface Book turning on and getting hot and draining the battery.</p>

            FYI, I have now had the opportunity to test the system by disabling connected standby through the registry and have resolved the inconsistency with the dock recovering the monitors and black screen restarts.&nbsp; The system will still shut off the screen saving
 energy, but everything comes right back up on device input.&nbsp; The system restarts fast enough that&nbsp;not having a sleep or hibernate&nbsp;option is not a problem and the fact that I don't have to&nbsp;worry about losing&nbsp;my work when the system is docked due to a black
 screen restart or goofing with the dock is worth&nbsp;the inconvenience.&nbsp; Since the change the reliability monitor shows hardware/drivers are stable with the occasional browser crash, score!

<h2>            Windows 7 Eternity Service Pack 1 &#40;Not Working&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so I've been wanting to install the Service Pack for my windows 7 computer. However when I continue after I download it, it will tell me that "One or more system components that the service pack requires are missing."<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cebc80df-f48d-4351-bd27-b1a9f4391dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cebc80df-f48d-4351-bd27-b1a9f4391dca" /></a></p>
<p>Now, im not sure if it supports this type of Windows 7, or something, but this is really needed.</p>
<p>I've contacted support 4 times, and even though, they were completely nice and easy to talk to, nothing has changed.</p>

<p>Then you should be able to install SP1.</p>

 what do to fix because I can seem to do is confuse myself and confound my computer the that submit a response was respondinding to something else said he knew but didn't give up the knowledge. So I'm stuck with no way out of this dilema but I did find an app

<h2>            Not automatically signing in to Xbox LIVE anymore.</h2>
                    
<p>I moved to a new place recently with a new wireless network. I can use Xbox LIVE just fine, but it doesn't automatically sign me in anymore. Every time I boot up my Xbox my profile/gamertag is signed in, but I always have to tell it to connect to Xbox LIVE.
 Can I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi there Gamesook, do you have the ability to see if you can connect automatically when you're connected wired instead of wireless to the internet to see if the issue still happens?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I would also try to clear your system cache from the device options menu, and then deleting (profile only) and redownloading your profile.

<p>Alright try this out:</p>
<ol>
<li>click the Xbox Guide button. </li><li>Once it is up, scroll to the right hand side and you will see the option "Profile" at the top.<br />
<br />
Click profile, then go to the bottom to&nbsp; Sign-In preferences </li><li>once you get there you'll have two options the top one should be&nbsp; Profile Auto sign-in (that's the one you want) and the bottom option will be messenger auto sign in.
</li><li>Turn on Profile auto sign-in and there you have it. </li></ol>
<p><br />
When you do this you have to be signed on to the account that you want to auto sign in.&nbsp; If you want to turn it off in the future you go through the same process.</p>
<p>I hope this works for you.</p>

There is a version of Vista Movie Maker 6.0 that will<br />
run on Windows 7 or 8...maybe you could use it.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

I guess anything is possible but considering that the <br />
requirement is 2.40 and you are receiving the error...<br />
it appears that it will not work.<br />
<br />
Could you check with the person who told you it <br />
would work and request instructions on how to solve <br />
the issue?<br />
<br />
Anyway the earlier version that I suggested may be <br />
worth a try.<br />

<div>Any ideas on this.....</div>

</div>
<div>Why can't I minimize a jpg or PDF? &nbsp;

<div>If I'm viewing a jpg or PDf document and move it elsewhere on my desktop so I can see something else, it disappears altogether. &nbsp;Where has it gone? &nbsp;</div>

<div>Why does minimizing a simple file seem so hard to do in Windows 8? &nbsp;Surely I am missing something.</div>

<p>Where are you downloading the file from and what steps are you using to open it and look at it in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the JPG or PDF is open and you are lookng at it, what program are you using to look at them?&nbsp; Do you see a name of the program it is inside of at the top of the window when you view the files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say "minimizing" a file, do you literally mean you are clicking the _ icon in the top-right of the window to "shrink" the windows down to the taskbar?</p>

<div>In gmail, I am downloading the attachment. &nbsp;I have no idea what program it is opening in since Windows 8 no longer tells you anything helpful like that. &nbsp;There is no top window in Windows 8. &nbsp;You can see the image and that's it. &nbsp;Right clicking leads to
 no where. &nbsp;The only way to minimize is to grab-hand it from the top and pull it down. &nbsp;Then it disappears (not minimized). &nbsp;I have no idea where it goes after that. &nbsp;</div>

Then I suspect it's opening in the default app - Microsoft Reader</p>

<p>So you get no menu bar at the BOTTOM of the window when you right-click?</p>
<p>See here for what should appear. <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=E60CE3038809E993!23820&amp;authkey=!AKV8bJxr-mli7yw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you grab it and pull it down that does NOT minimize it - that CLOSES it.</p>
<p>There IS no "minimize" in the traditional sense - move your cursor to the bottom left, click on Start Page icon.</p>
<p>All your "minimised" apps&nbsp;now appear as thumbnails on the left hand side of the screen when you move your cursor to the top left corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you OPEN the attachment, it goes to a temp folder. If you want to use it further, Right-Click ON THE ATTACHMENT icon and choose "save as". You can then save it in whatever folder you like for future use.</p>

<h2>            Can not enable Microsoft Wifi Direct Virtual Adapter</h2>
                    <p>the goal is I want to activate <strong>Mobile hotspot </strong>that use this driver Microsoft Wifi Direct Virtual Adapter #4 in order to work. apparently only this adapter, the other virtual adapter didnt work to activate mobile hotspot.<br />
</p>
<p>but the my Microsoft Wifi Direct Virtual Adapter is somewhat RANDOMLY enabled and disabled itself between Windows session!</p>
<p><br />
when the driver is disabled (greyed out) I can not enable it because <strong>there IS NOT enable driver option</strong>.. its magically gone! (so dont answer me to go to Device Manager &gt; right click driver &gt; enable.. its not there!)<br />
well, how to activate it PERMANENTLY?<br />
<br />
in properties status there's error:<br />
"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)<br />
To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."<br />
</p>
<p>(well, i can not "reconnect" it because its inside the laptop, duh)</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows already told me that I'm using latest driver for that driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, command <strong>netsh wlan start hostednetwork </strong>also did not work. cmd says cannot start hosted network.<br />
</p>
<p>any help?</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if you ever worked this out. I've got an asus eeebook. It's not throwing an error but I've got a full hard drive. with a red warning. I feel for you because you obviously put in work. So much that the answers to your question annoy even me. "Right
 click on you c drive." Good grief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ssd mounted as a d drive on the eeebook. I've set it up for my file history. That wasn't my original intention but while very handy, onedrive is unpredictable and I haven't found strong help files from MS. I'd like to set up the ssd for storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My C &amp; D directory structures are both convoluted and, as a rule, I don't touch registry files. I'm not that smart. My "D drive" (my mounted ssd) seems to be a backup of the c drive, but buried in a directory structure under a folder D:\File History\a heck
 of a lot of folders and subfolders here, with weird file names file types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to ditch to free up space, or how to set it up my D drive with out messing with registry files. If I do mess with the registry I need solid tested instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have figured this out by now, but new to tiny hard drives and onedrive I had to switch gears and discover file history instead. I lost a few important folders when I used Refresh You PC. The tool that won't lose your files. LOL. I drag my feet on upgrades,
 admittedly to a fault. I'd love to work the bugs out of windows 10, but I'm a waitress who's presently late for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This task is likely elementary stuff for you. &nbsp;I could have clicked on the MS fix that filtered to the top of my google search, but I scrolled down and clicked on your question instead. I lean toward the dark side of IT but don't have your training or knowledge.
 I'm working my way back into the field after leaving to be a family caregiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a link perchance with accurate instructions for expanding storage with an ssd in 8.1 w/ bing? Would you be kind enough to take your time &amp; post it?&nbsp;</p>

 Pictures, Videos, Music) choose Properties, go to Location tab, click the Move Button and move the location (and files by answering yes to the popup)&nbsp;to the corresponding folder on the SD card.. OneDrive files should be being saved to the SD card (perhaps

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>So I received&nbsp;my&nbsp;Xbox One Scorpio Edition&nbsp;on 7th Nov.&nbsp;I take my Scorpio out of the box and set it all up and as we all would expect all is working fine. Initial set up worked and signing in to my XBL account went well and hooked up my external HDD.&nbsp;I then&nbsp;decided to see what this console was&nbsp;capable of and launched F1 2017 (stored on external HDD)&nbsp;in 4K and during the start up of the game launching the screen went black and the Xbox One X power button was flashing every 2 seconds and then&nbsp;a loud electrical buzz came from the console where the sound speaker is what plays the turn on&nbsp;chime and then turns off.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Upon trying to turn the console on their is no success, I've unplugged it to try other wall outlets and still nothing.

            <p>I'm having the same issue as well. I factory reseted my console without external hard drive hoping that'll fix the issue and it did for like 15 minutes. I played Skate 3 for 5 minutes without running into any issues so I figured that the problem went away so I went to play some Call Of Duty: WW2, and while I was just chilling in the headquater, the screen started spazzing out, game crashed, external hard drive disconnects, and the wifi stopped working. Wifi would work again if I&nbsp;hard restart my xbox but even then, it's only a matter of time until my xbox stop working. I'm really hoping that it's something Microsoft can fix through a patch and that it's not a hardware issue and more of a software issue. I hope you get yours fixed or get a replacement as soon as possible!</p>

<h2>            Residen Evil 6 de Xbox One en Mexico esta demasiado caro , 20 dolares no son 645 pesos -.- porfavor cambienlo gracias &#38;lt&#59;3</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas tardes a toda la comunidad de xbox, les quiero informar que a la gente que se valla a comprar el Resident evil 6 de Xbox One en digital no lo hagan, bueno en mexico no hasta que cambien el precio. En todo los demas paises esta a 20$ o 20 Euros lo

<br />
Muchas gracias espero su aportacion en comentarios o solucionarlo , Gracias a todos &lt;3</p>

<p>Hola,</p>
<p>Busque ayuda en soporte técnico y me dicen que efectivamente ese es el precio. Se me hace extraño, pues 20usd equivale aproximadamente a 350 con el cambio de moneda actual. Con el precio que tienen en lista, es como si el dolar lo cambiaran a 35 pesos por
 dolar. No veo que lo mismo pase con otros juegos, sólo con Resident Evil 6. Espero lo resuelvan, porque en este caso sale más barato comprarlo en físico que en digital.</p>

<p>vi que en gameplanet el precio total en formato ficico es de 499 pesos mexicanos, se me hace un precio muy injusto, de hecho los juegos digitales deven ser un 30 o 20 % mas varatos que en formato ficico.</p>

            Yes, you can partition your MacBook Pro's hard drive and install Windows 7 along-side of Mac OS X, using a utility such as Apple's Boot Camp. This should be included on your Mac under /Applications/Utilities.<br />

            I too have started playing Halo Wars 2 and i thought of this same thing. i loved LOTR BFME 2 as a kid, i loved the mechanics as well along side game play. I do hope it will become backwards compatible.

I can only suggest that you wait for whichever game to be added, and hope. Which is what I am doing sadly.<br />

<p>Move your mouse to the bottom right (or top right)of your screen/ A charms bar will appear. Click on the Settings icon (cog wheel). When the Settings bar appears, click on the Power option. From the Power option click restart, shutdown or sleep, whichever
 you prefer.</p>

<h2>            Computer goes to black screen after &#39;preparing to repair&#39; message following Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I would be really grateful if someone could help.</p>
<p>After failing to install the last Windows 10 update on a Toshiba Satellite Laptop, it finally installed and said I needed to restart. After restarting the computer began to start as normal - manufacturers screen, then a blue screen with 'preparing automatic
 repair.' After this, it went to a black screen and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following guides online about how to reboot and even reinstall Windows 10 from a DVD and form a USB, nothing happens beyond the black screen. We can get into the Toshiba page, but not get to any partitioned area or boot from the laptop. It appears as if
 Windows has vanished!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being technical, it has been a case of following instructions for the most common solutions, but are we missing something? Up until this update, the laptop had been working perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. (apologies if this is in the wrong section.)</p>

Do you have a second monitor you could attach?&nbsp; Black screen can mean that the OS has decided (inexplicably) to use a secondary monitor and hence switch the Display configuration to Second Screen Only.&nbsp; If you are past the Lock screen and at least as far as
 the Login screen you can use Win+P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp; In the case of the above hypothesis that would switch it to Extend which might then show you something on your laptop screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try starting Narrator even at the Lock screen by pressing Win+Ctrl+Enter.&nbsp; Then try pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete to try to get past the Lock screen.&nbsp; Listen to Narrator and hear what it thinks is possible.&nbsp; Press Tab to navigate.&nbsp; If you get past
 the Lock screen a possibility would be to get to the Power button's menu for its Restart button at which you could press a Shift- key with Enter or Spacebar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your booting from an alternate device tactic, it's not clear if you have changed the device boot order (e.g. via BIOS settings) in order to make that work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
