            <b>None.&nbsp; It is a scam</b><br />
<br />
<br />
It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:<br />

<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email, they could
 have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case
 since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such ‚Äúsales‚Äù ‚Äì in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be good. In
 others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System
 Restore as will be suggested shortly ‚Äì then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10. The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information
 about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard drive).
 If you aren‚Äôt prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network, ISP and
 perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won‚Äôt do ‚Äì they‚Äôll still be the same until you revise them). There‚Äôs no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online
 scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If so:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start here - https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (http://www.answerdesk.com/) in the US at this time.
 After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can start here: https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/ (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In other regions not served by the link above, go here: http://Support.microsoft.com/securityand go to the ‚Äúassisted support‚Äù or contact us menu.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions that were
 charged to it without disputing them ‚Äì and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund - but
 if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities and
 the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related to resolving
 the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).<br />

<p>Beside that little non-working&nbsp;yellow non-smiling icon, Microsoft also has problems with&nbsp;the feedback (receiving them at turtle speed).</p>
<p>You are saying "We are aware of this issue and we are working on it". It seems to me&nbsp; that the majority of all Microsoft Support Engineers&nbsp; are&nbsp; always giving this particular answer when they don't have a clue on how it could be fixed,&nbsp;" OR&nbsp; "&nbsp;Microsoft
 is not giving them sufficient info's as to what the real problem is.&nbsp; My theory is that Microsoft did not properly prepare and anticipate&nbsp; the overwhelming pouring of feedback from possibly a few million computer users from all over the World. And for the
 feedback to operate properly, Microsoft would have to shut it down for a few days to fix it. Microsoft is not going to shut&nbsp; it down. To&nbsp;Microsoft shutting it down, would be, in their " WAY of THINKING ", admitting guilt.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<p>I also believe Microsoft is doing a good job with this Windows Technical Preview Evaluation copy, Build 9879; but not a GREAT job in all spectrums&nbsp; of this "Technical Preview". It was poorly&nbsp; "Written". Some of the "Codes", also poorly "Written". There is
 no comparison between the "1st Build Release" and the release of "Build 9879". Why was this Build 9879, not as good, or BETTER than the 1st Build release?.&nbsp; Microsoft&nbsp;did not go forward, but BACKWARD with this build 9879. Also some of the updates they gave
 us for this latest Build were not what a lots of users were expecting, in some areas it degraded the performance of this latest Build. Also, they added some new applications,&nbsp;and&nbsp; changed some exiting&nbsp;applications ( example: "Cleanmgr" )&nbsp;that combined, are
 performing&nbsp;at "TURTLE Speed".</p>
<p>There is after all, a&nbsp;difference between "good" and "GREAT".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an add-on to my previous reply to "SoozyQue".</p>
<p>I just added the feature "Media Center" to Build9879. I purchased it from Microsoft a few months ago.</p>
<p>After Microsoft downloaded it, installed it and restarted my computer. I was amazingly surprised in reading the bottom right corner the following : " Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation copy. Build 9879 ".</p>
<p>Does any one has an idea of what is the meaning of this ?. I am 100% sure&nbsp;Windows 8.1 did not have a Build 9879 !!. And why did Microsoft removed the words : " Windows Technical Preview Evaluation Copy ? ". And my System now shows that I am back or have
 now Windows 8.1 Pro With Media Center installed. What is this nonsense ?.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f846c4f-ca22-4949-b88b-e832a8f1ee6a" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft I think you are doing a GREAT job with this Win 10 testing.</p>
<p>My Feedback (not the IE one) works fine. I don't see any need to "shut it down for a few days".</p>
<p>As a veteran Beta user I'm very aware of the fact that &nbsp;MS and other software companies are not going to release fixes 1 at a time unless it's a severe issue.</p>
<p>Many fixes and Feedback suggestions will probably be released in the next build.</p>
<p>And believe me I know that there is the stray bug or so that a cause/fix may never be found for.</p>

<p>SoozyQue,</p>
<p>Against by better judgment, I am replying.</p>
<p>I also believe Microsoft is doing a good job with this Windows Technical Preview Evaluation copy, Build 9879; but not a GREAT job in all spectrums&nbsp; of this "Technical Preview". It was poorly&nbsp; "Written". Some of the "Codes", also poorly "Written". There is
 no comparison between the "1st Build Release" and the release of "Build 9879". Why was this Build 9879, not as good, or BETTER than the 1st Build release?.&nbsp; Microsoft&nbsp;did not go forward, but BACKWARD with this build 9879. Also some of the updates they gave
 us for this latest Build were not what a lots of users were expecting, in some areas it degraded the performance of this latest Build. Also, they added some new applications,&nbsp;and&nbsp; changed some exiting&nbsp;applications ( example: "Cleanmgr" )&nbsp;that combined, are
 performing&nbsp;at "TURTLE Speed".</p>
<p>There is after all, a&nbsp;difference between "good" and "GREAT".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hilary, <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that your Inbox is full, that's why your phone is forced to delete messages automatically after a day or so. As much as we would like to assist you with your Nokia C1, this is beyond our scope of support as your device is already outdated. But you
 can still use the Web to search for the best resolution. <br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have any other concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Home client programs crashing at random, infrequent times</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Community!</p>
<p>I'm experiencing a serious issue with my Office 365 Home Office client products that are installed on my Surface Pro 4 (running Win10). This randomly started happening about two weeks ago when my Outlook client would crash at random, frequent times throughout
 the day. Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote have experienced the same issue, but not with the same frequency of Outlook, which crashes anywhere between 10-15 times per day.
</p>
<p>I've worked with O365 Support and have done the Quick Repair, Online Repair, as well as a full uninstall and reinstall off the Office client bits, and nothing has helped, which makes be believe it is a hardware compatibility issue with my Surface 4, or something
 more endemic with Win10.</p>
<p>I'm happy to provide more details if it might help solve the issue - I'm near the point of returning my Surface Pro 4 and going with a Dell or Sony or other more stable platform but hoping to stick with my MS product! Thanks!</p>

            <div>You have 3 options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Email (though not calendar/tasks/contacts) shouldn't be a problem if you have IMAP enabled on the Notes server (i.e. Lotus Domino), as WP7 lets you sync your email via IMAP. Alternatively, though with less functionality, you can use POP3 if your Domino
 server has that enabled. Check with your IT department whether either of these is possible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For full integration with the 'phone's built-in email, People hub, tasks, and calendar, IBM's Lotus Notes Traveler product is currently available in beta for Windows Phone. Get your IT department to register for the beta: go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/lotus-notes-traveler-and-windows-phone-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/lotus-notes-traveler-and-windows-phone-7</a>,
 go right to the bottom of the comments (14 Sept 2012 comment), and contact Ed Brill as he suggests. This does require use of the most up to date Domino release though.</div>
<div>(A general point: I am very encouraged by the state of the conversation on the page I've just linked to, by the way - there are now loads of people asking for this support. It's very clear how much difference Nokia's WP7 'phones have made to the perception
 of Windows Phone in this segment of the market - I suspect most of the posters there inhabit some sort of small to medium enterprise.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The third option: have a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.commontime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.commontime.com/</a>, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.commontime.com/msuite/corporate-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.commontime.com/msuite/corporate-email/</a>.
 Despite the name this does appear to include calendar, tasks, and contact synchronisation as well as email. Their 'individual' Notes email solution doesn't list Windows Phone as a supported device OS, but the 'corporate' one does have support for Windows Phone.
 Again probably best to get your IT team to have a word with CommonTime.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please post back to let us know how you get on - I am keen to ensure that Notes users coming to this forum for help get the most up to date evidence - let's get these two great products working together properly!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

My problem is this : I can log on to Skype.com, and I can use Skype For Web through a browser, but when I try to log in to the standalone app, it stops me with : "You've tried to sign in too many times", and I can't even log in with the password + Captcha.<br />
I know I have the correct password, I can log in to the website. This is on Windows 7. This just started happening a couple days ago.<br />
Anyone have an answer? Skype and their technicians certainly don't.&nbsp;<br />

            No, there is no way to update your phone to windows phone 7.&nbsp; There was an announcement more than a year ago that no windows mobile phones would be upgradeable to windows phone 7.

<p>The operating system of WP7 is done from ground up, and is not an update to the 6.5 OS.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not possible for a WP 6.5 to be upgraded to WP7. The platform has changed. No carrier or OEM would provide such upgrade.</p>

            The carrier is the name of the company that your get your cell phone services from.&nbsp; Sounds like you are one of the lucky few whose carrier actually updated&nbsp; the phone through the UPDATE feature on the phone AND whose carrier actually provided an update
 to Windows Mobile 6.5.3.

<p>Well, I'm glad you figured it out and that's great that you got some additional applications with the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really enjoying my windows phone 7, but there are a lot of windows mobile fans that have been supremely disappointed in their windows phone7 devices.&nbsp; There are some significant differences between the windows mobile OS and the windows phone OS, and
 while I find windows phone 7 a refreshing change from my windows mobile phone, I am still carrying around my HTC Touch Diamond2 (along with my windows phone 7).</p>

<h2>            This build of Windows will expire soon</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a popup saying that my build of Windows will expire soon, I am part of the Windows Insider Preview Program and at the bottom right corner of the screen it says the following: Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Evaluation copy. Build 17686.rd_prerelease.180603-1447.
 I am worried because I don't know if it will automatically revert back to the version before the preview copy or if I will need to put in a product key again or what. It will expire in about 6 months but still it has me kind of worried. Please respond, Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Mac - Microsoft Office 2008 won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Originally my Mac mini Sierra 10.12.2 computer was operating excruciatingly slow (Beachball all of the time). After going through all web suggestions, I finally followed one that suggested I simply delete my original Admin User account and set up another
 user account. I transferred all files to the cloud and to an external hard drive. Apparently the hard drive picked up all of the applications/files that were on the New User side??? From that point forward I could not open Office. I have deleted the original
 Admin User account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since followed suggestions that included setting up. a second copy of Office - nothing worked. The Application appears in my Applications list with all of the files - Word, Excel, etc but nothing will open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael Thank you</p>

<h2>            Can I changes the Search Engine from Bing to Google in the &#34;Images - Online Pictures&#34; button in PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>So I have been trying and researching on how to change the search engine from Bing to Google in the menu bar "Images" "Online Images" section of PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions but it didn't seem to work and has not changed it from Bing to either Google, Yahoo, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wanted to possibly add in a selection where i could choose another search engine be it a sight where i have a subscription to and get our icons from and add it in here, if i can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to do this successfully? Or is this something that PowerPoint does not allow us to change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that why I have not been successful in the instructions I have followed?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 inbox not syncing</h2>
                    <ol>
<li>I have been running Office 365 Home on my PC and using Outlook for email. </li><li>I got a new Windows Lumia 550 phone a couple days ago and use the mobile version of Outlook on the phone for email.</li><li>This morning I noticed the inboxes on my PC and phone did not contain the same email messages, so I took a look at my email in Outlook.com webmail.</li><li>My inbox on Outlook.com seems to have everything as does Outlook on my new phone. However, Outlook on my PC is missing several emails that the other apps received today.</li><li>I have restarted Outlook on my PC and done a manual send/receive several times and the "missing emails" have not shown up.</li><li>As I am writing this post, a new email appeared in all three inboxes as it should. This new email is from a sender who sent me an email earlier this morning that only shows online and on my phone--hasn't shown up in Outlook on my PC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any suggestions? I am running a PC with Windows 10. All updates are installed.<br />

Thanks...<br />

            <p>The account is a Live Mail account and is accessed through Outlook.com. It is set up as IMAP in Outlook on my PC. When I set up the account in Outlook on my phone I entered my email address and password and let the app set it up automatically (IMAP).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning when I checked my email and compared it on the three devices, once again the phone and website inboxes match, but the desktop version of Outlook is missing a couple emails. Strangely, it is not the same ones as yesterday. So the problem doesn't
 appear it be a particular email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This reminded me of a problem I have had in the past with Outlook 365's inbox. The inbox would tell me I had an unread email, but everything in the inbox had been read. When I went to Outlook.com there was an email that hadn't synced/downloaded to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me the problem must be with Outlook 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>By default, Excel automatically re-calculates formulas in your Worksheet when you open it. You may have to disable this option to avoid the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Formulas &gt; Scroll down to the Calculation options section and select Manual to prevent the formulas from being calculated automatically. Close the Workbook and re-open again.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Also, tell us when does the Excel freezes? Is it the when entering values in Worksheet that contains the formulas? Check if this issue occurs in other Excel documents as well.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I look forward to your reply to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 16.21 &#43; Google Calendar - Dismissed Reminders Randomly Re-appear</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company uses GMail and Google Calendar as our primary e-mail/calendar provider.&nbsp; I use a Macbook Pro 2017 on OSX v10.14.2 (Mojave) and Outlook v16.21 (190117) via Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Outlook, but have had issues with reminders re-appearing randomly since I switched to Outlook back in June.&nbsp; I often get reminders that are weeks and even months old, popping up like they are brand new.&nbsp; I always dismiss my reminders when I do get
 them - and find myself clicking the "Dismiss All" button every time I get a listing of N past events that have already completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that other folks here who have the same configuration (OSX + Google Calendar + Outlook) have the same issue, making it seem more and more like an Outlook bug than some corruption on all of our machines.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said - I wanted to post this question and see if anyone has any ideas.&nbsp; This is one of those little things that drives you crazy over time - and I'd love to solve it.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Not a huge problem - just an annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks Nemanja,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the steps above this morning.&nbsp; As soon as I re-added my work Gmail account in the new profile, I received 120 calendar reminders:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63d2abcc-55a7-40c5-94aa-f2492869081a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63d2abcc-55a7-40c5-94aa-f2492869081a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I dismissed them all.&nbsp; I'll let you know if they keep coming back now.&nbsp; Hopefully they stay dismissed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care,</p>
<p>-Kyle</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the issue persists.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeatedly get reminders about overdue events - for things I've dismissed days, weeks, and months ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56b1dabe-70e4-4e6e-b388-c09dc8acb87e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56b1dabe-70e4-4e6e-b388-c09dc8acb87e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>There doesn't really seem to be any rhyme or reason to when these reminders appear.&nbsp; I usually get about 5-10 "ghost" reminders a day for past events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like it must have something to do with google calendar integration on outlook for mac.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p><p>I did check for updates, but there are none:</p>
<p>"There are no updates available for your Microsoft software at this time.&nbsp; Please check again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted to do the following:</p>
<p>* Disable reminders completely as you recommended above.</p>
<p>* Sync my OSX calendar with my gmail account, and turn on reminders in that calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good - outlook doesn't give me any reminders - but they come through via calendar.&nbsp; Hopefully I don't start getting old reminders through apple calendar now.&nbsp; :)</p>

            I have a similar problem. I have a new pc with windows 10 installed. Previously I was using vista but then as skype was no longer supported I used skype on my android phone, which worked fine. But now with my new laptop my contacts list has disappeared.
 Any help to recover it please?

            Many Thanks Joseph, that fixed the problem. Strange but when I logged in previously I used my email address or phone details to do so, and nothing appeared, but when I used my skype name as you recommended it worked fine, my full contact list was there...weird

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Glad that you were able to log in to the correct account and find your contacts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other Skype accounts were created when you used your email address and phone number in signing in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just need to log in using the same credentials you've used in creating them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not wish to use the other accounts, you can just disregard them and not access them. It will eventually close out due to inactivity (if unused for about 2 years or so).
