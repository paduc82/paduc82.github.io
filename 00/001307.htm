<h2>            Can&#39;t change language of Office 365 installation to German on one computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a subscription to Office 365 that lets me install it on 5 computers. On my main computer I have Windows and Office in English. I just got a new computer with German Windows 10 pre-installed and wanted to have Office with a German UI on that machine.
 As soon as I logged into the new computer with my Windows ID all the Office Apps that were pre-installed on the machine were automatically activated. In my Office account I can now see that I have used up two installations of the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really happy about that until I noticed that the Office apps on the new German computer are in English, even though in the language settings it says that the display language will be in the language of the OS. I have tried logging in and out several
 times, but I can't get the language to turn to German. I really only need Word and Outlook on this computer which my husband will be using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought of trying to repair Office or uninstalling it on this computer and doing a re-install, but Office is not listed in the control panel under Programs and Features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a restriction on an Office 365 subscription saying that all installs have to be in the same language?&nbsp; If not, what can I do to change the language to German?&nbsp; I really don't feel like digging out my old German Office 2007 and installing that. :-(</p>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Did you try going to this website, select German, download and install the Language pack?

            Hi EWindow,
<br />
<br />In Office 365/2016, Office 2013, and Office 2010, the language options are in the Set the Office Language Preferences dialog box. The display and help languages can be set independently. For example, you could have everything match the language of your operating system, or you could use a combination of languages for your operating system, editing, display, and Help.
<br />Editing and Proofing
<br />
<br />    Within any Office application, select File &gt; Options &gt; Language.
<br />    The dialog box where you can add, select, or remove the language Office uses for editing and proofing tools.
<br />
<br />    If your language already appears among the editing languages click Set as Default. Otherwise select the language from the Add additional editing languages list then click the Add button. The new language will appear in the list of editing languages.
<br />
<br />If the Keyboard Layout shows as Enabled you're all set for editing. If it says Not enabled in the Keyboard Layout column follow these steps to enable it:
<br />
<br />    Click the Not enabled link.
<br />
<br />    In the Add Languages dialog box, click Add a language, select your language in the list, and then click Add.
<br />
<br />    Close the Add Languages dialog box. Your language should display as Enabled under Keyboard Layout in the Choose Editing Languages section.
<br />
<br />Under Proofing, if your language shows as Installed you're ready to go. Otherwise click Not installed and Office will take you to a page where you can download the necessary Language Accessory Pack for that language. Follow the instructions on that page to download and install the pack, then come back to the Office Language Preferences dialog box to confirm that it's now installed.
<br />
<br />Note: If you're using Office in the Microsoft Store, clicking Not installed will take you to Windows Language Settings where you can select your desired language and it will be downloaded, if necessary, automatically.
<br />Display and Help Languages
<br />
<br />Within any Office application, select File &gt; Options &gt; Language.
<br />The dialog that allows you to select the language that Office will use for it's buttons, menus and help.
<br />
<br />If you've already set your Microsoft Windows display language to be the language you want Office to display in you can leave this set to Match Microsoft Windows. Otherwise select your language and click Set as Default to move that language to the top of the list. The language that is listed first is the one Office will use for its menus and buttons.
<br />
<br />Note: If you're using Office in the Microsoft Store and you want to change your default display language go to the Region and Language settings in Windows 10. Click the language you want to set as the default, and choose Set as default.
<br />
<br />Repeat to configure your help language if you want to.
<br />If the language you want isn't available...
<br />
<br />Download the proper Language Accessory Pack for the language you want to use from this page: Language Accessory Packs for Office (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/language-accessory-pack-for-office-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/langua...</a>). The Language Accessory Pack contains the display and proofing tools for most languages, but you can still choose to have your display in one language and editing in another.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0f04993-5db5-40d6-9ffe-8d321317d26e?upload=true" />

<p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The programs are now in German but I'm not sure your tip solved the problem, since I keep getting an error message saying the language pack installation failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't downloaded the Language pack. I followed the link you sent and tried to download and install the language pack. The language pack wouldn't install. I got an error code and a description saying that might hard disk might be too small (it isn't -
 it is a brand new empty one) or I might not have Internet access (I did). I tried several times to install the language pack but always got the same error. I looked up the error code and it pointed me to a tool to deinstall Office. I ran the tool and re-booted.
 To my surprise, all the Office apps were still there. And they were in German. So hooray!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still can't select German as a proofing language. And the setup for the language pack still fails.</p>

            Okay, maybe you have some trace of prior installations giving you trouble.
<br />
<br />Uninstall everything with this.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall</a>
<br />
<br />Install it again and see if you can install the language pack.
<br />
<br />If not, try to diagnose the problem with this tool.

<p>Thank you Pedro for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that my problem is even more complicated than I originally supposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this computer I created a default Admin account for me to install everything and a local user account for my husband without Admin privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that:</p>
<ul>
<li>when I log on with the admin account (which is the same Windows account I used to subscribe to Office), Word, Excel and Outlook are all in German, including proofing tools.</li><li>when I log on with the local account, only Word is in German (including proofing tools)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So the language German is basically available, just not in all apps for the local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need German for the local account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will deactivate the office installation and then try the uninstall tool and see if things work after a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: when I started to download the uninstall tool from the link you posted, I discovered that it is the same tool that I already ran. After running it Office was still on the computer and I still couldn't find Office in the Control Panel. I will try the
 other tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I just ran the diagnostics tool and said I wanted to uninstall Office. The tool ran and then announced that no Office products were found on the computer. Nevertheless I can activate the suite and start and use all the programs. This is crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next attempt will be to try to ignore the current installation and re-install from Office.com. I'm curious to see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I re-installed from Office.com and now all the apps are in German for both the Admin account and the local account. So that problem seems to be solved.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            set up different overtime works in MS project 2010</h2>
                    <p>Actually I have one question in mind, lets say if I have one task with 3 month duration, and for some reasons I have different overtime works over the task execution period, for instance in the first month 4 hours a day, second month 2 hours a day and last
 month 3 hours a day and lets say overtime pay rate through task duration is same or different as you wish. do you have any idea about how Microsoft project let’s to set up such condition ?

            You may certainly change the calendar to allow 12 hours working day in Month 1, 10 hour working day in Month 2, and 11 hour working day in Month 3 - however all of the work will be at a standard rate cost, not overtime.<br />

            When you assign overtime work, Project will spread the overtime hours evenly across the duration of the task.&nbsp; You may add the overtime work field to the Task Usage or Resource Usage view - however it does not appear to be editable.<br />

<h2>            Email address fields showing &#34;Full Name&#34; rather than &#34;Display Name&#34;</h2>
                    <p>We have many clients that are couples and rather than creating two separate contacts we have a single contact card for the couple which contains both of their emails and both of their cell phone numbers.&nbsp; When entering email addresses I change the Display
 As field to read just the individual's name, rather than the full couple name.&nbsp; Example fields for hypothetical couple John and Mary Smith:</p>
<p>Full Name:&nbsp; John and Mary Smith</p>
<p>File As:&nbsp; Smith, John and Mary</p>
<p>Email 1:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Display As:&nbsp; John Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [manually edited from default "John and Mary Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)"]</p>
<p>Email 2: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Display As:&nbsp; Mary Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have the contact open and click the Email button to create a new email, it will create an email with the following in the To: field</p>
<p>To:&nbsp;&nbsp; John Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***); Mary Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) <br />
</p>
<p>Here's where the problem comes in:&nbsp; If I hit Compose to open a generic new email and begin typing the names into the To: field, the only options it gives me ones that include the Full Name rather than the Display As name.&nbsp; So if I begin to type in "John
 Smith", the only option I can select is:&nbsp; "John and Mary Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)" and if I type Mary Sm.. the only option is "John and Mary Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So by that method i end up with an Address field that has two "John and Mary Smiths"
 with the different addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I can do such to force Outlook to use the Display As name when I search for people in in the To: line ?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Hi Michael B-AJM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click <strong>New Email </strong>to create a new email and then type in "John Smith" or "Mary Smith" in To field, it will show as "John and Mary Smiths", it's an expected behavior. Since the auto-complete list just show the Full Name of the contact,
 and&nbsp;"John and Mary Smiths" are the full name of "johnsmith@mail.net" and "marysmith@mail.net".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to show separate names in To field, you should click the Email button after open the contact as you mentioned. Thus, if you want to use Display As name as the auto-complete list name, I recommend you to submit your feedback via
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Uservoice</a> to let our product team know it. There are many feature released based on customers' feedback. Looking forward to your understanding.</p>
<p>

<div>I suspect what is happening is you are still using the overall account password and not the app generated password.&nbsp; You will still get mail until you log the device out (which is a good idea anyway) and then you will need to generate a password
 (on the pc in outlook.com) and "trust" the mobile device. After which it should not do that.</div>

<h2>            My android phone &#34;forgets&#34; my account information each time I restart my phone</h2>
                    Every time I try to start the Outlook app on my Samsung Galaxy phone, it appears like I'm using the app for the first time. I have to reenter all of my login details, server, etc. I've also tried adding the account info to settings&gt;accounts&gt;corporate and
 same thing. However I don't have any problems using the app on my Galaxy Tab 2. I figure something in my settings is off, but what??

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed with the investigation, please answer the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Did you already try to uninstall and reinstall the application from your mobile device?</li><li>
How about trying a different Microsoft account in the app, did the issue re-occur?
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your trouble syncing your account using Outlook App. This issue normally occurs due to bad caches and bad settings after the update. As an initial troubleshooting, you need to clear your
 mobile cache, reinstall Outlook App, and reconfigure your account. </span></p>

                    <p>With the official release of Windows 10, I have tried to update to the latest version of Windows 10: Home Insider Preview edition.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My current preview build is version 10130, and I have been attempting to install update&nbsp;</span><strong>KB3070677&nbsp;</strong>for
 almost a month now, meaning that I have been sort of stranded on preview build 10130 for quite some time. Whenever I check for updates via windows update, a new update called&nbsp;<strong>'June Update for 64x based Systems (KB3070677)'</strong>&nbsp;is detected, downloaded,
 and then installed. Everything seems to go fine so far...until I try installing the update by restarting my computer. Upon the process of my laptop restarting and installing the updates, it's completion goes as follows:&nbsp;<strong>30% &gt; 67% &gt; Update fails to
 install.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>*Prior to reaching 67% install completion, text then appears stating: "Windows couldn't finish installing the updates. Reverting changes made to Windows. Don't turn off your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer then restarts itself, and attempts the install process about 4-5 times until eventually "giving up" and booting back to the start screen. After about 30 seconds to a minute, a notification pops up saying "<strong>Windows Updates Failed to Install".&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

</p><p>I recently found a fix to this issue myself without the need of contacting Microsoft Support. This fix not only fixes the update issues, but also installs the latest version of Windows 10. Don't worry, I have tried the below steps and confirm that they have
 fixed my problem. Feel free to let me know if my steps have helped any of you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Steps to Fix the Problem</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></li><li>Scroll down to near bottom of the page until you see two separate download options. One is for 64-bit based operating systems, while the other is meant for 32-bit based systems. The download links should look like this:</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c370950-8e23-4acc-8f95-e35d98840723" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a 64-bit operating system, click on the bottom download button. If you have a 32-bit operating system, click on the top download button.</li><li>When the download is complete, run the installer.&nbsp;<strong>This installer will install the latest version of Windows 10 onto your computer, while uninstalling the preview build version you currently have installed.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to keep your personal
 files, programs and apps, and saved settings, make sure you check each save option when prompted to.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The setup/installation process will most likely take a while. In my case it took about 4-5 hours. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although, this may not be the case for you. A recommendation would be to plug a charger into &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your desktop or laptop to make sure it doesn't shut off during the process.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When the setup of Windows 10 is complete, login to your online Microsoft account or local account within your computer like usual. Wait for Windows to setup your settings, apps, programs, games, etc. you had before you started the Windows 10 installation
 - (Only occurs if you chose to save these aspects during the install launcher.)</li><li><strong>(Done)</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*<span>Note</span>:</strong>&nbsp;Remember, the Windows 10 install launcher, whether it be for 64-bit or 32-bit, will uninstall your current preview build version, and replace it with the latest version of Windows 10. In my case, it gave me the&nbsp;<span>official
 July 29th release of Windows 10</span>.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I really hope this guide helped you and others, I spent a good amount of time typing this. If you have any further questions, please PM me or simply reply here. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Having a similar issue with Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview, 10130. <strong>KB3070677
</strong>update does not show in updates history. Manually downloaded from Microsoft Update Catalog and attempted to install, but was greeted with the message<em> "is already installed on this computer."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Laptop was running legitimate OEM Windows 8.1 prior to Windows 10 IP installation. As it was OEM there was no backup media for 8.1 supplied. Ironically laptop was bought specifically to be a test machine so it would be nice to keep it up to date!</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong><em>UPDATE 12hrs Later: </em></strong>Left the laptop on but not in use for 12 hours and suddenly it sprang in to life, rebooting itself and updating to build 10240.
<em>Magic!</em></p>

<h2>            Hardware issues</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I'm sure there will be many hardware issues with there being so many different devices out there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've spent this<span>&nbsp;
</span>morning working on my notebook and Windows 10 pro Technical preview evaluation copy&nbsp;. Build 9926</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I had mixed feelings about whether or not I would revert to Win8.1 as I just couldn't turn off the touchpad
 and it was awful .</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I tracked down an HP download for the driver and installed<span>&nbsp;
</span>it in compatibility mode. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Almost gave up as it didn't make any difference.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I messed about a bit re-booting a couple of times and there was an unexpected windows update.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Suddenly synaptic's touchpad was there and I was able to disable!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Just need to sort out getting the function key to work now -This is active in bios but doesn't do a thing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I downloaded the drivers for that too but so far it's not working</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>oh and the vpn!&nbsp; Doesn't like windows 10 one bit.... working on that one!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Any ideas for these two problems anyone?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Access 2010 - Issue with Navigation path to set property</h2>
                    <p>I’ve got a client application in which I’m using a Navigational control to hold a number of tabs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The forms in each tab are similar in that they consist of a number of entry fields and a common subform which lists interested parties.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The contents of the interested parties subform vary dependening on the related ‘main’ form.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A GroupID <span>&nbsp;</span>tempvar <span>&nbsp;</span>is used in the query for the contents of the Interested Party subform.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Essentially <span>&nbsp;</span>when a tab is pressed the open event of the relevant main form sets a value in the GroupID
<span>&nbsp;</span>tempvar and a requery is run - this ensures that the subform list of interested parties is correct (without the requery<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>tempvar and a requery is run - this ensures that the subform list of interested parties is correct (without the requery<span>&nbsp;
</span>the contents of a list would not<span>&nbsp; </span>be correct as the GroupID is not known until load time).
</p>
<p>The above process works fine and the correct information is displayed.<span>&nbsp; </span>
However, dependent on circumstances I sometimes want to make certain fields Visible/Invisible in the list when the form is displayed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I thought that the following VBA would work. Note that this is contained within the same event procedure that contains the setting of the tempvar but after the tempvar is set as it needs this<span>&nbsp;
</span>information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">'DoCmd.SetProperty "Forms!frmclntNavigationForm!NavigationSubform.Form!frmclntIPList.Form!IntPartyName", acPropertyVisible, TempVars!Visible'<span>
</span>T</p>
<p>However when it attempts to execute I get:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">'Run Time error ‘32004’ </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The control name ‘Forms!frmclntNavigationForm!NavigationSubform.Form!frmclntIPList.Form!IntPartyName’ is misspelled or refers to<span>&nbsp;
</span>a control that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>I’ve used the Immediate Window to identify the forms and controls that are involved and this gives me the following results</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">?Screen.ActiveForm.Name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">frmclntNavigationForm</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">?Screen.ActiveForm.ActiveControl.Name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">NavigationSubform</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">?Screen.ActiveForm.ActiveControl.Form.ActiveControl.Name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">frmclntIPList</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">?Screen.ActiveForm.ActiveControl.Form.ActiveControl.Form.ActiveControl.Name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">IntPartyName</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 36pt">frmclntNavigationForm is the name for my main Navigational Control</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">NavigationSubform is the standard subform container within the Navigational Control</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">frmclntIPList is the Interested Party subform</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">IntPartyName is the control that I want to make visible/invisible</p>
<p>For information - the ‘main’ form which the Interested party subform<span>&nbsp; </span>
is related to is not actually listed in the path information.<span>&nbsp; </span>My assumption here is that the subform container manages the ‘main’ form and Interested Party subform separately.</p>
<p>Happy to provide additional information if required.</p>

            <p>Since I posted this I’ve managed to find a way to achieve what I need without the need to include the path information with the control name. See below for what I did – just
<span>&nbsp;</span>in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turns out that the requery which is run from the ‘main’ form triggers the ‘On Current’ event in the subform.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This means that I can place my setting of the control property within the On Current event macro so I only need to use
<span>&nbsp;</span>the simple form of the control name.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>There is a potential issue in this approach – if the recordset for the subform is empty, it doesn't look like the On Current event is triggered.&nbsp; However in this application if the recordset is empty then I'll always want the controlst(they are buttons on
 the subform header) to be visible so I cater for this by unconditionally setting the control as visible in the Open event of the subform.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the recordset is empty&nbsp; then it’s set correctly, if the recordsets is not empty the requery will result in the ‘On Current’ event being triggered which will then set the property as required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also seen a an item somewhere else that indicates that you can't set a property using the full address in the way that I was trying to do (ref. my initial query).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So effectively this query is answered - I'd mark it as such, but I can't see an option to do this!?</p>

<p>Hi Hamoud,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm if you are an Office 365 administrator (responsible person). If not, could you please involve your Office 365 administrator in this thread?<br />
Then, I can know the detailed deployment, check some event logs in the server side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an Office 365 admin, I would like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. &nbsp;In your organization, does the issue only occur to one user?<br />
2. &nbsp;Does it work in another workable Mac using this impacted user account?<br />
3. &nbsp;Do you try to remove password in Keychain Access?&nbsp;<br />
4. &nbsp;After you click “sign in with other options”, what will happen?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Johnny Zhang</p>

<p>Hi Hamoud,</p>
<p>I understand you are a student. However, the issue could be related to server side. So, we have to involve administrator (responsible person) in this thread. I suggest you forward the following article to your administrator as it seems to be an ADFS server
 issue.</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you checked your notebooks on OneNote online, are you able to see all your&nbsp; notebooks from there?Also, kindly check if you have a good internet connection. In the meantime, I would suggest to reinstall the application and sign out
 and sign back in your Microsoft account on OneNote. This will give OneNote a fresh new start and would definitely resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>In the meantime I directed the Launch to onenote.exe in the Programs folder. I got a response saying somezhing to the effect that what I was doing was inappropriate but after a few seconds it sorted itself out and then suddenly all the notebooks appeared.</p>
<p>There is definitely something unsatisfactory with the way this works and somebody should really look at it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>For now, kindly observe if you will get the same issue. Also, I would suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the application. This would help the application to go back on its original state.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tarun Upaday,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that after you migrated your account from Gsuite to Office 365 and then when you sign in Mail app in iOS device with the account, you will get error, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to sign in your account to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> with your Office 365 account to check the outcome so that we can know if it's an account issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, regarding your issue, I need to collect some information for further checking:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please also provide us the screenshot about the error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the issue just happens on you or all users who have been migrated to Office 365 in your organization? If the issue happens to all users, please provide your tenant information in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>. I have sent you a private message, please check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Have you tried to change another client to check this issue? If not, please try to sign in your account in another client to check if the error still pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h2>            I am receiving error message &#34;We couldn&#39;t sign in to your POP3 server...&#34; when setting up another account on my Outlook.com account</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm an Outlook Insider and I'm trying to configure a client to move from @pacbell.net email to outlook.<br />
<br />
An essential part of this is getting the email to import via POP3 (not forward, do not suggest it).<br />
<br />
However the email will not import. Always I am told that " We couldn't sign in to your POP3 server. Please make sure your username and password are correct. "<br />
<br />
However I am using 100% exactly the same settings on Thunderbird and it is connected just fine!<br />
<br />
How can I force Outlook to connect with this account?<br />
<br />
I'm using these settings:<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>pacbell.net</th>
<td>inbound.att.net / 995</td>
<td>outbound.att.net / 465</td>
<td><br />
</td>
<td>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</td>
<td>POP3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

            No, it isn't possible that I entered the wrong information because I copy and pasted it from Thunderbird where it was working, that's what "100% the same settings" means. Furthermore, I was troubleshooting the problem for over two hours so within the two
 hours I must have typed in the correct password at least once.<br />
<br />
And now that we're done troubleshooting pebcak errors, lets get on to troubleshooting problems with outlook.com.<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, you want me to contact the domain administrator for pacbell.net, aka Pacific Bell, aka AT&amp;T and ask AT&amp;T why their mail is not working with outlook.com. That sounds like a good plan: Hello, AT&amp;T? Microsoft is having a problem and I'm here to troubleshoot
 it. Who am I? I'm just some guy. No, I don't work for Microsoft. What's in it for you? Well, your email would work with outlook.com and people wouldn't need to go to att.net and look at your advertisements nor use your interface. Isn't that great? *Click*
 Hello?<br />
<br />
Lets move on to the third paragraph. You linked me to some article talking about how to connect to an outlook.com account. Why would I want to connect to an empty outlook.com account? Did you ignore the initial post where the issue is with importing mail into
 an outlook.com account, not connecting to an outlook.com with a third party app?<br />
<br />
Anyway, your answer is garbage and doesn't address a single of my issues. I'm insulted that you would waste my time with this generically useless response. If you don't have an answer then don't respond, copy and pasting irrelevant information from a help document
 rather than trying to solve a problem is a waste of time for everyone involved.<br />

I have tried everything from every forum on here for four weeks now and have not been successful in getting my AT&amp;T (@PacBell.net)&nbsp; e-mail to download.&nbsp; I think this must be a lost cause and a real disappointment!&nbsp;Certainly someone at Microsoft must be able
 to assist!&nbsp; I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;

            I'm having the same problem hjamesmartin was having above. Did it ever get resolved? My outlook synched once with PacBell.net, and then started giving me the same message he was getting. It's been two days, and nothing seems to help. I've tried all the
 steps outlined above.

                    <p>My boss, and his manager, as well as several other people at our organization, have this same problem. A meeting invite is sent out to upper management, they click on "Accept" and the invitation e-mail then moves itself to the trash folder, marked as "Unread."
 They have to accept again in the trash to actually get the invitation posted to their calendar.</p>

<h2>            Email retention</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I only have emails going back 2 weeks. The retention policy on the main email is 'no default delete policy' on the sub folders (so inbox, deleted) it is set to 'use parent folder policy'. If I undertake a recover deleted items it only goes back to 16/08/2015.
 If I click inbox and go to options and try to assign policy I can click never but it doesn't set it on the folder. Where have my emails gone? Many thanks</p>

<p>hi andrewfarr,</p>
<p>from your description, i understand that only recently 2 weeks emails are listed in your mailbox. and there are no delete polies on the default folders (such as inbox, delete items).</p>
<p>i would like to collect the following information to better understand the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>about “if i undertake a recover deleted items it only goes back to 16/08/2015”, could you share with us your detailed steps about how your undertake a recover deleted items?
</li><li>about “if i click inbox and go to options and try to assign policy i can click never”, could you please capture a screenshot? to upload the screenshot in the forum, please click&nbsp;<b>use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> insert/edit media</b> icon.
</li><li>does the issue occur to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">owa</a> (outlook web app) or outlook desktop client?
</li><li>if you use the search in owa, can you find these missing emails? </li></ol>
<p>for the inbox folder’ retention, usually it uses the whole mailbox’s default <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd297955%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;mspperror=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
retention policy</a>, which is moving emails that are two years old to archive. and if archive is disabled, the default retention policy will delete these emails instead of archiving them.</p>
<p>the retention policy you choose is called person tag, which can only be assigned to manually created folders. for default folders like inbox, delete items etc. we can create default folder retention tags and add them to your mailbox’s retention policy to
 custom their retention policies.</p>
<p>please refer to the following information:</p>
<p>1. login to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a> with admin credentials.</p>
<p>2. navigate to compliance management &gt; retention tags &gt; add &gt; applied automatically to a default folder.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=69bbeb8f-6931-49b5-bde5-43fadb7d15bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d69bbeb8f-6931-49b5-bde5-43fadb7d15bf" /></a></p>
<p>3. then in navigate to retention polies, choose your retention policy and add the newly created tag to it.</p>
<p>after that, items in inbox folders will never be deleted.</p>
<p>note: the retention policy may take up to 7 days to take effect.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>hi brook,</p>
<p>thanks for your answer so far, in response:</p>
<p>1 - go to deleted items, click and from sub menu choose recover deleted items. as new window pops up and there they are. as i said this only goes back to 16/08/15</p>
<p>2 - whilst i am in the inbox at the top of the screen is the menu - so delete, archive, junk, sweep etc. there is a drop down menu at the end which has retention (see screenshot) this doesn't 'apply' despite me clicking it, it reverts back to parent folder.&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=07e72add-18b8-4488-bcd0-6f5bac3dec0e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d07e72add-18b8-4488-bcd0-6f5bac3dec0e" /></a></p>
<p>3 - occurs in owa, i use entourage on my mac.</p>
<p>4 - yes!! thanks, how is this working and why can't i see them, there doesn't seem to be a next page option...</p>
<p>logged into exchange admin, done the above but when i try to add in the pop up window everything is greyed out and i can't access it.</p>
<p>many thanks again for your help. andrew</p>

<p>hi andrew,<br />
<br />
according to your reply, these emails can be found using search in owa. that means these emails still exist in your mailbox. and the retention policy is the default policy with no delete tags. this may be a complicated issue and we need to collect more details
 below:<br />
1. despite owa, do you use other device like a mobile device to access your office 365 mailbox? if so, does the emails all show up in the mobile device?<br />
2. as you said only emails in the past 2 week are listed in owa, could you provide us screenshots of the emails in owa?<br />
3. and you can search other emails 2 weeks ago, could you provide some screenshots about the result after you search other emails?<br />
4. which browser are you using to access owa, safari, chrome or other browsers?<br />
5. try in the owa light version to check if the emails 2 weeks ago can show up.<br />
&nbsp; here are the steps:<br />
&nbsp; 1) login to owa.<br />
&nbsp; 2) click <b>settings menu</b> and select <b>options</b> from the dropdown.<br />
&nbsp; 3) in <b>other</b>, click <b>go to the earlier version</b>.<br />
&nbsp; 4) then re-sign in owa to see if all emails show up. <br />
6. please capture a screenshot of the owa version by right-clicking in owa and selecting
<b>view page source</b>. in the next pop up page, capture a screenshot like below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ab55515d-6b64-490f-9d43-177758c020bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dab55515d-6b64-490f-9d43-177758c020bb" /></a><br />
<br />
to protect your privacy, i have sent you a private message to require the screenshots. here are the steps to access it.<br />
1. go to your details on the upper right corner of the forum.<br />
2. click private messages.<br />
3. click the subject title to read and reply to the message.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />
yang</p>

            <p>Hi Akiko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a sycning issue, as you create the sg when connecting to Exchange Online, the sg should show on the portal. You can click All supported groups and refresh portal to check if the group will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As get-AzureADGroup is a Windows Azure Active PowerShell command, it won't get the sg which is created on Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>&#34;Cookies must be allowed&#34; on a machine without Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elliander eldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Cookies must be allowed&#34; on a machine without Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>When I installed Windows 10 on a newly built machine, I had annoying problems where Microsoft kept force changing my defaults to use "Edge" every so often so I eliminated the problem my manually removing all traces of both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer
 from my computer. (That's not impossible, just not easy) This did not affect anything I was doing, and certainly didn't stop me from using Skype.<br />
<br />
However, as of today, I am unable to use Skype anymore. Even updating did nothing. It just says:<br />
<br />
"<span>Cookies must be allowed</span>"<br />
<br />
The thing is, cookies are allowed in all browsers I use and have installed. When searching, I found that Skype apparently is supposed to be using Internet Explorer to present adverts, and true enough I haven't had to deal with adverts at all so clearly Skype
 wasn't functional in that way. Regardless, now for whatever reason it won't let me do anything.<br />
<br />
So, is there any way to bypass this screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method of removing Microsoft Edge, btw, was less complete than the method for removing internet explorer. To remove edge I really just had to remove it from functioning by giving myself permission to modify it's files and then renaming both MicrosoftEdge.exe
 and MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe to have _remove.exe in the names so that when the system tries to open it on it's own it is unable to. In light of this problem, I temporarily canged them back to allow myself to check MicrosoftEdge settings and, sure enough, cookies
 are turned on there. If Skype is using any of Edge's files it will find them there.<br />
<br />
If Skype is using internet explorer though... ugh... Do I really have to reinstall that piece of trash just to use skype? I could have used an alternative, but because Microsoft ended Skypekit that doesn't appear to be possible. (I really hate how Microsoft
 keeps killing franchises I like...) It seems really strange as well that Microsoft would choose for Skype to use it's supposedly discontinued product. Even Microsoft doesn't use internet explorer anymore, yet they expect us to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how exactly can I use skype without third party programs, and without internet explorer? Is there a non-app version? (I loved the concept behind Microsoft apps, but hate the implementation) or is there some setting I can set manually somewhere to get
 through this locked out screen? I realize that there is a web option (I installed it for chrome for now) but of course, that won't run without chrome running and sometimes I don't want chrome running.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi, I checked the Feature Deprecation page. I am confused by what you mean by "Group Tiles". I wasn't using a tile which grouped things together https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/group-tiles/9wzdncrfhw4q or the Groups feature from Contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a Facebook app feature. If I was in the Facebook app on my phone, I could visit a Facebook Group of which I am a member and pin that to the Start screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we&nbsp;talking about the same thing?</p>

<p>No. That guy (who may or may not work for Microsoft - likely not) doesn't seem to understand what you've posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the update, the old Microsoft facebook app was replaced with the one made by facebook itself, which probably doesn't support the same pin to start features. Speak to facebook to see if they can add the feature to their app.</p>
