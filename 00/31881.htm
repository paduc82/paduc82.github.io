            <p><span>Hi Todd-Cindy-MorganBurris,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>Are you able to boot into Windows after the error message?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to boot into Windows then check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in the safe mode then there is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer
 is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you place the computer in the clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start
 Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

</span></span><span><span><span>article

</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></span></span></p>

</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 3</span></u></b></p>
<p><span><span>If you can boot into safe mode and clean boot procedure does not help then
 I <span>&nbsp;</span>would suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer</span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>which would scan for corrupted system files and check if it helps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The scan may take some time, so be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted

<h3> lenfichan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is stuck in infinite loop trying recover from operating system update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a dated version of Windows 10 - it is 1703.&nbsp; I have not been able to upgrade to the more recent releases.&nbsp; Every time the PC has tried, it kept recovering the original version of Windows.&nbsp; I believe there is an issue with one of drivers - I'm not
 sure which one.</p>
<p>I've been disabling updates.&nbsp; Today, however, the PC tried to update once again.&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, the update has failed</p>
<p>The difference now is that the PC can't go back to the original version of Windows. It boots, I see a Windows logo, then it flashes:</p>
<p>"Attempting to recover previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>"Restoring previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the PC shuts down, reboots, BIOS are loaded, Windows logo flashes, and </p>
<p>"Attempting to recover previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>"Restoring previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an infinite loop.&nbsp; The PC must have done it 30 times already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do short of re-installing the operating system from the CD?</p>

            Hi Len.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If an install so corrupted it cannot Upgrade to the newest version now cannot roll back you really only have the option to do the Clean Install, which is hardly a compromise since it's a vastly superior install that avoids all these problems.  
<br />
<br />Create the latest stable media from Media Creation tool to  Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem as long as they stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom install.  Then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup   to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Booting from a USB boot drive did not help.&nbsp; I created the USB boot ISO drive.</p>
<p>The problem is that when booting from the USB ISO, it detects that there was a previous effort to upgrade Windows 10, and refuses to do a repair upgrade.&nbsp; The message tells me to continue with previous upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB boot ISO gives 2 options: </p>
<p>1) repair upgrade using previous activity</p>
<p>2) clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2 warns that it will delete all system and program files, and wants me to back up all files.&nbsp; That gets me worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that my PC seems to be incompatible with all Win 10 versions later than 1703 (1.5 years old).&nbsp;There may be some obscure driver issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of the upgrades end the same way - message "reinstalling previous version".&nbsp; It usually upgrades version
 Win 10, 1703 to the latest KB, and that it.&nbsp; This time was different, the previous version was somehow corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second issue is that the USB boot ISO is Winn 10 1803 - so I would not be able to install it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I'm looking for is a way to clean up the previous installation so I could roll back to it.&nbsp; Not sure it is realistic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I may need to get a new PC...</p>

            The instructions I wrote out for you above, which are also Illustrated in the tutorial I gave you above, are quite clear that you must choose custom install to reinstall Windows. A repair upgrade cannot be done from boot, only from inside windows.<br /><br />So you didn't follow the instructions but yet you still gave me a bad rating for giving you the exactly correct instructions which have worked for tens of thousands of others I'be helped over the last 10 years.

<h2>            Windows Media Center play corruption when CPU Overclocked</h2>
                    <p>I am finding that WMC&nbsp;live play and playback of existing .wtv files is corrupted when</p>
<p>the Q6600 cpu is overclocked.</p>
<p>No other devices or applications&nbsp;seems to be affected negatively by the overclock.</p>
<p>The WMC picture will start to slow down to maybe one frame per second</p>
<p>and the audio stops permanently.</p>
<p>e.g. VLC continues to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only recovery is by clicking the progress bar back 5 seconds --</p>
<p>it will then play normally for maybe a minute then fail again.</p>
<p>There should be no interaction between the exact CPU clock speed</p>
<p>and the video/audio timing.</p>
<p>What is the workaround for this WMC&nbsp;failure ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reverting back to original CPU clocking</p>
<p>the WMC play problem has disappeared.</p>

            <p>CPU: AMD-A8-6600K</p>
<p>AMD Cataylst Control Center: 2014.0417.2226.38446</p>
<p>Catalyst &nbsp;v14.4</p>
<p>AMD Driver: 14.10.1006-140417a-171098C</p>
<p>Direct3D: 9.14.10.1029</p>
<p>2D Driver:&nbsp;8.01.01.1390</p>
<p>Win 7 64 SP1 with all known updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just wanted to add that I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used AMD's Catalyst Control Center to "Auto-Tune" each Frequency and then changed the system from 4Ghz to 4.2Ghz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted the system and WMC recorded all selections and the resulting file sizes were normal (the same size as the previous week's episodes). The difference being that when I play the Tv program the length of the program is now triple the original. (Ex:
 a half-hour show is now shown to be 1.5 hours long and a one hour program is now 3 hours long.). The other visible symptom is that each segement of the program is repeated. So I watch approx. 5 minutes and then that 5 minutes repeats. The easy solution for
 this is to fast forward 5+minutes, but the problem is that WMC can't play the normal-sized recording normally (1 hour recording time = 3 hour viewing time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought why don't I reset the CPU (revert back to the original clock speed) and I did. I rebooted and attempted to play the same TV program. The playback is still corrupted and appears as triple in length (viewing time on the slider). However, now that
 the clock speed is back to the original settings WMC is back to normal. All new recordings are displayed normally (no repeating segements, normal viewing time: half hour recording time = half hour viewing time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the original question remains, is there a setting that can be changed so that WMC is aware of the new clock speed? So that the codecs can be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone tried to rerun the setup after changing the clock speed and have WMC work? In the mean time, I will try to rerun the WMC setup after increasing the clock speed. Hopefully WMC will recognize the new speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in case someone wants to suggest doing a "clean" reinstall, let me remind you that you can't overclock the system until after Windows and AMD software is installed, and by then, WMC has been already installed. So the timings are established for the codecs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Looks like there are multiple manifestations of this same problem.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the performance of the Windows Media Center codecs should not be coupled
</p>
<p>with the exact clock speed of the PC in which it is operating --</p>
<p>that is a crazy design Bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One action that is guaranteed to change the PC clock timing is when the user</p>
<p>upgrades the CPU in the PC motherboard CPU socket to a higher speed CPU.</p>
<p>I have not tried this, but I would assume this would manifest the same problem</p>
<p>with WMC performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that upon initial Windows installation, some sort of timing calculation is made</p>
<p>based on the CPU clock speed or the Counter that is in the CPU,</p>
<p>At the very least, that calculation needs to be able to be recalculated</p>
<p>by manual request of the user, after he has upgraded the PC,</p>
<p>either by CPU clock tuning (overclocking)&nbsp;or </p>
<p>by installing a newer CPU in the motherboard CPU socket..</p>

                    <p>I identified a recurring Skype Sarl charge coming through my Paypal account that has been at $9.99 a month, accumulating to the tune of $489!&nbsp; I thought this was related to something I authorized a while ago, but see in this forum that there was something
 more disturbing going on. Frustratingly, I could not find any way to control this in my Skype account, nor even see it as part of my Skype account.&nbsp; Has anyone had this occur and found a way to get charges refunded?</p>

            <p>Exact same problem with my account. I added a new card to my account through the Windows 8.1 Store. After adding the card I got a blank screen. There appears to be some temporary authorizations made to the card from MSFT Billing with no amount $0 charged.&nbsp;
 Trying to buy an app then ask for me to select a payment option again even though the card I added is already listed. This has occurred since 10/15/2014 in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this on my wife's Microsoft Account also on a different PC and with a different Bank card and experienced the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is&nbsp;that the credit card verification system is broken and that it should be authorizing a small charge on the card instead of a $0 charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also guessing that is a system wide issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to be escalated quick because Microsoft and app developers are losing revenue because of this bug&nbsp;!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<p>When I log in to commerce.microsoft.com.&nbsp; I can see that my card got added as a payment option. I can also use this payment option on my Windows Phone 8 device without issue. I bought a $1.99 app form the Windows Phone Store.&nbsp; So this issue apparently is
 related to the Windows Store App only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PCs I have tested on have all been upgraded fully including the latest Patch Tuesday updates that came out 10/14/14.</p>

            Yup, having the same problem as well, it shows card info in there, but when I am trying to buy an app it says that I need to add payment info, and whenever I hit submit, there is the good ole blank screen. Microsoft has really gone downhill

            <p>I have been facing the same issue with my Microsoft Phone. I called the customer care and they said they do not accept debit cards any more which is weird because I have purchased apps previously with the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using a Virtual Credit Card too but they say there is a problem with my Bank. Again, I have used cards from multiple banks. It'll be really nice of Microsoft if they could sort this problem.</p>

<p>It says on that site that "As of this moment, you must run the Upgrade Assistant tool in order to purchase Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Pro online"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unnecessary.&nbsp; It's also available in Microsoft's own online store at <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1/productID.288401200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not talking about a mere upgrade, I'm talking about installing a CLEAN install of Windows 8.1 on a re-formatted drive assuming the Windows 8.1 disc&nbsp;is a boot disc like the Windows&nbsp;7 disc.</p>

                    I have windows 8.1 and moved my screenshot folder onto an external hard drive as my laptop doesn't have much disk space which I now can't find and although the screen dims when I take a screenshot it doesn't save anywhere. I've tried making a manual folder
 called screenshots and I've looked in my onedrive folder but it doesn't seem to have saved there.

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the classic version of Skype (which can be downloaded from the Skype website), to change the status of the account, just click the
<strong>status </strong>icon next to your profile picture located at the upper left side of the application beside your name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the pre-installed Skype version (UWP)&nbsp;on Windows 10, click on your profile picture and another window will appear, from there, you'll be able to see "<strong>Do not disturb"</strong> or
<strong>"Do not share presence"</strong> status. You may enable or disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above information work, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. </p>

<p>Both monitors are at maximum resolution so I can't shrink the image to see if they're hiding beyond the usual borders.</p>

<p>Hi BT1014,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are there any other items on your desktop? Or are the files that you're moving there the only ones missing? It may be possible that you're desktop items are hidden.
<strong>Right-click</strong> on your desktop, click <strong>View</strong>, and see if the check for
<strong>Show desktop icons</strong> is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

<p>Thanks -- all of the icons, shortcuts and files from before are still visible. Only the new files I saved to desktop over the past two days are "invisible" on the desktop but visible in the Desktop folder in Explorer. (I should note that, during that time,
 I've been moving the laptop off and back onto the dock where the second monitor attaches, so that and the following story are the reason why I think they might be sitting outside the monitor boundaries. Only problem is that the invisible files don't come back
 into view either on or off the dock.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other time I've seen this was many years ago on a Mac. We were able to change the resolution to a higher setting and, sure enough, the files were on the desktop but sitting in a spot that was outside the default resolution. Unfortunately, both of
 my current monitors are at the highest resolution already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird then, weird now.</p>

<p>Have you refresehed the desktop whenever you moving items to the desktop? Also, can you try creating another user profile and see if the issue is there? On the way the issue behaves, this can be caused by a corrupted user profile. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Select the&nbsp;<span><strong>Start</strong></span>&nbsp;button, then select&nbsp;<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>&nbsp;&gt;<span>&nbsp;<strong>Accounts&nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;&gt;<span>&nbsp;<strong>Family
 &amp; other people&nbsp;</strong></span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;<strong>Add someone else to this PC</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<span>At the bottom of the page, select&nbsp;</span><span><strong>I don’t have this person’s sign-in information</strong></span><span>, and
 at the bottom of the next page, select&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong></span><span>.</span></li><li>
<p>Enter a user name, password, password hint, and then select&nbsp;<span><strong>Next</strong></span>.&nbsp;<span><strong>Note</strong></span>: If you’re using
 Windows 10, version 1803, you can add security questions—instead of a hint—to your local account&nbsp;to help you reset your password in case&nbsp;you forget it.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check

<h2>            Wireless connection issues</h2>
                    My wifi works great and I am able to browse and do stuff but the problem comes when I try to connect my mobile or any other device to my laptop through wifi but it can't connect, it says no network found even my wifi is working such as connecting my mobile
 to my laptop for screen mirror or gamepad etc. I have Windows 8.1, any solution?

<h2>            win tv 1600 and win10</h2>
                    <p>So I am using the provided update from the OEM win tv version 8.5 from the download link.</p>
<p>This is a 3rd party program, run the installer with the original wintv disk to validate&nbsp; the upgrade.</p>
<p>Receive a message I can use the program, but win10 does not let the program update.</p>
<p>No place under programs or apps and features&nbsp; is it listed&nbsp; as installed even though it is in the programs&nbsp;</p>
<p>folder.</p>
<p>I am really beginning to hate microsoft products more each day.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I was prompted&nbsp; to remove the installation to go forward to install the 8.5 update, after doing so win10 refuses to let the installation go through, not even selecting the driver from the cd works as win10 wants a reboot to install the driver.</p>
<p>With said reboot, either the driver fails to load on shut down or boot with the below message.</p>
<p>I got a message that the driver is not signed but select continue anyway.</p>
<p>This is just another blatant way to bush MS store sales with movies and tv.</p>
<p>If I get the wintv package to work from the original disk, win10 blocks the software or channel scan sec. after a successful</p>
<p>launch.</p>
<p>I could never understand why with this device and another usb one from another hardware vendor stopped working on win10, not right away but a few builds into it.</p>
<p>Not using windows media center on any pc's, ever but the channel scan comes up empty and only the av connector would be available.</p>
<p>MS is going to shoot themselves in&nbsp; the foot with this one as of now, no more movies and t, rent or buy, or apps for that matter.</p>
<p>This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. (Code 12)<br />
<br />
If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system.</p>

<p>So Code 12 means&nbsp;<span>is that there are or is another device using the same address as the tv card. Try moving the card to another slot (when the system is off). If
 that doesnt work try booting into safe mode and remove the drivers (uninstall tv card drivers and delete device from the device manager) reboot install drvers again.</span></p>

<p>No other tv tuner cards where installed, this is an issue as MS does not want us recording video from our satellite, cable provider or over the air terrestrial&nbsp; analog or digital services and buy our tv from them.</p>
<p>I have solved the issue, I have deleted my win10 installation on this pc.</p>
<p>If this goes on on my 6 or 8 core pc's, so will win10 be gone from those devices as well.</p>
<p>Win8 will go on the one device if the 1600 does has the same issue and if not, by by win10.</p>
<p>I can safely say it will more than likely not work and the above reason will be verified soon.</p>
<p>Funny thing is the issue with MS killing the hardware was long before win10 even came into the picture on vista and win8.</p>

<p>First, go in defender to virus and protection settings and scroll down and turn OFF FOLDER CONTROL ACCESS. Restart PC.</p>
<p>It causes so many issues and is totally worthless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually have a Hauppauge HDPVR1212 with Total media extreme, winTV8 and the new free Hauppauge capture. (Hauppauge capture is nice, but the 2 schedulers will not work with it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do need to uninstall it. </p>
<p>then go to C:\Program Filesx86\WinTV folder and delete it</p>
<p>Then it also installs into the C:\Users\Public folder, so go there and delete the WinTV folder too.</p>
<p>Do a complete system&nbsp;disk clean up, but do not delete your Install or upgrade LOG files.</p>
<p>restart PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if you have the latest driver version but go here for newest WinTV8.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Another part I missed was, I am aware of having the Win 7 disk or maybe even Win 8 disk in to validate for upgrade to 8.5.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I assume you downloaded the 8.5 EXE update file from Hauppauge website and it is on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;if you had 7 or 8 installed and upgrading to 8.5, but it will not install, how far does it get after you started the install. right click on the installer and run as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it had 7, then it would uninstall it and then start process to install 8.5 after verifying your disk. If it had 8 already, then I do not think it uninstalls 8 to update to 8.5. May have been uninstalled and could not continue from there to install 8.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you say it says you can use it but windows will not allow it to update, CAN YOU ACTUALLY RUN IT. Are the files in start menu programs you say are there work and it opens and plays with video in wintv8 or wintv7 if that is what you originally had. ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the part that you say there are&nbsp;files in programs folder, well that could be possible. uninstalls do leave folders and files left over sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the question is which programs folder you talking about. The start menu all apps or programs or C:\Program Files(x86)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now there is no Hauppauge in Control panel &gt;programs and features list. That is because the program is not installed, or have you restarted PC after you did this and see if it is listed here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or was this a fresh install of WinTV version 8.5 on a new windows 10 installation.</p>

<p>Thanks for the indepth fixes but I have given up on this pc and win10.</p>
<p>If I ever try to install the 1600 again I will go through the steps you outlined.</p>
<p>I did delete the remaining folders, in public it just had some install log, mothing else.</p>
<p>I did run the install from the orignal disk and it installed the driver and software, but when&nbsp;</p>
<p>it ran from using the remote, win10 blocked the scan of the wintv 2000.</p>
<p>;at that point it caused the program to crash taking the driver with it.</p>
<p>I had gone into windows defender and turned everything off including the advanced protections, but</p>
<p>never turned off smart screan or internet options.</p>
<p>I had the orginal disk in the pc before running the 8.5 update, it stated I needed to remove the older version to&nbsp;</p>
<p>install the 8.5 and a reboot was needed, that was when the hardware driver would not load so running the 8.5 just failed</p>
<p>as it could not find compatible hardware.</p>
<p>Note, on another desktop with in10 with better hardware, it had the same issue.</p>

</p><p><strong>ATSC digital TV is the over-the-air HD digital TV for North America.</strong> ATSC digital TV typically requires an antenna for reception, and is currently broadcast in 200 cities, with over 1500 TV stations. ATSC broadcasts range in resolution from

<h2>            The need of world war 2 games</h2>
                    <p>I feel their needs to be more world war 2 games whether indie or not on Xbox. It seems to be one of the few genres on xbox with such few games on the Xbox one.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to see War Thunder to make it to xbox one or World of Planes and World of Warships. I volenteer at a museum where I see flying world war 1 and 2 aircraft fly everyday this is why I would like there to be at least world war 2 flying game on Xbox one.</p><p><br /></p><p>Have a great day,</p><p>Jacob</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>administrative&nbsp;templates&gt;system&gt;removable storage access</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to create a GP batch file to do it quickly in the 60 PCs by one click, but i don't know if it possible in stand alone systems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought i can do that file by the the registry.</p>
<p>it succeeded, i created a reg file with that code</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />

-----------</p>
<p>Alright .. now Removables Storages are restricted.</p>

    <title>Windows Vista won&#39;t start nor repair. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noblesb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t start nor repair.</h2>
                    Greetings!<br />
<br />
I am having a problem with my computer. About 2 weeks ago, my Windows Vista out of nowhere started to fail in start-up with the infamous and hated "Windows failed to start, a Recent Hardware or Software may have..." and the options for start up that none of
 which work. I tried to repair it several times, but Windows would only boot for an hour or two, and then the screen would go black. when I tried to start it back up, it would go back to the Windows failed to start message. I then proceeded to completely reinstall
 windows, but everytime I try the black screen comes back and the windows failed message starts again. I then even tried to boot from an&nbsp;Ubuntu disc&nbsp;and install that, but the same black screen and windows failed message after reloading appears. Now the computer
 only will start up with the windows failed screen every other power-up, otherwise the black screen appears. I looked inside my computer and everything is plugged in tight, and I just checked my disc for errors right before the failure, so I don't know what
 could be causing it.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!<br />
<br />
Brandon

<p>Hi noblesb,</p>
<p>First disconnect any external devices connected to the computer except mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you try startup repair using the windows vista installation disk.</p>
<p>1. Insert the installation disc.<br />
2. Restart your computer. <br />
3. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click the arrow next to the <strong>Lock</strong> button, and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
4. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
Note If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BIOS: frequently asked questions</a>.<br />
5. Choose your <strong>language settings</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
6. Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.<br />
7. Select the <strong>operating system</strong> you want to repair, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.<br />
8. On the <strong>System Recovery Options</strong> menu, click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Refer the below link for more information.</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/How-do-I-fix-a-boot-startup-problem</a></p>
<p>If the above step fail then check if the computer is able to boot into any advanced boot options.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to boot to Safe mode</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the <strong>up/down</strong> arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong>Safe Mode</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then Please wait.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the <strong>Welcome Screen</strong>.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</p>
<p>If you are unable to boot into safe mode then try any other mode from the advance boot options, refer the below link for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</strong><br />

<p>Hope this helps!<br />
