            <p>Hello Angelo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Few more details would help us to provide a better response.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you receive this error message while launching the application or while signing in to OneNote?</li><li>What is the version of the OneNote application installed on the Phone?</li></ol>
<p>As a workaround, I suggest you to <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">sign in to onedrive.live.com using browser on phone, check if you are able to sign in and try to open the OneNote from there. Opening OneNote Notebook will open notebook in OneNote application and
 check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope the above information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            HTC Touch Diamond Bluetooth sync pls Help me &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to sync my HTC Touch diamond to my Laptop. Lenovo T60. The USB cable sync works good. Bluetooth doesn't.<br />
<br />
Tryed everything. Devices are paired, i can transfer files throught regular bluetooth transfers, but Activesync 4.5 cannot sync when i try via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
When i tap connect via bluetooth in the sync interface on htc phone, it says it's not possible to find a existing bluetooth pair.....<br />
<br />
Using Windows XP, and windows mobile 6.<br />
<br />
Any ideas ??<br />
</p>

            Whoops I forgot the last part:<br />
<br />
Go to ActiveSync on your device. Click "Menu" -&gt; Connect via Bluetooth<br />
Now your connection should start.<br />
<br />
Note: If this still doesn't work find out if you have a firewall active and try disabling this. That could also be a solution..<br />

            Ok, Bluetooth Sync always has been a bit of a problem on Windows Mobile.<br />
Do you know which bluetooth stack on you windows XP machine you are using?<br />
<br />
What you could try:<br />
<br />
Go to your bluetooth settings of your PC and look at the tab "Local Services"<br />
There you'll see under service name "Bluetooth Serial Port"; Take the first in the row, due to a bug in ActiveSync only the First Bluetooth Serial Port works as selectable in ActiveSync.<br />
Write down the COM port behind this "Bluetooth Serial Port".<br />
Go to the connection settings in ActiveSync and under "Allow connections to one of the following" select the port you just wrote down.<br />
Try to pair your device with you XP machine and now you should be able to see "ActiveSync" as a Bluetooth Service on your device.<br />
<br />
Hope this will work out for you.<br />
Good luck...

<h2>            Prevent MPGear.dll and MPEngine.dll from automatically updating</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On an up to date Windows Server 2012 Standard system we are seeing MPGear.dll and&nbsp;MPEngine.dll being regularly updated every day or so. A google indicates they are part of Microsoft Malware Protection.</p>
<p>Our issue is we have 3rd party security software that blocks all dll changes to ensure server change control. So every day these MS dlls are blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to find any way to prevent these updates, as windows updates is set to manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have tried turning off Windows Defender under: Edit&nbsp;Local Group Policy &gt; Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender. Double click on "Turn off Windows Defender".</p>
<p>And restarting the server. However the following day Windows tried to update the DLLs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was directed here by a Microsoft Partner Forum Support engineer:</p>
<p>https://partnersupport.microsoft.com/en-us/par_servplat/forum/par_winserv/disable-mpgear-updates/ac54d6cb-a19f-438c-8ca5-b56fcd60598e</p>

<p>This isn't the proper place to send anyone for server support, since this is a consumer forum so few here have even seen a server, let alone supported one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since you're here and I actually do have that experience, I'll see what I can do&nbsp;to help before sending you to the more&nbsp;appropriate TechNet forums where administrators and other technical users discuss such issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears from various sources that the Windows Server&nbsp;2012 versions didn't contain Windows Defender, so the first question becomes how you are apparently receiving these updates on a system that shouldn't need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my best guesses based on what I've discovered.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The 2012 Server system was upgraded from Windows 8 which contained Defender</li><li>Another version of Microsoft security product&nbsp;like Endpoint Protection had been installed</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'd look into the second possibility first, since that might be the easiest to resolve by uninstalling or removing the components of that alternative Microsoft security product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the first possibility, I'm not certain this could happen, but someone in a thread in the TechNet forums claimed it happened to them, though they eventually solved it by completely reinstalling 2012 Server, so&nbsp;that may not be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other possibility I found doesn't appear to be reasonable, since it mentions the addition of&nbsp;the optional "Desktop Experience" package, which though this did contain Defender in Windows Server 2008, it was apparently not present in that same package
 for Server 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/clientsecurity/2012/11/05/more-information-on-microsoft-antimalware-protection-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">More information on Microsoft antimalware protection on Windows
 8 and Windows Server 2012</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn609826%28v=ws.11%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn609826%28v=ws.11%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From the information relating to the earlier Windows Server 2008, it appears this Desktop Experience package is how Defender and several other programs were actually installed there, so this may be why it's difficult to remove from an upgraded system, since
 if it managed to live through an upgrade the installer components required to remove Defender may no longer exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that searching for posts in the TechNet forums and then creating your own in an appropriate&nbsp;Windows 2012 Server forum there might be your best option for aid from those truly aware of such issues and how to solve them.</p>
<p>

<p>thanks Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unsure about this location also.</p>
<p>I've raised it in the TechNet forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a clean 2012 install and none of the mentioned features/products are present on the system. I shall see if anyone on the TechNet side have any further experience with this.</p>

            <p>Sorry forgot to answer you question.&nbsp; I don't see anyway to select a message nor to create a folder. In fact these features may well be present. All I'm saying is, I don't see them and I have used a lot of email programs over the years.&nbsp; So as to "What happens
 when I try to select a message". Please tell me how I select a message. I can click on it and read it, flag or delete it but not simply select it .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason&nbsp; I normally do this is to cull out various ads and notices that I am not interested in reading. I pre-select all these messages with a single click in a box to the left of each one and then I delete them all at once. I normally do this using Gmail
 on my smart phone.&nbsp; Saves a lot of time. </p>

            <p>How would I go about uninstalling these apps and what assurances would I have that the versions in the Windows Store would be more up-to-date then the current build versions? &nbsp; Also, the People app is not present in the Windows Store. The Mail and Calendar
 app are bundled in the Windows Store and have a user rating of 2 1/2 stars. &nbsp;Moreover they seem to be the Windows 8.1 versions. I like the new Calendar App. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really all I need is an answer to my original question re the mail app. If someone who actually know tells me the features I have discussed are or or not present in the current build, I am fine either way. All I want is an answer. &nbsp;No more suggestions please.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Anoka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your part of query on the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated earlier, you might find these small issues as the Windows 10&nbsp;is still development stage. These issues are expected be looked at before the final release of OS. Stay tuned for more updates. You may also send the feedback as suggested in one of the
 previous responses and let the developers know this is a running issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for sharing!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync with wm7 32 bits &#43; HTC HD2</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have tried during several hours to sync my new HTC HD2 with windows 7. I've tried almost everything : reinstalling wmdc, hard reseting my device, rebooting, turning off windows firewall&nbsp;... with no success.<br />
I've gone through the usb options on my windows phone, tried to check and uncheck the option "Enable advanced network functionality".<br />
- When this option is checked : windows can't find a working driver for "generic rndis". Even when I go through the hardware manager and try to manually update the driver (windows says it's up to date).<br />
- When the advanced network is unchecked, the phone finally syncs but it's very very very sloooow. It takes up to&nbsp;5 minutes to see "connected" in wmdc. I tried to sync my contacts from outlook and had to try 4 times to make it work (yes it took me about&nbsp;20
 minutes just for syncing 60 contacts).<br />
So there is something wrong :) Is it a known issue ? The USB cable is the one from HTC and worked good on XP.<br />
Maybe it would be faster to sync with bluetooth ?<br />
Thanks !

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not possible for a user to change his Skype Name or live username. What you can modify is only your display name or the name that is visible on your Skype profile.&nbsp;To do this, simply click your profile picture and click the pencil icon next
 to your name or follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com</a></li><li>Select&nbsp;<span>Edit Profile</span>.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<span>Edit&nbsp;</span>button and modify your name.</li><li><span>Save&nbsp;</span>the changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: It is no longer possible to create an account using your preferred username. You need to create&nbsp;a Microsoft account or register your phone or email address as a Microsoft account to enjoy using Skype's services.
 When you register for a Skype account, you will be given a live username that depends on how you created it (using email or phone number).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Jen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>I would like to explain that Email Address Box only can type one email address.</p>
<p>If you want to type multiple emails, I suggest you try create a distribution list, add all users who you want to receive the requests to the list as member, then you can type the distribution list on the email address box.</p>
<p>For more information about creating distribution lists, you can refer to the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-distribution-lists-in-the-office-365-admin-center-b1ffe755-59e5-4369-826d-825f145a8400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create distribution lists in the Office 365 admin center</a></p>

<h3> djrigsby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 HUP</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office Professional 2013 through the employer home use scheme, I now want to install it on a second PC for my use in the same home.&nbsp; There are conflicting answers about whether I can install it on one or two PC's - I understand the 2016 version
 is definitely one PC but a lot of people are saying the 2013 version allows installation on two PC's. Can anyone clarify this?</p>
<p>Also I have been offered Office 2016 through my employer with the HUP - if I purchase this does it over-ride my previous licensed copy of Office 2013 or will I be able to keep Office 2013 on one PC and install Office 2016 on the other? (I am quite happy
 to run an older version on one of the PC's)</p>

            1. Office 2013 was allowed on 2 devices. But now HUP is giving only Office 2016 which is allowed only for 1 device. So, you can install Office 2013 on 2 computers. In case of issues - <a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/en-US/contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/en-US/contactus</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work - then you will have to contact Digital River who manages this program for Microsoft.

<br />
<br />2. If Office 2013 was through HUP program, then you will need to remove it. If Office 2013 was not through HUP program, then you can keep Office 2013 and install Office 2016 through HUP.
<br />Source - <a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/faq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/faq.aspx</a>
<br />If you have a previous version of Microsoft Office 2013 from HUP, you are legally obligated to uninstall that version before installing Office 2016 from HUP as using only 1 licence is allowed. If you have acquired Office 2013 through another source, you are not required to uninstall Office 2013 in order to install Office 2016 products from HUP

            Vijay is correct in everything except his link to digital river.  Digital River used to do HUP distribution for MS but no longer. MS has taken back control
<br />
<br />You can use the first link he provided .

<h2>            Office 2013 Keys marked as invalid all of the sudden</h2>
                    <p>I'm a PC reseller. Build and sell PC's. I purchased MULTIPLE office 2013 licenses from a company that I checked was a certified Microsoft Partner. When I purchased the licenses, they all activated perfectly fine. However, one of my customer's systems needed
 to be repaired when their Hard Drive crashed. Now, when I try to activate office, it tells me my key is invalid. Not only that, but I purchased 30+ office keys for this customer from the vendor that was a certified Microsoft Partner, and NONE of those keys
 work. They're ALL reporting as invalid. For testing purposes, I tried to activate Office 2013 using one of the other 200+ office keys I purchased, out of the 20 I tested, NONE of them would activate. I would like to know why that is. Would someone from Microsoft
 be able to contact me and tell me why all of the sudden these keys are invalid? What happened? Since I have proof that the keys were purchased, would Microsoft be willing to replace them all?</p>

            <p>First of all this is a community forum. I am afraid you cannot contact Microsoft through this forum and Microsoft will not contact you through this forum either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that you purchased multiple office 2013 licenses. You did not say what Office 2013? Or whether the licenses were OEM or Retail? Or are you talking about Office 365 or Office 2013&nbsp;Pro Plus.&nbsp; Did you read the Microsoft licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I&nbsp;suggest that as a reseller&nbsp;you should not&nbsp;install/activate Office 2013 whatever licence you have purchased for them.&nbsp; You should just provide the buyer with the&nbsp;Product key or download onto computer without installing/activating.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to claim Office 365 subscription with Lumia 640&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a Lumia 640, and I know I should get a free 1 year subscription for Office 365 with the "Office 365 gift" app. But I cant download this app anymore ( I do not know if it is to blame Windows 10 Mobile update. ) I can not get this offer
 via "Lumia Offers" app ether. Any solutions?

<h2>            Access 2010 &#34;Unable to Create ACCDE&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a database of moderate complexity. The code compiles fine. When I try to save it to ACCDE, Access responds with an error message: "Unable to create ACCDE..." I've had other databases with the same references that don't have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating a blank database, importing everything, and recompiling, but I still get the same message there as well. Any recommendations?</p>

</p><p>It usually quite rare that if you can go into the VBA code editor, and from the debug menu do a compile, then a acccDE should create without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if&nbsp;the application compiles without errors, then you should have little issues or problems creating the accDE. If the VBA compiles, then I most certainly will be ‚Äúeager‚Äù to see what the solution to this problem eventually is, since if the application
 compiles, then in 99% of the cases, then an accDE can be created without issue. In fact, I NEVER seen a case in which you can compile the VBA code, but then not create an accDE.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something "really" bad is wrong here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would re-boot the computer and try again. If no go, then do a repair of office.</p>

<p>I had the same problem.</p>
<p>For me, I had to turn off the Taskbar Auto Hide and then it worked.</p>
<p>I also made the icons smaller which made the Taskbar smaller.</p>

<p>When i am looking at my Inbox, i see all the folders i have created to store messages and there are also folders for the 2 alias email addresses i created a year or so ago. I recieve emails in those folders just like i do in my primary inbox/email account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created 2 new alias email addresses recently but they do not show up in my list of folders. There is no where to check if mail has been sent to these new email aliases. I‚Äôm trying to find out why they don‚Äôt show up as folders to receive mail like my 2
 other alias email addresses did when i created them? How or where do the emails sent to these new addresses go and where can I check for mail sent there?</p>
<p>

    <title>Error Message&#58; Skype Cannot Access Your Sound Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error Message&#58;  Skype Cannot Access Your Sound Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi All... have been banging my head against a brick wall today with this issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support can't help - they keep on referring me to a ridiculous website that is to choose a Skype Number?!&nbsp; WTF?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my external microphone and headphone speakers were working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that happened yesterday of any note is the driver for my printer was updated by MS support dude via remote access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I cannot use the external microphone on Skype - just has the error message that it cannot access the sound card:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f1b1a14-23d5-4758-957b-1fb8b156a824?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f1b1a14-23d5-4758-957b-1fb8b156a824?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound card is confirmed working when using the default speaker and mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Scarlett 2i2 USB device (the mixer that the mic and the headphones run through) has current and updated drivers, etc - we have checked this.&nbsp; (The only thing we haven't done is reinstall this device yet.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has been restarted several times today &nbsp;- still same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype has been uninstalled and reinstalled today - still same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any questions, just ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am so hoping that someone can help me with this as I need to be able to use my external mic for my Skype calls due to quality levels far exceeding the mic from my laptop, as I'm sure you can understand...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It drives me insane that something working one day can stop working the next without any apparent rhyme or reason...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, looking forward to some responses!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>

            Before I give troubleshooting steps, I would request you to provide following information -
<br />
<br />A. What is your computer's make and model? For example Lenovo T470
<br />
<br />B. What is the Windows version and build? (To check this, type winver in Windows Start Search box and click winver)
<br />
<br />C. What is your Skype version?

<p>Update 9.5.18 20 minutes later...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely reinstalled Scarlett2i2 driver and software and can confirm that the Scarlett device does work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except when I want to use the external headphones plugged into it AND the mic plugged into it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external mic worked when I was using the laptop speaker for sound playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external mic worked when I was using a separate, different inferior headphones that jacked directly to the laptop (not via Scarlett2i2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I changed settings to use Scarlett2i2 for playback AND for recording, that's when I AGAIN get the same error message and it doesn't record a sound.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary - when both the external mic and external headphones connected to Scarlett2i2 = mic stops recording, audio still okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: The external mic still works though as I can see it is activating the soundbar in the 'sound' popup box...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Dear MSCA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Tech has afforded me a Win10 ISO for a limited time for evaluation, which I have uploaded into my "Oracle VirtualBox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed quite a few WinOS in the application, but on one I have been able to connect online services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to update, download and install, WinowsDefender, Adobe; Reader, AIR and ShockWave, open IE11 and install Java applet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if I update the OS itself, would I be over extending the liberty given to me?</p>

<p>The W10 version offered by TechNet is the 'Enterprise' version with a 90 day evaluation period, after which the OS will not function fully, the only way to continue, is to purchase a retails version of W10 &amp; install.</p>

</p><p>I am having trouble identifying what primary keys i need in what fields. My goal is to be able to record bookings for members and for groups. This will require me being able to book either of them while having access to both entity's to see available slots.
 Many thanks for anyone who gets in touch.</p>

            You need to completely redo your relationships and your key fields. If the Member Booking table is where you record the bookings, then you want a BookingID field as the Primary Key (preferably an Autonumber. FacilityID should be a Foreign Key. Can a booking be both for a Member or a Group? If only one, then you should have a BookerID as your foreign Key.
<br />
<br />You should have a single DateTime field for BookingDate The combination of BookingDate, FacilityID and BookerID should be a multi-field unique index.
<br />
<br />FacilityID, Date and Time should be removed from the Groups table. Similarly from the Members table. 
<br />
<br />InstructorID should also be removed Groups and Members. Unless an Instructor is specific to either a group or a member.
<br />
<br />The Group and Member payment tables, are unclear can you explain them more.
<br />
<br />Also not I do not use space in object names, that is not a good practice.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. Groups can block book but members cant. How would I go about this. Also one instructor can also be linked to many bookings.<br />

            I'm not sure what block book means. The question is can a booking be linked to both a group and a member?
<br />
<br />Again, remove the composite key from the Bookings table. And replace it with an Autonumber. Having InstructorID as a foreign key in the Booking table is the way to get an Instructor related to a Booking. 
<br />
<br />And you didn't explain the payment and membership type tables.

            Again thanks for response, I understand removing the composite key but if i just have a booking ID as a primary key it wont allow me to put the criteria that is needed (example a single member can only book 1 facility for one time slot each day, however
 a group can book a facility for many time slots for the day

            Yes it will. As I said earlier you can create a multi-field unique index which will prevent duplication on the combination of fields. However, the requirement that groups can mulit-book and members can't requires some thought on how to handle that. It would be better handled with Validation on your form, then on the table level.
<br />
<br />Let me think about it. But the composite key doesn't really work for you. It needs to be removed.

</p><p>Hello together,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a template workbook where procurement team will use. There are some mandatory columns that they have to fill. I'd like to stop saving the workbook if some of the cells are empty. I will use column C for my comparison to other columns. I also want
 to tell users which columns have empty cells. I already managed this but I'd like to show them one message box with all empty columns name, at the moment code check columns one by one.&nbsp; Total mandatory columns number are 14, there is also 2 optional column,
 which I don't want to stop them but just give information about those 2 columns.</p>
<p>kind regards<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching from 64bit &gt; 32bit or 32bit&nbsp;&gt; 64bit has always required a Clean install. This has nothing to do with backward compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to test the Windows 10 Technical Preview, you will need to download the ISO, create a bootable DVD or USB device and perform a Clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option would be to create a Dual Boot setup, if you have enough hard drive space.</p>
<p>

<h3> tourless  say:</h3>
<h2>            Seek and Destroy function</h2>
                    Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
I have a report that takes a raw data dump from an SQL db based on a few user defined parameters.&nbsp; I've just been given the directive that we want to exclude certain line items from the finished product.&nbsp; So to that end I'm thinking I might be better served
 with a function that can be called upon rather than a loop.<br />
<br />
What I need to accomplish is removing the entire row (shift row's up) where column c contains certain words.&nbsp; So I want to loop through all the rows in column c and remove them if they contain "COG" or "Top" or "Ambu".&nbsp; I'm pretty sure the criteria will change
 with the direction of the wind (as things tent to), which is why I think the function would be best suited.&nbsp; I just have no idea how to go about accomplishing it.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I could accomplish what I'm looking to do with loops on my own but I'm sure
 it would be ugly and raw and less than efficient.<br />
<br />
Any help or pointers in the right direction are always appreciated.<br />
<br />
TIA!<br />

            <p>You are right. From your original post I got the impression that COG would be the only word in the cell. But it is easy to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the line, 'FilterRng.Autofilter Field:=......' and replace it with the line below to filter for cells which contain COG or Top:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;FilterRng.AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:="*" &amp; arrRemove(a) &amp; "*"</p>

Do you have access and control over the SQL query?&nbsp; If so, how about making the change right there?

</p><p>I've tried to submit both using MS Edge, and Firefox, with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases, the submission process reaches the popup 'Uploading file', then after about 10 seconds, it halts, returns me to the form, with:

<p>
</p><p>I have tried this several times now, on both web browsers, on three different dates each!</p>

<p>Did you even read my post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I';ve read the instructions on more than one occasion. I;m a software designer, not some dweeb who just installed Win10 and doesn;t know what a FAQ is, or how to follow a procedure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I know how to submit the file. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>web form</em> <strong><em>itself </em></strong>is *broken*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(It has repeatedly failed to upload the same file, both as an EXE, and as an encrypted ZIP archive with the specified password from that document.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I need to try doing it from my Win7 machine, as no attempt to do it while running win10 has worked. For all that I know, Windows Defender is blocking the
<em>upload</em>?!</p>

<h2>            Copy &#38; Paste skipping a Row</h2>
                    I need to paste data into a spreadsheet on the blank spaces while skipping a row which has data on it. Precisely on the even numbers
<div><br />
</div>
<div>E.g</div>
<div>1 aaaaaaaaaaaaaa</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>3 bbbbbbbbbbbbbb</div>
<div>4</div>
<div>5 cccccccccccccccc</div>
                </div>

            <p>Think&nbsp;a&nbsp;formulas play could merge it for you and deliver the desired results ..<br />
An example to illustrate ..<br />
Assume your original data runs in A1 down, with every 2nd row blank,&nbsp;<br />
assume other data to be slotted in-between into col A runs in B1 down continuously, eg:<br />
in A1 down (original data): 1, blank, 3, blank, 5, etc<br />
in B1 down (continuous data): 2, 4, 6, etc<br />
Put this in C1: =IF(MOD(ROWS($1:1)-1,2)=0,A1,OFFSET($B$1,INT((ROWS($1:1)-1)/2),))<br />
Copy C1 down as far as required to merge cols A and B as desired, ie for the sample data above, you'd get this merged result in C1 down: 1,2,3,4,5,6<br />
You could&nbsp;also copy col C &amp;&nbsp;paste special as values to overwrite col A,&nbsp;then&nbsp;delete away col C to clean up<br />
