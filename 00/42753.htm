<h2>            &#34;microsoft register server has stopped working&#34;</h2>
                    Upon start up, after installing Production Premium CS5, I get the message that "microsoft register server has stopped working". I narrowed it down the "windows error reporting service",&nbsp; After disabling it, I no longer get the "windows registry" prompt
 at start up. Why is this, and what should I do?

    <title>Windows Vista Business to Windows 7 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertsukovich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista Business to Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Greetings. I have been operating with Windows 7 Pro w/SP1 for a long time. When I bought my computer, (Dell Inspiron 546) it came with Vista Business and because the timing was so close to Windows 7 coming out that I was awarded a fee download to Windows
 7 Pro when it did hit the market.&nbsp; When it did come out a Tech came to our house and downloaded Windows 7 Pro and I was left with the Disk, including the Key Code. As the result, I have the key code for both the Vista Business &amp; Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; A few months
 ago, I installed a new hard drive and downloaded the Vista Business first and then the Windows 7 Pro with no problem.&nbsp; Within the last 5 weeks my computer was experiencing problems with navigating, typing and an assortment of other problems, so I did a complete
 wipe. I proceeded to do a reinstall using the same order, the Vista Business first and follow with the Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I can get the Vista Business installed OK and the Windows 7 Pro gets past the section where it copies, expands files, installs features and
 the last item on that list and restarts and I am left with a *not so black screen and I get a couple of restarts about 10 minutes apart and each time going back again to that not so black screen and then it just sits there and there is an occasional blip on
 the activity light and that's it, nothing. So, now ai am wondering if my Windows 7 Pro disc is defective. Note, that all the downloads were done and I think that numbered about 115-117. I thought too that maybe the IE should be updated and tried to get that
 from 7 to 9 but it didn't happen because Vista isn't supported any longer. My goal was to get the Windows Pro 7 downloaded so I could get to Windows 10. Thank You for any help.</p>
<p>*not so black screen: It doesn't get black black but my monitor glows faintly when the light in the room is out. Too, when I do a manual shutdown I can see a faint blip on the screen when I do hat.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Microsoft Security Essentials has no product keys or anything of that nature as it's a free antivirus provided by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
2. MSE and NIS (Norton) will NOT work together. They will conflict. You use one or the other and I would absolutely not recommend using Norton.<br />
<br />
3. It depends on the version of Malwarebytes you are using. If you are using the free version, it's simply a scanning program. If it's the PRO version however, it offers real-time protection and may cause conflicts with any other antivirus software installed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

Thanks a lot,

<div>Microsoft Safety scanner means MICROSOFT SECURITY ESSENTIALS? &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Would &nbsp;you really prefer using MSE instead of using NIS? I, myself, think that the second is better than the first due to activating keys.</div>
<div><br />
<div>MSE can alone be complete reliable security software?</div>

            Microsoft Safety Scanner and Microsoft Security Essentials are two different things. MSS is simply a scanner and MSE is an entire antivirus suite that offers real-time protection.<br />
<br />
My opinion on MSE is that it's a great antivirus software for being FREE, however, there are better alternatives, especially when it comes to ones you pay for. I would not recommend the usage of Norton whatsoever regardless of being an antivirus that you pay
 for. In my time as a Blue Screen of Death Kernel dump analyst and doing general Windows based troubleshooting in IT, I have seen it countless times being the culprit of crashes and conflicts.<br />
<br />
It's good in business environments because Norton's support works VERY well with IT departments and ensures they always have the best of the best, but its commercial software is troublesome.<br />
<br />
For an antivirus you pay for, I would recommend ESET. It's fantastic.<br />

Thank you very much indeed,
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>
<div>But I would like you to kindly enlighten me why MSE is not installed with the updates of Windows as long as it is a stand-alone security program?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, NIS has a very good feature which is Norton Identity Safe, which helps you to remember the passwords and usernames of any websites you visit wherever you are. Thus, even from another computer you can log in to any website you logged in with a password
 and username saved while visiting it from your own computer. In other words, your logins are synchronised to Identity safe home page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really don't know if the feature of Norton Identity Safe is stand-alone or it is integrated to NIS.</div>

            I would imagine it's not installed with the updates because as you said, it's a standalone part of Windows that isn't included by default. I would go as far to say that Microsoft doesn't want to 'force' their users to have to have an antivirus solution
 installed by default, and let them instead of course choose their own.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of features like that which don't require you to use Norton. LastPass for example is a fantastic one, and I use it myself tied with a YubiKey. By default, LastPass is free and you have what's called a 'vault'. Inside this vault are your stored
 passwords for any websites you have chosen to save. For example, you can generate a 16 character long password containing letters, numbers, and special characters. As long as the device and or computer you're using has the LastPass plugin installed to the
 browser or OS, you can login to your fault and thus log in to any websites you have saved.<br />
<br />
LastPass Premium enables a few extra features, one of which allows you to connect a YubiKey to your LastPass vault. That way, even when you enter your vault login information, a prompt then comes up and asks you to press the YubiKey button to create a one-time
 completely random authentication password that will line up with the YubiKey you have enabled in your vault. This essentially makes it so even if your vault password is compromised, unless that person has physical access to your specific YubiKey, they cannot
 log in.<br />
<br />
I am not saying you are banned from using Norton, I'm just simply not recommending it. You are free to do as you please, of course. If it works for you, it works for you.<br />
<br />

            MSE and NIS can't work together. However, MSE and MalwareBytes or NIS and MalwareBytes can work together. Also, MSS is like MalwareBytes, so it can work with MSE or NIS.
<div><br />
<div>The reason is that if you install more than one antivirus software, the system is being monitored by two or more antivirus software. If one of them finds a file as malware, other defends that. If this issue occurs, the stability of the PC is affected.
 Therefore, it's not recommended to use more than one antivirus software at the same time. However, if an antivirus software is installed, an antivirus/antimalware scanner can be used. This is working fine because this software won't monitor files and folders.
 It simply scans all the files and folders and removes any suspected files. Therefore, MalwareBytes or MSS works fine with other antivirus software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>NIS is a good choice.</div>

<br />
<br />
If you click the 'Windows' tab, you can choose the browser plugins by themselves rather than the whole suite, but it's up to you.<br />
<br />
In regards to MSS, file sizes are generally irrelevant. Overall, Microsoft Safety Scanner is not meant to be used as a day-to-day tool, since it does not provide real-time protection against viruses, cannot update its virus definitions and expires after ten
 days. On the other hand, it can be run on a computer which already has an antivirus product without any potential interference.<br />

<h2>            Acer laptop won&#39;t start after updating</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has needed to update for a few days so i selected update and restart in the start menu, and the update seemed to go like normal, until it restarted and was stuck on a black screen with a loading circle of dots. I thought the update was still going
 and taking ages so i left it over night, but it was still just on the black loading screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying for 2 hours this morning to fix it, following advice online for what worked for other people, but it wouldnt start in safe mode, and I tried system restore to a restore point from a couple days ago which looked like it was going to work
 and loaded everything, but when it came to restarting, it just went back to the black loading screen, but after trying everything multiple times, now whenever i start up the laptop it has the blue screen saying start up error and only takes me to the start
 up repair options, most of which dont work at all. At this point I'm worried if the reset option will even work. I dont have anything at all plugged into the laptop. What should I do?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

            Hi Tori
<br />
<br />At this point the Reset is your only and best option at saving your system and files . . .
<br />
<br />You should initiate that reset and that will hopefully complete. please note, you will have to re-install all 3rd party applications (including Office, if applicable) after a reset . . .

    <title>lexmark x125 printer installation windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derek_williams  say:</h3>
<h2>            lexmark x125 printer installation windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have bought a new Toshiba Portege which is running Windows 7. I am trying to install a Lexmark X125 printer using the software from Lexmark CJXP125LE.exe.</p>
<p>but cannot get the printer to work. My computer recognizes that it exists when I use the control panel device utility. I am trying to use the compatibility feature, but no luck so far.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Thank you, Derek</p>

<h3> takt tigga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller</h2>
                    
<p>First I'd like to say congratulations on the big Windows 10 update, really well done. Right where do I actually start of? well first I'd like to say since the new update I've had nothing but issues with... Microsoft says windows
 10 will be faster then ever? it will make your Xbox one run and response fast, guess what it doesn't I've got my console to instant on and it still takes time to load, even when I want to snap it takes time to load. What i'm saying is the old update was faster,
 so well done on the new update. I'm not only *** with that but with my 5th Xbox one controller. Since the new update my controller has been drifting, I can't play games or invite or anything as my controller got a mind of it's own, not being funny Xbox but
 to me it seems like a firmware issues something you need to fix or look into. A lot of people are having same issues and we all get told " you need a replacement controller" NOOO WE DON'T&nbsp; we need you to update the controller or do something better with it.
 What else has got me angry about the ONE is that first it cost around $500 or more just for a standered 500gb ONE, then it takes you a year to make a 1tb ONE. First i'd like to say well done you knew the Xbox one was going to be big it takes over 130gb just
 for the first update and to set it up. The games take over 25gb to install, the updates can be as big as 7.1gb so well done congrates. you should of done the Xbox one first with the 1tb you just want to make more money, I've spent over £45 on each controller
 I had and yet am having so much issues with. Xbox you need to put your crap together and make the games/ consoles/ controller cheaper, this is not fair in us just buying a new controller to last only two months? Well my rant doesn't stop here, also why make
 us all pay so much for crap? the Xbox one is crap it's not as good you make it out to be, it has 7-8 year old technology in it and yet you made us pay $500 for something that is not even worth it? I mean people could of bought a high end pc for that money
 and game and stream better and faster then the Xbox one. So i'm not really happy with all the issues i'm having I speak out for everyone who thinks the same and who's got same problems, get your act together fix the issues and stop making people pay more out
 just for you liking. please take this serious. I'm not buying anything on Xbox or any more controllers until you fixed the problems. Please take your time to read and note down.</p>

<p>As for the price of the games and consoles, no one made you buy any of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, you have had and continue to have issues that frustrate you and we are sorry for that but most of the issue you stated here can't be handled in this forum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Microsoft fixing the issues they are and have been working to resolve them and I am sure they will continue to do so.</p>

            Hi  Renee,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App ( Windows Key + i )
<br />
<br />Go to Personalisation - Taskbar
<br />
<br />Is your Taskbar set to Auto Hide?
<br />
<br />If so, turn that option off . . .

<h2>            Windows 7 and Jabra Halo missing drivers</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>


<p>I have a problem with Jabra Halo too, but a diferent kind of a problem. After I managed to pair my laptop with the headset, Windows failed to install the drivers for the headset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The properties of the headset state "The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)". I was searching for drivers but I didn't find any (if there is any). What should I do to make it work?</p>
<p>I've got Windows 7 x64 on ThinkPAD laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>Hi ceeerg,</p>
<p>You might try installing the headset with your security software temporarily disabled.</p>
<p>Sometimes firewall and anti-virus programs&nbsp;will interpret access requests as hostile attacks and prevents them.</p>
<p>You can also perform a clean boot to see if a startup program is&nbsp;conflicting&nbsp;with the device:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>How old is the device?</p>
<p>I'm not able to find the device listed in the Jabra support site.</p>
<p>Is this device compatible with Windows 7:</p>

</p><p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point),
<em>format the&nbsp;hard-drive</em> &amp; then&nbsp;do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) CANNOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • How to back up or transfer your data on a Windows-based computer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971759</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW TO do a clean install of Vista: See the "To install Windows by performing a clean installation" (or the "To reinstall Windows Vista") section of&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: If your computer didn't come with a set of disks, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you would use to do the clean install (AKA a "destructive recovery").
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of EVERYTHING&nbsp;in the list below,<em>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 1. Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 2. Uninstall any now-invalid Norton, McAfee, etc., free-trialware which&nbsp;may have been&nbsp;reinstalled, run the appropriate removal tool (see below), then install the anti-virus application of your choice&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Security Essentials</a> - free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 3. Check in at Windows Update &amp; get the computer fully-patched: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 4. If your anti-virus application doesn't include an anti-spyware component, make sure that&nbsp;Windows Defender is enabled &amp; fully-updated:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Using-Windows-Defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Using-Windows-Defender</a>&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: After getting the computer fully-patched, download/install KB971029 manually [or via Windows Update] before connecting any external drive to the computer:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029</a>&nbsp;[2]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>VERY IMPORTANT!!</em> =&gt;&nbsp; Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it will be reinstalled (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You MUST uninstall the free-trial AND download/run the appropriate
 removal tool BEFORE installing any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades AND BEFORE installing your new anti-virus application</strong> (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>

            Check your Downloads folder for the Windows 10 ISO . . .

The Steps for creating the Bootable Flash Drive are:
Download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can Select Create Installation Media for Another PC
Choose USB rather than ISO

The Most reliable option however is to chose to download the ISO and use Windows USB/DVD Download Tool to create the bootable Flash Drive - I have found this to be completely reliable . . .

Click this link to get that tool: http://wudt.codeplex.com/

            Give this a try. 

Step 1: download the ISO file directly to your drive using your web browser:
https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/24-how-to-download-the-latest-windows-10-iso-files-directly-using-your-web-browser/

Step 2: create a bootable copy using Rufus:

                    Bonjour, j'ai un problème lié à ma manette Xbox One sur Windows 10 : à chaque fois que je la connecte pour jouer à un jeu, celle-ci se met à me causer des baisses de FPS/framerate ou des ralentissement sur le jeu alors que si je me met à jouer directement après à la souris+clavier il y a aucun problème. Comment règle-t-on cela svp ?

            Thanks. Now, tell me what "i cant see on my list of update intalled on my system (add/remove programs)" means?<br />
<br />
Are you saying that the updates are no longer found (listed)&nbsp;in Add/Remove Programs?<br />
<br />
Are you saying that the updates are no longer listed in the "Update History" section at
<a href="http://windowsupdate.micorosft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsupdate.micorosft.com</a>?
<br />
<br />
Are still having problems "deploying an unattended CD"?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can find 3rd party free applications using Bing, Google, or your favorite search engine.<br />
<br />
Also there are Clipboard Apps available free in the Windows Store.<br />

<h2>            atiumd6a.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error - following windows 1607 update</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 PC updated last night with the following updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feature update to windows 10, version 1607</p>
<p>Security update for adobe flash player KB3188128</p>
<p>Update for windows 10 1607 x64 based systems KB3176936</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these updates, when I boot the computer it comes up with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\windows\system32\atiumd6a.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status
 0xc00012f.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press OK the message goes away and I can use the computer normally, until I boot up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with troubleshooting this error? I have done some searching but can't find anything specifically related to atiumd6a.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much</p>

<p>Hi Leviozar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply. I had already run sfc/scannow before initially posting, but ran it again as suggested, this time using the verify and repair command. It reported that everything was OK. I then ran DISM RestoreHealth. Again, no issues were reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still getting the error message on boot up - do you have any further suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I ran the programs in safe mode I saw that the error has disappeared of its own accord (maybe because of subsequent updates?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, all seems fine now, although I will retain your advice in case something like this happens again. Meanwhile, thanks very much for your help on this matter.</p>
<p>

            Ha! I spoke too soon. The error message has disappeared from boot-up but is now appearing at random whilst the computer is working normally. I will run the programs in safe mode as suggested and see if that solves the problem.

            <p>Just for information I did run the programs in safe mode but they found nothing but the error message was still appearing. However, it seems that my computer has now sorted itself out following some updates. No error messages for a while now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to install .Net Frameworks security updates.</h2>

    <title>Unable to download digital picture files from my camera with Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download digital picture files from my camera with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>First, let me be perfectly clear: While I have owned and used computers for around 18 years, I use them for very simple purposes (selling on eBay, browsing the Net and answering email only) I am NOT computer savvy, so if you have any advise to solve my problem,
 please explain in very simple terms.</p>
<p>My latest computer, which I purchased a few months ago, has the Windows 10 operating system. At first, when I plugged in my digital camera to download pictures, the thumbnail page appeared as it always had, I chose which pictures I wanted to save, and clicked
 "download" or "save" and the pix went into my computers "Pictures" files. </p>
<p>The other day, I went to do my usual picture downloading routine, the thumbnails appeared on a smaller screen in the middle of my monitor with a larger page behind it. The page says "Select items to import from E/" "New Items"-the thumbnails-then "Already
 Imported" "January 2009" "Select".&nbsp; THAT'S ALL. I chose the pictures to save, but there's NO "download" or "Save" ANYWHERE. I right-clicked and left-clicked EVERYWHERE, and nothing appears, and it does NOT save into any files on my computer. I also cannot
 move the thumbnail page by dragging to see what it might say on the page underneath. On the right side of the page underneath, it says "Collection" "Albums" and "Folders". On the right side, it has a few editing icons. I cannot move the thumbnail page. I clicked
 ALL over the under page, and over the whole screen, and the only active icons are "Minimize: "Restore Down" and "Close"</p>
<p>HELP!! I am currently disabled and need this to work to make some income on eBay. And PLEASE don't ask me to take a screenshot to show you. All the "suggestions" I received for THAT one don't work, either.</p>
