    <title>Asus Transformer Book t100 Webcam not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre henderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus Transformer Book t100 Webcam not working</h2>
                    <p>I recently performed a clean boot of windows and it upgraded my PC to windows 8.1. Unfortunately, it deleted some of my driver software. I was able to recover most of it, but I can't seem to find the software for my webcam. I click the camera app and it
 says, "to get started, connect a camera". I assume it is because there is no driver software for it. Can anyone tell me where I can download the software, or if that is not why my webcam isn't working, can anyone tell me how to fix it in general?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgot to mention the integrated camera's light is on, so I really need to figure out how to access my webcam so I can turn it off. I've placed tape over it to cover it for now, but I need to turn it off somehow.

<h2>            Windows 10 .net framework error</h2>
                    <p>Original title: after windows 10 upgrade, getting "... \Framework\v2.0.50727\mscorwks.dll could not be loaded"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just upgraded my 64-bit Win7 to Win10.</p>
<p>I thought everything went OK; tested my key applications including Word and Excel. One business app went OK, then my second app hung due to a data feed problem. I could not get it to close, even with Task Mgr. So I shut off the entire notebook. I uninstalled
 the program, reinstalled a new version, and when I clicked the icon, I got this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\mscorwks.dll could not be loaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jenith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt response. First of all the app is called OptionNetExplorer. As you probably know, Windows10's GUI/interface is not exactly like it's predecessors. For instance, there is no control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the clean boot, as you recommended. I cannot "uninstall" the NET framework as a program. But I can delete the actual folder. Should I do that ... delete the folder marked: &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it should be deleted, what do I do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or should I simply try to reinstall Windows7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

<h2>            DLC content 99&#37; complete</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have been trying to download (after purchasing) the Black Ops Escalation pack for over a week now, it gets all the way to the end and then shows up as incomplete every single time. I have deleted the files before retrying to download and the same thing happens.<br />
<br />
I was using an Australian Xbox 360 and am living in Singapore with an NTSC version of the game, it works online and all the pacthes download fine. When the DLC was released I was unable to download the pack due to language settings of my game or something of
 that nature however the game plays in English and my Xbox is all in English as well so I dont understand.<br />
<br />
As a last resort I bought a new Xbox (Slim) from Singapore thinking that would fix the issue and ensure my xbox region matched the disc and it seemed to fix the issue. I finished downloading the pack and then it showed up as incomplete and I went through the
 process over and over again (delete and redownload) many times over.<br />
<br />
userid: ccombe (Xbox 360)</p>
<p>I really want to get the DLC content that I have payed for but cannot play because it keeps showing up as incomplete, it cannot be my xbox or my connection as I have downloaded other DLC content for other games without any issues at all in the past. My router
 has been restarted (ports open), xbox restarted etc.. it just doesn't seem to work even though I have paid...<br />
<br />
I tried the black ops forum and they said try try on here... My billing info says Australia, but when I try to update it I cannot change the country, only the street / state which is useless.. Would updating my billing info country fix the issue?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Your account region has to match the physical location you're living in. Since your account is set for Australia, but you're downloading from Singapore, this is why the download is not working. For the DLC to work your account region, disc region, and actual
 region, all have to match. So you would need to create a new account with Singapore as a region, use a Singapore disc, and then you could download it.

<p>ahh ok so that means I need a new account, do I also have to pay for xbox live all over again for the new account or can I use thats paid for on the Australian account? I will make a new account and test it out, do I have to do it on the xbox or can I do
 it online?</p>

<p>You can create a new account on the console or the website, it doesn't matter. However you'd have to purchase a new gold membership (if you want to play online) and any points for the new account. Plus, if your copy of Black Ops is from Australia, you'll
 probably have to buy a new copy from Singapore in order for it to work with the DLC.</p>

                    <p>Title pretty much says it all.</p>
<p>Got my SP2 today. Booted into W8.1 fine. Set it all up, downloaded the Windows 10 upgrade from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Ran the program, got to 24%, reset to the Surface logo, and hung there for an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point I tried to reset it, but no matter what I do it just hangs up at the Surface screen.</p>
<p>I'm able to get into the Bios screen, and the one where it give you options to Reset etc by holding the volume down button when starting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to do a factory reset from the BIOS or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, do I need to make a W10 or W8.1 boot drive?</p>

</p><p>I would wonder if you waited long enough and now have interrupted the install process.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's an advantage of older technology, you can see and hear and feel (e.g. heat) signs that something may still be happening that you would not want to interrupt.&nbsp;
 With the Surface everything&nbsp;can seem&nbsp;lifeless and cold but possibly still be very much alive inside.&nbsp; In fact, heat is one possible sign that you could get from your Surface.&nbsp; If you have an external USB drive involved in the procedure which has lights that
 would be another.&nbsp; Other clues that it could still be working would be any lights in your comm equipment.</p>

            <p>I was able to use the Reset function to roll it back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Tried the Upgrade for Assistive Tech two more times, and left it over night, but it still hangs up at the Surface logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a USB boot drive for W10.</p>
<p>If I do a clean install, by deleting the W8.1 partitions, and installing W10, will I need an activation key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to find out if this tablet has ever been upgraded to W10 and its already registered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answers guys.</p>

</p><p>1. No way to find out if it was every upgraded to W10 - technically, an activated Windows 10 upgrade can be tied to a Microsoft ID which Microsoft has stated is not transferable to a new owner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Can't comment on what is going on with the Assistive Tech Upgrade hanging. If you are in the US, a physical retail Microsoft Store might be able to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. when you buy a used/refurb Surface, there's just no way of knowing anything about the state of the software or hardware.

<h3> mossykaiju  say:</h3>
<h2>            BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER</h2>
                    <p>Awhile ago I tried to plug in my Wacom Bamboo Tablet to work on some commissions, but I found that none of my USB ports (three in all) wouldn't register anything. It would either come up as an unrecognized USB device, or just not detect it whatsoever. I
 tested this with my mouse, my wireless mouse, my xbox controller, my USB drives... everything. No response. Then eventually I got a BSOD.<br />
<br />
BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Problem Event Name:<span> </span>
BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:<span> </span>4105

&nbsp; Service Pack:<span> </span>1_0<br />
&nbsp; Product:<span> </span>768_1</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Originally I was able to solve this problem by shutting my computer down for a little while and then letting the static disperse. Then, when I turned it on, my tablet suddenly worked. However, since then it has been spotty. I know my chord is fine. It's brand
 new, intact and everything. My tablet may be kind of old, but it's always worked just fine. I know it's my computer for sure.<br />
<br />
I've also started to drain my battery more often, and that's helping too. I'll admit I used to have the bad habit of leaving my computer on for very long periods of time, putting it to sleep when not in use. And I've since stopped that, shutting it down every
 night and whenever I'm not using it.<br />
<br />
Please help me if you can. I can't afford to fix this lapto with new parts. Is there anything I can do?<br />

            So before I do anything, I would just like to clarify if this is right:<br />
<br />
I've gone in to Device Manager. <strong>atikmdag.sys</strong> is located within <strong>
ADM Radeon HD 6290 Graphics.<br />
</strong>Do I find a new driver for ADM Radeon HD 6290 Graphics? Do I uninstall the whole thing and re-install a new one? If so, can you direct me to the right download link for this driver? I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes.<br />
<br />
Also, question: Will uninstalling this graphics driver cause my computer to crash or fail somehow, preventing me from re-installing it?<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>at some point it was mentioned that the max would be 16TB per drive, not sure that is still in place though.</p>
<p>Regarding a Hub, it's not officially stated anywhere if it's supported or not, but I've seen reports of people using a Hub without issues.</p>

<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; That explains why the sort didn't work.&nbsp; So instead of patch ids we would have to go back to LastWriteTime of modules to get any kind of ordering of versions and infer patch orderings that way.&nbsp; Yuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I have tried to get some ideas by comparing what the Store does on both W8.1RT and W10 but haven't got anywhere on that tack yet.&nbsp; They both seem incredibly different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't have ProcMon on the RT here is what I am using to find out what has been written for "today".&nbsp; I really must find out how to create a script out of this because it is so useful.&nbsp; Also note that you could pipe it to .\clip.exe or a file to make
 it more usable than just wrapping in your console window.</p>

<h2>            I chose not to enable Cortana on system setup. Now, I cannot enable it.</h2>
                    <p>When I first setup my new PC, I chose not to enable Cortana or any of it's related features. Now, I would like to have Cortana on my desktop, but there are no settings or options to allow me to enable it anywhere. When I go to system settings and choose
 "Cortana and search settings" it does nothing. There is only an information page about Cortana and no options to install it. I've read several posts talking about how to fix Cortana if it is not working properly or if it is not available in a specific region,
 but none addressing what to do if you originally disabled it and want to re-enable it. I know it is available in my region because I have used it on my other Windows 10 PC's in the past without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling via PowerShell and modifying CortanaConsent in the registry, but still, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots to demonstrate that Cortana is in fact, not there:</p>

            Yes. I've already tried that. It did nothing. The only thing I haven't tried is reinstalling Windows, but I would rather avoid that if possible.

            <div>&nbsp; Hi JanettVA, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’m sorry to know that you are having trouble in copying and pasting from web. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to this question:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- From which web browser&nbsp;are you&nbsp;trying to copy and paste?</div>
<div>- Are you using any third party webbrowser?</div>
<div>- Are you using Modern UI Internet explorer or Desktop Internet Explorer?</div>
<div>- Are you able to copy paste text from web browser to text document? (eg: Notepad)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I see that the PrintMaster 18 application is compatible with Windows&nbsp;8 Operating System, I would suggest you to install the software/ application&nbsp;from the link&nbsp;and check if it helps.</div>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step B:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode with Networking then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean
 boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’ </b>option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the
<b>Task Manager window </b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>

If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the

<h3> sergio pissanetzky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double-clickling a .bat file in a Windows 7 Explorer directory worked just fine.</h2>
                    <p>I use&nbsp;.bat files created in a text editor. I used them under XP for years with no problems at all.</p>
<p>These are small files that run various executables of a LaTeX typesetting system.
</p>
<p>But now, I have upgraded to Windows 7. </p>
<p>Double-clickling a .bat file in a Windows Explorer directory in Windows 7 worked just fine while the extension&nbsp;.bat was associated with "Unknown Program."
</p>
<p>But I mistakenly associated .bat with Notepad, so now it opens in Notepad instead of running.
</p>
<p>How can I re-associate it with Unknown Program?&nbsp; </p>
<p>The dialog for associating file extensions with programs does not have an option for doing that.</p>

            <p>Sorry, no can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going from XP 32-bit to anything 64-bit will require a clean install.</p>
<p>Assuming you don't already own XP 64-bit, you'll need to purchase it separately,
</p>
<p>but availability at this point is scarce, if not non-existent. </p>
<p>(iirc, Microsoft offered a discount on upgrading XP from 32-bit to 64-bit, but that was years ago)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP 64-bit was a big flop&nbsp;anyhow... </p>
<p>Unless&nbsp;the software you're using has been tested to work on XP 64-bit, you may run into issues.
</p>
<p>And it's really not worth investing your time or money into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to grab a&nbsp;retail package&nbsp;of Windows 7 64-bit while they're still around.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you choose to build your next machine, </p>
<p>you can ditch your old machine and transfer your Windows 7 license. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you choose to purchase a manufactured machine, your Windows 7 will be a good insurance,</p>
<p>as you may (or may not) find Windows 8 intolerable and wish to downgrade :-p</p>

                    <p>Today I went to open a movie file using the Windows 10 APP and it reported a File System error (-2147219196).</p>
<p>It does this on three of my Windows 10 computers that just had the latest 2/14/2019 Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>This is not a PC problem but rather a problem with the update or the application.&nbsp; I suspect the update.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to quality control?</p>
<p>When can we expect Microsoft to look at this?</p>

            Hi Tomb18ZI,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run video play troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Video playback &gt; Click and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />2. Reset Films &amp; TV App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Films &amp; TV by Scrolling Down &gt; Click Advanced Options &gt; Click Reset
<br />
<br />3. If Reset doesn't work, then you should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Films &amp; TV App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste it
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage Microsoft.ZuneVideo | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.ZuneVideo | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />4. Review below help

<br />
<br />5. Use VLC Media Player as an alternative
<br />It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.
<br />
<br />To download VLC - <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>

<p>Made no difference.</p>
<p>Since this is an issue on three computers (one of which was just built 2 days ago,) it is unlikely a PC issue. My new PC as well has a completely different profile and Microsoft account.&nbsp; The newly reinstalled program has exactly the same version number.</p>

                    My computer occasionally loses power for no apparent reason. This sometimes happens when I'm using the computer, and sometimes when I'm away from it. The most recent time it happened, I checked the event logs and found this in the System log:&nbsp;

<div>The description for Event ID 1003 from source ISCT Agent cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.</div>
<div>
<div>If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.</div>
<div>The following information was included with the event:&nbsp;</div>

<div>the message resource is present but the message is not found in the string/message table</div>

<div>Please can someone tell me in words of one syllable how I can stop this from happening again?</div>

            Thanks for getting back to me. No, it doesn't go to sleep - it just suddenly dies, and needs to be re-started. I then get the Open Windows Normally/Open In Safe Mode... etc choice. If I open in safe mode I don't get the functionality I need, and I don't
 know how to do diagnostics, other than to look at the event logs, so I end up going back to normal Windows - until the same thing happens again.&nbsp;

<div>I don't think it's a wireless driver that's causing the problem, because I was having the same difficulty before I got my new wireless kit a little while ago.&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to know how daisy chaining works? Is this also the same connecting two monitors? Can anyone help me set-up this, step by step? It would be best if someone can post a diagram or illustration of it.&nbsp; Thanks</p>
