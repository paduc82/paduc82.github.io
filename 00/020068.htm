    <title>Low storage while updating Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Low storage while updating Win 10</h2>
                    While updating to the win 10 build(10.0.10586.545) my Lumia 535 dual sim indicates low storage on internal device. I freed up some space and 1.1gb was available. After resuming download the progress got stuck at 2% and used some space. The remaining space
 left in internal storage is 410mb.The update now seeks to restart and gives the same low storage as earlier. There is no way i can free up any more space. All data that exists on the internal storage is either system data or system apps that can't b moved.
 What do I do?

            <p>First of all </p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have been notified the amount of free space required PRIOR to update, and you should NOT have attempted the update&nbsp;if you did NOT have the MINIMUM free space****</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ONLY <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>THREE AREAS</strong></span> where a user can reduce any Temporary Files, this should show as MORE free space available</p>

<p>
</p><p>Delete temporary files, and cookies in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; <strong>Internet Explorer /settings, / Delete history.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are TWO <strong>Temporary File storage areas</strong> (located at the base of Storage Sense reports) PHONE &amp; SD CARD</p>

<p>
</p><p>As a last resort&nbsp; you can delete apps and re-install them after the update</p>
<p>IDK if indeed you had minimum free space requested, but as you can see NOT having space will imapct the update and may lead to other issues</p>

            Like I indicated earlier, 1.11gb (710 mb required for the update)space was available prior to the initiation of the update process. I suspect, the update files took up some space and due to an interrupted internet connection or some other problem, the
 update process started again and is prompting to free up more space. Could that happen?The "system and reserved" section size as seen in storage sense is 4.88gb. Is that the size taken up by system files? Moreover, the system apps can't be uninstalled either
 as you have suggested.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're glad to help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there could have been like an assessment for the phone storage before the update starts. To know if you have enough space for the updates, but we suggest to back up the phone and do a hard reset, Settings&gt; About&gt; Reset your phone. After setting
 up the phone, download the update and install it again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us if you need further assistance. </p>

            Selecting "Sign in using another profile" instead of clicking the profile it suggested (the same profile, but from before the rename to outlook.com) worked for me. Just wait a while for it to download the profile data and then everything worked like before.
 All saves made before renaming the account works like they should etc. in GTA IV.<br />

            <p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user renames an account, the old account name will be the ALIAS of the new one.
<br />
</p>
<p>Example: <br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** was renamed to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** will become the alias of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. <br />
In this case the user won't be able to log using their old account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to use your newly named account when signing in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about renaming process, you can check this link</p>

            The problem isn't with people signing in using old credentials, it's that the new credentials aren't accepted.&nbsp; Blunden got it right- there must be something cached which screws up authentication.&nbsp; Treating my outlook.com address as if it's a 'new' profile
 worked in all the GFWL apps I've tried so far.

    <title>Excel Won&#39;t Load the SAS Add-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasm516  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Won&#39;t Load the SAS Add-in</h2>
                    <p>We are running Office 365 Pro Plus with the&nbsp;SAS Add-in 7.1 for Microsoft Office (32-bit) on Windows 10.&nbsp; A few users are experiencing a problem where Excel will not load the add-in.&nbsp; The add-in loads in other Office applications, just not in Excel.&nbsp; If we
 go into the disabled add-ins and try to re-enable the SAS Office add-in, it simply will not re-enable.&nbsp; If someone else logs on to the machine it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought this was a SAS issue, so I reinstalled all the SAS components on the machines having the issue.&nbsp; That did nothing to fix the issue.&nbsp; I then tried doing a quick repair of Office, followed by an online repair, and neither of those options
 helped.&nbsp; I finally reinstalled Office and that seemed to fix the problem, so I closed the ticket.&nbsp; Two days later the problem was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that reinstalling SAS did not seem to have any impact, whereas reinstalling Office worked for at least a couple of days, I would say this seems to be more of an Office issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this behavior?&nbsp; Any idea on how to resolve the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information or suggestions you may provide will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that this is an add-in developed by SAS, the issue would need to be resolved from their end. If it turns out to be a compability issue with Office, then SAS might be able to reach out to Microsoft from their side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we are not the developer of the add-in, we do not have access to the source code and other resources that may be needed to further troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest contacting SAS to let them know and troubleshoot it on their end. Thank you for understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

If you are still on Build 14901 you should move to Build 14905 and at least that problem is solved but 14905 has many problems of its own.

<h2>            Toolkit to disable automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my C drive I have created a new file and named it Internet Explorer 10 Blocker Kit.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the above package to this position on my hard drive but it contains only 3 different files.&nbsp; The instructions for setting up the blocker states there are 4 files.</p>
<p>I pressume I have made an error somewhere.&nbsp; I am reluctant to proceed if there is a file missing.</p>
<p>My second question is when I enter Command Promt should CD be in inverted commas followed by a space and should the path also be in inverted commas.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for slow response. Glad the command worked this time. I found the same error in the IE9 Blocker Toolkit article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove the block you would replace /B with /U (it's in the IE Blocker Help file which should be one of the files you downloaded.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From elevated command prompt, type</p>
<p>CD C:\Users\The Name of my Computer\Blocker Kit </p>
<p>and hit Enter to take you to that folder/directory.</p>
<p>Then type</p>
<p>ie10_blocker.cmd /U</p>
<p>and hit Enter. Remember the space between</p>
<p>cmd and /U</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also change the registry value of <em>DoNotAllowIE10</em> from 1 to 0. If you need help with that at some future point, ask a new question in the Internet Explorer forum.</p>
<p>That registry information is in this article:</p>

<h3> jhan2455  say:</h3>
<h2>            Colour of word space &#39;formatting marks&#39; changed to black automatically- Need help changing them back to blue</h2>
                    <p>I'm in the final stage of my PhD.</p>
<p>In the process of changing my font from Cambria to Constatia&nbsp;the 'formatting marks'/'non-printing characters' indicating spaces between words changed from Blue to Black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change them back to the standard blue colour&nbsp;but there is no option to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things to note:</p>
<p>- To my knowledge I didn't fiddle with the font colour&nbsp;settings so how this happened is unknown to me</p>
<p>- According to previous forums it isn't even possible to change the colour of these non-printing characters from the standard blue</p>
<p>- Indent arrows and paragraph marks are still blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the colour of the dots between words back to blue?</p>
<p>What caused the change of colour&nbsp;of these marks?</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

    <title>HASH of the Malware in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adm_tombollens  say:</h3>
<h2>            HASH of the Malware in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to obtain the HASH from a Malware which has been identified in Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I run the MailProtectionReport.xslx, I get to see the Malware Mail Details but it does not show the HASH of the Malware, only the name of the Malware (which belongs to the AV company) and this is only 'general information'. A report is
 for example "JS/Nemucod.TSF" but I would like to obtain the HASH of this Malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

            Hi Tom,<br />
<br />
In Office 365, the following fields are also included in reports about malware-detected messages:<br />
<br />
<strong>event_type</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; This will always be <strong>Malware</strong>.<br />
<strong>filename</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the file that contained the malware.<br />
<strong>malware_name</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the malware that was detected.<br />
<br />
Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn500744(v=exchg.150).aspx#BKMK_Viewmailprotectionreportsintheoffice365admincenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use mail protection reports in Office 365 to view data about malware, spam, and rule detections</a>.<br />
<br />
I have also done some research but found no articles saying we can get the hash of the detected malware in Office 365. It will be great if the goal can be achieved, given the situation, I suggest you submit feedback to our related team via:

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
Right click Start button</li><li>
Choose Command prompt (Admin)</li><li>
Key in&nbsp;<em>Powershell</em>&nbsp;in the black window and hit&nbsp;<em>Enter</em>.</li></ol>
</li><li>
Paste the following command in the&nbsp;<em>Administrator: Windows PowerShell</em>&nbsp;window and press&nbsp;<em>Enter</em>&nbsp;key:
<pre>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</pre>
</li><li>
Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up.</li><li>
When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully it’ll start working. If not, this solution won’t apply to you, unfortunately.</li></ol>

    <title>16226-16232 missing keyboards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianrg  say:</h3>
<h2>            16226-16232 missing keyboards</h2>
                    <p>This is not about the current language problem for keyboards in 16226 - This appears to have been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead it is about missing keyboards:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option of a full or standard touch keyboard is missing in the Setting app. You can get a full OSK by launching the OSK.exe in System32. This offers a more complete keyboard then the missing standard keyboard and A LOT more than the current keyboard:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50ce3abd-98d6-4f67-aade-9aed4a5153d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50ce3abd-98d6-4f67-aade-9aed4a5153d8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I scanned through the new keyboards options and there is no Myanmar keyboard in the list. I trust that this will return when this problem is fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: The Myanmar keyboard is there now but the touch keyboards for English have become even more restricted - English US and English Australian - only the small swipe keyboard. English International and Myanmar only basic keyboard. Still no full or standard
 keyboard!</p>

<p>Yeah the new keyboard is pretty terrible on my touch tablet.</p>
<p>They lag and skip and now we no longer have a full keyboard option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what they are smoking over in Redmond but it must be pretty good if they thought removing full keyboard access from touch machines was a good idea.</p>

<p>Found a solution to this problem</p>
<p>1) For first need setup presissinons for folder C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink</p>
<p>2) Download old files keyboard (I get this from build 16199)</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9D3uZn3ETDzYV9fNW5wZ2dSMUk</p>
<p>
</p><p>File to change: InkObj.dll,&nbsp;InputPersonalization.exe,&nbsp;IpsPlugin.dll,&nbsp;TabIpsps.dll,&nbsp;tabskb.dll,&nbsp;TabTip.exe,&nbsp;TipRes.dll,&nbsp;tipresx.dll,&nbsp;tipskins.dll,&nbsp;tiptsf.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Open Task manager and end "Touch Keyboard and handwrite" and maybe related processes</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Replace files in&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Enable standard keyboard in regedit&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\TabletTip\1.7]<br />
"EnableCompatibilityKeyboard"=dword:00000001</p>
<p>
</p><p>or just use file&nbsp;Enable Standard Keyboard Layout.reg&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Restart windows and enjoy!</p>

<p>I use Hotmail.</p>
<p>I can print pictures that are attachments, but this one is in the body of the e-mail.</p>

            <p><strong>Operafan </strong>- I &nbsp;suggest to you to print the document into PDF file. You will get:</p>
<p>1. Numbering as it was in previous versions (as it was already mentioned - they appear on the printout).</p>
<p>2. Your numbers will be static! (I believe - you would prefer static numbers while you are editing this document.)</p>
<p>3. Using PDF as a source and DOCX as final document - you will not mix them up (I had such problem before finding this solution)</p>

    <title>Read&#47;Convert old Lotus WK1 and WK4 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roninrr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Read&#47;Convert old Lotus WK1 and WK4 files</h2>
                    <p>I am archiving some old tax records and find that I did some of the old tax computations with Lotus 1-2-3. (WK1 and WK4 file extensions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Excel 2010 (and Excel 2007), but neither will read the old WK1 &amp; WK4 file formats.&nbsp; Apparently earlier versions of Excel will import these files, but support for those files was dropped in Excel 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have legitimate copies of Excel 2007 and 2010, is there any way to get access to the older versions of Excel -- or get access to the software that would read the WK1 and WK4 formatted files (these are the preferred approachs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is pretty much impossible, has anyone else had this problem and used one of the file conversion programs offerred on the Internet.&nbsp; My real question about these programs is, just how safe are they.&nbsp; I am really trying to stay away from downloading
 any questionable software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or any other advice/help will do.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The files date back to 1987 and even though I have always preferred Word and Excel, the files were done with Lotus 1-2-3 when I worked at IBM on a workstation product, and at the time, IBM was pedaling the Lotus products and they were available to IBM employees
 free.)</p>

            Hi Kamax,<br />
<br />
Did you have to reinstall the application from the website or did you already have an installation file on your phone? I would recommend removing/uninstalling the My Phone application from Settings-&gt;All Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Remove Programs and then reinstall the
 application by going to <a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myphone.microsoft.com/install</a> on your phone.&nbsp;If the reinstallation doesn't work as expected, you could also try performing a reset on your device.
<br />
<br />
You can find more info on resetting your device here - <a href="http://www.hardreset.eu/htc_touch_pro_2_rhodium_hard_reset_soft_reset_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hardreset.eu/htc_touch_pro_2_rhodium_hard_reset_soft_reset_en.html</a>. Just make sure to back up all the data on your phone if you decide to do a hard reset! A soft reset
<em>should be sufficient</em> in most cases.<br />
<br />
Can you also tell us which service provider you are with and your current location? (For eg. Vodafone, UK or T-mobile, USA, etc)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Koshal

            Since you ask this question in an Access forum, I will ignore the .dbf request, and suggest you import or link your text file and run queries on it from Access. The help file has more info on how to import or link to files.

<p>Basically - assuming that the text file is structured enough like a database table - you can use File... Get External Data... Import, and select "Text files" from the "files of type" dropdown to import the data into a local Access table. You can use File...
 Get External Data... Link to create a link to the file without importing it - this won't be updateable and may be quite slow if the file is large, but it will let you see changes in the data if someone else is updating the text file.</p>
<p>There's an Import Wizard that will help you map out the file into fields, name those fields, etc.</p>

    <title>Outlook sending email SLOW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gigi1124  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook sending email SLOW</h2>
                    I have a brand new iMac with Office for Mac 2011 installed. There is only 1 POP email account in Outlook, and we host the email server in-house. There are no file size limitations in place whatsoever.<br />
<br />
It takes about 15 minutes to send an email with a 7mb attachment. Our internet connection usually runs about 5 Mbps upload, so speed is not the issue. I have completely removed and reinstalled Office, reinstalled Safari, turned off the firewall on the local
 machine, and I'm out of ideas. This is occurring on 2 different machines. <br />
<br />
All of the other machines on the network are PC with Outlook and they are having no issues at all.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

<p>Are you sending large attachments?</p>
<p>Remove and re-add the email account and check if this helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>To remove and add the email accounts:</p>
<p>Open Outlook &gt; GO to Tools &gt; Accounts &gt; Click on "Minus" symbol to remove and "Plus" to add an Email account.</p>

            Everyone in the office uses Outlook on PC's and it works just fine. No, I'm not sending large attachments. I have removed and re-added the account.
<br />
<br />
I will try rebuilding the database and post the results. Thanks for the ideas.<br />

            I tried all of the above. I cannot believe that it would take 5 minutes to send a 2 mb email. It shows the progress indicator chugging along in increments of 7-10 KB.
<br />
<br />
Inevitably what happens is that the outbox gets clogged up, and the user thinks that her emails have been sent but they are still sitting there.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions??<br />

Hi Brent, are the Outlook 2011&nbsp;clients on version 14.1.3 by chance? What happens if you test a client on version 14.1.0?</p>
