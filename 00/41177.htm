    <title>Desktop blinks periodically after upgrade to Windows 10 and after it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desktop blinks periodically after upgrade to Windows 10 and after it blinks it closes Windows like &#34;This PC&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have Dell laptop model N5110 and just finished upgrade from Win 7 Home to Win 10.&nbsp; Now my desktop blinks&nbsp;periodically and closes&nbsp;most other&nbsp;windows I have open except for Live Mail and Edge; it also doesn't close a Word document window.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can start Control
 Panel, but it opens and closes immediately.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;open "This PC" and&nbsp;it closes immediately.&nbsp; But if I right click anywhere on my desktop immediately after opening "This PC" and click refresh I can keep "This PC" window open until I try to&nbsp;navigate to any
 of its options and then&nbsp;it closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop my desktop from refreshing and leaving only a few windows open like Edge and Live Mail after it blinks.&nbsp; Is the opening and immediately closing of Control Panel and This PC related to this blinking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>12/26/2015 I am adding the following symptom to help diagnose what could be causing my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional behavior anomaly:&nbsp; the periodic blinking / refresh also seems to be affecting the "clock timer" of how long the laptop is idle and according to setting should be asleep or hibernating.&nbsp; Today I left the laptop on for over 2 hours with no activity
 by a user and it failed to go to sleep or hibernate.&nbsp; This feature worked with Windows 7.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Leslie,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might be causing because of some corrupted system files. So, I suggest you to run a SFC (System File Checker) scan from the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on Start button and select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>)”.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After the scan is complete, type “<strong>exit</strong>” and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure you install all the Windows update and also install the latest display drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hello - Thank you for the starting point to troubleshoot my problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC scan reports " no integrity violation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all devices in Device Manager and all report that I have the most recent driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blinking appears to be occurring once a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might add that when Windows 10 was installing, at one point my screen went blank / black, and after 30 minutes my screen was still blank / black,&nbsp;and the laptop appeared to not be responding to any user input,&nbsp;so I pushed the on/off button and&nbsp;upon restart
 I received a message that Onenote had not completed and needed to be updated.&nbsp; So I clicked to update Onenote; and its update was successful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I revert to my Win 7 OS and try the &nbsp;Win 10 install again without having to download Win 10 in order to retry its install?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Instead of installing Windows 10 again, try to perform Automatic Repair in Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Automatic Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix
 it so your computer can start correctly. Download a Windows 10 ISO in DVD or USB.

<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.</span></p>

            <p>I appreciate your attitude to keep me moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I provide you the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I'm getting into a lot of terminology with which I have little experience, and the links send me into what&nbsp;feels like going down&nbsp;a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My laptop is now also freezing periodically, in addition to blinking / refreshing on 1 minute intervals.&nbsp; Sometimes it recovers from the freeze, which can last 20 minutes or so, and sometimes it doesn't even after 30 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can get task manager
 open [sometimes I can when laptop is frozen] I end all active tasks and regardless of task manager I do a shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, regrettably&nbsp;I have to ask a&nbsp;couple more questions [I hate being stupid about being my own tech support]:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I use my Western Digital passport as the USB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the downloaded Windows 10 ISO also known as the System Repair Disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can&nbsp;I download the Windows 10 ISO directly to my&nbsp;USB passport? or do I download it to my laptop harddrive and copy it to USB?&nbsp; I'm reading the information about Media Creation Tool and it has a RECOMMENDATION&nbsp;for using the media creation tool on a PC running
 Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. If you run this tool on a PC running Windows 10, it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>can</strong></span> overwrite temporary files that are needed if you ever want to go back to your previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I boot my laptop using the&nbsp;Windows 10 ISO USB device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to try a repair.&nbsp; Please be patient with me.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the latest (12/26/2015 8:23a CST)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I located a blank SanDisk, and downloaded media creation tool, and started the media creation tool .&nbsp; It gave me 2 options, upgrade now or create media.&nbsp; I selected create media and on the next screen I selected Create installation media for another
 pc.&nbsp; The tool provided me a screen with language, edition, and architecture pre-filled which matched my laptop's entries, and there was a check box with "use selected recommendation for this pc" which I left checked.&nbsp; On the next screen, I had a choice of
 ISO or USB so I selected USB.&nbsp; The download started and ran for 6 hours when I was presented with the tool's buttons to "finish" and another option.&nbsp; I selected finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just now finished trying to boot from the USB, each time I try to get the laptop to boot from the USB, I tried 4 times to boot from the USB, it appears to be booting from my harddrive on each of the 4&nbsp;attempts.&nbsp; So in settings, I went into security and
 selected recovery, then I selected repair, then I selected troubleshoot, then I selected advanced.&nbsp; The pc indicated it was doing an automatic repair and wanted to know location for the repair data, so I indicated my USB drive.&nbsp; The laptop indicated it was
 diagnosing pc, and then showed a startup repair screen and then provided a message that it couldn't repair this pc and gave me the name of log file on my USB drive.&nbsp; The log is not on the USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I found a windows log file on my harddrive, however, I am not able to open it in a readable format.&nbsp; The file extension is .etl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blinking / refresh continues, it does not start immediately after start-up completes.&nbsp; The blinking starts when I initiate opening a task, like Edge, Live Mail, or try to open a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's next?&nbsp; I can't use this laptop with this behavior.</p>

            <p>Hi Greg:&nbsp; First let me thank you so much for your assistance during this holiday week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where I am in my attempt to repair my Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blinking / refresh continues.&nbsp; I am working through the Integrity checklist and it appears:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; All Windows update are installed and no more are available.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Device Manager is reporting no missing drivers and indicates that all drivers are up-to-date.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I have disabled the following in Startup via Task Manager:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Dell Datasafe, Dell Stage.&nbsp; These are the ones I could safely tell I did not need.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; There is another Dell start-up item I am not able to tell whether its needed and I am not confident I can disable it.&nbsp; Its called Quickset.&nbsp; I am still researching what it does and whether it is fighting with Windows 10.&nbsp; My initial take&nbsp;from its
 description is this could be the source of my problem.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I have disabled the following in Services via msconfig:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;Dell Data Vault and its Wizard, Dell Datasafe online, Dell Support Assist Agent, and Softthinks Agent Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can tell, all other startup and services are needed, or as on stand-by.&nbsp; Most other start-up and services are related to Intel, HP, Western Digital, Adobe, mouse / keyboard, Bluetooth, etc.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; My browser [now Edge] has Bing for address bar search, Adobe Flash Player, and I've imported my IE favorites.&nbsp; There appear to be no add-ons, or Extensions to disable.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I have not uninstalled the Dell bloatware, but can if its presence could be the source of my problem.&nbsp; I can&nbsp; uninstall these later.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Neither Malwarebytes nor AdwCleaner are finding any issues.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I have Defender enabled,&nbsp; I also have Webroot, my AV running.&nbsp; I have disabled Iolo System Mechanic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have begun looking into running "Installation media from the desktop, with a right click on Setup to Run as Admin".&nbsp; I do have access to set-up on my SanDisk and can right click on it to select "run as administrator".&nbsp; And from there I ran into a lot of
 questions.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;provide those questions in another reply as soon as I can organize my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Hi Leslie -</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I suggest you disable everything in msconfig&gt;Startup (Task Manager) and Services (after Hiding all MS Services) at least long enough to restart and test the PC.&nbsp; You really don't need
 won't even run the Factory Install but prefer the superior <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

<p>
</p><p>I would uninstall System Mechanic which like any tweaking suite will only cause problems, and may have ruined Windows if already run.&nbsp; Is it possible there is a System Restore point before it was run or installed?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please uninstall Webroot to default to Defender which is a full AV solution that guarantees best performance without interference.&nbsp; Running two AV's causes problems.&nbsp; If you want you can reinstall Webroot later and disable Defender, but I would not.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for sticking with me on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Repair Upgrade and the blinking / refresh continues.&nbsp; Only now it occurs more frequently than each minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>all</strong></span> non - Microsoft services and Startup.&nbsp; I have uninstalled System Mechanic and Webroot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to look into a restore point before the Windows 10 install was run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I understand correctly, that a clean install means all software, data file, mail, etc. will be gone? &nbsp;This is a big deal to me and I will have to have a lot&nbsp;for backup and recovery in place if I loose it all with a clean install.&nbsp; Is there a freeware
 available to port some specific software to another pc because there is some software I can no longer retrieve even from the development house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only partitions on this harddrive are the ones that would have been created at the factory with original Windows 7 install.</p>

            Hello, this problem that you are facing may be due to some corruption in your files. Try running a system file check, and DISM health restore which will check and fix the problems that exists. Learn more about that here:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833...</a>
<br />If this couldn't find and or repair anything, try uninstalling the app entirely, then re install the app. 
<br />Hope these helps, and let me know if you are still having issues!

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10 Problems</h2>
                    <p>I updated Skype last week to the new version suggested by the Skype Bot&nbsp;<br />
On 4/25/2017, at 08:53, Skype wrote:<br />
&gt; Use the latest version of Skype for your computer (computer). It has all the great features you know and (heart). It’s free to use and designed especially for Windows 10. Try it now<br />
</p>
<p>It looks great and much more simplified. However, there are a few features that are not working:</p>
<p>&gt; CTRL+F in a conversion searches skype contacts instead of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Conversations do not update unless I make Skype my focus window.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The real time persistence is no longer working, this is critical to users who work in other programs and are reactive to Skype messages rather then always in the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update to correct the 2 problems above would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I have the same problem. After Windows 10 updates in December 2016 my Skype stopped working, not connecting when I wanted to make a call. I tried reinstalling but nothing seemed to work and after a week of so I stopped trying, using Skype to talk on my tablet,
 and to message (which worked) on the laptop. A few weeks later when I tried, it worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have happened again after the last update a few days ago. Last Monday I was using Skype without any problem, yesterday it was not working. I could use the messenger but could not use it to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? When can you update without this problem reoccurring (I also have audio problems each time you update but after a few hours fiddling around, so far can fix these).</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will have to add to this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave the new Windows 10 version of the application a week or so to vet out bugs before starting to post complaints but this is costing me productivity.&nbsp; Skype is not usable with new 11.15.597.0&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues range from:</p>
<p>1) Calls coming in ring.. and after I pick up.. skype ring sound continues over speaker.</p>
<p>2) Calls going out ring.. and when I connect, it continues to ring as if nothing connected</p>
<p>3) Dialing out I do conferences a lot and as such would cut / past the long passcodes (one main reason for Skype over desk phone).&nbsp; This is now broken as you cannot paste into the dial pad location</p>
<p>4) Dial pad is not select-able for active call.&nbsp; Once you connect it shows a seperate window for the ability to mute or end the call but cannot complete the call settings of inputting a pass code within that popup (like old app has ability to where I would
 click on dial pad and paste in the code)</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t load up on my computer</h2>
                    
<p>My Windows Vista won't load up after I log-in.&nbsp; As soon as I log-in I get an error message: "Windows Explorer&nbsp;has stopped&nbsp;working" followed by "Windows is restarting" and then it never restarts.&nbsp; I soon start receiving error message that state that other
 programs that are trying to load have failed to do so.&nbsp; I've tried to reboot in Safe mode but I have the same problems in Safe mode also.&nbsp; I try to run an msconfig.exe and system restore but the error messages pop up before I can get the commands in and prevents
 me from doing anything.&nbsp; The problem started Tuesday night 8-3-10 after I installed&nbsp;a router on my modem to enable wireless internet for my wife's laptop.&nbsp; The router is a D-link router.&nbsp; I think I may have to reinstall window vista or at least try to repair
 it but I apparently&nbsp;didn't receive a Windows Vista disc with my computer when I purchased it from Best Buy.&nbsp; A very frustrating situation to be sure.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p>Firstly, support for Windows 7 will be ending in future, so it is better to consider installing the latest version of Windows which is Windows 10:</p>

            <p>Windows 7 Home Premium has a limit of 16gb TOTAL addressable memory.</p>
<p>The motherboard (in your case) accounts for .5gb addressable memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16gb - .5gb = 15.5gb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same applies to 64-bit operating systems&nbsp; as happens with 32-bit systems when the motherboard and installed resources total more than can be addressed by the operating system..

            Hello DebbieKemp1
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having issues.
<br />My name is Frank. I am a member of this forum, just like yourself.
<br />
<br />OK. Let's both take a deep breath.
<br />Now, let's grab a chair and commence the resuscitation process.
<br />Look - an unmountable boot volume is computer speak for "your hard drive is either dead, missing or damaged". 
<br />
<br />Let's hope that the cause of this message is that you have left an update disk, CD or USB stick in the computer during the bootup process.
<br />Please make sure you have not.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, it is possible that the values contained in the ROM BIOS for the boot sequence of devices gets out of sync with reality.
<br />In that case, verify in your ROM BIOS that your primary hard drive is still listed correctly. Is the HD a SATA, ATA, SSD? Know those things before hand.
<br />
<br />Absent an issue like the one I described above, when Windows does not boot, a few things could be happening:
<br />1. After a system update, a driver is causing issues and stopping the boot.
<br />2. An incompatible device is inserted in the computer
<br />
<br />The steps I would take are as a follows.
<br />Is this a laptop or a desktop?
<br />On a laptop, please flip it over and remove the internal battery pack.
<br />Keep it out for now. Unplug the power cord as well. Wait half a minute.
<br />Connect the power cord back to the laptop.
<br />Keep the battery out.
<br />
<br />If this is a desktop, simply unplug the power cord and keep the PC disconnected for half a minute.
<br />Reconnect the power cord.
<br />
<br />Make sure you have nothing connected to the computer.
<br />Keep your keyboard and mice connectors, but everything else goes!
<br />No USB drives. Make sure the CD bay is empty.
<br />
<br />Turn the computer back on. Most of the time, this jiggling around seems to prod Windows back alive.
<br />
<br />I hope this gives you some ideas.
<br />Please keep us updated on your progress.
<br />Regards,       
        </p>

<p>Yes 64 Bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It is a NUC, I believe it to be a rebadged shuttle designed for windows 10, no it did not have an OS, I originally had Win 7 Pro on there, upgraded to 10. At a later date formatted and did a clean install of win 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. Pretty sure it was 30/12/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. Created install media from the media creator from the MS site on that day, was installed via USB stick on a brand new stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2c. I didn't need a product key&nbsp;as it was a previously upgraded and activated copy of Win10</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Yes.&nbsp;and the&nbsp;driver&nbsp;disk is a shuttle driver disk, but&nbsp;the unit was not sold as a shuttle as it was sold as a barebones NUC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - I have Eset endpoint security which is up to date. I have also installed Malwarebytes, superantispyware, spybot search and destroy, all are up to date, none have picked up anything other than tracking cookies. NB at this point in time I am removing it
 to see if there is any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5 - Eset endpoint security firewall, I currently have it disabled and using the windows one, I have tested with the windows one turned on and off. NB at this point in time I am removing it to see if there is any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 - KB4019472 10/05/2017 . KB3150513 24/05/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7 - Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 - Firefox, Yes, 64 bit. Chrome, Yes, 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9 - Normally Wifi to ubiquitu AC access point, which runs through Huawei Cube Cellular AP. Have also tested through wireless N through AP directly, have also tested 2 x android hotspots. All with same result. As mentioned originally our windows 7 PC&nbsp;is not
 affected using chrome or firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 - No, not really unless there is a problem. None have been run on the machines affected.</p>

<p>Following the previous post, I have finished installing Eset and the problems have disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only occurred after 24/5 when KB3150513 was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is either exclusively that of Eset, or a combination of Eset and KB3150513. I will do the same to the laptop which is a i7 Dell XPS laptop, from a hardware level, none of our units should even encounter performance issues.</p>

    <title>Hiding Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickyg50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding Taskbar</h2>
                    I recently updated to Windows 10 and I have always used the auto hide the taskbar feature. &nbsp;Since Windows 10 has been installed, this feature will work for a while and then all of the sudden continue to stay up after I open an app. &nbsp;I have tried turning
 the feature on and off and it will still stay up. &nbsp;The only way for me to get the auto hide to work again is to restart the computer. &nbsp;How can I get this feature to work properly?

    <title>Surface Book 2 - continually undocking from base by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyjsemear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 - continually undocking from base by itself &#40;causing all peripherals to flap&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>After recent OS update (cumulative update for windows 10 version 1809 for x64-based systems (KB4493509)) on Surface Book 2, the computer seems to be constantly 'undocking' itself periodically (about every 20 minutes) - causing all peripherals to 'flap' (SD
 card, any USB connections, etc). Is there a known issue in the most recent update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has started to experience this issue - please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - i've cleaned all connections, etc. This is either:</p>
<p>1. A recent bug in cumulative update.</p>
<p>2. A hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<h2>            Account investigation...</h2>
                    
<p>In early december I had around $110 dollars worth of microsoft points charged to my account...informed customer support and they locked my account up and told me it would take about 20 days to resolve...here I am today and still no account back and my money
 not refunded.&nbsp; I called a week ago, and was told my issue would be brought up again to the researchers and to call back in 3 days if it still isn't resolved.&nbsp; Called, and they said they are unsure and more time is needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does anyone know how long it will typically take them to finish up the investigation?</p>

<p>Btw, the account is PoonPatrol1993...I can't sign in for some reason to post on it..</p>

<p>Good luck mine took 6 months to complete.</p>
<p>Now having trouble getting in contact with the Exceptions Analyst who tried contacting me recently.</p>
<p>Was gonna ask him about all the DLC discounts I missed throughout my investigation. They only gave me what I was missed and it wasn't until after I asked about compensation that they gave me more time. He called to ask me about compensation as well. So I'm
 trying to contact him back but having no luck. Oh and I posted as BillowPanther on here during my investigation.</p>

<p>They don't really keep you in contact on what's going on.</p>
<p>I didn't hear anything until I filled out a BBB complaint. But even then wasn't given any real useful info.</p>
<p>Wasn't until after 5 months that I finally got in contact with a Exception Analyst who never answers his phone and is horrible and keeping in contact. I swear I emailed him 10 times and called in before I finally received any contact from him only to be
 told he no longer has my case and that it's in the hands of the investigation team. Then after getting my account back he's tried to contact me when I wasn't home. Again try to contact him back again and still no luck. I got my account back but he wanted to
 contact me to make sure I was properly compensated he stated in the voicemails. Hoping I'll be able to get in on on the DLC deals I missed out on throughout my 6 month of waiting on them.</p>

            In general, Windows won't see the files on a Linux-formatted hard drive. There is a utility which allows exploring EXT2/3 files systems from Windows but AFAIK it doesn't work for Ext4. If you have data in Linux which you wish to share with Windows, you
 can put it on a separate partition formatted FAT32 which both operating systems can read. Or do the backup from the Linux side and not from within Windows. You can create a chron job to handle this or use one of the many Linux backup programs. I'm very old
 school Linux and am hesitant to recommend regular writing to an NTFS partition from Linux because of the risk of corrupting the NTFS partition, but the newer distros like Ubuntu *can* write to NTFS natively. Depending on your situation, a better solution might
 be to use a network drive (Google for "NAS") which both systems can use as a backup destination.

<p>For the most part I agree with Malkeleah, but I would like to add that Ext2Explore now seems to support Read-Only access of Ext4 file systems from within MS Windows:</p>

<p>Seems that this issue is related to old save files, starting a new fresh save can fix the problem.</p>

            From what I saw a lot of people are having this problem with this error, I believe it is a specific problem of the game, less bad that is not your console.

<p>I just upgraded to an msi890gx-g65 board and bought 6GB of DDR3 ram and windows will only see 3.25 of it.&nbsp; I have tried just two stix and still get 3.25GB showing in the properties menu.&nbsp; Can any one help me with this?&nbsp; The board sees all of it but windows
 will not.&nbsp; What is the limit on ram with XP?&nbsp; Do I need to go to win 7.&nbsp; I really don't want to spend the cash if I don't have to.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There are several factors that affect regarding the maximum amount of RAM in your computer. The first and most obvious is the architecture of the system (32 or 64 bit) since 32 Bit systems theoretical only recognizes a maximum of 4GB.</p>
<p>As some others have pointed out, you dont see all of this memory in windows sometimes but that does not mean it is going to waste! You dont "lose" the RAM its simply being used by the system. (For things like PCI/PCI-X, graphics e.t.c.)</p>

            Thanks suketezu for the reply.&nbsp; So I don't have to ugrade to win 7, or will I?&nbsp; I am&nbsp; abit confused.&nbsp; If the system is using the rest of the ram than is it true that I really don't have the extra to use for other programs?&nbsp; Will I see a big improvement
 in proformance if I upgrade?&nbsp; I have an amd phenom2 x4 cpu.&nbsp; If XP is a 32 bit system does that mean that I am not using the full potential of the cpu and if I upgrade will I?&nbsp; Also will I have to reinstall all my programs if I use the upgrade win 7?&nbsp; I have
 heard that it wants to do a clean install.&nbsp; I assume that means it will reformat the drive.

<p>You really do not need to upgrade to a different OS and there will be no significant difference (in terms of seeing RAM) if you upgrade to 32 bit Win 7.</p>
<p>If you want to see all of your RAM detected, then you need to upgrade to 64 bit. About the usage of RAM, only a small portion is used for specific applications, in your case just .75GB of your total RAM, the whole 3.25GB is intended for use for all your
 programs and applications.</p>
<p>Regarding upgrading to Win7 from WinXP, unfortunately yes, you will need to format the drive since there is no upgrade installation for WinXP to Win7 you will need to do a clean install. :-)</p>

            So in reguards to my cpu, will I see a proformance increse if I go to the 64bit&nbsp; win7.&nbsp; As I said I have a phenom2 x4 cpu.&nbsp; If xp is only 32bit is it not using the full potential of the cpu?

            Yes, since 64 bit is more stable (also in my own opinion and experience) you will see a performance increase. In this case, it's using the full potential of the CPU even if its 32 bit. However, please note that your processor should be 64 bit before you
 can install 64 bit software, if it's only 32 bit then you can't install 64 bit. For more information if your processor is 32 or 64 bit, consult the manual or contact your computer manufacturer. :-)

Not entirely correct as well,&nbsp;a "custom / clean installation" will indeed format the drive, the only difference is that it will create a Windows.old folder after installation.

<p>Ich möchte hier meinen Unmut zum Ausdruck bringen!:</p>

<p>Ich finde es absulut unmöglich, dass Xbox-User aus Österreich <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NICHT</span></strong></span> am Reward-System teilnehmen können oder dürfen.</p>
<p>Es ist eine Sauerei!&nbsp; Wird das in nächster Zeit (DIESES Jahr 2012) noch kommen? Es gehen einem jede Menge an Gewinnchancen verloren.</p>

<p>Wenn das die Art und Weise ist, wie Microsoft seine User behandelt, dann pfeiff ich drauf und geh zu Sony. Es kiann doch nicht das Problem sein, in Deutschland geht es doch auch, wo also ist der Unterschied? Das gleiche betrifft die Apps. Youtube kann man
 als Appauf der Xbox in D benutzen, in Ö nicht. Was soll der Mist!!!???</p>

<p>Ich hoffe es kommen ein paar anständige und zufriedenstellende Antworten,ich denke, dass ich nicht der einzige bin der das so sieht.</p>

<p>Ein sehr entäuschter Xbox-User</p>

Bezüglich Reward System kann ich dir leider momentan gar keine Antwort geben, aber auch ich hoffe das wir in Österreich bald teilnehmen dürfen.<br /><br />Die Märkte Österreich und Deutschland sind leider / zum Glück verschieden und auch das mit den Apps ist etwas nervig. Für YouTube kann das Xbox Team aber leider nichts, denn es ist eine Entscheidung von Google (dem Inhaber von YouTube). Dazu gab es auch ein offizielles Statement:<br /><br /><em>"Und die schlechte Nachricht gleich vorweg: YouTube wird es zum Start nicht nach Österreich schaffen. In diesem Fall liegt das daran, dass Google in Österreich derzeit keinen lokalen YouTube Dienst anbietet.</em>&nbsp;<em>Wir haben diesbezüglich für euch bei Google nachgefragt und hier ist die offizielle Aussage dazu: "Leider bietet Google in Österreich derzeit noch keine lokale Variante von YouTube an.

<p>hallo &nbsp;.</p>
<p>ich stimme elkazam nur voll und ganz zu. ok das mit youtube ist eine sache von google und den österreichischen politikern. ein beispiel ist Goolge Street view , was den meisten von uns bekannt sein wird. österreich verbietet das aufzeichnen von den strassen
 für google. auf der website wo man die strassen entleng fahren kann geht ds fast überall auf der welt ausser in östterreich sind keine strassen von street view zu betrachten und ich glaube das ds von den sowieso total verrückten politikern ausgeht, also das
 sie google hier nicht zulassen wollen oder so.</p>
<p>und was das xbox rewards angeht finde ich auch das es eine absolute sauerei von microsoft ist. allerdings muss man bedenken das die deutschen versionen und die österreichischen versionen der spiele unterschiedlich sind. ein beispiel sind die USK und PEGI
 und in deutschland sie die rewards nun mal auf die USK versionen ausgelegt (auf die ich gerne verzichte. wer braucht schon diese zensierten spiele der USK ^^ ) also wenn ich nur mehr usk spiele zocken dürfte um am xbox rewards teilnehmen zu dürfen würde ich
 verzichten obwohl die rewards eine tolle sache sind.&nbsp; es kann auch sein das ich grad totalen mist schreibe aber das ist nur eine vermutung von mir.&nbsp; es wäre schon klasse wenn österreich die rewards auch nutzen könne.&nbsp; mir würde nur der genau grund wissen warum
 das noch nicht geht</p>

<p>Microsoft schliesst die Österreicher schon ein wenig aus .... dennoch würde ich nie damit drohen zu Sony zu wechseln ;) Ich denke ja auch das gemessen auf die Einwohnerzahl und der XBox Spieler ist im Österreichischen XBox Forum auch wenig los ist, wegen
 2-3 Leuten wird Microsoft nichts ändern ....</p>

<p>@ mabinidicht:</p>
<p>Meine Aussage: "Wenn das die Art und Weise ist, wie Microsoft seine User behandelt, dann pfeiff ich drauf und geh zu Sony. " Ist in keinster Weise als Drohung zu sehen, sondern soll darauf hinweisen wie man sich dabei fühlt von MS so behandelt zu werden.
 Den die Umstände sind bei PS3-Network sicher auch nicht gerade rosig (diverse Webseiten berichteten es).</p>
<p>Und die Aussage das es nur 'Hausnummer' 2-3 Leute sind die Posten, heisst das nicht, dass es nicht wesentlich mehr stört. Die Nutzung des Forums als Spiegel zu nutzen ist doch etwas unüberlegt.</p>
<p>@hardgorebooster:</p>
<p>Du könntest natürlich recht haben, das es an der Altersfreigabe liegt, wobei ich mir das fast nicht vorstellen kann. Man wird ja für die Tätigkeit als solches belohnt und nicht welches Spiel oder dergleichen ich nutze, denke ich zumindestens. Wobei ich mich
 da auch sehr irren kann.</p>

<p>Leider ist mir jetzt etwas aufgefallen, was mir echt den Kragen etwas anschwellen lässt.</p>
<p>Ich habe 2 Accounts (2 deswegen um manche Erfolge zu bekommen) einen Gold, mit dem ich regulär spiele und einen Silber. Da ja jetzt dieses Wochenende in Ö ein Gold-WE ist kann ich mit den SIlber-Account auch online einiges machen.
</p>
<p>Nun kommts: Wieso kann ich mit dem SIber-Account die Youtube-App runterladen und Videos anschauen etc. und mit meinem Gold-Account nicht. Da habe ich nicht einmal die Möglichkeit die YT-App runter zu laden.</p>
<p>Ist das ein schlechter Scherz!? Also geht YT doch in Ö und alles andere ist nur BLA BLA und die Ö Xbox-User werden für dumm verkauft, oder wie soll ich das jetzt bitte verstehen???</p>
<p>Es tut mirleid wenn ich mich das jetzt etwas aufrege.</p>

            <p>Das Xbox Team arbeitet stetig an der Verbesserung von Xbox LIVE, aber leider ist nicht alles möglich. Österreich ist in Relation leider relativ klein, aber die Jungs und Mädels in Wien geben ihr Bestes. Wenn die Sachen rein einen Schalter umlegen wäre, dann würde es vermutlich sofort passieren. So stehen viele Wünsche auf der Liste und die werden nach und nach abgearbeitet. Sachen die mehr gewünscht werden, werden (wenn möglich eher umgesetzt). Nun aber zu ein paar Sachen und meiner persönlichen Meinung dazu:<br /><br /><strong>- Xbox Rewards</strong><br />Ist bisher nur in Regionen verfügbar, die absolut selbstständig sind (US / UK / FR / DE). Östereich gehört mit anderen Ländern gemeinsam zu einer Gruppe, die leider bisher noch keine Rewards hat. Das Thema wurde bereits beim Xbox Team platziert und vielleicht gibt es bald Neuigkeiten dazu (Deutschland musste auch ein oder zwei Jahre auf Xbox Rewards warten).<br /><br /><strong>- Feedback</strong><br />Das österreichische Xbox T

    <title>Skypeforlinux has issues with two webcams - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skypeforlinux has issues with two webcams</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with ubuntu 17.10. It has a built-in webcam. However, since this doesn't let me turn the cam around etc., I need to connect another USB Webcam (I use Logitech QuickCam IM/connect). Details of skypeforlinux version:&nbsp;Skype version 8.17.76.3
 Calling version 2018.09.01.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I call someone on skype, the audio works fine. If I use the laptop webcam, the video works fine too.&nbsp;However, when I select the external webcam, a black frame is shown and the "all-is-working" indicator LED on the webcam doesn't go on as expeted. Sykpe
 detects my USB webcam and I can see it on the Video device settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The webcam works perfectly well with the program cheese. I can see the captured frames live. I can switch correctly between the two cams. When I boot into Windows, skype there works perfectly well with the external webcam. Can you please help me here?</p>

<p>Hello Joseph_A,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I did the following:</p>
<p>1) Selected the external webcam on the video settings dialog.</p>
<p>2) Made a video call to someone. I could only see black frames being captuered and the other person didn't see my video.</p>
<p>3) I cut the call, made sure the external camera was still selected, and logged out. Then I quit skype.</p>
<p>4) Restarted skype, logged in. In the video settings, the external camera was selected by default now.</p>
<p>5) Called again, but video failed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the suggested procedure didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test further, I created a dummy webcam on v4l2loopback, and fed the actual webcam stream to this dummy device. Vlc player and mplayer could both play from the dummy device, but skype couldn't pick up the video (again, device is listed on the video settings
 menu, but when selected, the frames are black). I think it is problem with multiple video devices somehow. Skype seems to work only when /dev/video0 is selected and not otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other possible solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Mahesh</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open, install or update modern, third-party Windows 10 apps</h2>
                    <p>I was using the modern Windows 10 style apps fine up until a few days ago and they all just broke. Whenever I try to open any, (e.g. Wunderlist, Fitbit, Netflix) their window pops up extremely briefly and then instantaneously closes. When trying to update
 or install any app (not just third-party) in the store, I get this error:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the common answers I could find on Google (WSReset, Windows Store Troubleshooter App, Stopping wuaserv and renaming the&nbsp;SoftwareDistribution folder), but nothing has worked. Rebooting into safe mode with networking still produces the same
 error. It's strange, because it just randomly started happening and I've been using Windows 10 for over 6 months now with no problems.</p>

    <title>Worst Technical Support Ever - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel91458  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst Technical Support Ever</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft has to have the worst technical support of any company. Windows 10 just did a major update and I lost the Edge Bowser along with the ability to access some progams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent tech support an e-mail to 'call me' wait time 200 plus minutes! When they finally called back, I was placed on hold, then someone from India who barely spoke English asked me all sorts of questions about what was going on with Windows (thinking I was
 getting somewhere at this point).&nbsp; Then the Indian guy says he needs to transfer me to tech support and there MIGHT be a charge...really a charge for something YOU (Microsoft) screwed up! So off I went to tech support, on hold with music for 27 minutes then
 the call is dropped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having a problem with the recent update from Microsoft for Windows 10? Anyone else loose Edge?&nbsp; I also lost iCloud Calendar...anyone else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Apple Support, same thing, put in phone number and they would call me back. My phone rang immediatelly! On hold maybe 5 minutes, then someone in Alabama gets the ICloud sort of straightened out but advised they have had a lot of calls concerning
 the latest update...anyone else?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to mirror my surface pro 3 to my tv and I am having a hard time connecting it with the wireless display adapter. &nbsp;the adapter shows up on the tv and says "ready to connect" then when I connect it on my surface, the tv says "connecting to my computer"
 then the screen goes blank, while my surface shows that its connected. &nbsp;When I disconect from my surface, the tv screen stays blank, doesn't go back to the "ready to connect" screen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it does work tho but might take me 10-20 mintues of restarting the surface and tv. &nbsp;I tried switching it to different usb and hdmi ports and the same thing happens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this or did i get a defective wireless display adatper?</p>

<p>I've had my laptop for almost 2 years now and just yesterday I started my computer and a message box said "Windows Vista Home Premium product key you typed is invalid for activation."&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I typed the product key in from the sticker on the back of my computer and then it gave me an error message saying "The following error occurred while trying to use the product key:&nbsp;</div>

<div>The facility code is : ITF (0x04)</div>
<div>Facility error: 0xF050 (61520L)"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone please tell me what I should do? I've called dell support several times and they put me through the wringer having me call this number and that number and NOT helping me at all... Should I uninstall something or restore my computer?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My windows was perfectly fine at home over the weekend, maybe it got bumped around on the return home to college? I really don't know and I'm just looking for help....</div>
