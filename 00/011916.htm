<h2>            I keep getting disconnect while using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. What can I do to prevent this from happening&#63;</h2>
                    I keep getting disconnect while using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. Error that pops up "You were disconnected from Windows-based computer." What can I do to prevent this from happening? This only happens if I let the connection sit idle
 for about 5 minutes. Note: the computer isn't idle, just the remote connection. The error does not mention anything about being idle but that's the only common denominator that I have identified. It does not disconnect if and while I'm using it. I've already
 gone through all of the software preferences to make sure there isn't a setting that needs to be changed. Please advise.

 block all other pages except the organization's domain. also use this to keep employees from playing on the web when they should be working plus less chances of malware getting in.</p>

    <title>embedded videos cropped on PC ignore cropping when played on ipad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            embedded videos cropped on PC ignore cropping when played on ipad</h2>
                    <p>I use Office 2013 on Windows 7 (all windows updates applied). I often embed videos into powerpoint presentations and use the cropping feature built into powerpoint to focus the attention on videos. However, when I play the presentation on powerpoint for
 ipad it shows the full video and ignores the cropping that I did on the PC. Please fix this! It makes it impossible for me to use my ipad as a portable powerpoint player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the same powerpoint on office 2016 for mac and it works just fine while keeping the video cropping settings in place.</p>

            <p>Have you tried compressing the media in your presentation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>File | Info | Compress Media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, the saved PPTX retains the entire video so you can go back in and change the trim later. &nbsp;When you compress, it removes all but the part you've chosen to show. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the Compress Media dialog box is as opaque as the usual MS error and other messages. &nbsp;Status immediately jumps to "Processing ... 100%" which may mean *something* but it certainly doesn't mean 100% done. &nbsp; &nbsp;The green thermometer bar also jumps
 clear across to the finish line. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'd rather have a messagebox that says "Buzz off and get some coffee or something, pal. &nbsp;I'll be done when I'm good and ready." &nbsp; At least then you know that you don't know anything. &nbsp;Beats these bogus messages that make you think you know something
 you don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So go get some coffee or something. &nbsp;In any case, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait until the "Compression in progress ..." message at the bottom of the dialog box changes to ... whatever it changes to when it's done. &nbsp;I've been waiting on the silly thing for half an hour now ... giving up.</p>

            <p>Thanks alot for the tip. I thought I had compressed the videos, but as you say that clearly did not work since the cropped data shouldnt exist at all if it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I get home I will try to compress media again and wait until its TRULY finished.</p>

            <p>I tried compressing the media again and left it on overnight just to be sure everything was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still doesnt seem to work. I have also now tested the powerpoint file using powerpoint online as well as the ipad and iphone. All of them show the uncropped video! This seems to be a huge bug. For some reason whenever I open the ppt on my computer using
 office 2013 on win7 it still shows the cropped video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way you know of to actually remove the cropped data. This would really help me out so that I dont have to remake all the videos using some sort of actual video editor and then re-import them back into ppt.</p>
<p>

            <p>I can't think of anything else offhand, but I just realized I may have misinterpreted what you're asking. &nbsp;When you wrote "cropped" I was thinking "trimmed" &nbsp;... ie, showing the whole width and height of the video but shortening it in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But of course, you can also crop a video just as you can a photo ... ie, cut it off top/left/bottom/right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else, I'd like to pass this bug along to MS, but first, can you confirm which you meant so I can make a clear report?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>At this point I have just resorted to editing each video in a separate video editing program and then re-importing them into powerpoint. Very frustrating since I spent so much time making the powerpoint only to have to make it again! Ughh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind of an aside, but any idea how Keynote deals with video cropping. I do have a Mac available in the house. I know I could just go play around with it for testing, but at this point I just dont want to waste any more time on this. More for future reference
 since I will be making a lot of talks for my work.</p>

Hi Palcouk,</p>

The ISP notice when updating the DNS record stated that the update would take a few minutes.</p>

<h2>            Need HELP with software on N97</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My n97 is from Three. I ran the software updater and it found v20 and so i installed it on my phone. Now, i get problems like when i click on destinations it comes up with System Error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I rang Three yesterday and they said that v2 was not compatible with n97 and you need v11, which i had before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They said that I need uninstall v20 and install v11 and I can take it into a three store and they can do it for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I cannot go to a three store atm so is there any way of unistalling v20 and installing v11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhav X</p>

            You will either have to take it back to three or a Nokia service point.

<p>First off, I'm pretty sure that you cannot downgrade the firmware at least not without the services of a Nokia Care Point (I'm doubtful too that the Nokia Care Point can do a downgrade).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, it sounds like you got incorrect information from 3 regarding the N97 being compatible with v20. If the upgrade was available in the Nokia Software Updater (NSU) then the phone is compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with not being able to access destinations after the upgrade to v20 is well documented on this forum and I would suggest doing a search to find the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
That&nbsp;request would have to be sent to a program running on your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have such a program?&nbsp; You could use&nbsp; netstat&nbsp; /abnop&nbsp; TCP&nbsp;&nbsp; (entered in a cmd window)&nbsp; to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. then you would do a right-click Find Up for 34343 and see the program's
 name in square brackets on the next line.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise it probably means that you are trying to suppress advertising and whatever host name that is originally associated with that path and filename has been associated with&nbsp; 127.0.0.1&nbsp; (the TCP/IP local loopback
 addresss).&nbsp;&nbsp; To eliminate all such instances of that you could rename your HOSTS file and do an&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /flushdns&nbsp; (also in a cmd window.)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We currently don't have the option to&nbsp;resize picture attachments&nbsp;in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, I would suggest that you try switching back to Hotmail interface if your account allows you to. To do so, please refer to these steps:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to <strong>Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p>2. In you mail page, click the <strong>gear icon</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select "<strong>Switch back to Hotmail</strong>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would suggest that you upload the photo on SkyDrive then&nbsp;include&nbsp;the link on your message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem here. I tried to Switch back to Hotmail but I cannot find any option to do so. I really need to be able to resize my pictures. For me it's a MOST. &nbsp;I actually switched from yahoo to Hotmail for this exactly same reason. Could

<p>I have a horizontal mounting for my N8 in the car. I like OVI maps much more in horizontal layout. But incoming calls seems to be displayed always in vertikal layout !?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same for the dialing field if you click on "Make call" on the main window. There seems to be no horizonzal version.</p>

<p>It would be a bit hard to talk on the phone in landscape orientation. So no, there isn't such a feature. Is it THAT hard to turn it around?</p>

<p>Yes it is very hard to turn it around if it is mounted in a car kit in landscape view to be able to use OVI maps in landscape, which is great and much more better in landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is a big lack that it is not possible to see the caller number and picture in &nbsp;a correct way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is quite impossible to dial a number because the digit buttons are arranged in portrait mode.</p>

            I love that this one thing doesn't rotate. I hated it on my N97. Everytime I pulled it out of the pocket when someone called, it was horizontal. Annoying IMO.

            Hmm, my Mercedes E-class has built in bluetooth in the car hifi system. So why should this be bad. It works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Nearly all programs on the N8 support landscape and portrait, Why not this eseential, basic screen for incoming calls?<br />
<br />
(You are right it is better not to dial while driving, I can do this on the steering wheel with integrated buttons.. Much more important is the caller display only supporting portrait in the moment.)

<p>Rest assure, i think firmware update would solve that.</p>
<p>did you check out the horizontal call view on the E7 ? it was available there in one of the tech review post.</p>
<p>i for one, also would love a horizontal view for call. it is not about security issue while your driving or what. it is about how we like to use it. for me, i have my N8 in horizontal view most of the time. when i press call on the horizontal view, it became
 vertical, and i have to switch. i mean whats the purpose if u have accelerometer if you cannot rotate even a call screen?</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have created a modern team site and tried to open it using sharepoint designer. We are unable to open it in AWS server whereas able to open and perform operations using Azure server. We have tried to disable it using CSOM but ended up with "Access denied
 error". Account that is used to disable the designer property is added as Site Collection admin as well as tenant admin. In a User Voice, we have seen that the property cannot be disable either manually or programatically but in one MS blog we have seen that
 Modern sites will not be accessible using SharePoint designer. Kindly clarify whether the modern sites will be accessible using SharePoint designer? If yes, please do clarify whether it can be disabled manually or programatically.&nbsp;</p>

            The way Msft blocked accessing a SP 2013 site in SPD 2010 was to slip the restriction through in a "critical update". It wouldn't surprise me if they did the same thing again though I haven't found which update they used yet. If you find it please let
 the community know.

    <title>Align Horizontal Line In A Vertical Elbow Connector Programatically in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenny aa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Align Horizontal Line In A Vertical Elbow Connector Programatically in PowerPoint VBA</h2>
                    <p>I have a Slide with multiple Vertical elbows with (an elbow with two Vertical components and one horizontal component). If two vertical elbows are parallel to each other sometime the horizontal component is at different level creating an unaesthetic situation.
 I have been manually lining them up but was wondering if there is a programmatic method for reading and setting the location of the horizontal component of an elbow so that I could "read" the lvel of the first connector and assign it to additional connectors</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t Yammer send email notifications when I &#64;mention them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My understanding is that when you @mention another employee in any group discussion, Yammer is supposed to send an email to that person. However, this functionality does not work for anyone at our company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever anyone in the company writes a private message to another (or uses the chat feature), an email goes out -- so we know emails are set up properly. But whenever we use the @mention feature, nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we resolve this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Retaining WPA-PSK keys in WM6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> severance15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Retaining WPA-PSK keys in WM6</h2>
                    
<p>Shortly after receiving my new&nbsp;Samsung i760 running WM6, I successfully set up a WiFi connection to my home wireless router using WPA-PSK.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after traveling about and connecting up with other hotspots, I returned home and attempted
 to reconnect to my home network.&nbsp; Although my SSID clearly showed up in the list, apparently WM6 abandoned my WPA-PSK key.&nbsp; I had to manually&nbsp;reenter it - a somewhat tedious job - before regaining connectivity.&nbsp; This scenario has since been repeated twice
 more - a big pain!&nbsp; Is there no way to retain the settings for a specific SSID?</p>

<p>You can use the Avery 74461 label definition in Word 2013, which has the same layout as 74549. Although the package says that the label height is 2¼ inches, the actual height is 2.22" as listed in Word. If you use this, you'll need to set the text alignment
 (in the Alignment group on the Table Tools | Layout tab of the ribbon) to centered both horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the document Avery74549PinStyleNameBadges.docx from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avery.com/templates/74549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.avery.com/templates/74549</a>. (Technically this is a document, not a template,
 but the distinction in this case doesn't matter.) It's the same as what you'd get from the 74461 label by clicking New Document in the Label dialog, except that the text is already center-aligned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2016 and later do have a definition for the 74549 label. As you see, though, you do have alternatives.</p>

<h2>            Outlook CSV File by Category</h2>
                    <p>Outlook used to export contacts by category. &nbsp;Which means that if a person was assigned to more than one category they were entered twice. &nbsp;Outlook 2016 no longer does this after a recent update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a general contractor and some contacts serve multiple areas. &nbsp;It was nice to have it so that all I had to do was sort by the category. &nbsp;Now, with the categories combined it has screwed up everything and now takes me much longer to sort the excel file.
 Because I have to go in a manually separate each contact that has multiple categories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to do that again?</p>

<p>In Outlook when you have the category view, you simply have to have the columns in the order you want them:</p>
<p>Name: &nbsp; &nbsp;Company: &nbsp; &nbsp;Address: &nbsp; &nbsp;Etc:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, since Outlook displays the contacts multiple times for each category, its simply cut and paste into excel.</p>
<p>To do the whole list Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C and then paste into your excel sheet.</p>
<p>For just one category right click on the category header, select copy and then paste into your excel.<br />
