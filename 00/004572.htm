<p>OK, so you need to explain just a little more about what you have done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What software?</p>
<p>Where did you get?</p>
<p>Links if possible?</p>
<p>Is it an .exe file or is it a .cab file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What process are you following to install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy ... we can help</p>

<p>I just took a quick peek ....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears to be a Windows download so I would assume the install is done from your PC.&nbsp; There was no mention (that I could see ) about Windows Mobile so I am not sure just how the install works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need help with programs that are made for Windows Mobile, we can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a contact on the site for help.&nbsp; I would suggest you send them a note and ask if it is for Windows Mobile.</p>

            I'm assuming that after you install on your PC, you will get a special number to dial with your phone that will then allow you to enter a second number that you want to call.&nbsp; I'm assuming there is no software to install on your device ... you will just
 be able to dial a special number to log in.

<p>
</p><p>The spell and grammar on Microsoft 365 for MAC is also not working for me. &nbsp;I note the discussions are based back in 2014 but I am having the same problem one year on. &nbsp;I tried to contact Microsoft in Spore but they are on holiday and Microsoft Australia
 didn't answer my international call after 10 mins waiting. &nbsp;Whereas Apple support answer 24/7.</p>
<p>Why is this happening, why can't Microsoft solve these very basic problems. &nbsp;I am a new home user since March 2015, prior to that I always had the support of my organisation, I now understand why we had so many IT people supporting our desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone at Microsoft HQ needs to standup and deal with this problems because the reputation of the company is being severely impacted.</p>
<p>Think I might go on a training course to fully convert to Apple products.</p>

            <p>Hi Phillip:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not weird, it's working the way it was designed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select some text, then go to Tools&gt;Language... and set the language you intend to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that dialog, click the "DEFAULT" button, then say "Yes" to the prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will fix any FUTURE documents you create on that computer. &nbsp;However, as Bob noted, once a document is created, its language attributes travel with it. &nbsp;So for existing documents, you need to correct each document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is likely that the bad language specification has become added to one or more of your styles. &nbsp;It would be worth checking each of your styles, beginning with the Normal style, and putting their "Language" setting right as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time you make a change to a style, click the "Add to template" checkbox, to ensure that your changes are written back to the document's template when you save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft designed this mechanism to provide ultimate flexibility. &nbsp;Many of us could handle a lot less flexibility and a great deal more simplicity. &nbsp;However, the people working in multiple languages need it to stay the way it is, so ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
        </p>

            <p>Which set of Proofing Tools are used by Word are dependent on the Language formatting of the text being checked. This always has been the case, it isn't a matter of Preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all probability, the "random" sentences are content copied from another source where the respective language formatting had been used. Other possible causes exist, but that is the most common. [One prevalent source of errant Language is content copied
 from web sites.] When the simple Paste command is executed the Language attribute travels with the pasted content. Unless absolutely certain of the source, it's best to use
<strong>Edit&gt; Paste Special - Unformatted Text</strong> in order to avoid the issue. Then format the pasted content as necessary using the existing Styles in the document. NOTE: It isn't a matter of font or character set... The text very well may
<em>appear</em> to be English, for example, but still be formatted as Chinese, Russian, Spanish, or any of several dozen other supported languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct the issue in an <em>existing</em> document: Select the text involved, then go to
<strong>Tools&gt; Language</strong> to select the appropriate Language. If the issue exists throughout the document but should be consistently the same Language you might prefer to first
<strong>Select All</strong>, then apply the Language correction. This is a revision that must be made in each document presenting the issue because Language is specific to the text similar to Bold,Italic &amp; other formatting attributes - it simply is not indicated
 visually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Default Language in Word pertains only to new documents created using that specific installation of the software. Once the document is started, however, it's possible to intermix any combination of supported Languages... intentionally or inadvertently.</p>

    <title>How to recover missing email alias &#40;not deleted by me&#41;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to recover missing email alias &#40;not deleted by me&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Email alias is missing in list, and mail sent to it is not delivered.
</strong></p>
<p>An email alias was previously set up and worked properly for months -- mail sent to the alias was correctly delivered to the inbox. Since early March 2019, mail to the alias has not been received. I did not make any changes to the account,
 so this apparently is due to some problem on the Microsoft back end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alias is no longer listed as associated with the account on the "Add an alias" page (https://account.live.com/AddAssocId). If I try to add it using the "Add an existing email address as a Microsoft account alias" option on that page,
 it returns an error message saying "This is already part of your security info."
</p>
<p>On the "Security settings" page (https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/basic?mkt=en-US&amp;refd=account.microsoft.com&amp;refp=security), the alias is listed with the designation "Will receive alerts".
</p>
<p>After deleting the alias from the security settings page, tried again to add it back as an alias, but got a different error message, this time saying "This email address is already taken. Please try another. "</p>
<p>This is a critical issue since the alias has been used in many places, resulting in important emails being lost.

<p>The problem is not missing emails; it is that the alias itself is gone, and I can't figure out how to get it back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alias was set up by going to the online Outlook.com&nbsp;<span>"Add an alias" page, and using the "</span>Create a new email address and add it as an alias<span>" option to create a new @outlook.com
 address as an alias. That worked fine, and the alias has been used many places and all email sent to that address went to the primary inbox. Until early March, when the alias disappeared from the list and email sent to it no longer showed up in my inbox.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Outlook.com now won't let me add it back. And since it was only set up as an alias for the primary account, I have no credentials to log in using that alias.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I don't know if the Mac allows you to insert ActiveX controls which is what radio buttons are in the Windows versions of Word.</p>
<p>However, if it does, to make separate groups of radio buttons act as mutually exclusive, you need to assign a name that is unique for each of the groups.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            I cannot start the Windows Defender service even though I do not have another antivirus&#47;security software installed</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to start the Windows Defender because I believe my laptop (Windows 10) might have been infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the app, an error message that reads "This app has been turned off and isn't monitoring your computer." appears. The same error message appears even if I try to run as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start the Windows Defender Service from the Service Manager, I get the error message that reads "Windows could not start the Windows Defender Service service on Local Computer. Error 577: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this
 file...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot change its Startup type to Automatic because that menu under Properties is completely grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already run the System File Checker and nothing is corrupted if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate it if someone can help me solve the problem. Thanks a lot.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel for Android - Zoom keeps resetting to its default of 60&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Excel for Android on my tablet.&nbsp; I like to use each sheet of each spreadsheet at a specific zoom size, usually somewhere around 84%.&nbsp; The problem is, every time I close a spreadsheet, when I re-open it, the zoom setting is back at its default,
 which is 60%.&nbsp; So I have to re-size every page of every spreadsheet, every time I open them.&nbsp; To be clear, this is true on ALL spreadsheets I'm using on my tablet, not just one of them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested to me that I change the zoom size on my tablet overall, but I don't need or want the size of the text on my tablet, in general, to get larger.&nbsp; I only need the size of the text in my Excel spreadsheets to get larger.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help, but I have the feeling there is no solution for this.&nbsp; I don't have the subscription - I'm using the free version.&nbsp; If I got the subscription, would this problem definitely be fixed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have exactly the same issue. The spreadsheets always default to 50% on my Galaxy Note 8, which is too small most of the time.</p>

<h2>            When I open Internet Explorer 9 it goes to an MSN Sign Up page instead of msn.com.</h2>
                    When I open IE9, it goes directly to an MSN Sign Up page instead of msn.com.&nbsp; Sometimes there is a log-in option for my email account and then that goes back to a MSN Sign Up page.&nbsp; I click on the Help Center option, then Service Status check and on the
 top of the service status page there is a Window Live then Hotmail (###) and I get to email from that.&nbsp; I can browse the Internet through email connections or Google.&nbsp; Per Windows Live Solutions, I have optimized the browser, tried to do system restore which
 could not be completed, made <a href="http://msn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msn.com</a> my default homepage and sent them a screen shot of the MSN Sign Up page.&nbsp; They said i should ask you for help to get IE9/msn.com working as it should.&nbsp; This problem started Saturday 12/18...prior
 to that everything was working just fine.

</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to try the steps provided from the link below and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:
</span></b><span>Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means
 that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled.</span></p>
<p><b><span>For your reference:</span></b><span> Change your Windows Internet Explorer 9 home page.</span></p>

            <p>Seeing this same error code, but these steps aren't working for me. &nbsp;Three things worth noting:</p>
<p>1. Running WSReset opens the "old" windows store, not the Beta version....not sure if this is significant</p>
<p>2. I had previously seen another error message that I resolved by following these steps:</p>
<p>http://www.winbeta.org/news/how-fix-app-cant-open-windows-10-technical-preview</p>
<p>Unfortunately now I can't seem to re-install the apps.</p>
<p>3. I also tried running the image cleanup as suggested by NicholasDiazXR (also to no avail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

            Still broken... even after you do this, it gives you the error in the store beta (the grey one) this one sends you to the green store... witch isn't helpful because the word preview isn't in that one

<h2>            Internet Explorer 9 Opens with Additional Tab Displaying Search Results for Strange Characters</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi guys,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm having an issue with Internet Explorer where, when I open the program, it displays extra tabs with search results for strange characters. This happens maybe 20% of the time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Usually when I'm connected to the internet and I open IE9, I get something like this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbf230b5-970f-4dcf-a9b5-0443a2cb6c7a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e889b91-eae8-4ae9-bbe2-10f52c65ad37" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d006148-6b14-4925-ac0c-501becfc8fa5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I disconnect from the internet I get things like this (below), which makes me think that these weird URLs are causing searches to fire in Google (my default search provider in IE).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8424e15f-73c6-42d0-902a-bff7585c00a4" /></p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b90c5d4d-502b-47d1-ac58-821efee24863" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But this one opens with an actual Google search URL. Again, network connection is disabled at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbe7b2bb-f17d-412e-9fb8-3c5aaf55b8c1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>What could be causing this and how do I fix it? Any ideas? Thanks for your time! :-)</span></p>

            <blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;As this is a work computer, I leave the home pages on the company intranet pages that we set up for me when the computer was assigned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should have mentioned that.&nbsp; Ask your administrator for help diagnosing your symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, as I indicated, the original symptom description points to a problem with Home page setting and I gave you a method of changing that.&nbsp; About:Blank&nbsp;is just the most neutral Home page available.&nbsp; An alternative would be About:Tabs (e.g. the default
 New tab page).&nbsp; If you chose that you might even find that your original Home pages were listed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, another possible cause (which I have just thought of)&nbsp;could be using the Start with tabs from last session option (on the General tab in the Startup section).&nbsp; Then instead of getting corruption from a multi-entry Home page list you might be getting
 it from a multi-entry "last session" list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp;my recommendation is:&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">as a test</span>, change your Home page to a single item and change your Startup to show only your Home page.&nbsp; Then if you still have multiple tabs opening when IE is started you will know
 that there must be a different reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I've used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.

            You can download Classic Skype and use that.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<h2>            Create a drop down list in Office 2013 and export content to clipboard.</h2>
                    <p>I would like to create a document template in Microsoft Word that contains some info along with&nbsp;2-3 separate drop down lists. After the user selects their choices from the drop down list, I would like them to be able copy all of the information to their

<p>
</p><p>So my question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it be possible for users to copy the info listed in the template along with their specific choices in the drop-down menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be achieved in Word 2013?</p>

<h2>            Recent problem with Outlook Express&#58; Couldn&#39;t send or receive E-mails&#58; My resolution to the problem.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">My recent experience with Microsoft Outlook</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">One week ago, I had a major problem with my E-mail. I could not send or receive and got two warning messages. One was a yellow triangle with an Exclamation point and the other was a warning saying something to the effect that my
 E-mail account had reached its capacity and that I needed to delete old E-mails. Unfortunately, it wouldn't let me delete old E-mails. I tried to find the number to call Tech Support but they wanted me to contact them by E-mail. I tried to call Microsoft direct
 but all I got was an automated answering system that eventually kicked me out. </p>
<p class="contentHeader2">I was finally able to contact Microsoft Outlook Support and talk to a real human.&nbsp; I had to pay $150 for service before they would do anything. They had me put the computer on remote access. They dinked around for three hours and
 finally got the E-mail running. Supposedly there was some bad code in an E-mail. I don't know which one. They also said the repair was warrantied for a year and I would get free help if I called them.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, the same thing happened with my E-mail. I tried to call Microsoft Support but the wait time kept getting longer and longer.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, I called Microsoft Outlook Support and gave them my case number and told them I expected free service. They said they had never heard of that warranty. I told them my problem and the guy on the other end said
 he had to talk to his supervisor. They sent me on to Level 2 Tech Support. It was a long time before I got anybody but I finally got a human being on the line. I talked to him for 5 minutes. I suspect it was because of the warranty but he gave me a simple
 solution to my problem.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solution: Hold down the Ctrl and the Delete key at the same time. That evidently overrides the warning. Once I did that, I was able to free up the system and delete other old E-mails. So far, my system has been working.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other things I learned. The Microsoft Outlook number was totally worthless. It was completely automated. I couldn't even reach a voice mailbox. The system finally kicked me out. Their number is 800-642-7676.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="contentHeader2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A better&nbsp;place to call is the Microsoft Outlook Support Center. Their number is 866-425-4816. That is where I got the help I needed. I hope this helps others.</p>

<p>When I turn my Nokia N95 8GB on I always have to set the time and date, even when i've not removed the battery. I turn my phone off at night and in the morning when I turn it back on I have to set the time and date again and again and again, every single
 time I turn it back on. Does anybody know what's going on?</p>

<p>This is usually caused by a failed auxiliary battery in the phone which keeps time when the phone is powered off.<br />
<br />
You have two options.<br />
<br />
1. Get the Auxiliary battery replaced at your nearest Nokia Care Centre<br />
2. Set the clock to auto update. This is not a proper solution and the phone will only give you correct time after it downloads the correct time from your network.</p>

<br />
I just got the brown 7370. My friend has the gold version and when she opens the phone, the display is of flowers moving and it makes a noise as you swivel the phone.<br />
I do not seem to have this - does anyone know what the theme is called and where i can get it?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

The swivel sound seems to be controlled from Tone Settings and making sure "other tones" is On.<br />

            Hi ozzie - I share excatly the same frustration as you!<br />
<br />
In the advertisement it lookes nice that the flowers are both engraved in the metal and then continuing in the color display.<br />
All images of the 7370 on the net has these flowers on screen.<br />
When receiveing the phone I did not have those images/themes - just a theme with some (boring) blue/green colors :-(<br />
And it does not seem to be possible to download themes from nowhere to the 7370 :-(<br />
<br />
ozzie - If your friend has it in her phone, then you can get it from her. It think it is possible to copy the nth-files from the themes-directory using PC-suite. So at least you have the possability to get it that way.<br />
<br />
Anyway - Should anyone have that theme (nth-file) shown on all advertisements of the 7370, I would appreciate if you could share it.<br />
<br />

            Hi Oz, Cocio - afraid the Goldenflower theme is copyrighted and doesn't show up in Pc suite, or at least not on mine. Just hope that Nokia make these themes available, that advert screen does look nice.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I've made do by finding a decent sized ad on the net and using Pc suite to crop and set it as wallpaper.<br />

<h2>            Lumia 925 Battery Charging issue</h2>
                    <p>hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;am using Nokia Lumia 925 ( with Cyan updated 8.1)&nbsp; since one n half year, was very much happy with it, but last 2 week or so i facing some unique type of problem related to charging issue, the thing is my batteary taking too long to charged up or sometimes
 its does`n charged at all or some time its does charged but for 20% only n then get stuck, to sort out&nbsp; the problem i brought new charger AC 60 N Nokia Made n started using it n was happy that problem got solved, but this happiness got short lived n with in
 20 days or so the same problem got cropped again :(, today i went to Nokia service center Mumbai and told all the issue, over there the service center personal tried another charger, which started working on my cell, later on i tried my charger in front of
 Nokia personal to check again but after 1% it got held up though the charging symbol do appear but it doesn't go ahead, with hell lot of trouble n research&nbsp; finally the service center told me to replace the USB cable wire which i agreed and gave them to replace,
 being without USB cable wire i thought of again buying a new charger which i did this time i got AC 50 Nokia made charger of Rs. 1000/-&nbsp; and started using it, but problem now is that its taking almost an hour to charge 25%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>as battery replacement cost is approx Rs. 8800/- and being die hard fan of Nokia, am now in dilemma what to do being replacement cost is too high or go and buy some other brand ?
</p>

            <p>Hi Riz, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem could lie on the USB connector itself and not the battery or the USB wire.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried doing a soft reset? I had an issue once where the battery would show to only be charged to 40% after an entire night of use. However after doing a
<strong>soft reset </strong>(hold volume down + power for 15 seconds or until the phone restarts.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>

<h2>            SharePoint on OneDrive for Business 2016</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Two general questions on last OD4B version. I know there are some issues with Share Point with this, is there any way to sync the files as in the 2013 version? And do you have a fix coming in the next weeks?</p>
<p>Also is it possible with the new version to stop syncing singular folders and re-sync them afterwards?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Luca</p>

<p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>Firstly I'd like to confirm if you refer to the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client rather than former OneDrive for Business (Groove).</p>
<p>Regarding "any way to sync the files as in the 2013 version", could you describe your requirement in detail?
<br />
If you refer to syncing the team sites in the Next-Gen Sync Client, we’re planning out SharePoint document library sync this year.<br />
Or, you can use the 2016 version of OneDrive for Business (Groove.exe, version 16.0, in Office 2016).</p>
<p>You can let us know more detailed description about the issue you encountered. Just post threads in this forum, we'd like to help you further.</p>
<p>For the second question, yes, you can right click the icon-&gt; Settings-&gt; Account-&gt; Choose folders to simply choose which folders to re-sync.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I'm referring to Sync Client, that I understand is a brand new product from OneDrive for Business 2016. Will Sync Client replace this latter in the near future?</p>
<p>Basically what we're trying to do is to sync documents shared between different accounts, but that doesn't seem possible with Sync Client.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Luca</p>

<p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>Since the new client should be improved in some limitations such as syncing shared documents you mentioned, it currently cannot replace OneDrive for Business 2016.</p>
<p>But it will be improved and you can see more detailed information by referring to
