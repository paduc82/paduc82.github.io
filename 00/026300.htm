<h2>            950XL &#34;Living Images&#34; doesn&#39;t work in the native Microsoft &#34;Photos&#34; app</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;950 XL that has never been able to utilise the "Living Images" function when viewing the photo's in the native Microsoft "Photos" app. My wife has the same phone and hers works all the time.</p>

            MIne stopped working too, so I did a search online and found this posting. You've actually solved my problem. My camera and photos weren't allowed to run in the background. I switched them both to be allowed to run, and the living images feature is working
 again. Maybe you should set yours to NOT allow both, then do a soft reset, then set the apps back to Allow, then see what happens.

<p>Try uninstalling Lumia Creative Studio app and restart. Mine started working. Also make sure Camera and Photos apps can run in background. After taking a photo, be patient and avoid immediately going to photos app to see the living image. It takes time in
 processing. Good luck 😊 . Be aware that there has to be enough movement in the image for it to be a living image.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It looks like you have 380 contacts synced to MyPhone, but when you logon to myphone.microsoft.com you only see one contact ?<br />
Did you check before you synced if all contact were there ?

    <title>Microsoft Office got cancelled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h.norman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office got cancelled</h2>
                    A few months ago my parents bought a new desktop computer. I needed to use Microsoft Word and we had not bought it yet, so I downloaded the free trial. A couple days later, my sister lent us her copy of Microsoft Office, which had up to three downloads
 on it. So we downloaded that, and about a month ago I got an e-mail saying that Microsoft Office had been cancelled. I thought this was the free trial coming to an end and didn't think much of it. A few days ago I went to use Word on the computer though, and
 it wasn't there. It was the whole Microsoft Office, downloaded and free trial, that had been cancelled.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone had this problem before? Are we able to download it again without using up the last download on the disk?</div>

    <title>Facebook won&#39;t load after new Windows 7 Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuppicide  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facebook won&#39;t load after new Windows 7 Install</h2>
                    <p>My computer was running Windows XP Pro with all the updates. I used Firefox 14 beta and Avast! Free Antivirus. All was well.<br />
<br />
I wanted to upgrade and bought Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit.<br />
<br />
I saved whatever files I wanted, formatted, and installed a fresh copy. Installed the latest updates, Firefox, and Avast. I then went about my business. I installed Flash, Adobe Reader, and Google Talk so I can make free phone calls.<br />
<br />
Facebook does not load 99% of the time. If I do manage to get Facebook to load then none of the games usually load (apps.facebook.com).<br />
<br />
I tried Internet Explorer, same problem. Instead of Firefox 14 beta, I went to the regular stable version which is Firefox 13. No luck.<br />
<br />
I had Adblock Plus installed in Firefox, so I took that off. No luck. Besides, I was using that before also.<br />
<br />
I know this is a new freshly installed machine, but whatever I checked my hosts file also. Clean.<br />
<br />
It's not a problem with my router I don't think because I have my Girlfriends computer right next to me and it runs Facebook just fine. I have DMZ (demilitarized zone) set on my IP.<br />
<br />
I tried disabling Windows Firewall. No luck.<br />
<br />
I installed Malware Bytes and ran a scan. Clean.<br />
<br />
I asked someone on Microsoft Answer Desk. He suggested to try rebooting in Safe Mode with Networking and try it there. No luck.<br />
<br />
I then tried uninstalling Avast. No luck.<br />
<br />
I also tried disabling IPV6. No luck.<br />
<br />
I think I installed Windows 7 on Monday, 7/2/12. I looked and there's no restore points.. only 7/4/12.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft guy said since it's a new install I should reinstall, and before I do anything, try Facebook to see if it works. No updates, nothing. Go right to Facebook.<br />
<br />
It's not that simple. I don't have any room on my external hard drive or money to purchase another. To install Windows 7 in the first place I had to copy like 300GB of data to my other machine via USB.. sloooooow. Took days. Then I had to copy it back once
 Win 7 was installed. Now I'll have to do that all over again. By data I mean mostly television shows and mp3's.<br />
<br />
So, before I go through that headache, I'm open to any more suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Linking individual spreadsheets to a master spreadsheet</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I want to create a program for a school club where if a student signs in for one of the club events, a master spreadsheet will take into account of that and it counts how many events a student went. Or is there a way to do this without having to create a program?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Yes it would be similar to this, but in that particular example, you are summing values from a person, while what I want to do is to tally every time a person types in their name for instance. I do appreciate the help.<br />

<h2>            Outlook Web App - Using an image next to text</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to get an email signature that has a logo on the left and text on the right. I can't see any way to wrap text. I've tried using the Outlook 2016 desktop app to create one too and copy/paste it but couldn't wrap text in that either! Tried doing
 it in Word too and copying and pasting it, but the image doesn't transfer (looks like a broken/unknown image link).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Reeyano</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve tried creating a signature with an image in the Signatures and Stationary window in Outlook 2016 and I wasn’t able to see an option to format the actual picture that will be included in the signature. However, I was able to make the image to be
 on left side and the text on the right corner. Check this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2a198de-1f22-46da-ab5c-9839ab61dd4d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2a198de-1f22-46da-ab5c-9839ab61dd4d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>Now, for me to make sure that I’ve reproduced your concern accordingly, I’d recommend that you provide a sample screenshot of what exactly you’re trying to achieve.
</span>See this: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
<strong>How to include a screenshot in your post?</strong></a><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In this way, I’ll be able to check other ways that can be done. Can you also confirm the Outlook version you’re using?
</span></span><span>See this: </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>What version of Outlook do I have?</span></strong></a></p>

<h2>            My outlook 2003 keeps prompting me for a network password for my yahoo email account</h2>
                    My password remains the same but outlook keeps prompting me to enter my password and will not accept it after a while.&nbsp; If I go to yahoo mail the password works fine there and outlook will usually reset and work ok for a short while (less than a day) and
 then the whole thing starts over again.&nbsp; What is the problem?

    <title>Permissions for Sharepoint Excel Spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permissions for Sharepoint Excel Spreadsheet</h2>
                    
<p>I recently shared a Sharepoint Excel document with coworkers. However, I want to limit certain people from editing the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted to go back into the Share section of the sheet to see who I had the shared the file with previously and it does not give you that option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I see who has been shared with in the past and alter their permissions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi ashleybrooks7248,</p>
<p>what do you mean about “ <b>i attempted to go back into the share section of the sheet to see who i had the shared the file with previously and it does not give you that option.</b>”? could you give us some screenshots related to the points what you mentioned?<br />
to upload a screenshot, click <b>use rich formatting</b> and then click <b>edit/insert media</b>.</p>
<p>generally, after you shared a file with another person, you can see who you have shared it with via
<b>…&gt;share&gt;shared with</b>. if you want to prevent the file from being edited, you can click
<b>change to view only </b>to achieve that.</p>

<p>hi cliff,</p>
<p>it looks like i do not have the stop sharing option you have above. when i click on share --&gt; shared with, it only brings up names but no permissions. if i click on someone's name, it just redirects me to a profile page.</p>
<p>if i click advanced, it says i do not have permission to access.</p>

<p>Hi AshleyBrooks7248,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm if the file you shared with other people is from a site collection another user shared with you. If yes, you shouldn’t edit his permission. You should contact the shared site administrator to edit the permission.</p>
<p>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<h2>            E61i - Remove Arabic&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi guys, I updated the software on my E61i tonight and everything seems fine EXCEPT that I now have Arabic characters instead of the conventional English characters I am expecting.<br />
<br />
I have tried changing both the Language and Phone General settings to English, and i can type i English however when i hit the Open/Close Bracket/'@' sign/ etc. I get Arabic characters!!<br />
<br />
I just want the phone to display the characters i am hitting on the keypad. I also notice the cursor has a little triangle on the top which it never had.<br />
<br />
There must be an easy fix? Please?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :(

<h2>            Windows 8 updated to windows 10 stuck at boot logo &#40;no loading circle&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had successfully upgraded windows 8 to windows 10, until i used malware bytes to clean my PC, and now i am stuck at the boot screen showing just windows logo, no loading circle, and hard drive led is like my power led showing that my HDD is at 100% usage,
 i have waited max for 1 hour but nothing happens. I have tried safe mode, startup repair but no luck.
</p>
<p>The major issue is that i have been using win 8 successfully for about 3 years and have important data. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
backing up data is not an issue as i have separate hard drives for my personal data, just need to fix this windows boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>What a ridiculous request. Deleting a site should have nothing to do with how it was&nbsp; created and should be as easy as creating one - click a link the site is gone. And the deleted site should disappear immediately
 from the lousy sharepoint.aspx page. Anything else is just crappy, amateurish design that needs to be fixed.</span></p>

</p><p>Normally. we do not need to delete account to start over. </p>
<p>
</p><p>While, we need more information about the situaiton. You queried about how to delete the site on this post, however it seems there is another question about the permission to delete folders. Can you confirm if the first question is solved? If it is a different
 issue, we would like to suggest posting it with some related screenshots on another thread so that we can handle it separately.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Below is the alphabetic sort result for Tamil in Microsoft products. But as per recommended sorting rule,&nbsp;ஃ should be next to&nbsp;ஔ. It was already implemented in google spreadsheet and Libre calc. Can you please let me know the procedure or forum when I can

<p>
</p><p>Adding contacts in Skype for Windows 10 works differently. To find people who are not in your contact list, type their email address, phone number&nbsp;or Skype Name into the search box and select
<strong>Search Skype</strong>. In the search results, select the person you're looking for and send them an&nbsp;instant message and a contact request will be automatically sent along with your message.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/00325806-252b-42a3-8eb6-ed0f4ebf7377" title="DanPumphrey1">

</p><p>Adding contacts in Skype for Windows 10 works differently. To find people who are not in your contact list, type their email address, phone number&nbsp;or Skype Name into the search box and select
<strong>Search Skype</strong>. In the search results, select the person you're looking for and send them an&nbsp;instant message and a contact request will be automatically sent along with your message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>You must be kidding me.&nbsp; Leave it to Microsoft to take a great product, "upgrade" it into something unusable, and alienate its customers.&nbsp; I find humorous the dismissive statement "<span>&nbsp;Skype for Windows 10 works differently</span>".&nbsp;
 &nbsp;It certainly does.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, there is conspicuous absence of instruction (help) regarding how one must add contacts in the Win 10 version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the previous versions which I have used for many years, I had been able to enter contacts freely and call anyone I had wished to call.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Win 10 version MS is limits my access to my contacts, requiring that my contacts be existing Skype users...or
 I must offer up their emails, etc. to create new Skype users.&nbsp; You also require that the users acquiesce to a particular procedure&nbsp; that is unduly burdensome and a user interface that requires more operations to make a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of the new version, I have found a link to the previous version of Skype and happily re-installed that version which is more consistent with the way USERS use their phones&nbsp; &nbsp;I will use that version until MS either renders it unusable or releases
 a new version that is as open and friendly as the older versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS long ago should have learned to respond to the needs of users and not to dictate what appears to work well for Microsoft.&nbsp; MS has scored a big ZERO with me.&nbsp; You seem to be on your way to ruining a great product and service and driving me away after so
 many years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert to the modality of the old version of Skype and make a lot of existing customers very happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FREE SKYPE!</p>

<p><span>However, I want to display one image when one criteria is met, and
 the other image for all other times. &nbsp;I have tried a few things but it doesn’t work for me. &nbsp;When testing, I am copying all text to the right of ‘IF’ and entering it in an If statement. &nbsp;If it matters, I am using Word on a Mac, though I do have access to a

            I'm having the same or worse problem. Just got the E71 at a major launch event at the Sheraton in Karachi, Pakistan on July 26. The power button doesn't press. And when you press the top right area of the phone (where it says E71) or even keep the phone
 hard on a table it goes through it's shutdown sequence. Looks like the power function has been moved from the actual button to the front of the phone. Can anyone help?

            To switch from General to Silent, just press and hold "#".<br />
<br />
Its a bit tougher to press the power button, but if you just only press it very shortly, the menu stays, and you can pick it from there too.

<p>I'm having the exact same problem -- I short-press the red button and I see the menu come up for a split second before the phone shuts down and restarts all on its own.&nbsp; I've had the phone for about 2 months and this just started happening.</p>

<p>@msrkwt -- did you ever find any resolution on this?</p>

            My phone just started having the same problem. I dont know, but it seams that the power button is jam. When u press it, it stuck and just keep closing on and off the phone. Any ways to fx that?

            Do you have handy profiles installed? If yes (in Handy Profiles) go to options-settings and change the way the power button works,
