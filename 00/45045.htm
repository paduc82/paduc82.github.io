            Should be included in Windows - however you will need Blu Ray software to PLAY a video.&nbsp; Personally I use Cyberlink PowerDVD (<a href="http://www.cyberlink.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cyberlink.com</a>) but you may have something different.

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot do a lot here. If you see any type of cheating or boosting please report these players. Click on there name and select report player. Then chose the option that best describes the situation. This also goes for any harassment or offensive
 language. It does get looked into. We apologize for any inconvenience and hope everyone has fun playing!</p>

<p>Just letting you know, I have played this game over 3 years and reported every single hacker in that game, nothing has still happened to them. The hackers are only inspiring other players to hack because that game cant be played anymore without cheaters
 coming in. I have even writed every single cheaters name on the list of my own and there is over hundred of them. I know that it's a huge problem for you to get rid of them, but I still hope you will do something about it as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>            Very Slow File Operations- Copying, Deleting</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span>Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I'm a retired telecom engineer whose retirement hobby is to photograph up-and-coming talent for their portfolios.<span>&nbsp;</span>I don't
 charge, but run it as a professional business.<span>&nbsp;</span>This computer problem has me nearly paralyzed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It certainly looks like "amateur hour" in front of these models and parents.<span>&nbsp;</span>In the sticky "Tips" for this forum section Edgar says about information to provide when asking a question "The more the merrier."<span>&nbsp;</span>I
 hope that's the true spirit around here, because here comes a lot!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Summary:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit in Classic mode.<span>&nbsp;</span>I've been seeing very slow file operations since making this
 PC my main computer earlier this week.<span>&nbsp;</span>My system specs are listed below my signature. In addition to a specific example of the problem below, here are some othe4r observations:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Slow file transfer when copying image files from a CF Card over Firewire 800 MB/s (1394b) (see specs).<span>&nbsp;</span>It takes 30
 sec to copy 150 files (730MB) to the D drive.<span>&nbsp;</span>In Safe Mode it takes 5 sec.
</span></p>
<p><span>- Copying about 60 MB of "Web size files (4KB, 35KB) to a USB "thumb" drive takes over half an hour.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>- Interestingly the transfer rate is "lightening fast" between this PC and a PC I use as a NAS over 75" of Cat 5c cable at up to 50 MB/s.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>- I achieve over 200 MB/s backing up Outlook PST files from my C: drive to my Data drive.</span></p>
<p><span>- File transfer to an external USB-connected drive pokes along at 1.9 MB/s.<span>&nbsp;</span>A 50MB transfer takes over a half an hour.</span></p>
<p><span>- Copying or moving files between one instance3 of Windows Explorer to another often results in Windows Explorer freezing or vanishing altogether.<span>&nbsp;</span>Even
 copying or moving within the same instance can result in Windows Explorer disappearing.</span></p>
<p><span>- I just replaced the external drive with a WD My Book 3.0 2TB on USB 3.0.<span>&nbsp;</span>The transfer speed is averaging 14-17MB/s
 in normal mode and 52MB/s in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps if we can nail down and correct the cause of one symptom it will fix the others.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>A Specific, Repeatable Example of the Problem:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>On my internal data drive (the Hitachi 2TB) when I copy 150 image files (about 730 mb) from one folder to another it takes approximately 27
 seconds.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I delete the 150 files from the destination folder it takes about 27 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Troubleshooting:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I followed steps outlined by Afzal TaherMicrosoft Support Moderator on Thursday, June 03, 2010 5:07 PM in this thread:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/f1d8d485-a9c8-4ec9-ae31-27c8c26164a5?prof=required</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Troubleshooting Steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. When I boot in Safe Mode the copy takes 4.7 seconds and the delete takes less than a second.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. When I boot after selecting Selective Startup in msconfig leaving Services normal and disabling all Startup items the original problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. In msconfig I disabled all non-Microsoft Services and all Startup items then reboot and the original problem persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Diagnostics / Virus Scans:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ran MalwareBytes</span></p>
<p><span>Ran Trend Micro Housecall</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p><span>Hijack This report available- I don't know how to attach it to this post.</span></p>
<p><span>The top part of a Belarc Advisor report is available- I don't know how to attach it to this post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Additional Information:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To the best of my knowledge all hardware drivers are up to date.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The 2TB hard drive is freshly defragmented and the recycle bin is empty</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The BIOS was updated at the time of build in May 2010.<span>&nbsp;</span>Since then two updates have been issued.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Should I update?<span>&nbsp;</span>(ASUS recommends not updating the BIOS routinely.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am running Microsoft Security Essentials.<span>&nbsp;</span>Windows Defender is turned off.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>My Request:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is much more than I can get my arms around.<span>&nbsp;</span>I would appreciate suggestions of any further tests or diagnostics I
 can run to isolate this aggravating problem and specific things to solve piecemeal.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You may want to try "Autoruns" which lists a number of programs/services that run at boot up, etc.</p>
<p>Since the copy/paste process is faster in safe mode, the party-pooper has to be some program or a background service (which clean boot wouldn't have detected) in normal mode.</p>
<p>Autoruns would take care of it.</p>

<p>Hello RIP, thanks for that.&nbsp; (I did not get an alert of your reply.)&nbsp; I've downloaded&nbsp;Autoruns and Process Explorer and will see what they tell me.&nbsp; In the meantime see if my observation of very fast file transfers using a file sync app make sense:</p>
<p><strong><span>More observations</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In my previous post I noted that transfer rates to a new WD My Book 3.0 2TB on USB 3.0.<span>&nbsp;</span>were averaging 14-17MB/s in normal
 mode and 52MB/s in safe mode.<span>&nbsp;</span>I use the file synchronizing application GoodSync by Siber Systems.<span>&nbsp;</span>Using GoodSync I am seeing transfer rates of over 200 MB/s when transferring large files (800GB Outlook PST files
 for example).<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible that GoodSync bypasses the shell?<span>&nbsp;</span>If that were true would that give us a clue where to look for my lethargic
 file system operation?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Suspecting that Goodsync bypasses the shell (and therefore whatever has normal file operations bogged down) I ran a test of copying files from
 the CF card to D:.<span>&nbsp; </span>The transfer rate was an astonishing 153 MB/s for 150 files of around 5 MB each.<span>&nbsp;</span>The elapsed time was less than a second!</span></p>

<p>Hey Dave,</p>
<p>It could be possible. Nothing can be ruled out.</p>
<p>Why not uninstall (if feasible) the sync software and confirm for re-occurence of the problem?</p>
<p>I use this freeware <a href="http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TeraCopy</a> to copy/paste files and it works just fine and great to me. You may want to check it out.</p>

<p>Hey RIP,</p>
<p>Been out of pocket- just getting back to this...</p>
<p>What I meant was with GoodSync I get blindingly fast transfers compared to the performance with Windows Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can uninstall it, but I've run the Clean Boot, Safe Mode, etc and it doesn't seem to be a culprit.&nbsp; I would be glad to do that- but first,
 recalling that I get expected transfer rates in Safe Mode but not in Clean Boot...</p>
<p>I ran Autoruns both in Clean Boot and in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I was not able to Export the autoruns scans but have the *.arn of each scan:</p>
<p><a href="http://techno-archive.com/autoruns/AutoRuns-CleanBoot100820-1.arn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techno-archive.com/autoruns/AutoRuns-CleanBoot100820-1.arn</a><br />

<p>The only differences I found were in the Task Scheduler section.&nbsp; I didn't know how to export the result, but&nbsp;I have a JPEG snapshot of it:</p>
<p><a href="http://techno-archive.com/autoruns/Autoruns%20Difference%20CleanBoot-SafeMode.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techno-archive.com/autoruns/Autoruns%20Difference%20CleanBoot-SafeMode.jpg</a></p>
<p>Can I safely disable everything in the Task Scheduler section of the Compare results?</p>
<p>BTW, I'm still not getting alerts.&nbsp; Are you getting them?&nbsp; I have "Alert me" checked and have it set up in my profile settings to&nbsp;"Always Alert Me By Default When I Post".</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I tried TeraCopy.&nbsp; I still got the sluggish file performance.&nbsp; GoodSync seems to let it run at it's natural speed.&nbsp; But GoodSync isn't a Windows Explorer replacement so I still need to fix the problem..</p>
<p>I can't deselect the item in Autoruns Task Scheduler "\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Media Sharing\UpdateLibrary".&nbsp; I get a message "Error changing item state: The interface is unknown."&nbsp; The status bar shows this as ""%ProgramFiles%\Windows Media Player\wmpnscfg.exe"".&nbsp;
 I renamed "wmpnscfg.exe" to "wmpnscfg.exe.old".&nbsp; OK, got all those Autoruns entries Going to reboot the system now.</p>
<p>NO CHANGE!&nbsp; In fact, the 150 file transfer from the CF card to D: ground to a halt.&nbsp; GoodSync copied the 150 files (730 MB) in not much over one second.&nbsp; What next?</p>

<p>I'm suffering from the same problem with a new Windows 7 machine. Very fast in safe mode, but in selective start it slows to about 10% of the safe mode performance, copying between SATA disks at 3MB/s and deleting files at 40 items per second. The same files
 are copied at 50MB/s or more, and deleted at perhaps 190-500 per second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone found a real cure for this. I am checking various services, but this is very much poke and hope...</p>

<p>Microsoft engineers don't care about these silly problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most are too busy making commercials to sell Windows 7; the rest are busy developing Windows 8, or whatever they call the next cash cow.&nbsp; Why would they listen to users when they know most home
 users&nbsp;use their products the way they come out of the box.&nbsp; Microsoft knows that some tech-head will figure it out and post a registry hack, then Microsoft will include that in one of their unpublished Windows Updates (hopefully).</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if they fixed the current version before the next version goes on sale???</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft, screw the hype and "YOU" become user friendly.</p>

<p>Oops-sorry about above 2 entries (got click-happy). &nbsp;Anyway, have you solved your file transfer issue yet? &nbsp;There haven't been any updates from you since Oct. so I'm pretty sure you've resolved it, but if you haven't &amp; you just happen to come across this
 thread again, I agree w/user 412B that it sounds like a security app.-related issue. &nbsp;If booting in "Safe Mode" doesn't replicate the degraded performance but other boot modes do, it &nbsp;may be because AV &amp; Firewalls aren't run in "Safe Mode." &nbsp;</p>
<p>So your anti-virus settings may be set to scan EVERY type of file &amp;/or "scan the entire file" when Reading/Writing/Executing; if you're transferring a large amount of data, this will take more time so that your AV can do its thing. &nbsp;You can re-configure
 it to Not scan image/*.jpg, however if you're transferring from/to a portable, as in:</p>
<p><span>"- I achieve over 200
 MB/s backing up Outlook PST files from my C: drive to my Data drive.</span></p>
<p><span>- File transfer to an
 external USB-connected drive pokes along at 1.9 MB/s.<span>&nbsp;</span>A
 50MB transfer takes over a half an hour."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>the above scenario makes perfect sense if it is the security app. since by default, they will always scan anything going to/coming from portable devices, but the Outlook files have
 probably "lived" on your HDD long enough for your AV program to have done its scan &amp; cached that info. in memory so it wouldn't need to repeat its scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope that that has either been completely unnecessary info. (cuz it's solved) or that it helps somewhat. &nbsp;Best of Luck!</span></p>

            <p>Good day all.</p>
<p>I know this is a very old post but I have also encountered the same problem this week so if any one else ends up here, I hope it helps.</p>
<p>I happened across the below post<br />

( toswegian's comments : which lead me to check my virtual memory settings. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 3 Gigs of memory, windows had chosen a 512 Megabytes paging file for my&nbsp;virtual memory.</p>
<p>I changed this to 4096 Megabytes ( overkill ) and unbelievably the copy speed has gone from
<br />
2.0 - 4.0 MB/Sec to 40 - 50 MB/Sec<br />
<br />
Copying 97 Gig was going to take 9 - 27 hours (&nbsp;kept changing&nbsp;) and is now taking about 30 - 40 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps someone else to.</p>

<h2>            Where does the Windows 8 bing app store the bing pictures of the day that you set as your lock screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When you use the bing app you can right click the screen and set the bing picture of the day as your lock screen. On the account settings I can see the ones that I have put as the lock screen before and switch between them, but where does it store them on
 the hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the&nbsp;Bing App works directly through the internet, the images are likely stored in a temporary location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the Bing App and found the images in the following folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\your name\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Bing_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\INetCache</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you&nbsp;expand the<strong> INetCache</strong> folder, you will see several sub-folders that have random alphanumeric names similar to the following.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>AO87Y66Y</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These sub-folder names&nbsp;will be different on your system</p>
<p><br />
Open each one of these folders and set the View to Large Icons to see the images.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can save these images to a different folder, if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, these are temporary files and they may disappear when you clear the browser cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Flight Simulator X Gold Edition Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you all could help me. &nbsp;I have Windows 10 64 bit as my OS. &nbsp;I am using a Intel 7 3.6 GHZ, 16 GB RAM, I installed Flight Simulator X Gold Edition on to my computer and then when I am using the program about 15-20 minutes into the game it
 gives me a message saying: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft Flight Simulator has stopped working. Windows is looking for a solution to the problem". &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This program worked just fine on my older computer with Windows Vista as the OS. Intel DuoCore 2.2 GHZ 8 GB RAM &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have updated my drivers for my computer. &nbsp;I also have uninstalled and reinstalled the flight simulator program. &nbsp;I have kept windows 10 updated. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I also have contacted Microsoft and since the program was working when they tried it they did not help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are there any other suggestions on what to do? &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>You must be tired of reinstalling FSX so many times - trust that you haven't had problems activating it, as some have.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Uiautomationcore.dll error message has been a frequent visitor for many FS users. &nbsp;Generally speaking, this error comes up when the user has used the menu bar or right clicked within
 the Sim many times (some say up to 20 times). Don't know whether this is relevant in your situation. &nbsp; Anyway, deleting and reinstalling that .dll in Windows\System32\ &nbsp;will do no good as FSX appears to have problems with that and that dll should not be deleted
 or changed in anyway. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What must be done is to download the version of&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">uiautomationcore.dll that will be suitable for FSX if it
 was running in XP or Vista (FSX is a 32 bit program operating on a 64 bit platform, as in your case). &nbsp; Now this fix has worked for some and not for others. &nbsp; Those that have tried another version of it have also reported mixed results. &nbsp; But for what its
 worth, I give you this link for downloading the 'popular' version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.search-dll.com/dll-files/download/uiautomationcore.dll.html &nbsp; (this version has digits ending with 16386. The other version ends with 18000). &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The site 'Search-dll' is safe and you just click on the download dll icon and save it to desktop. &nbsp; Then go to your main FSX folder (probably in Program Files (x86) unless you have placed it elsewhere) and paste the new
 elsewhere.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I won't suggest doing anything else at this stage and see how you go with this new dll in your FSX Folder. &nbsp; You may want to save your flight a few times (particularly as you approach
 the 15 minute mark). &nbsp; This is so that you can go back to the saved position and continue on with your flight instead of starting all over again, which can be very frustrating! &nbsp; I still do this even though I haven't had a system crash for a long while now:
 &nbsp;just an inbuilt fear of something going wrong! &nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">All the best.</span></p>

<h2>            Gamma Calibration issue</h2>
                    Hey, I'm trying to change my gamma settings for Rust. And I use the windows "Calibrate Display Color" feature<br />
and I change my gamma, but the moment it changes, it immediately resets back to default settings. My Graphics driver is AMD Radeon. And my computer is a HP Pavilion, with a HP 27xw IPS LED backlit monitor. I've used apps that use gamma calibration and it does
 the same thing where the moment its gamma is changed, the monitor instantly sets it back to normal/default. I need help

<p>It didn't do anything. It still instantly resets the gamma to default when I move the slider up to increase gamma or lower gamma, it just sets it to normal gamma even when I save it,</p>

            Hello, have you tried installing the correct drivers for your Acer C120 projector? You will need to install an appropriate driver for your hardware or your product may not work. Try checking if you have the drivers installed. If you already had the drivers installed, you may want to consider re-installing them. 
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions!

 Would you please teach me how to do it properly?&nbsp; Thank you so much!

<p>Yeah, as always I was hanging out on net and downloaded weird app.</p>
<p>After what I deleted it, but before I deleted it, it blocked my folders like</p>
<p>Start Menu, Documents, Application Data, Desktop and other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is when I try to open one of these files it says "Location Unavailable C:/Users/All Users/Documents &nbsp; Access Denied".</p>
<p>Btw my antivirus keeps deleting programs from those folders and blocks them from starting. So I cant access my</p>
<p>photos or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to open these folders? I saw some answers on how to open</p>
<p>"Access Denied" folders but It didnt work.<br />

<h2>            Programma Programmi Compatibilit&#65533; Applicazione Applicazioni</h2>
                    <p>To,21.10.2013<br />
Buongiorno.Tre problemi<br />
Ho aggiornato Windows 8 (putroppo!!)con la versione 8.1<br />
Non mi funziona una periferica "Scheda video di base Microsoft"<br />
Non riesco ad aggiornare il driver<br />
L'errore è:<br />
Windows non è in grado di caricare i driver necessari.<br />
Il dispositivo non funziona in modo corretto. (Codice 31)<br />
Il driver in fase di avvio non corrisponde al driver della scheda video<br />
di cui è stato eseguito il POST.</p>
<p>Non funziona Microsoft Silverligt in Mediaset play<br />
Ho provato con la compatibiltà programmi ma senza successo<br />
E' installlato ma non funziona,ho provato a disinstallarlo ,chiuso e riavviato il programma,<br />
ma continua a non funzionare<br />
Che fare?</p>
<p>Altro problema precedente all'aggiornamento.<br />
Quando sono su Internet explorer si aprono<br />
dei siti pubblicitari non richiesti di tutte le tipologie,molto <br />
fastidiosi e invadenti e forse pericolosi.<br />
Come fare per eliminare il problema?<br />
Nota-Ho AVG e Tune Up utilities vanno bene o sono da disinstallare?</p>
<p>grazie<br />
adriano suragna</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Two documents folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhaber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two documents folders</h2>
                    After a truly massive update this week (adding all sorts of junk), I see that I have two documents folders. They appear to have the same location (C:\[my name]\documents), but they are not identical, as one is empty and the other has my usual files and
 subfolders. The documents icon on my desktop still gets me to the correct one. But what gives?

            <p>Please see the location I give above. They are of course also visible one above the other in the left panel when I view my computer or documents, and they are both visible side by side in the main panel if I go insgtead to my user name. However, if I right
 click click on the two documents folder and select aproperties, I see two distinct identifiers after all: users/jhaber and users/jhaber/desktop.

            <p>Thanks for the details. &nbsp;This sounds like your Documents folder was inadvertently redirected to the desktop (perhaps by dragging it to the desktop, which performs the redirection automatically in the background).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I suggest:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the properties of the Documents folder inside your main user account, go to the Location tab at the top then click "Restore default" location and apply it. &nbsp;Choose yes when prompted.</p>

            <p>Thanks! I don't know what happened. (I don't recall dragging anything anywhere, and there was no copying action taking time.) But I right clicked on these and asked to restore to default location. Puzzlingly enough, it then took quite some time copying a
 huge number of items, for all my files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that now the left panel of various explorer windows now shows only one documents folder, and in clicking on it I see all my data. The bad news is that now clicking on the documents icon on my desktop now opens a window containing none of
 my files except for an empty folder that McAfee Anti-Virus automatically created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured that the next step might be to delete that icon (which is not overlaid with a shortcut arrow) and then find a way to add an icon for the full folder to the desktop. However, hitting the delete key ran up against a message saying I need permissions
 from DESKTOP-CLGCVN\jhaber. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think has happened? Thanks again, </p>

            Hard to say how it got there, but I've seen it before.&nbsp; The redirect is causing that situation.&nbsp; I would remove the desktop icon for your Documents.&nbsp; Then go to the "good" Documents folder, right-click it and choose "send to &gt; desktop" and use that one.

            <p>Your approach could be right. Just bear in mind that, as I say, I can't yet delete the icon from the desktop. I'm guessing that the McAfee "vault" folder is standing in the way of deletion. I'm going to try to reach their tech support people tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, bear in mind, too, that on a gut level it feels like a kluge. Whatever settings placed Documents, This PC, and Recycle Bin on the desktop (all desirable) are a part of Windows 10 and differ from the potential to drag folders or apps to the desktop.
 If nothing else, you don't see the shortcut arrow on them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for causes, hard not to think that the issue's sudden onset has something to do with the monster Windows 10 update this week, a good 90 minutes and several restarts. Perhaps it just didn't like whatever system configuration I have. But what a shame. I'll
 report back if I make any progress. </p>

            <p>Sorry, but this has been a very frustrating experience. After on the phone for more than an hour with McAfee and four different tech people, the best they could do was to ask that I have the original Windows 10 disks. Of course, this was doubly awful. First,
 I have no intent of reinstalling and spending days as I did this summer recreating my computer, and anyway it could just lead back to the update that got me into this. Second, of course I have no such disks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that the only solution is to get the desktop icon to direct to the right folder, and there has to be a way. But I've lost a lot of faith in Windows as able to do simple tasks. I had a fine system before the update this week ruined it. John</p>

            <p>Hey John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I could help if I could just see it, but it's difficult to do remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of situation can happen in Windows 2000 and higher, it's an artifact of the redirection of "user shell folders" like Documents, so that administrators can redirect them to another drive or network location so it doesn't matter where the user sits
 down that day (like at a school or shared workspace), their documents are still "inside" the Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, there's not supposed to be a front-facing way to place "non shortcut" Documents folder on your desktop.&nbsp; The desktop icon settings are
<em>supposed </em>to only allow these icons to be placed without shortcut arrows (but of course it's an object oriented system so you can force anything in the registry).</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer (aka "This PC")</li><li>User's Files (profile folder)</li><li>Network (previously Network Neighborhood)</li><li>Control Panel</li><li>Recycle Bin</li></ul>
<p>Those are the only icons presented to a user to be placed there, .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still I think the first place I'd say to check is this location in the registry:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the information about where the redirected locations should go.&nbsp; So when you open the "documents" folder, this registry setting determines what folder you really actually see.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfec4281-1597-46fb-a404-69598a34b487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfec4281-1597-46fb-a404-69598a34b487" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see in my case I redirected it to a folder called "Dcouments" inside my OneDrive folder.&nbsp; But I think this is what would help you quickest is to set the path here, then reboot</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thanks. I'll look into this further. First, though, I think I should start with making that McAfee vault folder vulnerable to deletion by uninstalling and reinstalling the anti-virus program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, such things as the stored addresses of certain document subfolders in my Firefox bookmarks and in my ftp program make clear that the previous address of Documents (with "\desktop" in it) has been around quite some time and was thus probably
 the default in installing Windows itself. Thus, we could sum up the issue this way: (1) this week's Windows update mistakenly created a second such folder at nominally the same address (although don't ask me how two distinct items can have the same address),
 empty except for the McAfee empty vaults folder. (2) Your suggestion of opening their location bars didn't exactly merge them or delete one. Rather it moved on to a new address without "\desktop"; moved all my files into that one; and left the mostly empty
 one visible on my desktop and, in the left panel of explorer windows, visible with an ordinary folder icon under Desktop. (3) I've added a desktop shortcut the ordinary way, with Send to, for the full folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's not anything strange that I did, and things just spiraled out of control. Nothing we've done has helped much or explained what happened. Windows has just gone crazy.&nbsp;

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with the same netbook (DELL Inspiron 11, 3162-3164).</p>
<p>32GB SSD is not enough space to download and install the Fall Creators Update (1709). I tried all the prossible ways. Fresh Windows installation, Disk cleanup and free space, delete previous version of Windows, create media tool, ISO, USB, DVD... plenty
 of time wasted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is that you only have two choices: </p>
<p>(1) stay with the previous version of Windows 10 (!) or </p>
<p>(2) go to a free OS for your PC (e.g. Linux Ubuntu)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft disappointed me for sure...</p>
<p>I going for the second option, although I paid for Windows 10 Home<span>®</span></p>

            Hi Jason
<br />
<br />What is the exact activation error on that PC - go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation . .. 
<br />
<br />In the meantime:
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Does that utility find the Windows 10 Product Key?

<p>I have a recording of a Webinar that I would like to post and I need the file size to be under 50 MB. The original file for a 48-minute video is 121 MB in mp4 format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've done and the results I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have split the video into 3 15 to 17 minutes parts</li><li>To each part, I have added one picture for 3 seconds, a title for 3 second and a still generic for 3 seconds.</li><li>When &nbsp;saved the project (best for the project), I got 3 files : 121 MB, 158 MB and 333 MG.</li><li>I then found HandBrake online and applied it to each video. I now have 3 files: 30 MB, 35 MB and 88 MB.</li></ul>
<p><br />
I tried going back to the original file and using handbrake on it. After adding my picture for 3 seconds and my generic for 3 seconds, the final file size was 618 MB!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It looks like Movie Maker is doubling the size of the file each time I save it as an MP4 file, even when I cut the movie instead of adding to it. Does anyone know what's going on?</p>
<p />

<p>Hello Sophie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you start experiencing this issue?</li><li>Which version of Movie Maker are you using?</li><li>Which Windows version is running on your computer?</li><li>What's the resolution/quality of pictures that you are trying to attach on your video? Is it a high definition pictures?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>
        </p>

<p>Do you know what actual codecs are being used in the original webinar? My guess is they are optimized for rather static content such as slides. But Movie Maker is using a general video codec designed for full motion video. The result is a larger file size
 for your content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Handbrake is apparently able to use a slightly more optimized codec to get the size smaller than Movie Maker, but even that can't get it back to the super compressed format of the webinar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you check with how the webinar is created and see if there are video editors designed to keep the highly compressed format but with minor additions for your content?<br />

<p>Hi considerate_guy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I start by saying I was really hoping you would reply as your answers to other questions in the forum seemed very helpful to the ones asking them. I even visited your website to try to email my question directly to you :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Zoom for broadcasting the webinar and pressed "record". I ended up with 4 files:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>audio only (mpa)</li><li>playback.m3u</li><li>the webinaire recording in mp4<br />
</li><li>and the chat record in txt</li></ul>
<p>The strangest part is that the exact same video, when saved in mp4 with Movie Maker, kept getting bigger and bigger. It went from 121 MB to 159MB, to 333 MB, to 618MB. As if Movie Maker kept "in memory" the previous content, but not adding it in the video.
 I'm not sure how to explain properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the information I have on Codec when opening the file in VLC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flux 0:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Type: Video</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10) (avc1)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Resolution : 1920 X 1080</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Débit (rate?) : 25</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Decoded format : PLanar 4:2:0 YUV</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flux 1:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Type: Audio</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Codec : MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Channels : Stereo</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Sample frequency? (Fréquence d'échantillonnage) : 32000 Hz</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Can you confirm if the webinar is mostly still images with someone narrating? How much action there going from frame to frame?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think it's just the nature of taking something that is optimized for very little change between frames and then running it through Movie Maker which is just expecting "normal" video with possibly lots of change from frame to frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4:2:0 YUV color space is also more compressed compared to what Movie Maker generates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure there is much you can do to keep the compression but just add your photo and clips as an intro. You might want to try Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 to see if it can do this or not.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I've&nbsp;a windows 7 64 bit system and the problem is that the search function doesn't work properly. I've already red a lot op topics without a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>First of all, when I open the window for "Indexing options", the button&nbsp;"change" is not available, the button "advanced" is. Is this normal, or have I a lack of&nbsp;rights? (I'm the only user&nbsp;&nbsp;and can&nbsp;change everyting, even the register, so I suppose I have
 enough rights)</p>
<p>When I click advanced, and choose "rebuild index", I get a pop up that it can take a long time, when I choose "OK" nothing happened</p>
<p>When I run the troubleshooter, windows determined that "Windows-search can not be executed",and shows the options to execute this reparation as an administrator. Once again, the troubleshooter restart and nothing others happens.</p>
<p>Can someone help me with this problem?</p>
<p>I have already made another users with admin rights, same problem</p>
<p>I 've also let check the system files, with "scannow" and everything was fine</p>

    <title>Windows 8 download error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gako84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 download error</h2>
                    I just recently purchased the Windows 8 digital pro upgrade. I downloaded the upgrade assistant and found the programs that aren't compatible but really don't care for them since I'll be doing a clean install. When I first started the download (after purchasing
 the key), it originally stated that the upgrade service could not be started. I fixed that issue by repairing my Windows update service. When I started the install again, while it says we're preparing your computer, the error I get says "Error" and that's
 it. I didn't even get to the download of the install itself. I could relly use some help in finding out what's wrong.

            <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation

<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>

<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

            Well I'm planning to do a clean install of the system since the OS I'm on right now (Vista 64) has a nasty virus that I can't get rid of. And since I dont have the install disc form Vista I have to do a clean install of 8. Would I be able to create a bootable
 media source like a USB from another computer and then use the media to do the clean install on the computer that needs it?<br />
