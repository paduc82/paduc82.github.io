<h2>            Don&#39;t add space between paragraphs of the same style is ignored inside Table cell</h2>
                    <p>Customized multi-level Outline Style employs the subject feature. The style is employed frequently in my document and&nbsp;works as expected when the list is in the regular body of the document, i.e., suppressing paragraph spacing between successive paragraphs
 using that style.</p>
<p>However, when the style is employed on lists within a Table the spacing between successive paragraphs is present rather than being suppressed as it should be.</p>
<p>The style allows for&nbsp;paragraph formatting of 6pt Before.</p>

            Unfortunately, that's just the way Word 2003 works. With the same style definitions, Word 2007 and later handle the spacing in tables the same as in regular text.<br />
<br />
If you're stuck with Word 2003, all you can do is apply direct formatting to the offending headings in the tables to set the Space Before to 0 pt.&nbsp; If the style was not a multi-level list you could define another style with the same appearance except for the
 Space Before, but that won't work here because it would interfere with the numbering.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft needs to clarify Windows 10 free updates for &#34;supported lifetime of the device.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I know it's been brought up before, but now that Microsoft is urging everyone with Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to "reserve" their free upgrade to Windows 10, I think they need to spell out exactly what "supported lifetime of the device" actually means.&nbsp; Some
 have&nbsp;said it could mean as long as a device has the ability to retrieve and install an update.&nbsp; Others have speculated Microsoft creating a set number of years&nbsp;particular to each&nbsp;type of device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop I'm testing Windows 10 Preview on is from 2010.&nbsp; It has a fully-licensed version of 8.1 Pro as the main OS, with 10 Preview on a separate partition.&nbsp; I "reserved" Windows 10 on the 8.1 side, and my&nbsp;plan is to&nbsp;wipe out&nbsp;the&nbsp;preview partition when
 the actual release is available after 7/29 and then perform the&nbsp;upgrade from 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say, though, that Microsoft decides the "supported lifetime" of a laptop is 10 years.&nbsp; That would mean this device would only be eligible for free support for another 5 years, until 2020.&nbsp; Windows 8.1, however, will be supported until 2023.&nbsp; If that
 turns out to be the case, it's a no-brainer to stick with 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may just cancel&nbsp;my "reservation" until Microsoft&nbsp;clearly lays out&nbsp;the Windows 10 support arrangement.</p>

            <p>I think you are worrying for nothing.&nbsp; W10 is being described as the last o/s.&nbsp; W10 will still evolve to introduce new things and still be W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a self full of laptops with XP and perhaps Vista and they just became outdated and too damn slow to be bothered with.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was better to buy a new one than try to insert some goodies under the hood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now&nbsp; have a bunch of 2012 era notebooks and they lap up W8.1 and W10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do expect that over the years W10 may make these little guys fall by the wayside.&nbsp; They will still be able to run some W10 but perhaps not all things offered by W10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like my old XP's, they still work but I feel guilty in even giving them to friends.&nbsp; They have had their day.&nbsp; I would think your 2010 PC's will be left behind&nbsp; only because W10 will be offering new features that will not be available to your PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your choice will be like my XP's.&nbsp; They still run but I have moved on and plan to move to W10 on Jul 29th.</p>

            <p>My main concern is security updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I keep&nbsp;my oldest laptop&nbsp;running 8.1,&nbsp;it will continue to get security updates for another 8 years.&nbsp; If I upgrade it to Windows 10, will that be the case as well?&nbsp; That's the big mystery at this time.&nbsp; Or, as you say,&nbsp;MS
 could update W10 to the point where this aging hardware would no longer be able to handle it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern may or may not&nbsp;be much to do about nothing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would just like Microsoft to&nbsp;disclose precisely what those who click the Reserve Now button are getting into without being vague on the details.</p>

            <p>Supported lifetime of the device is begging the question, and saying that it will be supported for the supported lifetime of the device is just circular. &nbsp;We will support it as long as we support it. &nbsp;The use of the term "device" alludes to hardware. &nbsp;Hardware
 may become obsolete, and no longer supported by Windows, at some future date, but it's not predetermined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 10 is a rolling release distribution, it will continue to be updated to what would have been called Windows 11, 12, 13, but instead it will always be Windows 10, being updated from time to time. &nbsp;The incremental updates won't typically be
 as dramatic as one might expect from a full shift from say Windows 7 to Windows 8, but it will be in bits and pieces instead of one giant change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think Microsoft can give a particular date to extend support to, because Windows 10 is not a static OS, so, as long as your computer is capable of running whatever Windows 10 becomes, it will be supported with security updates etc. &nbsp;Will there come
 a time when your computer will no longer be compatible with what Windows 10 becomes? &nbsp;Possibly - but we're not there yet, and I don't think that Microsoft knows in advance what hardware may at some point be deemed obsolete and unable to run what windows becomes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, there are processor requirements for running Windows 7. &nbsp;You can't run it on an 8088. &nbsp;Suppose you have a core i7 processor. &nbsp;In 20 years, it may be just as obsolete as the 8088 today. &nbsp;There's very little chance that anyone would be using a
 20 year old processor, so in reality few to no people would be harmed by discontinuing support for the i7 in 20 years, but Microsoft hasn't predetermined when a particular bit of hardware may become obsolete.</p>

If you have a helper column (in my example column J) and use the formula</p>
<p>Please note</p>
<p>In J1 there is a&nbsp;4</p>
<p>In J2 =IF(ISBLANK(D1),ROW(D1)+2,J1) that would give you the second row of each matrix this formula is then copied down</p>
<p>It would be easier of the first row would be blank and then the formula in J2 could be always used</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then make&nbsp;the following substitution in your formulas&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(D7=0,D6-INDIRECT("D"&amp;J7),D6-D7)</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p><span>However, what other sources for video can be used? I've seen some screenshots where you've had the option to add providers other than YouTube (e.g.
</span>http://www.howtogeek.com/tips/how-to-insert-a-youtube-video-into-a-powerpoint-presentation-in-office-2013/&nbsp; ) -
<span>however, all I have access to is YouTube &amp; embed. </span></p>
<span>however, all I have access to is YouTube &amp; embed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, what other sources provide embed codes that Powerpoint likes? It's not happy with vimeo (even with editing the embed code, so that it only has the iframe &amp; not the rest of the code); nor is it happy with Bob National (</span>http://bobnational.net/
 - useful source for UK educators). </p>
<p><span>It's Powerpoint 2013, the updates are controlled by the system admin, though Windows update doesn't appear to think it needs any updates to Office, and it's claiming to be up to day.
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks. </span></p>

            <p>Thank you :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't explain clearly enough - I got the embed code from Vimeo &amp; Powerpoint told me that it couldn't embed video from that source. Guess I waffled too much about the various things I'd tried to persuade it to!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tested the "embed" with a YouTube video, just to make sure that it worked (i.e. using embed, rather than the option to search for a video - embed's easier when you already know which video you want.&nbsp;</p>

            My copy of PowerPoint 2013 is not displaying the Embed option, so unfortunately, I can't test (it's a bug). I know Vimeo makes you sign in, which is one possible problem. Also, check that the video you want to link to is marked for public viewing.

            <p>I have the same problem in PowerPoint 2016. Even with the correct embed code from Vimeo there is an error message in PowerPoint saying it couldn't embed that code.
</p>
<p>In the PowerPoint Help function, it is actually stated that other embed codes than Youtube doesn't work in PowerPoint. Well, that's just great... I then went on to the official PowerPoint "suggestion box" and found that lots of other people find this troublesome.
 Teachers in particular are frustrated&nbsp;with this limitation in PowerPoint (I am one of them).</p>
<p>So, I don't know what's next. Wait and hope that Microsoft will be kind enough to enable embedding from a few more video sources than Youtube, I guess.</p>

<h2>            Sent items for shared mailbox in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    
<p>We have a couple of shared mailboxes where we need to save copies of sent items in the shared mailbox. I have configured the mailboxes with:</p>
<p>set-mailbox &lt;mailbox name&gt; -MessageCopyForSentAsEnabled $True<br />
set-mailbox &lt;mailbox name&gt; -MessageCopyForSendOnBehalfEnabled $True</p>
<p>Copies of sent mail are now saved in the folder Sent Items in the shared mailbox. But I'm unable to view the Sent Items folder on Outlook 2016 for Mac. In the Windows client the folder is visible, but in the Mac client only the folder Inbox are visible.
 I'm opening the folder from the Open Other Users Folder-menu in Outlook.</p>
<p>Are there any ways to show the Sent Items folder for a shared mailbox in the Mac client?&nbsp;</p>

                    <div>Hi</div>
<div>Sorry if this question's been asked before. Also this could be an outlook question or exchange online question.</div>
<div>I am using office 365 with exchange online. I have an azure SQL database in sharepoint with contacts in.</div>
<div>I would like to connect an exchange address book or contacts list to the database.</div>
<div>I'm pretty sure I can do it with sharepoint external list and sync to outlook, but I was wondering if exchange online or outlook 2013 would offer a way of connecting directly to an sql database.</div>
<div>It seems logical, as Excel and Word 2013 will both happily connect to such a database using external data SQL connections.</div>

            <p>No, Outlook can't directly connect to a SQL database as there needs to be a second layer to make sure that this is indeed an address list. For instance, a CRM application can do this and be this second layer for Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can use a SharePoint solution to pull information out of an Exchange Address List and sync that with a SharePoint List and bypass Outlook completely so that it all works server-side.</p>

            NRF is often (usually?) added after the package is printed, "after market", as a sticker or stamp. It could be applied to packages with either type of license.<br />
<br />
Look at the package and any accompanying materials that give an indication of how the package was originally distributed. Is there any indication that is was intended for distribution by manufacturers (OEM) only or if it was intended for retail (FPP)?&nbsp; That
 distinction will determine the license terms it operates under.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I can think of is to contact the phone activation center and ask them for the license terms associated with the product key. They are the only ones with positive knowledge.<br />

            I have just phoned local Microsoft and the lady who answered my phone said it was like a normal retail package.&nbsp; It would be licensed for two computers at one time and it is transferable from one computer to another.&nbsp; So long only two computers are installed
 and activated at one time.&nbsp; If I un-install from one computer I can install and activate it on the third computer and so on.

<h2>            9926 Start Menu</h2>
                    Why did 9926 trash my start menu? The way it looked in the previous version was way better, how do I get it back like that? Why can't I remove stuff like "sports" and "weather"? How do I make the "All Apps" look like it did in the release before 9926?
 The alphabetized list sucks.

<p>
</p><p>When the display zoom is set to anything but 100%, the "Display Settings" option is show (as above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem being when you open a document, then save it, whatever zoom level is selected saves with the document. We have a client using custom templates in Excel, and when someone saved the file, someone opening on another computer sees the same format changes.
 Looking for a way to disable this in Excel, so the format will maintain regardless of who opens the file or saves it (we want them to be able to edit numbers and names, but not the format of the spreadsheet - which is already locked, but the view settings
 affect column sizes)</p>

<p><span>Hi Patrick,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any custom views or specific display settings (such as hidden rows and columns, cell selections, filter settings, and window settings), print settings (such as page settings, margins, headers and footers, and sheet settings) used in an Excel file gets
 saved in the file itself. The Excel application will open the file and will base the view used on what is saved in the File. This means by default, any changes made to the Excel file that was saved will affect how other users see the file upon opening it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We encourage you to submit your issue on the Excel <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 it and address it. Feedback items regularly receive Microsoft responses on the Excel UserVoice Website.</span></p>

<p>Thank you Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this doesn't really answer my question though, I understand the file and view settings being saved with the file - what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not the "Display Settings" feature in Excel can be disabled, so it doesn't alter the appearance
 of the workbook without user intervention. So far the only thing I can think of is to downgrade the client to an earlier version of Excel that doesn't have this particular feature.</p>

            Open Task Manager, End the process of the possibly fake trojan. Go to settings, make it so your computer does not open tabs when awoken, reset your computer.

<h2>            Problems checking in from Word and Powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    
<p>I'm able to check out a document (Word or Powerpoint) from a Sharepoint document library and work on it in the relevant desktop application. &nbsp;When I try and check it back in from the relevant app I get the message</p>
<p>"we can't do that for you because the file is no longer checked out or has been deleted". &nbsp;</p>
<p>The document is still checked out and hasn't been deleted. &nbsp;I'm then forced to save the document to the desktop and upload it to the site replacing the existing version that is there and checked out. &nbsp;It then checks in ok from the Sharepoint site.</p>
<p>It does this whether using Chrome or IE11 as the browser and has done it for a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>Any solutions out there ;-)</p>

2. If you checked out an Excel document, what’s the outcome? Does the issue occur only in Word or PowerPoint file?<br />
3. Does the issue is limited to one specific file? Could you open other files to do a test?<br />
4. If you create a new library, upload the file onto it, check the file out and then check in, what’s the result?<br />
5. Could you do a test in another existing libraries in the affected site collection or another site collection?<br />
6. Do other people in your organization encounter the issue?</p>
<p>Based on my experience, I suggest you do the following first.<br />
1. Sign out of your account from the Office 365 portal.<br />
2. Exit all Office applications.<br />
3. Go to&nbsp;<b>Control Panel</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>User Accounts</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Credential Manager</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Windows Credentials</b>.<br />
4. Remove all credentials there(This will remove your stored passwords.).<br />
5. Run regedit as an administrator to open Registry Editor.<br />
6. From Registry Editor, browse to:<b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity\Identities</b>.<br />
7. Check to see if there are any folders listed under&nbsp;<b>Identities</b>. If yes, delete them.<br />
8. Clear IE caches via <b>Tools&gt;Safety&gt;Deleting browser history</b> ,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset IE</a> and check if cookies is enabled in IE via
<b>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Privacy </b>and<b> set settings to Accept All Cookies.<br />
</b>9. Restart the computer and do a test to check the outcome.</p>

<p>Cliff,</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. &nbsp;I have carried out the steps suggested and it has solved some issues but left me with the following challenge with PowerPoint documents:</p>
<p>From any site (and any user):</p>
<p>1. Click on a powerpoint document - it previews in Powerpoint online</p>
<p>2. Select 'open in Powerpoint' from the top menu</p>
<p>3. Powerpoint 2016 (16.0.6769.2017) opens with Check out button in the top menu</p>
<p>4. Select Check Out button and it goes away</p>
<p>5. The files are opened in 'Read Only' mode - yet the file shows as checked out in Sharepoint</p>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<p>1. Check out Powerpoint document in Sharepoint</p>
<p>2. Click on file name - it previews in PowerPoint online</p>
<p>3. Select 'open in Powerpoint' from the top menu</p>
<p>4. Powerpoint 2016 (16.0.6769.2017) opens</p>
<p>5. The file opens ok and it's possible to check it in etc..</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Some screenshots related to the symptom of the issue. - see description above</p>
<p>2. If you checked out an Excel document, what’s the outcome? Does the issue occur only in Word or PowerPoint file? - now seems to be just Powerpoint, Word seems to work ok</p>
<p>3. Does the issue is limited to one specific file? Could you open other files to do a test? - no, I uploaded a new powerpoint file created from new, and the same thing happens</p>
<p>4. If you create a new library, upload the file onto it, check the file out and then check in, what’s the result? - Same thing</p>
<p>5. Could you do a test in another existing libraries in the affected site collection or another site collection? - seems to happen in all libraries tried</p>
<p>6. Do other people in your organization encounter the issue? yes, affects another account tested on the same machine</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Adrian</p>

<p>hi adrian,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>it seems that the error message” we can't do that for you because the file is no longer checked out or has been deleted” has disappeared.</p>
<p>now for the second behavior you mentioned in this post, i try to reproduce the issue and find the point below. please confirm if your scenario is the same as the following said.</p>
<p>if a user has do some settings in library settings, the issue may occur.</p>
<p>here are the steps to reproduce the issue.<br />
1. navigate to the site collection where the files are stored.<br />
2. click the library tab and click library settings.<br />
3. click versioning settings.<br />
4. scroll down and check the yes checkbox in the <strong>require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2babafb2-747c-4618-83be-1686c3046bae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2babafb2-747c-4618-83be-1686c3046bae" /></a></p>

<p>after doing that, the user will encounter the issue you described.</p>
<p>if your scenario is this, i suggest you check the no checkbox in the
<strong>require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong> option.</p>
<p>please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>Thanks for this Cliff, all of our libraries force check out before editing. I have tried changing it on one library and it stops the error, however, it does allow users to edit documents before checking out which potentially causes other problems. &nbsp;Equally,
 it is a major burden to go through every library changing the settings.</p>
<p>What has been changed to cause this. &nbsp;It's been working fine for many years. &nbsp;Is there a fix coming?</p>

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>It seems that the issue can be resolved if you check the <strong>
Yes</strong> checkbox in the <strong>Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong>&nbsp;option.&nbsp; Generally,
<strong>Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong> is set to
<strong>No</strong> by default in a site library if someone doesn’t change it. Now I’d like you to do the test and tell us the outcome from your side.<br />
1. If you create a new library in the affected site where the existing libraries’ settings have been changed to
<strong>Yes</strong> in the <strong>Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong>&nbsp;option, is the setting in the new library changed to
<strong>Yes</strong> in the <strong>Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong>&nbsp;option automatically?<br />
2. If you create a new site collection and a new library, is <strong>Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong> is set to
<strong>No</strong>?</p>
<p>If the two tests’ outcome is that<strong> Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?</strong> is set to
<strong>No</strong>, may be someone change the settings to <strong>Yes</strong> manually. You may need to go to every affected libraries to change the settings.</p>
<p>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</p>

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>For clarifying, could you mind uploading some screenshots related to the symptom of the issue you encountered?<br />
To upload a screenshot, click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click
<strong>Edit/Insert Media</strong>.</p>
<p>To make sure if it is a client issue since it only happens to PowerPoint, could you confirm and try the following?<br />
1. If you have installed Office 2016 on another computer, could you enter the affected sites on the computer to do a test?<br />
2. Have you updated Office 2016 to the latest version?<br />
3. Which version of Office 2016 you installed, click-to-run or Windows Installer?<br />

<p>#4 caused the installer to crash after uninstalling so I've just had to reinstall Office. It still continues to exhibit the same problem. &nbsp;Office 2016 has been generally the most buggy version for a while, hence, why I continue to run a Mac with Office 2011
 for Mac.</p>

<p>Hi Adrian,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your confirmation.<br />
<br />
Considering it work fine on your Mac with Office 2011 for Mac , it indicates that the issue is related to the Office 2016 on your computer.<br />
<br />
Since the issue only occur when you open in PowerPoint and check it out from Office 2016 PowerPoint client while no issue happen when you check the document out from SharePoint Online, it indicates that the issue is related to the connection between PowerPoint
 2016 client and SharePoint Online.<br />
<br />

<h3> jakorpel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dissapointed for Nokia Music services</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have to admit that I'm more than dissapointed for the Nokia Music service. I have E90, thus not being the Nokia Music device, I really hope Nokia advertised Music models don't have these kind of problems I have met. And I think problem are not technical but
 rather the logic how implementation has been done. Here are m y concerns<br />
1) I wonder why Nokia Music application and E90 has nothing to do with each other i.e. I cannot load music from Nokia Music to my E90?<br />
<br />
2) Instead I have to use PC suite but that doesn't work as the music I have downloaded is protected!<br />
<br />
3) Prize for download is huge compared to any other music download service in internet.<br />
<br />

            Sorry to hear of your disappointment.<br />
<br />
The Nokia E90 unfortunately does not support playback of DRM protected music. You can play normal mp3s ripped from your own CDs, but not protected songs like those from the music store.<br />
<br />
For a list of devices compatible with the Nokia Music store, go to:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/music</a><br />
<br />
For compatible devices, PC Suite does NOT transfer DRM protected tracks. You need to download NOKIA MUSIC for PC for a mobile optimized transfer:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://music.nokia.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://music.nokia.com/download</a><br />
<br />
The USB connection for transferring songs must be "MEDIA" (like "Media Player" / "Media Transfer" / or "Printing and Media" ) PC Suite or Data Transfer will not work<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean about the price of music being high. Tracks are 1euro in most of Europe and I think 80 pence in the UK. 1 cent higher than iTunes. The price of an over the air download via wifi is the same as PC, which is unlike most operator music stores
 which often charge premium prices for mobile downloads.<br />
<br />
For Comes With Music, the price is almost unbelievably low. For less than the cost of about 1 normal cd a month, you get UNLIMITED music downloads for a year...to KEEP, not just for the length of your subscription but forever...AND you get a mobile phone, camera,
 videocamera, webbrowser, gaming machine, calculater, music player, etc.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 clean install</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7. I had Office 2007 which I upgraded to Office 2010 Professional Plus Beta. I now have Office 2010 Professional Plus&nbsp;RTM and want to do a clean install.</p>
<p>I uninstalled Office 2010 Beta and rebooted and then installed 2010 RTM. In order to ensure that it did NOT bring over any old settings, I renamed the ...\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook folder. When I start Outlook it reports that it can't find the Outlook.pst
 file in that folder and shuts down.</p>
<p>If I try "outlook.exe /cleanprofile" or "outlook.exe /firstrun" I get "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. The command line argument is not valid. Verify the switch you are using."</p>
<p>PS the drop box at the foot of this page doesn't have Office 2010 RTM as an option!</p>

    <title>Disable auto updates on Office 365 for Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirausagi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable auto updates on Office 365 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I am planning a roll out of Office 365 to about 35 Mac computers (and 400+ Windows machines) and need some information about managing updates on Mac computers for Office 365. Although I see lots of information for managing Windows O365 using office
 click to run xml&nbsp;files, I can find almost nothing that allows me to configure or manage updating on a Mac. Does anyone know how I can turn off auto updates for O365? If I can get that much then I should be able to deploy new versions of O365 manually through
 our remote deployment system. Thanks.
