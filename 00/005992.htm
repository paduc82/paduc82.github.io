<p>Hi Hayden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bootup issue you're experiencing with your Alienware PC might be due to a corrupted startup file. That being said, we'll need more information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>What do you see on the screen when you power on your PC? Do you see the Alienware splash screen at boot up?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to boot to the desktop, we recommend performing a custom installation of Windows 10 using an installation media. You can create an installation media using the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Download Windows 10">Media Creation Tool</a></strong> from another PC. After creating a Windows 10 installation media, kindly follow the steps

<p>If you are on 1 of the last 2 Insider builds you</p>
<p>could be experiencing the boot issue some of us have.</p>
<p>Do you have an USB with any Windows build on it?</p>
<p>If you do, boot from the USB and then continue</p>
<p>to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Once on Win 10, go to Control Panel, Power Options,</p>
<p>Choose what the power buttons do, then Change</p>
<p>Settings that are unavailable.</p>
<p>Then turn off Fast Startup.</p>

<p>No I don't have any usb sticks with a build of windows 10 I don't even have use sticks bc I don't have money for a decent usb stick and also how would booting from a usb work to fix that do I need to switch to boot device in bios to use the usb stick? Also
 I never seen a option for fast startup in windows 10 and does the usb stick help get into the os on the hard drive to change options?</p>

<p>You only need an 8GB USB to put the build on.</p>
<p>Yes, you need to change the boot in BIOS to</p>
<p>boot from the USB.</p>
<p>Yes, the USB would help you get into Windows 10.</p>
<p>Fast Startup is under Power Options, Choose</p>
<p>what the power buttons do and then Change the</p>

<p>Fast Startup is there where Sleep and Hibernate are.</p>

<p>An 8GB stick should be inexpensive. You can use the media creation tool to create a bootable USB, or download an ISO file and use a utility, such as Rufus, to make a bootable USB from it.&nbsp;<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Insider ISO is here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On Alienware, just tap F12 at boot to get a boot menu (I have Alienware too). If a bootable USB stick has been inserted, it will show as a boot option.</p>

<p>Hi SREDAdmin,</p>
<p>The relationship threshold of list lookups has been increased from 8 to 12 after Office 365 was upgraded to the current version due to the some concerns from the SharePoint Online users.</p>
<p>However, since these configurations of SharePoint cannot be changed from the front side, it is not feasible to increase the threshold of the list view lookup. To best influence our products, you may consider&nbsp;submiting&nbsp;feedback to Office 365 uservoice forum
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>I understand that you have already 14 columns. To further&nbsp;analyze this situation,&nbsp;you can provide a screenshot about the
<strong>columns</strong> part in the&nbsp;<strong>library settings </strong>(You can still click the&nbsp;<strong>LIBRARY&nbsp;</strong>to access
<strong>Library Settings</strong> page)&nbsp;to us. Please click <b>Use rich formatting</b> under the replying box and then click the icon of
<b>Insert Media</b> to upload the screenshot.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>April</p>

<p>Hi SREDAdmin,</p>
<p>To stop this error, we can click the <strong>LIBRARY</strong> to access <strong>

<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>

                    <p>I've rented movies on my xbox one for a while, but lately it doesn't seem to be working. It takes my payment, then when I hit the play button I hear the chime but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened last week or so, twice, and both times xbox support refunded me for the rentals not working (The first time we did all this trouble shooting like restarting the console, logging out and back in, etc, nothing worked). Tried again tonight to
 see if it's working again yet but the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time support basically said too bad, they can't refund me for the rental. It's only a $6 movie rental but seriously? Too bad and "I hope you understand"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to make the movie play I'm all ears, or if anyone can help me get this small refund that would be great too. Kind of pissed that microsoft is this stingy over something that wont work.</p>

                    <p>I'm using a 10130 DVD to clean install Windows 10 Preview on a PC that is originally a Win 7 Home. Windows Update takes me to a Windows 10 Home version, but the ISO is promoting me to a Windows 10 Pro version. Do I have a say while installing from DVD, can

    <title>Outlook 365 Account Setup - &#34;You&#39;ll need the internet for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 365 Account Setup - &#34;You&#39;ll need the internet for this&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up an Office 365 account in my Outlook 2016. I have already set up a different 365 account which works fine, and also all my other accounts are working fine. I am having no troubles with my internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whenever I try to set up the new account, I run into an error message that Outlook couldn't connect to the required service (see screenshot below). I've tried the set up in multiple ways, including with anti virus/firewall turned off, in different WiFi
 networks, and on a different profile, but the problem always returns. As I said, my internet connection is working perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also talked to the IT support at my institution today about this and they were unable to find a solution. If anyone has any thoughts on how to fix this you'd save my day (/week/month).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Internet Explorer displays pop-ups that appear as a result of you clicking a link or button. Pop-up Blocker blocks pop-ups that are
 displayed automatically (without you clicking a link or button). If you want to allow a specific website to display automatic pop-ups, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>To allow automatic pop-ups from a specific website</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button. In the search box, type <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
</span><strong><span>Tools</span></strong><span> button, point to
</span><strong><span>Pop-up Blocker</span></strong><span>, and then click
</span><strong><span>Pop-up Blocker Settings</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
</span><strong><span>Address of website to allow</span></strong><span> box, type the address (or URL) of the
 website you want to see pop-ups from, and then click </span><strong><span>Add</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step 3 for every website you want to allow pop-ups from. When you are finished adding websites, click
</span><strong><span>Close</span></strong><span>.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you want to move calendar and contacts to an online calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may setup an Live account on Outlook by installing Outlook Connector from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the email account is setup, you may copy the Contacts and Calendar items from the original PST file to the Live account Contacts and Calendar folders respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this suggestion was helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Koen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With error code 0x8018830f, it means that update was downloaded but couldn't be opened.
<span><span>We would suggest that you back up the apps, messages, files and reset the phone. Afterwards try again to install the update.</span></span>
</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Follow these steps below and check if it helps:</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>On Start, swipe over to the all apps list, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>
Reset your phone</strong>. </span></span></li><li><span><span>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, select
<strong>Yes</strong>, and then select <strong>yes</strong> again. It might take a little while for the process to complete.
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>Note: To back up your stuff, view this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I solved the update problem by removing some apps in order to create some place on the device. After that I re-installed the removed apps. Hope this solution works for other owners of a Lumia 735. Succes!

</p><p>I am sorry to hear that and I highly understand that you want to sign back in to Skype, but first. Please provide the following information so we can isolate the case. The information you will provide will help us identify the root cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the Skype version that is currently installed on your Windows 10?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried to sign in to the Skype homepage and check if it will work?</p>
<p>3. Have you tried to sign in, using other device?</p>

            These seem to be mostly an issue with windows settings, can you verify the same by disabling UAC.<br />
Try that and then try to update.<br />
Also in the error log, look for any particular registry key mentioned.<br />

    <title>Signature in OWA for iPhone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anne fischer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signature in OWA for iPhone</h2>
                    <p>In OWA for iPhone, I go to the Email signature page, make sure the box is clicked for "Include a signature," choose "Use a different signature," and put my info in that box.&nbsp; The first time I send an e-mail, it's fine and the signature is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can close the OWA app once, and come back in and it's still there.&nbsp; However, after I close the app a couple of times then come back in and try to send a message, my signature ALWAYS reverts to "Sent from OWA for iPhone."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just a bug in the app?&nbsp; Is there any workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried making the choice to "Use my signature from Outlook on the web."&nbsp; It works the first time or two and then the OWA app reverts back to "Use a different signature" and has "Sent using OWA for iPhone" again.&nbsp; This is EXTREMELY frustrating!</p>

<p>Hello James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per my knowledge, it is not feasible to add this signature to the transport rule. You can browser that html link and then copy-paste the entire content to the Outlook signature editor to use it.
 Note: It is suggested you press Ctrl + A, then press Ctrl + C to copy. In Outlook signature editor, please press Ctrl + V to paste it and keep source format.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can feel free to submit a feedback to our related team about this idea via the link below:</p>
