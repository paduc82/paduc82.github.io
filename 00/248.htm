    <title>Can&#39;t reinstall Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> retired geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t reinstall Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been running Win 10 under Parallels for a long time. When the final version was installed I started having problems with office applications wanting to use the Preview version rather than the Final version. I was also unable to set Excel files to use
 the Windows program rather than the Mac program from the Mac file manager. I've tried coherence and full screen, but I always had to go into Windows to set the preferences to use the Windows version. Word didn't seem to have that problem, but it wanted to
 use the preview version. Finally, after upgrading to El Capitan, I decided to remove Parallels and Windows and start over. Bad move. Once I removed Windows, I can no longer install it without having a product key. The preview key has been disabled, so I'm
 basically SOL. To me, it is like a slap in the face. I put up with all the issues during the preview, many of which I reported, and now I'm told it was all for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in this business for over 45 years. I've had many frustrations along the way, but I was generally able to create a work-around to fix the issue. This time I'm stumped. I realize my 74 year-old brain isn't as flexible as it used to be, but there
 has got to be a way to get me back in business. From reading the forum, I'm not the only person who has run into this, but none of the suggestions given seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get my Windows 10 back?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smittychat pinged the Mac moderators, so here I am!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parallels does not come with a license to use WIndows 10. It does offer to install Windows 10 when you install Parallels, but it is up to you to purchase the license for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased Parallels while Windows 10 was a free public beta you were able to use Windows 10 until the final version was released to the market. Once the Windows 10 preview period expired users received notices that they have to purchase Windows 10
 if they want to keep using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As has already been pointed out, if you had a working install of Windows 7 or 8 you could upgrade it to Windows 10 for free. You said your copy of Windows 7 is an upgrade. Maybe you have a copy of Windows XP full version that you could install, upgrade to
 7 and then upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line you will have to have a valid copy of windows 7 or 8 in order to get the free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

            No, you can't, sorry. It is hardware and software relateed issue. Phone HW is very restricted to OS.

    <title>&#34;Attach as Copy&#34; should be the default and sending a link to a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan ricciardi  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Attach as Copy&#34; should be the default and sending a link to a web location should be an option</h2>
                    Whenever we send an item via Outlook as an attachment that is originally housed on OneDrive or in Sharepoint it attempts to send a link to the item in the email rather than send a copy of the document or item to the recipient unless you click the down
 arrow and change it to "Attach as Copy" if there is any way possible to make that the default option (rather than a two step process that can easily be forgotten) and allow users to select an option if they'd prefer to attach a link to the item I need that
 to be made clear. Right now our company supports 185 different offices with 1458 client computers, all of which we would LIKE to upgrade to Office 2016 and Windows 10 but we aren't, because of little options like this... it's very frustrating.

            Same thing it is happening to me and I am looking for an answer. My One Drive is up to date and yesterday I was sending files to my customers as attachments saved on ONe Drive. Today I encountered the situation in which attached files are basically links.
 The worst is if I turned off my internet, I get an error like is offline and instructing to check my connection. That is wrong. Should be able to attach offline files as before. I tried the save copy and works ok, but if I am without internet, then I need
 to select "send to email' and it works fine...but what about sending multiple files? then I will have separate emails. Come on guys! fix this issue.

            <p>One of the best features of Outlook <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>was
</strong></span>the easy way to attach a file to an e-mail from a drop down list of recent items, right form the e-mail, without having ot search all over for it. This feature has been ruined in Outlook 2016, which forces you to attach a link of the file instead
 of an actual copy of it. This is frustrating. Really.</p>
<p>In search for an answer or a solution I've been told that this is a better way since you share one same document to your recipients. The problem with this is that they can make changes, and
 in security/privacy than an advantage in collaboration.</p>
<p>In any case, at the least, give the user the option to send a link or a copy from the "Attach a file" dropdown menu of recent items; whatever one feels is best for him/her to share the file.</p>
<p>Of course there are some workarounds (like adding a "Attach a file" button to the ribbon; or selecting to convert the link to a copy of the file once you attached the link, from the right dropdown menu of the attached link; or selecting the file from the
 "Browse this PC" option at the bottom of the "Attach a file" menu), but they only make the path to attaching a file much longer, when it was so simple before. Something that took only two clicks, now takes -in the best of cases- four clicks. Imagine how cumbersome
 it becomes when you have more than one file to attach!</p>
<p>In one "Microsoft Answers" post, it was tols that the "attach link by default" was "rolled back" and that Outlook should return to offer copies -<strong>and</strong> links- of files once you restart Outlook; but this didn't happen in my case. I occasionaly
 get to select a copy of the file , but most of the time it only offers the links.</p>
<p>Conclusion: this big step backwards in Outlook 2016 must be fixed as soon as posible.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a new calendar has appeared ... just now. Very weird! Now, depending on the email address I use, the appointments are shown in the according calendar (see image attached). It was never this way. The appointments sent via the email addresses
 were always shown in one calendar (the main calendar). How can I switch it back? I would like to have all my appointments shown in the main calendar (the one on the left side in the image attached) independently which email addresses I use.&nbsp;</p>

            That was my suspicion. Are they in different data files? The red calendar is the correct one?  It looks like you set am IMAP data file as default data file, which created the 'this computer only' folder (green). We don't recommend using those folders. 
<br />
<br />If the red one is correct and in a pst data file, switch the view on the green calendar to a list view and move the events to the red calendar.  Go to File, Account Settings - open the data file tab and set the file where the desired calendar is as default data file. Select the imap data file, click open file location (it's on the right side of the dialog's button bar). Close outlook, go to file explorer and rename the imap data file. Restart outlook.  
<br />(I also have steps at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/2013/imap-accounts-outlook-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/2013/imap-acc...</a> along with screenshots.)

            Unfortunately, it does not work. I cannot delete the green calendar. There is still the correct data file set as default. And I am not aware of setting up an new IMAP data file. This green calendar just has appeared. :-(

 deleting the entry does accomplish what I need, nor does changing the indent.&nbsp; I know this has to fairly simple.&nbsp; Thanks for considering my question.</p>

            So what do you think is the actual pricing policy Microsoft applies in the South African market? It never was set at the same price as the US price and SA inflation is 5%. Using yesterdays exchange rate as you have done is disingenuous.

            <p>Disingenuous, not really, I guess that MS would discount pricing structures for any jurisdiction they see as an 'emerging market'</p>
<p>NZ $10.25</p>
<p>Au $8.62</p>

            <p>I would agree that it might be appropriate for MS to use discount prices for emerging markets, in which case the price of R114.99 in SA is relatively high against the usual 'emerging market' countries. Aus and NZ are good benchmarks for other developed markets.</p>

an article</a> for your reference. Tips: Just select the <b>Contacts</b> folder.</p>
<p>Please note that the PST file is used for Outlook client importing, and we are unable open it. If you share it with others, they can

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue occur in all the browsers? </li><li>Have you tried in another Network environment? </li><li>Do other users in your organization encounter the same issue? </li></ol>
<p>In addition, I uploaded the Office 2016 for Mac installer.pkg to my workspace and sent you a private message. Please access it via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>From your description, the network environment is the cause of the issue. You can try the following steps and check the result:<br />
1. Temporarily turn off proxy settings, antivirus and firewall. You can refer to point 4,5&amp;6 in the following article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-code-30174-4-30125-4-30038-4-or-30125-1011-when-installing-Office-7bfabec6-76be-4cde-880e-819a9c569612?ui=en-US&amp;amp;rs=en-US&amp;amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-code-30174-4-30125-4-30038-4-or-30125-1011-when-installing-Office-7bfabec6-76be-4cde-880e-819a9c569612?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a><br />
2. Change the DNS server to public DNS Servers, such as Google DNS (8.8.8.8).</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we recommend you post a thread in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=Unable+to+download+office+2016+installer&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;x=12&amp;y=10&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=networking&amp;ContentTypeScope=#/Windows/networking//1">
Windows forum</a> for further troubleshooting. It is a specific support channel for handling related queries.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Problem with Office Installation &#58; Access Denied to Installation Source</h2>
                    <p>Hello and a good day to whoever is reading this! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing a problem with the installation of Office 365 on my computer (using my organisation's account) and I keep running into the same error, which I have posted below :
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6646aebc-8e62-436b-b812-a35c2e0b1985?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6646aebc-8e62-436b-b812-a35c2e0b1985?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;I have already uninstalled previous Office software manually (because I ran into the same error while uninstalling and because I thought clearing all Office related files might solve this error, which hasn't happened). I have tried the suggestions on the
 microsoft support and external sources, but to no avail. Here is the office installer I am using:</p>

<p>Hi Aman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you can try to download and run the Easy fix tool so that it can automatically scan your computer for any remaining Office installations that might still be around:</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/diag_officeuninstall</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, restart your computer and try to download Office via <a href="https://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office.com</a>&nbsp;and sign-in using your work account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, please make sure that you have Admin privileges on your computer as it is required:</p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/check-if-you-have-local-admin-rights-to-install-office-edc2f78a-e6b7-4041-917b-8136afb0a654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check if you have local admin rights to install Office</a>

            Activation is tied to the drive NOT the user. When you open the Microsoft Office applications in a new User it will ask you to setup, but this is not activation. You do not see the icons in the Dock. You will need to drag the applications from the Main
 Applications folder to add to Dock.<br />

            Can you please consider reading before you start answering? Syncml has been discontinued by Google. If not already discontinued, it will be in the near future.

<p>syncml is still available for all premium google apps accounts. I have just configured my 206 to sync my contacts and it works pretty well. The only annoyance is googles 50-contacts-per sync limit. If you happen to have more than 50 contacts, you have to
 run the sync multiple times to get all contacts transferred to your phone.</p>

<p>solution for mac users:</p>
<p>I searched for over a day - since the google sync didn't work on my 206.</p>
<p>I'm using OSX and installed iSync, I exported the google contacts andimported them in my addressbook. I found this nokia 206 isync plugin on the internet&nbsp;<a href="http://workbench.haefelinger.it/download/isync-nokia-206/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://workbench.haefelinger.it/download/isync-nokia-206/latest/</a></p>
<p>and after installing, restarting and syncing I'm fully synced now.</p>

<p>Today I swapped the Contacts from my aging 3 years old Nokia Asha 303 to my Android phone with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary requirement I had was to ensure that I find some way of syncing contacts with Google contacts as my android is configured to do so. This provides me a backup of all my contacts at Google and will ensure that I can enter/edit my contacts at one
 devices and they will be available everywhere. Also Google provides ability to recover contacts (up to a certain amount of time) in case they are accidently deleted. In order to sync contacts I used SyncML . Support for which is enabled by Google from quite
 some time. In order to configure Nokia Phones to sync with Google contacts, follow the following steps. We need to start with creating a personal configuration option first -</p>
<p><strong>settings -&gt; configuration -&gt; personal configuration</strong> -&gt; add new</p>
<p> Specify the account name. Anything will work here as it is just an identifier text entry, in case you are syncing from multiple sources. My account name is “Gmail Contacts”.</p>
<p> <strong>server address</strong> should be <a href="https://m.google.com/syncml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://m.google.com/syncml</a></p>
<p> <strong>username</strong> must be your username including the domain name (e.g *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). If you are using google apps then you should use that domain instead of gmail.com.</p>
<p> <strong>password</strong> must be your password. You will be asked to enter it twice for verification.</p>
<p> <strong>contacts database</strong> -&gt; database address is the one which is important for us as we will be syncing with it. For Gmail (and Google Apps) you should specify ‘contacts’ here. There is no need to specify username and password again here.</p>
<p> <strong>calendar database</strong> -&gt; database address should have the value of ‘calendar’. In case you do not want to sync calendar you can leave it blank.</p>
<p> <strong>notes database</strong> -&gt; database address should have the value of ‘notes’. In case you do not want to sync notes you can leave it blank.</p>
<p><strong> use pref. acc. point</strong> – Set this to either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. In case you set it to ‘No’ the you need to setup the access point values. I have set it to ‘Yes’, so that whatever my preferred access point at the time of sync is, will be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Database names is a place where SyncML protocol lacks standardisation as different providers use different names, so you must know the database name in case you have a different provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next the sync settings can be configured as below -</p>
<p><strong> Settings -&gt; sync &amp; backup -&gt; sync with server -&gt; sync settings </strong>
</p>
<p><strong> synchronised data</strong> – select the databaes which needs to be synced here. I have all three databases viz. contacts, calendar and notes selected</p>
<p> <strong>sync settings</strong> - Since this is a dual SIM phone, you will have to select either SIM1 or SIM2 and the select the configuration profile which you created above viz. ‘Gmail Contacts’.</p>
<p> <strong>automatic sync</strong> – This can be set to daily, weekly, monthly or off modes. In case you set it to off then you need to initiate sync manually when you wish to sync the databases.</p>
<p> <strong>rules for incoming</strong> – There are three possible values – Always allow, Always reject, Confirm first. The meanings are obvious. The first will always allow the incoming data and sync it, the second will always reject incoming data (in this
 case changes on your phone will be sent, but changes from Google server will not be received) and confirm first will prompt for appropriate action each time. My setting is ‘Always allow’</p>
<p> <strong>Settings -&gt; sync &amp; backup -&gt; sync with server</strong> -&gt; sync now can be used to initiate the manual sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
1. In order to install IE10, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;have SP1 (service pack 1 ) installed first.<br />
Do you have it ?</p>
<p>If you are not sure of that......</p>
<p>click Start button &gt; right side, click Computer &gt; at the top, click System Properties &gt; under Windows Edition, it will tell you whether you have Service Pack 1&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Find out exactly which Internet Explorer version you are using at this very moment.......</p>
<p>Open your Internet Explorer &gt; at the top, click Help &gt; select About Internet Explorer .</p>
<p>What does it say ? Internet Explorer 9 or Internet Explorer 10 ?</p>
<p>If it says Internet Explorer 9, consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p>Stay with IE9.</p>
<p>IE10 is having too many issues which Microsoft needs to sort out.</p>
<p>Wait till MS has ironed out all the bugs and glitches, then you can try to install IE10.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2013 is shifting ink on images when shared online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathemaddicts  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013 is shifting ink on images when shared online</h2>
                    <p>I am finding OneNote 2013 to be an awesome product (the MX version is not robust enough for my needs, but 2013 definitely needs a radial menu).&nbsp; The only major issue I am having is that my ink gets shifted when viewed in the WebApp by my students.&nbsp; This
 makes things like fraction bars and the like get completely shifted out of context.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me be clear, the OneNote 2013 notebook has none of these flaws, but it is shared online (via a link) to my students and, when viewed through the OneNote WebApp, the ink is shifted randomly.&nbsp; Here is a link to one of my documents.&nbsp; If you look at page
 2, you can see that the ink is shift up to write on top if the printed text (but this is not the actual behavior in the OneNote notebook).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=388077F27EE023CC!62229&amp;authkey=!AEv2QVZ01QxRDJw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?page=view&amp;resid=388077F27EE023CC!62229&amp;authkey=!AEv2QVZ01QxRDJw</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there something I can do to guarantee that what I see in my notebook is exactly what my students and collaborators will see online via the WebApp?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><br />
So I did that, per your suggestion, and it worked for a few things, but you can easily see that (for example) page 5 is completely off kilter.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's actually not just the positioning of the ink to the image, but the ink to some of the ink.&nbsp; I inked some text, lifted the pen, inked a box around the text and it looks fine on my local copy.&nbsp; However, the WebApp completely shifts the box.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Am I alone on this issue?</p>

I can now completely confirm that changing the paper size did nothing.&nbsp; My highlights are still shifted and the fraction bars I draw are in weird places.

            You're not alone. I'm a math professor that just experienced the same thing. At first, I was really excited about how easy it would be to share one note files with students. Now I'm not so enthused.

            <p>So it has been a little over one month and I have still heard nothing from MS support on this issue.&nbsp; If posting/sharing OneNote sections/workbooks is a feature that this product offers, why is it that the ink on these documents is shifting itself?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this a known issue that will be fixed or is this an issue that will be ignored because relatively few users share inked documents?</p>

            I should also state that those links in the original post are now outdated.&nbsp; I had to resort to saving my lectures as PDF after every class.&nbsp; As a PDF, there is no shift in ink issue.&nbsp; I would still like to know if there is a resolution on the horizon.

            I am having the same problem. I can painstakingly shift the ink that seems to be randomly misplaced when viewed in the web app so that it looks fine for my students, but then obviously it is in the wrong place when I view it in the desktop or Windows app
 version of OneNote 2013.

<p>I am finding OneNote 2013 to be an awesome product (the MX version is not robust enough for my needs, but 2013 definitely needs a radial menu).&nbsp; The only major issue I am having is that my ink gets shifted when viewed in the WebApp by my students.&nbsp; This
 makes things like fraction bars and the like get completely shifted out of context.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me be clear, the OneNote 2013 notebook has none of these flaws, but it is shared online (via a link) to my students and, when viewed through the OneNote WebApp, the ink is shifted randomly.&nbsp; Here is a link to one of my documents.&nbsp; If you look at page
 2, you can see that the ink is shift up to write on top if the printed text (but this is not the actual behavior in the OneNote notebook).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Office and I am really loving OneNote for study. I have a Sony Vaio Duo 13 to use the pen support. I noticed that the webapp and the android app does not display my ink annotations in the right position. It happens for all of them, specially
 if they are located in the final (bottom) of the page. In my android cell phone and my galaxy note 8 it`s the same thing. These are the "prints" of the webapp and the main application:</p>

            <p>I am having this same issue with shifted inking in the web app. For reference I have tried viewing the notes using the following browers with the same effect in each: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this gets resolved soon, as the share feature is useless as is for me as is.</p>

            <p>Same problem.&nbsp; Did a hardware reset &amp; lost all the apps, which didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>My phone is not windows 8 by the way, it's a lumia 800 with windows 7.8.</p>
<p>As this doesn't appear to be an OS issue this is making my doubt about upgrading to a win 10 phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow Whatsapp did install at some point, but haven't been able to install anything since.</p>
<p>Can't update apps either.</p>
<p>Probably unrelated, but whatsapp always complains about "notification problems" and takes a long time to receive a message if I'm not in the app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>**edit**</p>
<p>Managed to update my apps by the method of madness: keep trying and expect a different result. Updated at the 20ieth attempt or so. Wifi was turned off. Same problem with every app that needs installing. If it asks for a birthdate it's not working so keep
 on trying I guess. </p>

            <p>Yes I had this problem today on Windows Phone 7, an old Lumia 800 I was&nbsp;reviving as a backup phone.&nbsp; What a beautiful phone and system! Anyway, after reading the above thread, I tried the method of backing out and repeating the update over and over again
 until finally the account was recognized and able to download the WhatsApp update. As someone says above, if it asks you for date of birth, then it's already an error, so back out of that screen and try again. Keep trying, it worked for me after fifth attempt
 (this was over WiFi with no SIM card installed).</p>

<p>For those Windows Phone 7 user, who come here by an Internet search, please, go to the website Outlook. At the top left, does it say ‘Outlook.com’ or ‘Outlook Mail’? If it says ‘Outlook Mail’, please

            <p>I had the same problem and got it Solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to http://account.live.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; selected "Security &amp; privacy"</p>
<p>-&gt; Under "Marketing" -&gt; "Account marketing preferences"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unchecked "Send me promotional offers from Microsoft"</p>
<p>-&gt; Save</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the "View basic information about your account"-page</p>
<p>-&gt; Personal info -&gt; Edit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refilled all the fields on the form by first changing the value to something other and then to the right value again.</p>
<p>-&gt; Save</p>
<p>
</p><p>and right after this I was able to install apps again</p>
