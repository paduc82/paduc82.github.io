<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Preparing Automatic Repair</h2>
                    After my first turn off, turn back on, it is stuck trying to recover. I have tried all the options, even download install Windows from cloud. I can get to the c prompt, but when I do, it is a X drive - I have no C drive - it is damaged or missing.

            I got it Sunday, turned it on, paired the pen. Then turned it off, as I had to leave for business trip. Next day, when I tried to turn it back on, it immediately said attempting to repair. I tried all the options for recovery, including wireless download
 recovery. It said log file in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ETC\LOGFILES\SRT. When I took the option to go to C prompt, it took me to the path X:|WINDOWS\SYSTEM. When I tried to access the C drive, it said invalid file structure or some such error. I think it is corrupted/damaged.
 I will try your suggestion when I get hold of a USB drive and reply back.

            <p>I now have this exact same problem on my third Surface Pro 4. This most recent one just did the same thing the first two did after leaving it sitting for two days. The process was the exact same:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Turn on for the first time</p>
<p>-Go through initial setup</p>
<p>-pair pen</p>
<p>-Finally get in and do Windows Update</p>
<p>-leave for a day or two,&nbsp;</p>
<p>-start up gain and immediately goes into "Diagnosing your PC" "Attempting repairs" and "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't installed anything on the device other than doing the Windows Update and rebooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any restarts after that immediately go into the same loop. EXTREMELY frustrating. I'm not sure how this made it out of QC. As I said, this is my third one in a row exact same symptoms as trauma2000 when trying repairs.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Update: I did create a bootable USB drive, and that didn't help either. I gave up after dozens of tries of every menu option. I am certain the drive damaged itself somehow. It is sold state, but when I went to the C prompt (a diagnostic option), it took
 me to the X drive. When I tried to access the C drive from there, it said it was an invalid drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I returned it to Amazon, and got the lower end one (M processor) as it does not need a fan - less noise and longer battery life. Happy with it, but not great as an iPad replacement, slower to start up after going to sleep.</p>

            <p>My surface pro 4 is in a continuous loop flashing the surface logo. I have tried restarting, holding down the volume+ and power button in all the sequences shown in the community conversations and forums and still cannot get&nbsp; it to start. I bought the product
 in Orlando&nbsp; Florida Microsoft store in October and am currently in Europe until the end of April so I cannot return it to the store till then.</p>
<p>I cannot even register it on the Microsoft support website as the "choose a product" drop down box on the registration page does not work so it will not allow me to complete the registration even though I have entered the serial number of the product.
</p>
<p>I have tried to have a live chat with Microsoft but the live desk does not respond either!!</p>
<p>Has anybody had similar experience and resolved the problem?</p>

            Hi, so basically, I had reset my computer and the computer had shut off due to no more battery life. Upon charging it up. It gave me an error saying to restart and reinstall Windows 10. It would not let me pass this stage at all. So I researched and did
 shift+f10 to get to the registry edit. As I completed, it put my sp4 on a restarting loop saying it's installing at 64%. Once it finishes restarting about five times, it goes to a black screen. I'm at a complete loss. I have no idea what to do. The only other
 thing I've tried is pressing the power button and the volume+ together for about 15 seconds or so and it takes me to the Surface uefi screen and that does absolutely nothing for me as I have no idea what that screen is for. Please help.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 - Auto Sleep issues</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
I'm here to report that when my surface pro 2 sleeps automatically, like after a certain amount of time (usually 10 minutes), I can easily wake it back with the touch of a finger. Just as if simply the display was turned off, rather than actually SLEEP. On
 the other hand, if I press the power button (set to sleep), then it will truly sleep, meaning touching the screen won't wake it up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to know if that was intended or is a firmware, hardware, software flaw. Though I do think it's a flaw, cause it's not actually sleeping when the display turns off. In fact what happens is that ONLY the display turns off but the machine keeps
 on awake. I tested that by doing a POWERCONFIG -LASTWAKE, and it returned 0.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope I'm not the only one affected by this!</div>
                </div>

            <blockquote>Hm ... no chance. I've switch off IPv6 and my surface doesn't sleep. Now I will test to upgrade the wlan driver.
</blockquote>
<p>The latest firmware update should have fixed the problem for most. I used the default power plan with only some setting changes and it sleeps without any issue now. I didn't need to install any wlan driver by myself to make sleep to work. I think the easy
 way to make sure sleep should work is to reset your pro to factory setting and install all updates before anything else and test the sleep with default plan. If still no sleep, then get a replacement.

            <p>Windows 10 Enterprise is a volume license client. This particular edition of Windows 10 does not come preinstalled on new computers. It is more likely to be pre-loaded by an organizations IT department.
</p>
<p>Are you using the laptop in an organization managed by an IT department?</p>
<p>If not, then its possible the laptop was pre-loaded with a non-genuine copy of Windows 10 Enterprise license.</p>
<p>In that case, you will need to reload the original genuine copy of Windows 10 that came preinstalled on the system which would most likely be Windows 10 Home if it was purchase 3 months ago.</p>

            Hi Gregory
<br />
<br />Do you mean you have recorded a Skype session and you are getting a message that is it good for 30 days. If so, then yes, that will only be stored on the servers for 30 days, you must download and save that if you need to keep it. 
<br />
<br />Those videos are very large and cannot be stored indefinitely on the Skype servers, they need to keep freeing up space to make room for new videos ...

    <title>Start Menu, Taskbar And Various Apps Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Start Menu, Taskbar And Various Apps Not Working</h2>
                    <p>This may have similarities to a number of posts on here but I haven't seen one quite like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick installation history as it may or not be pertinent. I originally upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to 10 Pro but kept getting BSOD dpc_watchdog_violation errors so I downloaded the 64-bit Windows 10 Pro iso and clean installed using my Microsoft account.
 This gave me quite a few problems with mapped NAS drives so I then clean installed Windows 10 with a local account for myself as administrator and three standard local accounts for my family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seemed well as I set up the Mail, Calendar, Weather, People apps etc. for each account. After a while, these apps are no longer working for my family's accounts but they do on my account. If you left click on them, they give the 'click' movement but
 do not open nor do they when trying them from the 'All apps' menu. Some apps will work but an awful lot will not. All apps appear to work on my account so I changed the account types to administrator but they still would not open. I have tried the following
 PowerShell fixes to no effect:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><code>Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –like "*windowscommunicationsapps*"} | remove-appxprovisionedpackage –online</code></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>The first removed the Mail and Calendar app which I then reinstalled to no effect. The second didn't really appear to do anything.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>A second problem which may be related is that on a couple of occasions the start menu and taskbar stop responding to left clicks i.e. clicking on the start button does not open the start menu. Right clicking on the button
 opens the Win+X menu (Device Manager, System, Control Panel etc.). The taskbar icon would also fail to respond to left clicks but worked on right click e.g. I could not open the volume slider but could access the menu to open the Volume Mixer to control the
 sound from there. One of the suggestions I found online for this was to use Settings\Update &amp; Security\Recovery\Reset this PC but as I was unable to open the start menu I tried to come at it from another direction. I right clicked the start button and tried
 the link 'Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Recovery\If you're having problems with your PC, go to Settings and try resetting it'. When I clicked on the link a settings window (presumably 'Update &amp; Security') opened but immediately closed. This happened
 every time I clicked on the link.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><span>A restart fixed this problem but it came back eventually necessitating a further restart.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">I haven't reset the installation yet as I have spent some considerable time setting up everything and would appreciate some reassurance that I'm not going to be left back at the start and will still face
 the same problem.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>Any help appreciated.</span></span> </p>

<strong>DISM</strong> Commands:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press
<strong>Windows + x</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I don't receive any error messages, as I say if you click on the app it "depresses" to show that it has been clicked and after that nothing happens at all on the three standard user accounts. They work correctly for the first created account.</p>
<p>I don't think the make of computer is particularly pertinent but it is an old MESH (UK computer assemblers) desktop that has been upgraded. It is mainly used by the family for email, web browsing and watching video from the home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried the app troubleshooter and it found nothing amiss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the DSIM commands and after the first received the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No component store corruption detected.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And after the restorehealth command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps still do not work for three of the four accounts.</p>

    <title>Unable to find driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loganrohr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to find driver</h2>
                    I recently bought a new barebones system, after I received my physical copy of Windows 10. I tried to install, I was prompted to select a driver to which it would be installed. It couldn't show me any drivers that it can be installed to, after going to
 browse all I could find was the windows 10 drive, which I'm assuming was the USB. And a boot driver x which selecting neither of those worked. I am extremely confused on what it's asking me to do.

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t go into sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium x64 with Service Pack 1 and I can't get it to go into sleep mode, either by pressing the sleep key on the keyboard or by choosing Start&gt;Shut Down menu&gt;Sleep. Here is a list of things I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Control Panel&gt;Power Options, changed plan settings and restored default settings for all power plans.</li><li>Removed all hardware except the keyboard and mouse which came with the computer.</li><li>Via Device Manager, turned off the "Allow this device to wake up the computer" feature on all devices except the keyboard.</li><li>Via msconfig.exe, disabled all startup items and services (a "Diagnostic startup" or a "vanilla boot").</li><li>Removed all antivirus software.</li><li>Logged out of Windows and issued the sleep command from the login screen.</li></ul>
<p>After trying all of these things, I still can't get my computer to go into sleep mode, either on demand or automatically!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else could be wrong here (e.g. a Windows update that I need to uninstall)?</p>

            <p><span>Hello Brandon, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. We are glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Were any significant changes made to your computer prior to this issue?
</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the information you’ve provided, it probably appears to be an issue with the one of the hardware drivers. So, I would suggest try booting up the computer in Safe Mode and check, if you are able to put
 the computer to sleep from there and update us with the status of the issue. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Unfortunately I think the problem has been happening for a while now. I know that once my trial version of Norton Internet Security expired, I had to change antivirus programs, and so went with AVG despite the fact that it had prevented my computer from
 going into sleep mode before (AVG was the predominant antivirus program in my family). Since then, however, I have removed AVG and tried other antivirus programs, including avast!, before settling on Microsoft Security Essentials, but as I said before, it
 doesn't seem to matter what antivirus program, if any, is installed on the machine -- it won't go into sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is impossible to put the computer into sleep mode from Safe Mode -- there is no such option. It seems sleep mode is part of Windows' power management service, which is apparently not among the core drivers and services loaded when I start the computer
 in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an HP Omni 120-1136.</p>

<p><span>I apologize for inconvenience caused to and not connecting with the fact that power management service would be disabled in
<em>safe mode</em>. However, I still have a firm belief that the issue lies with the hardware drivers. Thus I would suggest you to try updating the drivers for graphics adapter, storage controller and the network controller. You may try to download the drivers
 from the following link. </span></p>

            None of the drivers solved anything... the problem remains. I still think AVG tweaked a setting that disabled my computer's sleep capability, at least under Windows. As I said, I've since removed AVG, but doing so didn't repair the damage.

            In order to further isolate the problem, I set the computer to dim the display after 2 minutes, turn off the display after 3 minutes, turn off the hard disk after 4 minutes, and go into sleep mode after 5 minutes. The display eventually turned off as set,
 but the hard drive never turned off, and so the computer couldn't go into sleep mode. So now my question is: What could be preventing my hard drive from turning off when asked?

            <p>There is no errors and i dont even have an antivirus. As stated on my comment above this whole issue is caused by that usseless windows update to my gtx 1080, which btw IS TOTALY UNNECCESSARY. Dont make anything you dont need to make ffs. Nvidia drivers
 are all i need for that so why you guys butting in with ur usseless damaging stuff....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing resolution changes nothing. I work in IT support, ive gonne through a couple steps myself and if this was gixed with changing resolution i wouldnt be here...

 you using windows live messenger?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if you find any errors in event viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>What information appears in event logs? (Event Viewer)<br />

<h2>            Network adapters don&#39;t work after upgrading to Windows 10, even with new drivers installed</h2>
                    <p>I just decided to upgrade to Windows 10, and I'm immediately having networking problems.&nbsp; I can't connect to the Internet.&nbsp; It seems like there is some connection because I get the icon with the little yellow triangle saying that there are connectivity issues.&nbsp;
 However, I am unable to access any internet pages or ping my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the windows network troubleshooter, and it says that the problem may be related to the drivers for the devices.&nbsp; I then tried downloading all of the latest drivers for my network adapter from a Linux partition on my computer.&nbsp; In linux, my network
 devices work fine, so I know it isn't a hardware issue.&nbsp; After downloading and moving the drivers over, I installed them in Windows 10.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to go wrong with the installation.&nbsp; However, nothing changed.&nbsp; I still had the exact same issues as before.&nbsp;
 I have tried this for both my wireless card and my wired network adapter, and both have given exactly the same results.&nbsp; I am able to install the driver, but it makes no difference to my connectivity, even after restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7, and before the upgrade the network adapters worked fine.&nbsp; My network adapters are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wired - Intel Corporation Ethernet Connection I217-V</p>
<p>Wireless - Ralink RT2760</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice, it would be very appreciated.&nbsp; I don't really want to have to roll back to 7.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. If you recently upgraded to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, it's possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to try uninstalling the network adapter driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver upon restart.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Expand network adapter.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result, we will be glad to help if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p />

            I tried your advice (as well as ZigZag3143's advice), and it still does not work.&nbsp; I uninstalled all of the drivers for my network adapters, then restarted my computer.&nbsp; When I checked the device manager, the drivers were there as though I had never uninstalled
 them, but the Internet access still did not work.&nbsp; Again, I know that the problem isn't with the internet connection because I'm typing this from the exact same physical machine, just a different partition.&nbsp; It must be something to do with Windows 10, but
 I haven't been successful at figuring it out so far.&nbsp; If you have any further advice, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!

            I tried all of the things there and none worked. &nbsp;After that, I reinstalled my operating system, which fixed things. &nbsp;I still don't know what the problem was, but reinstalling the OS solved it (as it usually does). &nbsp;Thank you very much for your help, it
 was obviously a tricky issue and I really appreciate that you took the time to help with it.

    <title>Explorer.exe not responding after right click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamb984  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe not responding after right click</h2>
                    Explorer.exe hangs when I try to right click on a file. Explorer freezes and I cannot continue unless I open the task manager and kill the explorer process at which time the system rights itself and I can continue to use explorer normally thereafter, until
 I reboot again. I note that after killing explorer.exe and the systems rights itself, some of the icons have disappeared from the task bar. Preliminary tests show that the problem always occurs after a fresh boot and will happen exactly as describe above.
 Right clicking on the desktop works OK. A "safe" boot appears to be error free. I have installed SP3 but the error continues. I have automative updates turned on, although I verify first before installing. This problem surfaced about 12 months ago and I cannot
 recall any specific software or event that may have triggered it. Regards

            Right-click issues are generally caused by third-party software which has inserted entries into the context menu. Troubleshoot with the free ShellExView tool.<br />

            In 2017, this program still helped in fixing my problem.<br />
To clarify, I had the same problem as OP, my right-clicking would hang explorer.exe and the only fix was restarting the program through TM.<br />

<h2>            Is the PC or the Qualcomm Atheros not working properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire ZS600G, Mfg Date 2/6/13&nbsp;running Windows 10.&nbsp; My problem is if I leave the computer inactive for an extended period of time, 1-2 hours, when I come back and wake it up, the internet is not connected.&nbsp; This is day 3 of this situation
 and so far I've gotten it back on line, but is it the PC, the Qualcomm Atheros AR5BWB222 wireless network adapter or maybe the Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller (I don't even know what this one does)?</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Hard drive unformatted&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zavisimochik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive unformatted&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This morning, when I went to turn on my XBox 360, it asked to perform a system update, telling me I couldn't use XBox Live until I do, all that jazz.&nbsp; So I went ahead and told it to perform the update, and then it spontaneously restarted.&nbsp; Then when I turned
 it back on, it just spun the loading wheel for a long time, so I turned it off, unplugged it, and plugged it back in.&nbsp; When I turned it back on, it once again asked to perform the update, but then told me I didn't have enough storage space.&nbsp; When I went to
 check the hard drive, it said "unformatted."</p>
<p>Now I haven't done anything to the hard drive since I got the console.&nbsp; So what could have happened to it, and how do I get the functionality back without reformatting the hard drive and losing all my game saves?&nbsp; I've taken good care of my console since
 I got it, and it's rather upsetting to have this happen.&nbsp; :-(</p>

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>Thanks for replying</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I am only a community member, not a Microsoft employee. However I have phoned xbox support and they are now fully aware of the issue you are having with the system update. I can only recommend re downloading the games again by following the instructions
 within this article.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/downloadable-content/redownload-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../redownload-content</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Like I have said, I am only a community member like your self , and am always willing to help you and other gamers. However as for fixing issues, I can not.
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>That is understandable Suknath, and im sure some of us appreciate that at least you called microsoft to make them aware of the issue. Please understand we're frustrated because we're basically helpless and all we've really heard from Msoft is "either reformat
 or buy a new one". This to us, as loyal consumers, is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Is there a way we can some kind of official ticket thread or communication with microsoft directly regarding the issue? Perhaps there is a better way we can relay to Msoft that this is a big issue and avoid complaining to ambassadors who cant do much to
 assist us.</p>

<p>There are a number of us with the same issue. It has been suggested to me to use a data transfer cable to copy the data over to another hard drive. &nbsp;You might want to try that to get your game saves back.</p>
<p>Good luck! &nbsp;I'm taking my hard drive into the Microsoft Store to see if they can help.</p>

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>I spoke with someone from Xbox Support.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>They have some more things for you to try your self. Could you please unplug your Xbox 360 and everything that is connected to it. After you have done this, you will need to inject the Hard Drive for the console. For help with this, please follow the instructions
 within the article bellow.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After you have done this, please plug everything back into your Xbox 360. Plug everything back in, including your network cables. Then start it up again. After you have done this, you should then see the Hard Drive back in the Storage area, and it should
 be formatted back to the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All of this information has been handed down from phone support, and they say it should work with this. However if it doesn't work, please feel free to ring support your self or keep posted to the forums for more troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Please post back any results back from this step. I hope this helps you, </p>

<p>Update! The people at the Microsoft Store couldn't help either. &nbsp;They did try a good number of things including connecting up to their system and even just coping the data off the drive over.
</p>
<p>I had to reformat my drive. &nbsp;The good news is it works fine. &nbsp;The bad news is yes, I lost a whole bunch of stuff. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That was my main worry, however you can download the games back to your Hard Drive by going into your recent downloads, or by going onto the game in the Market Place.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Tip: I had data backed up on the cloud, and on a USB. I would recommend doing this,incase this happens again. Also, your stats on the games might still be there, like your COD level and classes. As this is stored on their servers. Not your Xbox Hard Drive.
 So you might have everything there from Multiplayer.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sorry I could not help further. It looks like its just re format the drive. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hey there UncrossedMat</p>
<p>Welcome to the Xbox Live Forums</p>
<p>Once you have re formatted your Xbox 360 hard drive, you will be able to download all of your owned games and content back onto it. However, for your game saves, you can not re download &nbsp;your game saves unless you have got them backed up on a USB stick or
 on a different storage device such as your consoles memory.</p>
<p>As far as your Xbox Music and Video passes, you should be able to re download them by using the recent purchase history and "My Collection" feature on there. Basically, any content you have bought on Xbox Live, Xbox Music and Xbox Video. You can re download
 back onto your Xbox. Games you have got with Games with Gold. You may not be able to download back onto your Xbox, however you could always try downloading it and see what it says.</p>
<p>I hope this has helped you with your question. If you have any other questions or would like any help, please create a new thread on the Xbox Live forums where the community can best assist you (Members Like you and me)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

It is not there. I tried searching for it but it does not come up anywhere.<br />

            If you mean the msiexec.exe file is not in the c:\windows\system32 folder and there is no backup copy you can use to replace it (via copy/paste) in either:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
The msiexec.exe file is covered under Windows File Protection so it would take some extra effort for it to be missing completely from your system unless your unspecified antimalware/antivirus application quarantined (effectively deleted) the file.<br />
<br />
You can download and install the Windows Installer 4.5 package from here (for 32 bit XP, you need the last one):<br />
<br />

<br />
If you want to see if just replacing the file is all you need to do, there is a copy of the msiexec.exe 4.5 file on my SkyDrive you can download.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called msiexec when the file name really needs to be called msiexec.exe (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />

            <p>You might have WPS enabled in your WiFi router. It will display any devices within WiFi range that also have WPS enabled. The devices cannot connect to the network without interaction at your end (not counting hackers). Disabling the option should make your
 unknown device disappear.</p>
