<h2>            N97&#58; Touchscreen unresponsive for a time after unlocking keylock.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I send my N97 away for repair I just want to see if anyone else has seen this. &nbsp;It all started on v11 when if the phone was key locked and then unlocked the screen fails to respond for quite a while, upto 45 seconds sometimes and as it does start
 to respond the accuracy is all over the place with touching the green call butting activating soemthing half way up the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated to v12 a few weeks ago and it is still there, I done a factory reset last week and still there so i would have to assume it is hardware, the touch screen driver chip or something not coming out of a power-saving mode when asked to or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background application wise I use Nokia email and Mail for exchange. &nbsp;Facebook runs as a widget. I sometimes have fring running but not always. &nbsp;I'm using a standard Nokia theme now too incase it was an issue there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the more I write here the more I'm convinced it is a hardware issue but before I have to send off my expensive business phone for 7 days for repair I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this and has found&nbsp;what&nbsp;is casing it.</p>

<p>I've had this issue for some time now. Firmware update from v11 to v12 didn't help, only made it worse. Hard reseting the phone didn't help. It freed space from phone memory up to 35MB but the screen still doesn't respond after unlocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After hard reset my home screen widgets are not updating. Music player widget won't show the song that's playing. Accu Weather or Facebook widgets won't load at all, even though the apps them selves work when opened from the menu. Favorite contacts widget
 won't show any image over the names, not the image set to that name nor the default icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm taking it to repair tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have this as well but it's intermittent. In my case I don't think that it's a hardware issue and my best guess is that it has does something to do with the screen lock and screen light time-out. Hoping that it'll be fixed with FW v20 like many other niggles.</p>

<p>I have the same problem as m1bxf.</p>
<p>But with my n97 is stated after updating to 2.0.</p>
<p>I went to a nokia service point to fix my GPS, wich work great now, and they also did a software update (20.0.019.C01.01) but the problem remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;hardware as after updating to v20 there appears the small blue circle indicating where there the screen is pressed in an area of the screen which is not being pressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the phone in for repair and they say they could not see it at all and would not change the screen without seeing the fault! &nbsp;I mean what kind of RUBBISH customer support is this??? &nbsp;I see today Nokia are cutting back on their research and development
 headcount in Finland and Denmark, I think they should keep them and get rid of their totally useless Nokia Care team...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow I'm getting a faulty phone back now which will no doubt go right back in for the same fault within 24 hours.</p>

            Hey Guys i had the same problem very annoying, but found the solution you just need to recalibrate your touch screen. If you go to the menu /Settings/Phone/Touch Input/Touch Screen Calibration. Hope this helps

<p>My screen is not reacting good, even after recalibrating my n97. What I do is switching of the phone, and the for a few hours is goes well again.</p>
<p>It is not the way, but I hope in the next update it will be better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not the screen protector. &nbsp;Here is where I am today. &nbsp;I bit the&nbsp;bullet&nbsp;and bought another N97 from my friend, this time a black one. &nbsp;Due to an error flashing it and bricking it I had to take the new phone to the repair centre. &nbsp;While there I showed
 them the faulty white one, the one which had already been in and they agree there was a fault. &nbsp;They flashed my new black n97 for me while I waited and kept the white one to be repaired saying it would take a few weeks to get the parts. &nbsp;Ok I thought as I
 have the black one. &nbsp;3 days later I get a call saying it was all fixed and I got a friend to collect it. &nbsp;It came back looking the same, there were some white blotches behind the screen which are still there so they didn't change that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the saga goes on, while on a call my new Black N97 speaker has now stopped working so I need to enable speaker phone to make calls! &nbsp;So I thought I'd go back to my nice repaired white N97 and guess what? &nbsp;ITS NOT FIXED!!! &nbsp;I mean I'm really unlucky I've
 now got 2 faulty N97s but I just feel like Nokia have no care at all to get them fixed. &nbsp;I really have lost thew will to live with them, 2 devices which a total high street cost around Â£1000 and I just feel useless and unable to get them working...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway I'm leaving Nokia now for a good while as this level of support is pathetic and you just can't tell them! &nbsp;I've ordered a Nexus One which should arrive this week...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. A bit of naming and shaming here, the repair centre I've been using is Regenersis PLC&nbsp;in Huntingdon.</p>

    <title>how to separate rows using a dotted line according to the dates in a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaquino87  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to separate rows using a dotted line according to the dates in a column</h2>
                    I have a column that goes from latest to nearest dates and for example, row 1 to 15 will have information about stock trades (buys and sells on that date) and then row 16 through 27 will have different information about the same stock but on a sooner date
 and then rows 27 and on will have nearer and nearer dates for the same stock until it comes to the current date at which point there are the totals and a few blank rows separate the next stocks that have the same information.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can send an actual example if that would help but wanted to know how to format the cells so that there is a solid line or a dotted line between row 15 and row 16 and then between row 27 and 28 - by highlighting all of the information or by not having
 to manually add in a line for each date, just because there are thousands of rows and manually using a divided line and having to go through going to the format window would take forever.</div>
<div><br />

<div>please e-mail me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or by responding to this question and I WILL BE VERY APPRECIATIVE! &nbsp;THANKS SO MUCH!</div>

            <p>You can set the border formatting in conditional formatting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you set up is like this:</p>
<p>8/8/2011&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
8/9/2011&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
8/10/2011&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data<br />
</p>
<p>and the cells that don't contain dates are BLANK, then you can use this formula in Conditional Formatting:</p>
<p>=NOT(ISBLANK($A1))</p>
<p>where A1 is the first cell containing a date (and the active cell in your selection).</p>
<p>To implement this, select the first cell containing a date, and drag the mouse over all the cells (rows and columns) where you want the dotted line to appear.</p>
<p>Home tab &gt; Conditional Formatting &gt; New Rule &gt; Use formula...&nbsp;&nbsp; paste in the formul, then click the Format button and set the border format for the TOP of the cell.</p>
<p>Does that do what you want?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

<h2>            N97 Setting menu item disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. On my Nokia N97 the Settings menu item has disappeared. I do not know what happened, if the children had deleted it or what... Now I can access the Settings just through the Help where I have to click on the link which opens the Setting.</p>
<p>So, can anybody tell me is there a way how to restore Setting menu item without hard reset? Will hard reset restore the menu and will I have Settings in the menu again?</p>
<p>Thanx</p>

<p>Hi, you cannot 'remove' settings, what will have probably happened is you've moved it into a folder. Try looking in your folders, Games, Office, applications etc. When you find it, select options&gt;organise then select settings&gt;options&gt;move to folder and select
 Root Folder, it will then appear back where it started&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>

<h2>            MS Publisher 2013 &#34;Not Responding&#34;</h2>
                    I'm running MS Publisher 2013.&nbsp; It's been fine for a month, but today it just keeps giving me a "Not Responding" message at the top of the page, and I have to wait 10-15 seconds for it to unfreeze.&nbsp; Then every time I try to do anything... the same thing,
 and it keeps doing it more and more, until I can hardly do anything.&nbsp; I've clicked "Use legacy drag preview", and "Disable hardware graphics acceleration", as suggested for some others with speed issues with MSP2013... but nothing changed.&nbsp; I'm going slowly
 crazy here... can anyone help?<br />
Thank you.<br />

            Thank you for all your responses.&nbsp; I ended up calling Microsoft (not helpful), and then Toshiba.&nbsp; I had two versions of Publisher running, which when we uninstalled the earlier version, solved the problem!!!&nbsp; Cheers!<br />

                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Description:</span></p>
<p>In Word 2016, using the "Find and Replace" dialog to search for formatting instances (specific font color) causes that font color to be applied to any text the cursor is placed in at the time of color selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Steps to reproduce:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>open Word 2016</li><li>create a new document or open an existing document (<em>if new document: type some text or enable the displaying of paragraph marks, an empty paragraph mark is already sufficient to show the problem</em>)</li><li>place cursor anywhere in the document</li><li>press ctrl+h (i.e. open 'find and replace' dialog)</li><li>click button "More &gt;&gt;"</li><li>click button "Format"</li><li>from the drop-down list, select "Font..."</li><li>in the new window ("Find Font"), select a new font color, e.g. "red"</li><li>press "OK"</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; <strong>the selected font color is immediately applied to whatever the cursor was placed on/in at the time.</strong></p>

    <title>E66 beginner&#39;s Q&#38;amp&#59;A - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> korben---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E66 beginner&#39;s Q&#38;amp&#59;A</h2>
                    2 days ago I bought my new cellular - E66 and been playing with it since. Here are my questions to you. Awaiting answers<br />
<br />
<strong>1]</strong> when I'm trying to use Apps Installer to install new themes I get this:<br />
the contents of the currently selected phone cannot be shown by this application<br />
both with memory card and phone memory<br />
<br />
<strong>2]</strong> do you have creaking noises when you use you're slider buttons?<br />
I mean it's not very loud but it's there...perhaps I will get used to it.<br />
Some people say it's 'pretty normal'...<br />
<br />
<strong>3]</strong> any really useful freeware available for this phone...?<br />
<br />
<strong>4]</strong> Nokia Ovi Suite or Nokia PC Suite? which one is more reliable/advisable?<br />
<br />
<strong>5] </strong>opera 4 mini or opera 5 mini for my phone?<br />
<br />
<strong>6] </strong>When to start charging e66?<br />
<br />
my old cell had % and I had read it was best to start recharging when the % dropped to 8-10, how about e66? One bar left or....?<br />
And when to stop?<br />
<br />
more or less when the meter stops<br />
or<br />
meter stops + 10 minutes, then unplug?<br />
<br />
<strong>7]</strong> currently:<br />
102.07.81<br />
12-07-2008<br />
RM-343<br />
what can I gain downloading the newest soft? do you recommend it?<br />
<br />
<strong><font color="#999999">8]</font></strong> can the balloon tips in the main menu be turned off? those that popup when you choose messages - you see popup saying you've chosen... messages, when you choose gallery there's another popup..icons are self-explanatory
 for me, so?<br />
<br />
<strong>9]</strong> On my old cell I could configure the picture settings to my liking, i.e. I could choose 2mpix and the desired resolution or 3mpix and the resolution. Is it possible with my e66? cause so far haven't been able to figure it out... or it's
 impossible, which sucks cause I want my 3mpix and, say, 800x600<br />
or maybe it wasn't possible.. and I'm mistaken with this one lol<br />
<br />
<strong>10]</strong> more to come...<br />
<br />
thank you for your time!<br />
<br />
sincerely,<br />
korbenPL<br />
<br />
ps. I hope it's the right section...

<p>3) there are a lot of useful freeware for your phone. have a look at ovi.com for starters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) opera mini 4.2.1. opera 5 is still in beta. try bolt or skyfire as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) check your manual for the battery specifications. But to the best of my knowledge, it's not healthy to let the battery drain nor leave it charging when it's full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) go to nokia.com get support and software, downloads, can i update. there's a section there where you need to enter your device code (written inside the phone just under the battery). the page will tell you what software is current and if your phone needs
 an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) just disable help activation (not too sure where it can be found on the e66, usually in the settings)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) turn your camera on. press options, settings. you should find a page for both image and video where you can adjust your settings as you please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) that's why this community exists. :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>2. I used to have the E66 last year, and there is a noticeable 'creaking' from the slider buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Plenty available. I can't give recommendations as I do not know what you need.<br />
<br />
5. Both are fine, though be aware that Mini 5 is currently a beta software. I have been using it since release and it is pretty stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Li-ion batteries works best when constantly top up, rather than allowing it to discharge below 3-5%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Upgrading to the newest firmware is recommended due to bug fixes and general improvements, particularly if you are having some software issues. It isn't a necessity if you find your phone stable. My E51 is still running on its original firmware because
 I find it stable enough not to bother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Yes in the camera settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi korben</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) i think this not ur phone problem only , but also it occurs to&nbsp; me when i try to install any apps using app. intaller, it sounds to be a S60 problem related to protiction issues , cos with any S40 phone i;m able to see the apps installed on the phone,
 but with S60 phone u can only install but u can't see the apps installed on the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) for me i recharge my&nbsp;phone and any nokia phone when the message " low batterry "&nbsp;shows up, but time of recharging takes&nbsp;depends on the type of battery , mine takes 1h</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) those ballons sound to be obligatory and no way u can remove or disable using the phone settings</p>

<p>wooo I hought to myself 'why not visitng my old thread and see if there are any replies'<br />
<br />
and voila!<br />
<br />
so many thought-provoking answers to my burning questions - good to know I can count on you, gents :smileyhappy:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
10] How to stay protected surfing the net?<br />
what are the possible ways?<br />
<br />
clear cache every time?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
11]&nbsp; Open 'Settings', then 'Connection'. Scroll down to 'Wireless Lan' and click on it. Right click 'Options' and select 'Advanced settings' and continue. Go down to 'TX power level' and select 4mW or 10mW (default is 100mW).<br />
<br />
can anyone validate this?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
12] how to set the definitely DEFAULT access point for my WLAN connections?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#999999">13]</font> When I start the phone I keep getting now this:</p>

<p>I have never tried sending a txt file to my phone, but try Y-Browser. It should be located in Documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. If connecting via WiFi, make sure you enable WPA/WPA2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Yes, changing from 100mW to 10 or 4mW significantly decreases the power consumption. It worked wonders with my old N80 (known battery hog)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. A bug I believe, it happened on my E51 but after I formatted by memorycard the error message never appeared again</p>

    <title>Windows maps stopped working on Lumia 935 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjubn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows maps stopped working on Lumia 935</h2>
                    <p>I have an ongong issue with Windows Maps app. I'm using Lumia 935, with Windows Phone 10, all software and apps are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago, Maps app stopped working. It shows white/black/blue screen instead of maps (all the buttons are available in the app as usual). It doesn't matter if I'm online or offline. I have some offline maps stored on my SD card. Here's how it looks:&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/i/s!AmrmDqffcnTngcQmfvPvhsx52QgiuQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/i/s!AmrmDqffcnTngcQmfvPvhsx52QgiuQ</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to enter Settings for Maps from the Settings path (to change the location or remove maps) it loads for some time and sends feedback that it couldn't access maps and suggest to try again later. Obviously I've tried that many times. The issue persists.
 So I can't move offline maps to the device and/or add/remove new maps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to enter Settings directly from the Maps app, the app freezes and crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't reinstall the app since it's locked on my device. It doesn't give me such option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system update happened on the way and it didn't help. I've restarted the device multiple times and Maps are still not accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping that Maps app update would help, but it hasn't been released in a while so I'm writing with hope that someone can help me figure out what the issue is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought about removing maps manually from the SD card to sort of hard reset them, but I can't find a folder which would includes those. I have hidden files and all that stuff set to visible on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone have a similar issue? Do you have any suggestions about what I could try or where to reach out for more help in that matter?</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure what you are trying to do but as a side note, RESCO Explorer will allow you to map a network drive from your device allowing access to files if that is of any value to you.</p>

<p>Hi Usama,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll download updates more quickly when connected to WiâFi. Since you wanted to download the update to your phone using a cellular data connection, please make sure that it shows 3G, 4G, or LTE. If you have a 2G or 2.5G (EDGE) connection, you'll be prompted
 for updates, but won't be able to download them until you have a faster cellular data connection or connect to WiâFi. To update using a cellular connection, please select
<span><strong>Download</strong> when prompted to download the update. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, you can install the available update on your phone by using the<strong> Windows Device Recovery Tool.</strong></span> In this case, you will need to download and install it on your PC or laptop<span> that runs with
</span><span>Windows&nbsp;7, Windows 8, Windows&nbsp;8.1, or Windows&nbsp;10. Once the tool is installed, please connect your phone to PC or laptop via USB cable.</span></p>

<h2>            Project Online - Charge out rate AND pay rates per task</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a professional services business. We pay our employees the 'pay rate', and we charge them out at Pay+Overhead+Profit, or the 'charge rate'</p>
<p>
</p><p>For our projects, we need to be able to analyse per task, and rolled up, the charge rates and the pay rates at the same time, and then be able to deduct those figures from a budget.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've dabbled with using 2 standard rates over 2 cost rate tables, however I'm now stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would want this to be the set up for all our projects across the enterprise, so knowing how Project Online/Server will handle this will be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been down this road before, and there is no simple way to address this need.&nbsp; What I have done is to create three extra columns.&nbsp; Name one of them Charge Rate, name the other Pay Rate, and name the third one Profit.&nbsp; Create&nbsp;a formula in the Profit
 column that subtracts the Pay Rate column value from the Charge Rate column value.&nbsp; Next, set your charge rate on Cost Rate Table A and set the employee pay rate on Cost Table B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, insert the Cost Rate Table column in the Task Usage view and select Cost Rate Table A as the rate for every task.&nbsp; Copy and&nbsp;paste&nbsp;the values in the Cost column to the Charge Rate column.&nbsp; Change the values to Cost Rate Table B in the Cost Rate Table
 column.&nbsp; Copy and paste the values in the Cost column to the Pay Rate column.&nbsp; You should now be able to see the profit per task in the Profit column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of every reporting period, or bi-weekly, or monthly, you will want to repeat the process of setting the Cost Rate Table value for every task, then copying and pasting to the Charge Rate and Pay Rate columns to see the current state of the project.&nbsp;
 I realize this is a bit of a laborious process, but it WILL work.&nbsp; I have used this with clients previously, so I know from experience.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            The text you selected is not underlined. Therefore, there is no color because there is no underline. If you select text that is not underlined the underline color is No Color.<br />

            <p>If there is no "No Color" option for font color settings ,I think it is not&nbsp;satisfactory.</p>
<p>When I pasted some html text, such as syntax highlight code , all the font color will be replaced to the settings.</p>

            <p>Ah - that's a bit different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The format you want your text to have is the color black. Select the text and choose black as the color. That way you can keep the other formatting (bold, etc) and all the text will simply be black.</p>

<h2>            Office for Mac Error code 0x800488fe</h2>
                    <p>I have a Macbook Pro on El Capitan 10.11.6, and just did the recent updates from Apple and now when I try to activate Office to use Word, I keep getting an&nbsp;0x800488fe error code. I've had this subscription for 4 years and never had a problem til now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at other posted questions related to this error code, and tried the solutions, but nothing works. My language and region is English and USA, so that isn't the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this problem and how did you fix it? Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should try and use that same account to login to the portal or my account page (https://portal.office.com) and check to see if there are any errors or messages. That error code is normally shown when there's a problem with your account. It's unlikely
 related to the recent updates that you applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>If it listed there, you should check the version and see if it compatible or not. If there wasn't any info or no record. Then contact the manufacturer and ask them about compatibility status with Windows 8.</p>

            is that normal that the translator show the time as a timestamp? i think just the "em" tag should be fixed.

            <p>Is this in one location (e.g. your hotel), or anywhere you've tried?&nbsp; Does the&nbsp;WiFi require you to sign in on a web page before you are allowed access?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes hotels or other public WiFi Hotspots will block certain ports (or even block&nbsp;all ports other than 80 and 443- the two needed for web browsing) to prevent people from sending spam, using file sharing services, or using&nbsp;VoIP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some email services (like Exchange,&nbsp;Hotmail, and Gmail) that use Exchange Activesync can work over 80 and 443 just like web browsing, but POP and IMAP email may be blocked. Can you access your mail in&nbsp;the browser via a webmail portal?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no official statement regarding whether or not zune devices are discontinued or will be back again. At the moment Microsoft&nbsp;pushes its lovely Windows Phone which has the zune player integrated.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 calendar prints 30 minute meeting slots as 60 minutes</h2>
                    When I schedule a 30 minute meeting in Outlook, and I have checked and confirmed it is for 30 minutes, when I print the weekly version of the calendar it prints out as a 60 minute block and not 30 minutes. This gets quite difficult to read when there are
 several 30 minutes meetings back to back and they all print out as 60 minutes. Has anyone else come across this issue, if so have you been able to get it resolved? It started about 2 months ago for me.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue may be caused by a few things. One of the common causes is a program error. However, this is yet to be determined in your case. Do let us know the type of set-up on your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Are you using a home computer or work?<br />
<br />
2. Which account type is currently configured (POP, IMAP, MAPI or Exchange)?<br />
<br />
<br />
We will look forward to hearing back from you regarding this concern.

            <p>Hi Pam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly you're unable to receive emails and the email senders receive a bounce message. Based on the information you provided, it's possible that you encountered this issue because you've almost reached the mailbox storage limit for
 your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're using a free account, we suggest that you delete the unnecessary emails in your account to free up some space in your mailbox to check if this will resolve the issue. However, if you don't want to do this, we suggest that you upgrade to
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/ad-free-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ad-free Outlook.com</a></strong> to increase your mailbox storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we would like you to provide the affected email address in the private message area so we can check it on our end to verify the cause of the issue. To view it, just click on the "<strong>You have a private reply to this message</strong>" link above
 your post and make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link. We have also moved some of the information that you provided in the private message area for security reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p>I have gone through all the posts in this thread. I'd like to explain that it is not feasible to work around list view threshold limit by creating the view filtered by lookup index column. To make other community members who come across this thread find
 the information easily, I'd like to make a summary like below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Symptom:</strong></p>
<p><span>We will get the error "</span><span>This view cannot be displayed because it exceeds the list view threshold (5000items) enforced by the administrator</span><span>" when we filter a view using lookup column in a list which has more than 5000 items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
<p><span>Although </span><span>we</span><span> can index a lookup column to improve performance, u</span><span>sin</span><span>g an indexed lookup column to prevent exceeding the List View Threshold does not work.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<p>Use another type of column as the primary or secondary index. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>

<h2>            double columns ending midway down page</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Please have a look at this screen shot of my document:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36a29c89-60ee-4715-a132-c77583dc25fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36a29c89-60ee-4715-a132-c77583dc25fa" /></a><br />
<br />
As you can see, I have double columns. And on page two the columns end a little passed the midpoint of the page. There's a bunch of extra space that I would like it to fill up but I don't know how.<br />
<br />
I got it into this state by going through the following article:<br />
<br />
https://wordribbon.tips.net/T009480_Changing_the_Number_of_Columns_in_the_Middle_of_a_Document.html<br />
<br />
That is to say, I'm switching between one column (for the Chapter title) and then two columns (for the body of each chapter). Page 3 (not shown) begins with "Chapter 2" in a single column.<br />
<br />
The instructions in the article tell me to put a continuous break where the body of the chapter ends, and then set the section after the break to single column. So I do that but it seems to have set the bottom for BOTH columns to be the same. I don't mind the
 second column ending half way down the page (that's just where it ends) but I'd like the column before that to continue down the page until it reaches the bottom margin.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to tell Word to stretch the second last column to the bottom of the page (where the bottom margin begins)?

<p>When you insert a Continuous section break, the columns are "balanced" on the page, as shown. You have a couple of options:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you enter a Next Page (or Odd Page/Even Page) break instead of Continuous, the columns won't be balanced.</li><li>There is also a Layout Option (at the bottom of <strong>File | Options | Advanced</strong>), "Don't balance columns at the start of Continuous sections." (This is a per-document setting.)</li></ol>
<p>Assuming you want to start a new page, (1) is what you want. I'm not sure when (2) would be appropriate for you, but if the columns aren't balanced, you won't be able to add anything more to the current page unless it's in the second column; anything below
 the section break would be on the next page anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What remains true is that columns are a section property, so you have to insert some kind of section break when you need to change the number of columns.</p>
