<h2>            FSX Fatal error mid flight</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have FSX and just installed it on my new computer. I have used FSX before so I'm no new to it but I keep running into this problem of Fatal error messages popping up mid flight and crashing the game. I use Windows 10 and have a 64 bit processor and
 a GTX 960 graphics card and a lot of RAM so in technical terms I should be clear but is there anything I can do to fix this? It is really discouraging to get 4 hours into a transatlantic flight and it crash on me.I've messed around with the graphic settings
 a bit but nothing seems to be working. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I also use FSX and can identify with your problem. &nbsp; Firstly, what is your error message? &nbsp;Secondly, your card is great but what are your specs on your CPU, Ram, monitor, etc. &nbsp; The processor is much more critical to FSX than the graphics card. &nbsp;As you know
 a program crash at any point in the game can be caused by a myriad of factors. &nbsp; All it takes is one conflict to crash FSX, whether a crash to desktop, a freeze, BSOD, black screen with/without sound, etc. &nbsp; So, it won't be easy to isolate the problem, even
 in a few steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, check the error message, preferably in your Event Viewer, at time of crash. &nbsp; It could give an indication as to how to go about dealing with it. &nbsp; However, in the meantime, just to help you along your flight path without having to restart the whole flight,
 periodically save the flight, say every 20-30 minutes. &nbsp; So, if there's a crash, you can just reload from that point and continue on. &nbsp; Not a solution by any means, but it will keep you going until you can identify where the problem is. &nbsp; The problem could
 be simple, such as lowering your settings, especially, autogen, scenery details, LOD radius, traffic, clouds, and even maybe removing any addon scenery and aircraft. &nbsp; You mention that you were flying transatlantic when this happened. &nbsp;Did you have the sim
 rate set to over 8X?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know - others with suggestions may chime in.</p>

            Ok so I have a 2 TB hard drive with an intel i5 Quad core @ 4x 3.50GHz/6MB L3 cashe. I have 8GB of installed RAM with room to add chips up to 64GB. I also have a 64 bit operating system, x64 bit based processor. I'm using my 55-56 inch Sony smart TV as
 a monitor. I have the frame rate at 40 and the global texture at ultra high. I'm running the screen resolution at 1920x1080x32. I have a bunch of the other settings at ultra high as well. any thoughts?

            I Also forgot to add that the error message said fatal error Microsoft flight simulator has reached a fatal error FSX &nbsp;is automatically restarting. It cuts out the most over water and flying out of KDEN.

            <p>Maybe you've haven't had the opportunity to fly and therefore get the error message (which will be useful in noting which is the faulting module), in any case, your specs are more than adequate to run FSX at least at the default aircraft/scenery level and
 higher. &nbsp; And as you mentioned, that you have used FSX on your previous computer without any problems. &nbsp; I assume that your TV monitor hasn't been a cause for errors in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the FSX program, I would run chkdsk for any errors, clean up the drive and defragment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In FSX (for testing purposes): &nbsp;remove any added on scenery or aircraft (except installed Afcad scenery files or airline skins).</p>
<p>In your FSX Settings: &nbsp; reduce all your settings under each of the five tabs to default. &nbsp;Then adjust the following in each tab:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Graphics</span>: &nbsp;Target Frame Rate (30); &nbsp;Filtering &amp; Global Texture Resolution (your choice); &nbsp;only tick Adv. Animations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Aircraft</span>: &nbsp;Untick Aircraft casts shadows on itself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scenery</span>: &nbsp;LOD (your choice); &nbsp;Mesh complexity (80-100); &nbsp;Mesh Resolution (38 m); &nbsp;Texture Resolution (1 m); &nbsp;Water Effects (High 1.x or low 2.x); &nbsp;Scenery Complexity (as low as you can go for now); &nbsp;Autogen
 Density (Normal or Sparse for now); Special Effects (your choice).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Weather</span>: &nbsp;Cloud Draw Distance (Low); &nbsp;Cloud Detail (Detailed Clouds, Medium to High)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Traffic</span>: &nbsp;Airline traffic (&lt;40%); &nbsp;GA traffic (&lt;10%); &nbsp;Airport Vehicle Density (Medium to High); &nbsp;Road Vehicles (10 -20%).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to your FSX Configuration File (fsx.cfg) located here: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Drive:\Users\yourName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\FSX</p>
<p>(you will find two fsx.cfg files: &nbsp;one .cfg and the other .cfg.txt). &nbsp; Delete the .cfg file: &nbsp;FSX will rebuild a new one when you start FSX. &nbsp; However, you will lose any specially mapped controls, etc., so you may want to note all that down).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start FSX to rebuild a new cfg file and shut FSX down again. &nbsp; Go back into your fsx.cfg file in the above location and do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that your Display Device has only one entry, unless you are using Directx 10, then you will have two entries.</p>
<p>Under Graphics, add the line "HIGHMEMFIX=1" (without quotes). &nbsp;Aces team forgot to include this entry.</p>
<p>Under Display, WideViewAspect=True (since you're using a TV).</p>
<p>There are other tweaks, but generally they cause more problems than they are worth.</p>
<p>Also, your Nvidia card can be configured, either through their Control Panel or via Nvidia Inspector (can be downloaded for more settings), but not for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's it for setting up FSX to give you a flight at minimal to average settings. &nbsp;If you still get a mid-flight crash, then there must be another conflict with your hardware, which will take a lot more time to isolate. &nbsp; There are also guides published
 for setting up FSX and dealing with CTDs, etc., but we'll see how you go with the above for now.</p>

<p>Do games that are installed on the console's hard drive work normally, or do they exhibit the same behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option you might want to consider is a factory reset, keeping your games &amp; apps installed. You can do that at Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Console Info -&gt; Reset console -&gt; Keep my games &amp; apps.</p>

<p>Hello Yonce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with games not wanting to start. Sometimes it can be caused from a software update that was unsuccessful. You can try doing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft factory reset</a> and see if that helps. When prompted select reset and keep my games and apps.</p>
<p>*******<strong>very important please make sure you know the log in information for the account*****</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason for knowing account details is the profile does get taken off the console, as does the save data. As long as you have an Xbox live subscription the save data is saved on the cloud also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            You will need to reinstall your profile. If anyone else has installed their profile to your console (remember, it is against the Xbox Live Code of Conduct to give account information to another user so they can use it), they will be able to add it back
 the next time they use the console.

    <title>Xbox Account issues.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> socialbadge7943  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Account issues....</h2>
                    
<p>So here's my problem: There is an email attached to my Xbox Live profile (gamertag) that doesn't exist, so I can't 'recover password' or anything to access and change it, and I don't remember/know the password either. What I'm worried about is if I ever
 have to transfer my profile, I won't be able to do it because I won't have the password, and I can't get the password, either. So I'm wondering if microsoft would let me change it (if I somehow proved the gamertag was mine, which I know I can, and will do
 to the best of my abilities) or if I'm screwed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I've asked something like this before, but it wasn't answered very well at all, and I'm incredibly worried because I've had this gamertag for three or something years, and the possibility of losing it so easily
<em>really</em> bothers me.</p>

<p>You have an insane amount of hoops to jump through on this one. It's doable, but for many it would be easier to just start fresh.</p>
<p>Unless there's download content you don't want to pay for again it may be better to just make a new account.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there's a lengthly process to go through.</p>
<p>I don't have the link handy, but there are others that do, they can post the link to get you started if you want to go down that road.</p>

<p>Hi WMP is just a player - settings may need adjusting or you may need to run some fixes.</p>
<p>More importantly... is all your music showing as you would expect in your 'Music' folder?</p>
<p>Check to see if it will play from there and report back... Thanks, R.</p>

            Yes, the music is still present in the folder. and when I want to play a song, it will play on media player, but it does not recognize the song.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the extra info - it's not unusual for an update to disrupt WMP settings. Just check in the first instance that the correct folder location (usually 'My Music' in W7 - example is W10) is showing under 'manage libraries' etc. as shown here.... If
 not click 'Add' to locate and select (then 'OK')</p>

<h2>            Getting random Windows 10 Crashes when playing games</h2>
                    <p>Hey!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started getting BSOD and Random crashes (where BSOD isn't even shown but computer just reboots) and can't, for the life of me, figure out what the issue is. I've only experienced this when I am playing computer games (World of Warcraft, Apex Legends
 etc.) and I have made sure that my drivers are up to date. Looking in the event view I am getting the following error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x00000101 (0x0000000000000018, 0x0000000000000000, 0xffffb7015df4b180, 0x0000000000000006).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching a bit on google without getting any real answers I thought I would try my luck here. I've done a driver verifier test and wasn't even able to get on the computer without going into safe mode and manually resetting the verifier in CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea what this could be and maybe some advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Christoffer</p>

            Hi Christoffer, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Christoffer
<br />
<br />I am sorry, I cannot get any meaningful read from that Mini-dump file, because Driver Verifier is still enabled . . .
<br />
<br />Can you please disable Driver Verifier, then let your system crash again, then upload any new minidump file(s) created and I will analyze those for you . . .

<p>Hello, I have a Toshiba Satellite 1110-S running Windows XP SP2and recently I have been getting a error every time I open Windows Media player. When I open media player the computer beeps and the screen gets all grainy and I get this error "The driver ati2dvag
 for the display device\Device\Video0 got stuck in an infinitive loop. This usually indicates a problem with the device itself or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly. Please check with your device vendor for any driver updates." Error

<p>What does this mean? Do I need a driver update and were do&nbsp;I get one?? This is an older laptop&nbsp;</p>

            Why have you not updated/upgraded from SP2 to SP3? In addition to being wide open to security issues, SP3 fixes problems. Perhaps it will fix yours.<br />

 Media player 9 series though when I upgrade. I'll tell you how it works out.

<p>yes you can - you just cant get it from windows updates - i see from another thread someone has already given you instructions but here's a better link (should go straight into download)</p>

<p>i&nbsp;doubt it - my bet is you attempted to get them from a site other than AMD</p>

<p><span>I reserved my Xbox One Day One Edition immediately after announcement and as I looked for a solution to connect it to I finally settled on a projector. So I have been snooping ways of dealing with the issue of having the console ~10' and about 25'
 of cord away. I have been real interested in how others have done it with the 360 along with researching the differences with the new system and dealing with those.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Now I am well aware my setup will not go as planned, so until I get everything together, this is just a starting point.</span><br />

<span>I believe I have settled on a Viewsonic PJD7820HD, which I will mount on the wall directly across from the wall I project to. It will be against the ceiling (8'), but on a shelf. I am in an apartment and I am not certain the manager would appreciate me
<span>I believe I have settled on a Viewsonic PJD7820HD, which I will mount on the wall directly across from the wall I project to. It will be against the ceiling (8'), but on a shelf. I am in an apartment and I am not certain the manager would appreciate me
 scarring his ceilings. My screen will be against the wall ~10' away(walls are 11'7" apart) and I will project ~80"X45" screen with the top of it running along my ceiling. That leaves plenty of room for a piece of furniture I have to go under it that is 30"
 high. (resembles a triple dresser, but it isn't)</span><br />
<br />
<span>Now, as usual, there are a ton of things that can go wrong here and I am trying to anticipate them as much as possible. The projector is backordered and it could be awhile before I get the money altogether and actually receive it to start my nightmare.

 Couple of things I have concern over;</span><br />
<span>a.) If my calculations are correct a 6' person can be no further than 4' from the back wall before their melon will get in the way of the projector while playing a Kinect game. Does anyone know anything I can do to give more room and is this correct?</span><br />

<br />
<span>b.) will it be difficult to mount the kinect to a flat wooden surface? Will I be able to get a 25' USB3.0 extension, will it require a repeater, and will lag become a problem?</span><br />

<p>No way. That is why I went projector. A TV can't touch the things you can do with the projector. I started out looking at TVs until it became abundantly clear it was foolish to pay more for an inferior product. A 100" TV would be much worse and cost a ton
 more.</p>

<p>And that doesn't apply to the question anyhow, if you want a TV, go for it. I am posing a question for people who have experience doing this. Those that have projectors know why I ask and also know the benefits of it.</p>

<p>Yeah sorry I'm trying to find an article but it's vanished lol it's about distances of kinect and it have a broader range, but I think you'd be fine.</p>
<p>Could you mount the projector to the ceiling? and it depends what kind of Kinect games you are playing too, not many games will use your full-body unless you have kids around and you are playing Kinect Adventures or the dancing games etc.</p>

<p>i have a tv and am looking at a similar problem with the cable.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>the rumor is kinect 2.0 will be usb 3.0. but this hasnt actually been confirmed. what we do know for certain is it uses a propriety connection. thats going to make extensions difficult.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i also dont really know much about usb 3.0. someone did point me to a 10m cable for $110. supposedly you can chain 2 together, it has a power adapter to power it as well, which should alleviate the concerns on length. but for someone who would need 2 cables,
 unless the kinect 2.0 cable is very long (15' or so) thats a lot of money to spend on something that may not work.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>all in all i think the kinect 2.0 with usb 3.0 was a bad decision. they really should have went cat 6 with a separate power adapter.</p>

<p>Ya, the projector I am getting is $700 so I just don't see the sense in paying that or more for a bulky ol' TV. The tech headache is actually a bit of fun to me TBH, but just looking for other savvy owners and ideas. And I do plan to mount the projector
 right up against the ceiling(part of the TL;DR), but there appears to be other tricks that apply as well. I think you can use keystone correction and other things. Don't know though, was hoping someone here would.</p>

<p>I thought USB 3.0 was actually confirmed. That means I will have to wait even longer for answers. But asyou can see, I found the cable on Amazon. But I don't know how the Kinect will be set up and I don't know if the repeater is necessary(one without is
 far cheaper) or maybe for some reason the repeater won't work with it, or even if the distance has other possible hangups.</p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live&#58; Accessing Product Keys for Previous Purchases</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; I know this is a little late but I was trying to play Tinker and though I can get Games for Windows Live to download, it's asking me for my product key.&nbsp; While this was a free game, it did have a key attached, and without the server connecting, I
 can't see a way to get access.&nbsp; I really want to finish that last achievement.&nbsp; I figure I'll probably have other keys there as well as I look into my back catalog, and would love to find out how to get a doc with all of these product keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the error when trying to access the product key via "All Downloads" on the GFWL program is: "There was an error retrieving your purchase history.&nbsp; Please sign out and try again later."&nbsp; Which I'm sure is because the server is down, but I figure
 this purchase history has to be backed up somewhere else as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for the reply! &nbsp;I called in yesterday and they said that apparently nobody has access to any of that information anymore and all of the purchase info made from the games for windows live marketplace was scrapped. &nbsp;So any games purchased through
 that service are just unplayable now. :(

            Okay, so, troubleshooting says to contact system administrator, cannot fix<br />
network issue.&nbsp; Troubleshooting also states printer is turned off, but it<br />
is not and does not appear under devices.&nbsp; Printer is connected, however,<br />
if I try to print something, I am prompted to install a printer.&nbsp; When I go<br />
to devices to install printer, this is the error message I receive "Windows<br />
can't open Add Printer. Access is denied."&nbsp; Any other changes I attempt to<br />
make, I receive, "Access denied."<br />
<br />
32-bit, logged in as Administrator, Microsoft Security Essentials 4.10.209.0<br />
<br />
So, how it all began was that it appeared I had multiple and duplicate<br />
identities/accounts ??? linked to my homegroup with a variety of<br />
permissions.&nbsp; Like an idiot, I decided I would get rid of or attempt to<br />
change those permissions and in essence, I believe I changed my own<br />
permissions which restrict my ability as the administrator to perform<br />
certain tasks, ex. Add Printer.<br />
<br />
I am identified as being a part of a "workgroup", however, the network<br />
states "homegroup."&nbsp; I don't know whether that makes a difference or not.<br />
And, the home network only consists of my personal computer connected<br />
directly to the modem, my lap top and my wife's laptop.&nbsp; Occasionally yet<br />
rarely will someone else connect to the network and I only want to allow<br />
those individuals to have access to the printer.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what<br />
I have done, at this point.&nbsp; I occasionally have issues with my printer and<br />
I have recently changed internet providers wherein another network had to<br />
be created.<br />
<br />
I hope some of this information helps with a diagnosis.&nbsp; I certainly don't<br />
want to send anyone barking up the wrong tree.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />

            <p>It sounds like you're a victim of the "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" syndrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without knowing exactly what you did, the straightforward thing to do at this point is to create a new user account -- assuming that you retain enough "administrator" rights to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the instructions here under "My computer is in a workgroup" -- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you can't get past step 2 because you don't have administrator rights, see the advice below</li><li>In the short paragraph under "Copy files to the new user profile," you'll see the admonition that you "must have at least three user accounts on the computer to complete these steps, including the new account you just created."&nbsp; You should ALWAYS have an
 extra account with "administrator" rights that you rarely use (so it has a low probability of becoming corrupted).&nbsp; The standard advice is that for maximum safety, your everyday account should be a "Standard user" account, but not everyone follows that advice.&nbsp;
 No matter whether your everyday account is a "Standard user" or an "administrator," you should have a spare "administrator" account.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have an uncorrupted "administrator" account, you'll have to activate the built-in account named "Administrator."&nbsp; By default, Windows 7 keeps this account disabled.&nbsp; Without "administrator" rights, however, it's a bit tricky to activate the
 "Administrator" account.&nbsp; Do you have a Windows 7 "system repair disc"?&nbsp; Do you have a Windows 7 installation DVD?&nbsp; If you don't have either of these, all is still not lost.&nbsp; If you're in this position, post back for further instructions.</p>

            <p>P.S.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A "workgroup" is what Microsoft calls a <span>peer-to-peer local area network.&nbsp; This is what virtually all home users of Windows computers have.&nbsp; The alternative is a "domain network," in which there is a central "domain server" computer,
 usually managed by a network administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>"HomeGroup" is a feature that Microsoft introduced with Windows 7.&nbsp; It is a simplified method of creating a local area network.&nbsp; A "HomeGroup" and a "workgroup" are very similar but not identical (which is
 why the same collection of Windows 7 computers may be identified as belonging both to a workgroup and a HomeGroup).&nbsp; See
</span><a href="http://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/networking-basic/differences-between-workgroup-and-homegroup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/networking-basic/differences-between-workgroup-and-homegroup.html</a>

<p>
</p><p>If you want someone to be able to access your printer over your network but not able to access files on your two laptops, that can be done (NOT with the HomeGroup), but let's leave that until your current problem is sorted out.</p>

            <p>Well, yes, I am definitely my own worst enemy.&nbsp; I was able to create new Admin and Standard User accounts.&nbsp; I also already had a guest account that was not turned on.&nbsp; So, I now have four user accounts, actually five, one being "Public."&nbsp; Logged into new

            <p>You need to be logged on as an "administrator" user to copy files from one user account to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you actually create an account named "Public" or are you just looking at Windows Explorer?&nbsp; Having an account named "Public" will cause you a fair amount of confusion, because by default Windows 7 comes with a set of "Public" folders (in Windows XP,
 these used to be called "All Users").&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65882b42-c1f2-4494-9503-fbb8b047b295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65882b42-c1f2-4494-9503-fbb8b047b295" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assume that you have the following accounts (Guest should remain "off")</p>
<p>
</p><p>OldTed (administrator)&nbsp; (corrupt in some way)</p>
<p>OldKids (standard user)</p>
<p>NewTed (administrator)</p>
<p>NewKids (standard user)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do is to create yet another new administrator account, for example, SpareAdmin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An advisable step omitted from the Microsoft instructions (sorry, I forgot to mention this earlier) is to log into and out of each of the new accounts before you copy the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into SpareAdmin and copy the files from OldTed to NewTed (except for the the 3 Ntuser files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think that the OldKids account was also corrupted in some way, copy the files from OldKids to NewKids.&nbsp; You can do this while logged into either NewTed or SpareAdmin</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to whether you were successful or not, log out of all accounts, then log back in to NewTed.&nbsp; Are your files where you expect them to be, e.g., in My Documents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you add a printer while logged in as NewTed (which, after all, was the point of this exercise)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once things have settled down and you're certain that all the files are properly in their new accounts, go back to Control Panel &gt; User Accounts (<strong>while logged in as NewTed</strong>) and delete OldTed and OldKids.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp; you like, after that, you can use Windows Explorer to delete whatever remains of the file structure relating to those two old accounts under C:\Users.</p>

<p>sounds like the software program needs updating. Is that software compatible with Windows 7?</p>
<p>Also, check and make sure nothing is currently running that may interfere with the installation.</p>
<p>Have you tried running the installation from safe mode?</p>

<p>I would also suggest contacting the manufacturer Plustek as the error message suggests.</p>

            Hi Eddie,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I´ve updated the program´s software, but I still receive the same error message while running set-up. I tried to unpack the included cab files, but get an error message ´unable to open`, ´this file might be encrypted, corrupt, outdated´ ..., ´no valid&nbsp;archiv&nbsp;file´.
 I tried to send a report of the error message and a only&nbsp;blank&nbsp;page occurs while loading continues. In safe mode the problem still occurs and loading the safe mode get stuck. I seriously think this program has to be corrupt or incompatible and yet I´ve no
 clue how to fix it. Thanks for your help.</div>

                    <div>
<p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>I am currently on a standard account on Windows 10 typing this. I've accidentally deleted my one and only administrator account. Now this is how it went - I disabled the hidden administrator account via cmd in administrator mode, and it totally slipped my
 mind to create an administrator account before disabling the hidden one. I didn't do that, and I passed through the administrator credentials login thing because the hidden administrator account was then active, disabled it, and then it hit me - so I would
 love some help on this. Do I just need to factory reset my laptop? Will Windows 10 still be installed if I do? Is there any other way that I can recover my administrator account without factory resetting it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>PS: If this helps, my laptop is a Toshiba Satellite C-850 13D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            Hi there I don't know if I mentioned this in my question, but I am stuck on a standard account, there are no administrator accounts on my computer at this point in time. I only had the hidden administrator account active, and then I disabled it without
 making another administrator account.

<h2>            Web Cam</h2>
                    <p>Hi there everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an unknown, (Japanese/Chinese) web cam.&nbsp; When I plug it into the usb port, the four lights light up, but nothing else happens.&nbsp; I tried contacting a friend on Facebook using it, and the webcam came up with a line through it.&nbsp; I'm having to resort
 to just headphones and a mic, but no-one can "see" me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a plug in and play type of webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can anyone help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

</p><p>Yes, I could see my webcam in device manager.</p>
<p>So when I clicked on your link, it came up as "Hardware and Devices" - "Detecting Problems".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It finally then said</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC camera doesnt have a driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see my device listed.</p>
<p>

    <title>Display blinks after color calibration in Windows 10 Pro 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabimarian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display blinks after color calibration in Windows 10 Pro 1809</h2>
                    <p>Hello people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading my Win 10 Pro to 1809 version on a Latitude 6440 laptop, the display starts to blink everytime I'm inserting/extracting an USB device. This is not the type of blink made by the default windows visual notification, but it's something that
 looks like the blink you see when you disconnect an external monitor/tv via HDMI or like a display with imperfect connection.</p>
<p>This happens always after I calibrate my display from the Color Calibration tool from Windows and suddenly the display make a short blink and then keeps doing like that when inserting/extracting usb devices on any port. After restart, the problem disappears,
 but for a short time, since it appears again after a short period of time.</p>
<p>The graphic card driver is up to date, and the laptop has a moderate use with less stress on the graphics.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
<p />

            Hi Gabi
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />I noticed there are some other important updates for this model I recommend you apply to see if it improves stability.
<br />
<br />BIOS Update October 2018
<br />
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05250268M/1/E6440A23.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER05250268M/1/E6...</a>
<br />
<br />Chipset January 2019
<br />
<br /><a href="https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03709265M/3/Chipset_Driver_GH5T3_WN32_10.1.1.18_A04_01.EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloads.dell.com/FOLDER03709265M/3/Ch...</a>
<br />
<br />Apply these updates to see if they help.
<br />
<br />If you continue to experience further problems. 
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />

            Hi,  GabiMarian
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Hello Andre and many thanks for your time.</p>
<p>I've already updated everything on this laptop (including BIOS).</p>
<p>Also reinstalled the driver and installed an older version for the graphic card and worked ok till I did a calibration.</p>
<p>Before the Windows upgrade everything worked just fine so I'm suspecting there is something wrong with it.</p>

            Some users have been reporting problems with the new version of Windows 10. Its possible you might have to rollback to your previous version and stick with it for the time being. 
<br />
<br />Here is how you do that:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Did that already but the symptom comes back after calibration.</p>
<p>Also found that if I remove the usb receiver of the mouse while I am in the calibration menu the colors and gamma goes back to default and came back to what I've set after moving the gamma slider a bit.</p>
<p>Today I've spoke to a friend from a local pc&amp;laptop service and he told me that he had some serious problems with many customers pcs after last upgrade of Windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm very sure that before this upgrade my pc worked just fine with the display calibrated just from the first day of use.</p>
<p>

            Hi Trainfoodx,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Your information seems to be a bit conflicting.
<br />
<br />
<br />1.  If i go to settings , there is no WIFI option
<br />2. The wifi symbol always has a red cross on it.
<br />
<br />It can be either 1 or 2. Which of it is true?
<br />
<br />Secondly, Right click Start&gt;Device Manager.
<br />Expand Network Adapters and take a snip and post in the next reply?
<br />
<br />Third,
<br />What is the make and model of the computer?

<h2>            What happened to the default games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently upgraded to Windows 7, but since I went from Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit&nbsp;to Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, I was forced to reinstall and lose all my old programmes. My only problem is that the default&nbsp;"Games" folder that came with the&nbsp;Windows
 7 installation&nbsp;is completely empty, other than "Game Explorer" which also has nothing in it. Every previous version of Windows I've ever had has always come with default games like Solitair and Minsweeper. So is there any good reason that I have none now?
 Is it meant to be like this? Is there some update I'm meant to install? Is there somewhere I can&nbsp;get the default games?</p>

            Not at no cost - the free upgrade offer expired nearly a year ago. But you can pick up a Win 10 disk and do the upgrade. Just make sure you back up any documents, pictures, etc. before you start the upgrade.<br />

<p>If the Windows 7 that you installed is a retail copy, then yes you can perform a free upgrade using the Windows 7 product key. If the Windows 7 is an OEM version that came with the PC, then you will have to purchase a Windows 10 licence . . .</p>

    <title>Video encoding stuck at 0&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kojiknight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video encoding stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    I normally record some gameplay footage in 720p, xvid for video codec and plain PCM for audio. When I reencode them to MP4 to upload to youtube, I have absolutely no issues and encodes are generally really snappy only taking 20 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
If however, I edit the video in any way (say, cutting the video down, making some portions play fast, etc) it will then forever be stuck at 0% when encoding. Despite being stuck, the program itself hasn't locked up AND it still eats up a good 30% of my CPU
 and accessing my main HDD at about 25MB/s.<br />

            <p>That's typical when you use a video file made with a codec that Movie Maker doesn't get along well iwith..... the xvid codec is of them. Convert the xvid files to something that works better... such as WMV... before using them in a project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Movie Maker as a conversion tool when files go into them OK but issues happen when I try to edit them or save an edited project with them included.</p>

            The problem is that I don't want to constantly add an extra step to the process as this would significantly effect turn around (adding 20-30 minutes to every video, which I pump out several a day).<br />
<br />
My recording software is fairly limited as well but I'd rather stick with it if possible. Does Movie Maker have a similar problem with MPEG1 video? My only other choice besides that would be motion JPEG.<br />

            Your results will vary by the computer and the codecs on them.... motion JPG and MPEG 1 files usually work for me... do a test of each kind before committing your process.
<div><br />
<div>If you can't use the option of conversions before putting files in a Movie Maker project, you should move on to using other video editing software.&nbsp;</div>

            You might consider using something like Freemake Video Converter which can utilize the CUDA cores of certain GPUs to speed up the encoding.&nbsp; As noted by PJ, if you convert to .wmv, Movie Maker should be able to easily handle the speed-up effects and other
 trims that you&nbsp;are making.

    <title>Windows 8 keeps changing the time of my clock - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 keeps changing the time of my clock</h2>
                    I like my clock to be five minutes fast so that I don't run late for anything, but every time I set the clock five minutes fast, the computer will reset it when I re boot. I DO NOT want the computer to update the time automatically, but I can't find the
 settings to change it anywhere!

You really do need to update the time.&nbsp; If you dont things will break like networking and it may even think your copy of win 8 is not genuine.<br />
<br />
You can stop it from updating the time under date &amp; time&gt;Internet time&gt;change settings&gt;uncheck&nbsp; synchronize with internet time.<br />
