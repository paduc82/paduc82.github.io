<h2>            I&#39;ve tried everything&#33; WMDC won&#39;t connect</h2>
                    
<p>About 2 weeks ago, WMDC just out of the blue stopped recognizing my device, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the program, 4 times, hard reset my ATT Tilt about the same. I've disabled my firewall completely, disabled
 my virus software...and almost everything else I could find on the net to help me troubleshoot. Let me say at first I'm not the most computer literate person in the world, but if someone could walk me throughs ome otehr troubleshooting steps I'd appreciate
 it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't do anything to my computer or my device. No programs were added or removed or nothing. I'm lost and I've been without sync ability for damn near 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do? Can anyone help? PLEASE?</p>

<p>I mean absoloutely nothing. I don't get a tone on my phone saying it's connected, I don't get a tone on my computer neither. I did the check/uncheck advanded network functionality thing, and&nbsp;my firewall is down completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do get the yellow light on my device saying it's charging from the USB connection though, so&nbsp;I know the cable works. Where I'm at right now, it HAS to be Vista, and short of rebooting the computer from factory settings I don't know what to
 do. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the exact same issue. My device used to connect/sync fine and two weeks ago it just stopped - just like the other user here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know where the phone would be shown in device manager. The Windows Mobile adapter is there under Network Adapters (I have already tried deleting that and letting the drivers reinstall) but which 'heading' should i look at to&nbsp;find the
 smart phone?</p>

<p>Same problem, here. It used to be that if I ended the&nbsp;partnership, then it would see the phone the next time I plugged it in. That stopped working, today. I removed and then reinstalled WMDC and it worked: once. Then the same problem is back.&nbsp; There isdefinitely
 something wrong and I hope someone at Microsoft has some useful hints in debugging this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it fails, there is nothing in device manager (because the device is simply not seen). Plugging the same phone with the same cable into a second machine works, so it's not the phone. When one USB port fails, they all fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help please. It's really hard to do device driver development on a phone that you cannot connect to!</p>

<p>Hi Joe - it's fair to say that MS has downgraded WMP with the (general) decline in disc use and the introduction of their new pet 'Groove Music' - however WMP should still perform basic music disc functions like playback and ripping. Getting it to burn discs
 these days can be a bit troublesome!</p>
<p>You say you upgraded to W10 - presumably this&nbsp;PC was on an earlier OS when purchased... if you are having problems using WMP it may be because the upgrade has not gone smoothly.</p>
<p>Are you actually able to access WMP? Cheers, Ric.</p>

Other functions work, such as announcement of calendar events.

            Hello. Just for clarification, are you trying to change the default activation button? The default activation button is the "media net" button (second from left on the bottom of the keyboard). When you press that you should get the microphone icon to pop
 up and two tone prompt to say something. From what I have read, ATT security locked alot of the functionality and the ability to install 3rd party apps. You should visit a Jack or ATT forum to see if you can remap the buttons.

    <title>Nokia 6210 Navigator Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 6210 Navigator Crashing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was just wondering if anyone else is also experiencing so many problems with the Nokia 6210 Navigator. If my MP3 Player is running while I'm downloading, the phone will crash &amp; shut down, the GPS loses signal, I cannot install Nokia OVI Maps 3, Th phone
 loses signal while I'm on the internet, etc. Does anyone know where I can get a changelog for the Nokia Firmwares? I'm currently using v05.501 &amp; I'm still experiencing the problems... Nokia Maps v3 doesn't want to install either?</p>

<p>The crashing whilst more than one app is running is probably a shortage of memory (just like when WIndows runs out of virtual memory and freezes). If it hasn't always done it, it could be a build-up of apps, system files, etc. over time - if that is the
 case, backup up personal data from phone memory using PC or Ovi Suite, reformat the device with *#7370# then restore the data leaving out Settings and you should see an improvement in performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signals dropping during internet connections are more often network issues than phone - if you are in an area where your network has a weaker 3G signal it might be switching often between GPRS and 3G, and in the process the connection can be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Maps Updater which is used to install Maps 3.01 has been down of late, if you are getting the "unable to read device" error then it is the server issue and not a problem with your phone. Nokia should have this fixed shortly.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm using my phone as a modem via cable. The problem is if I listen MP3 files on my phone while I'm using it as a modem, the player scratches, accelerates and make crackling and pop sounds. The problem is that there are no other applications running
 &amp; it cannot be an out-of-memory problem, because the MP3 player alone cannot use up 128mb of RAM. I had a Samsung SGH-E340E (EDGE version) and with this phone I could play MP3's while using it as a modem via bluetooth (It's actually doing 3 things at once).
 This was a damn old phone and it didn't crash or make crackling sounds if I used the MP3 player while downloading via Bluetooth (internet 2 PC via bluetooth). The Nokia 6210 Navigator is a lot newer and supposed to be a lot faster and to me it sucks. Even
 if I'm using it on EDGE only, the MP3 player would still do the same thing. I've updated to the latest firmware v05.501 (there's no applications installed yet). Why can a very old phone which is not even Symbian outperform a SmartPhone (unless the smartphone
 is **bleep**)?</p>
<p>Here are my experiences, but I don't know what to do (phone related as well as company quality related):<br />
1.) After I updated my phone's firmware using Nokia Software Updater, the phone was dead, completely dead... I had to use a non-Nokia application to recover it (it took me 2 minutes &amp; wasn't possible using Nokia's Software Updater).<br />
2.) My phone crashes quickly if I play MP3's while browsing the interent via cable or bluetooth...<br />
3.) The phone loses signal (not network related, my friend's 6110 doesn't do it in the same area)...<br />
4.) I have problems using Nokia Maps Updater - it tells me "Cannot get enough information about the phone [3].". The customer support cannot help me on this, it looks like the problem isn't going to be fixed very soon as it's been like this for more than a
 month now.<br />
5.) My GPS loses signal every damn 5 minutes.<br />
6.) My phone doesn't have a timer or a stopwatch?<br />
7.) The phone's audio starts clipping if I use the preset equalizers. My older Samsung had a lot better audio.<br />
8.) If I take a photo, it makes a black spot over the image in the left corner, until I close the image and re-open it... Software bug maybe?</p>
<p>Every alternative solution I tried just simply results in another failure. These are just some of the problems I have.</p>
<p>If I update the phone's firmware, are the Symbian OS updated as well? I see in the "About" Menu it shows "Symbian Copyright 2010"? If I downgrade the firmware, it still shows "Symbian Copyright 2010" - so this means you cannot reverse the OS update? Why
 does it show year 2010?</p>

<p>Yes - the 1st time I've started to experience problems I contacted their customer support (via e-mail)&nbsp;and the told me to update the phone software via Nokia Software Updater. After this, the phone was dead (I didn't yet at this stage knew I could recover
 it myself using JAF, but I don't wat to void any warranties). Then I was forced to take the phone to a Nokia Carepoint where they recovered it for me. Here I told them about the MP3 player problem, but they told me that I should be doing only 1 thing at a
 time and that they cannot do anything about it... For the GPS losing signal, they updated the Nokia Maps&nbsp;from v2.0 to v2.0XX&nbsp;(it came with the new Firmware as I understood), but the firmware update didn't solve any problem. The audio that clips when the equalizers
 are used, the rep just adjusted the bass (low frequencies) until it stops clipping, but then the sound doesn't sound very good. And, for the image showing a black spot in the upper corner after taking a photo, they told me it's a known problem and I should
 report it to Customer Support (which doesn't make sense to me, because I can't think how they would'nt know this - or actually, no I can... If they can take 2 months to fix a bug in Nokia Maps Updater then the could probably take a&nbsp;year in fixing a firmware
 bug :-)). I still can't get it, the MP3 player story bugs me a lot and it doesn't sound like there's much to do about&nbsp;it - rather not to playing MP3 audio while downloading from the internet sounds awful. This phone can make a phonecall while using a camera
 without a problem (video calling).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I should maybe just accept it and not confuse myself anymore and in the future just look another way. :-)</p>

    <title>Expired password on synced account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kine2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expired password on synced account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>today we are in situation, that all admin accounts into our O365 are telling us that "Password Expired" and we are forwarded to change password page. But I cannot change the password, because it is telling us that it is not allowed (yes, because we ae using
 AAD Connect to sync our AD to AAD with passwords). Now, we are in situation that no admin can open the O365 admin page to check the "Never expires" in password policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we can do? Changing password on my PC in our domain does not help, because the password is not synced to AAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible cause of the problem: our admin accounts were created manually in O365 before we synced the domain. After the sync, the accounts were connected with our AD accounts through email addresses. Seems that the "Never expires" was not checked by the process
 and O365 still have expiration date on our domain accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I correct that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info:</p>
<p>I can login into office 365 outlook etc. but not Admin portal</p>
<p>I can login into Azure portal with the domain, but there is no task to reset password or set the Password Never Expire</p>
<p>I cannot change properties of the AAD connect app, because I cannot login as O365 admin (Password expired).</p>

            <p>Hi Kine2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try removing the admin accounts from the sync. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will turn those accounts into cloud accounts and you should be able to reset the password.</p>

            Hmm, seems that it removed the user from Office 365. I was not able to login with the account anymore and request for "forgotten" password ended with "Unknown account".

            <p>Interesting is, that in documentation it is written, that when the sync is enabled for the account, the Password Never Expire is set. But still our accounts expired...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Research:</p>
<p>Try:&nbsp;Moved my account in AD to different OU, which is not synchronized</p>
<p>Result: Cannot login into O365 nor request lost password because account unknown =&gt; sync is working</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try: Move my account in AD back to the OU with sync</p>
<p>Result: Can login into O365 but not Admin portal (when reentering password, it tells me that it expired) =&gt; Sync is working but is not syncing password (still have original one on O365 even when I changed password in AD yesterday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something wrong with the accounts which were linked when Sync was enabled and the account already existed in O365 (was linked through email address in AAD and AD). How to force PwdSync for such an account?</p>
<p />

            <p>Solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem was in missing AD permissions for account under which the AAD Connect was running. It had no AD Replication permissions and there is only INFORMATION message in Event log with the error inside it. Thanks to this the sync will not even set the Password
 Never expire on the O365 account and was not syncing passwords correctly. </p>

            Sounds like this is display driver problem. Try updating Windows to see if installs a new driver. Failing that go into the device manager and update your video card driver that way.

Right click on an open area of the desktop screen this will bring up a menu, click on display setting, then click on advanced display setting and change the resolution, this should work if not then you will need to look for a different driver as posted above.&nbsp;

            Right click in the screen and click "change display". &nbsp;Scroll down to Advanced Display Settings and reduce the resolution so you can get to the Start button. &nbsp;Click Settings and go to Windows Update and see if a graphics driver shows up after you ask for

            <p>There's your first mistake, thinking Win10 is an upgrade.</p>
<p>It's a overblown tablet operating system that reduces your capabilites for control and customization so that it can also run on phones that nobody outside of microsoft employees own... Yikes.</p>
<p>Win7 is probably the last 'microsoft' operating system that I'll own or use.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Message that skype video app (integrated) giving me is :</p>
<p>
</p><p>No video preview available .Your device might not have a camera ,camera disabled in privacy , or another app might already be using it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Than when I run regular camera app it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something went wrong , if you need it, here`s the error code : 0xA00F4246(0xE8010001)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than this glitch windows 10 runs very smoothly and I'm pretty much happy with it :)</p>

<p>The 3 files that you mentioned appear to be legitimate.</p>
<p>They are all associated with a driver for&nbsp;an Intel Graphics Adapter chip.</p>
<p>The actual files are all in the System32 folder.</p>
<p>The second location is for the kit26685.inf file, which is just a text file that is used&nbsp;for&nbsp;the Installation of the driver.</p>

<h2>            Grouping and Ungrouping on a field in a Pivot Table</h2>
                    
<p>Please help, I have been stuck on this for a long time and can't figure it out. I would like to group on a field that is in the 'column labels' area in a Pivot Table. I have a spreadsheet with Pivot Table previously created where this works fine. But when
 I create my own Pivot Table to recreate this, it does not work. The Group/Ungroup options are inactive (greyed out). I am looking at Pivot Table Tools/Options/Group. How do I create a Pivot Table that will allow Grouping on the field in 'column labels'?</p>
<p>Thank you for any information.</p>

    <title>Using Apple Time Machine with Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Apple Time Machine with Office 2016</h2>
                    
<p>How do you restore an old version of a contact, without storing the entire profile?</p>
<p>The back ground is we are mysteriously losing the notes section in contacts in Outlook. No idea why yet, no pattern to which contacts do this or when.</p>
<p>So I am using Apple Time machine to keep taking snap shots so I can flip back to an old version of the contacts. This is a short term fix that I hope will also help me find a pattern to what is going wrong with the deletions.</p>
<p>The problem is, I can find and recover old versions of a contact (drilling down to the hidden Outlook storage directories, searching for the contact name and evoking Time Machine). Also, I can see the recovered file has the correct content by looking at
 it with a hex editor, but I cannot get Outlook to except that one contact being loaded back in (complains about it not being part of the current profile).</p>
<p>It seems Outlook wants the entire profile recovered, not a single contact. I don’t want to recover the entire profile, because that’s tens of thousands of items. Just my one little contact would be fine.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how to do this?</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>I want to collect more details about how you make Outlook try loading back the recovered contact. Based on my knowledge, Outlook will start rebuild the entire database after performing an Apple Time Machine system restore.<br />
And when do you see the complain that it's not being part of the currect profle?</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp; ased on my knowledge, to back up only contacts, you can export the correct version to an OLM file or an PST file (requires a Windows machine for PST file). When problem occurs, import the file and replace it with the problematic folder.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry</p>

<p>&gt;And when do you see the complain that it's not being part of the correct profile?</p>
<p>I located the file that contained the contact (which is not easy, as Outlook gives it a funny name, has multiple versions and sticks it in directories that bear no relation to the names the human gets to see in Outlook, but it is possible to track down by
 searching for the name of the contact and looking at the date updated on the file).</p>
<p>I then used Time Machine to grab a copy of the contact as it was a few days ago and drop it onto the desktop. The file has a name like:
</p>
<p>BF45DC5D-6BD1-4530-8F10-5C6BA51EAB96.olk15Contact</p>
<p>I know it is the right file, even though it is heavy formatted, because I can rummage around in it with a hex editor and read the contents.
</p>
<p>I dropped the old one onto the desktop (not into the directory it came from because I want to compare it with the new one and selectively integrate the data). When I open that file with Outlook it complained about the profile.</p>
<p>&gt;you can export the correct version to an OLM file or an PST file</p>
<p>Yes I have been doing that, but I have to remember to do it manually, which is a pain. I want Time Machine to keep regular copies automatically, which it is doing nicely. The problem is Outlook won’t let me pull out part of the backup. I think it wants the
 full backup or nothing. Which I consider to be poor design. What if I was working on a disk recovery and not all the disk was recoverable? I should be able to pull back what I can and access as much of it as possible.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Restoring from Time Machine backup, Outlook restore the entire profile to recovered, not the single contact.</p>
<p>If you have Exported only contacts items from Outlook 2016 for Mac manually without using Time Machine backup then you can restore only contacts without restoring the entire profile.</p>

<p>You are right, Outlook won’t let you pull out part of the Time Machine backup. You can feedback about this design behavior. (In the upper right corner of Outlook, under the Search box, click the down arrow next to the smiley face.)</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>I have thoroughly checked thread details and all your test with action perform. From the description, I understand that you want to restore an old one&nbsp;contact without restoring the entire profile.</p>
<p>However, it's not feasible to restore only specific one contact. If you would like to request this feature, visit the
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Suggestion Box </a>to leave your feedback. Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we would truly appreciate your kind understanding.</p>

<h3> michal.g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 C API&#58; xlDefineBinaryName&#47;xlGetBinaryName do not seem to work</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am developing an Excel AddIn (XLL, C API). Recently I installed Excel 2010 and noticed that a piece of code which works fine under Excel 2007, fails under Excel 2010.</p>
<p>The problem is related to the xlDefineBinaryName/xlGetBinaryName commands. The former seems to work (at least it returns 0), the latter always returns error 15 (#VALUE!) or 42 (#N/A) under Excel 2010. You can try the following sequence of commands:</p>
<p>retCode = Excel12(xlDefineBinaryName, 0, 2, &amp;opName, &amp;opData);<br />
retCode = Excel12(xlGetBinaryName, &amp;opData, 1, &amp;opName);</p>
<p>The first command returns a success, the second one always fails. They both work fine under Excel 2007.</p>
<p>I know that early versions of Excel 2007 had the same issue (fixed in SP1). Is the issue back again?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Michal</p>

<p>The hot fix did fix my problem. My addin calls xlGetBinaryName to read custom data embedded in the workbook. It works fine for all Excel versions up to 2007. It didn't work in Excel 2010 until I installed the hot fix. It fixed the problem but then it introduced&nbsp;a
 serious problem with my addin. After installing the hot fix, Excel crashes when I try to close it.</p>

            1. Not sure why the Manage Folder option is disabled. Try to soft reset your device. 2. You will need to modify the registry to disable the threaded feature. Load a registry editor on your device and go to Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Inbox\Settings.

            When answering you need to use the reply button on your original question,&nbsp; also you need to put the subject in the subject line not your name, as for your problem remove the battery and the power adapter then hold the power button down for 10 sec's, plug
 in the power adapter with out the battery being installed see if the unit&nbsp;boots up, if it does then you can shut it down and reinstall the battery, this works for HP and Dell laptops.&nbsp;

                    I contacted my anti virus protection customer service, gave them remote access and they told me I had been hacked and that I hadn't protected my internet connection. He said csrss.exe was the problem. I've been noticing some issues with my computer for
 a few weeks, I know very little to nothing about computers&nbsp; so I am at a loss how to go about fixing this. I'm also not sure the customer service was legit.&nbsp; I read that this is a legitimate program for windows but if you show two its a virus. I do see two
 showing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I was lost when I read other threads on how to deal with it. I'm not computer saavy at all. I'm running windows 8

            Hi  Aamir, this is a big issue at the moment a lot of Outlook users are affected, this is expected to be fixed within the hour, a lot of users are reporting they can access their Email from their Mobile phone, but not their PC/Laptop . . .
<br />
<br />Latest &gt;&gt;
<br />Microsoft are seeing a few isolated incidents on a small portion of infrastructure that has received the fix and that did not work. They are analysing diagnostic data and service log files to identify why the fix was ineffective for some of their customers.
<br />

<h2>            Sharepoint notifications for an expiring password after password has been changed</h2>
                    <p>For beginning info we have a hybrid environment - we use on prem AD with Azure Sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We send out emails when password expiration is approaching. Users change password using ctrl+alt+delete, the password last set attribute is updated in AD, and the new password takes effect successfully. However, when visiting sharepoint users are still prompted
 that their password will expire in X despite this not being true. The date will come and go without any issues, but the notifications continue until the date then stop - again with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What needs to be changed to sync correctly so these notifications stop?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having problems for weeks being able to download pdfs, jpgs, and other attachments within Outlook email. &nbsp;Ever since being switched over to the new platform, this problem has existed. &nbsp;I spoke with tech support who tried to resolve for the better
 part of 2 hours and was basically told it was most likely a system problem and the techs were most likely working on it.... but three days later, I still have the same problems. Any help to resolve would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</p>

<li>Are you using a third party antivirus software?</li></ul>
<p>No</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Windows version are you using?</li></ul>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete and re-install an app from the Store</h2>
                    <p>I had to re-create my user account due to continued crashes with Insider Builds, and the main issue is that Forza Horizon 3 won't re-download from the Store. The existing install folder is still on my C: drive but I don't have permissions to remove it. That's
 a cozy 50GB. If I try and re-download it I just get an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Can I forcefully remove a specific app with a PowerShell command? Ideally I wouldn't have to re-download the 50GB and Windows 10 would act like other services such as Steam, GOG, Uplay etc and just recognise the folder of files. It is certainly
 supposed to but needless to say something has gone wrong.</p>

<h2>            bullpoint</h2>
                    My Dell Inspiron laptop with win 10 shows a program called "Internet Optimizer" by Bullpoint that appears to have been installed about 2 years ago. &nbsp;I cannot delete it nor can I find a specific reference to it in any MS help sites. &nbsp;I always use Windows
 Defender and Microsoft Safety Scanner has been running for over 3 hours now with zero files infected. &nbsp;I'm wondering if the scanner is working properly as the progress bar filled long ago and it has passed 855k files scanned which seems like a lot. &nbsp;Malwarebytes
 didn't identify the Bullpoint program although it did find 15 other apparently minor items. &nbsp;Any assistance and/or leads will be gratefully received.
