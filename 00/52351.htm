<p>5 as the registry contains all information about installed programs;</p>
<p>6 as keys from the registy can be exported and . . . imported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it not be great if one could install a new, clean windows 10 and,</p>

Why not make an image of a new clean install? That's what I do. You can restore it at any time.

<h2>            Error message&#58; Sorry, we can&#8217;t connect to Microsoft services at the moment, while switching from a local account to a Microsoft account and also can&#39;t sign into Windows Store.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Can't access my Microsoft account on my Surface RT </p>
<p>I just got my Surface RT yesterday and have problems accessing my Microsoft account.<br />
When trying to switch back from a local account to a Microsoft account, it accepts my email address, then after I enter my
</p>
<p>password it says You’ve almost finished changing your account. Next time you sign in to Windows, use your Microsoft account
</p>
<p>and password.’&nbsp; Then I click on finish and id shows the working animation next to ‘Preparing your Microsoft account’,
</p>
<p>however then it says “Sorry, we can’t connect to Microsoft services at the moment. If this problem persists, search for
</p>
<p>“network problems” on the Start screen.” My only option then is to click on Close.<br />
It started this from the beginning when setting up the tablet and I had to start up as a local account.<br />
If I click on the Store app and try to download any app, it asks me to sign in but returns the error: “We can’t sign you in
</p>
<p>because the network isn’t available.&nbsp; Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and try again.”</p>

            Yes I can sign in to the account through the web mail and that is the same ID I am using to access the app store and the same ID I am trying to use to set up my surface account.&nbsp; I will try the what you suggest that I haven't already tried.&nbsp; I already
 have run the trouble shooter and there is no internet connection problem.&nbsp; As far as waiting for 24 hours, I got my surface around 4pm central on 12/3, I was never able to login to my Microsoft account and it is now over 36 hours later.

<p>@Pascal Yeah - i did that too just now. Still can't seem to either connect an existing (local) account to an existing MS account or add an existing MS account.</p>
<p>It helps me log in to an account, but of course not to the one i use on all other devices :-/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get as far as receiving an access code on my phone for my existing account - I promoted the newly created account to admin, Logged in to live.com (in a browser) using my desired account, and it seemed for a moment to get me further. But sadly
 no. Still ended with the "can't connect" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And nothing in the event logs.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/79f28d85-6cc4-4546-a0c3-509cc8153695" title="RumelGuarina">RumelGuarina</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There's a lot of probable causes why this happening on your Surface device. This could be a software related issue which can be fixed by doing troubleshooting steps. This could also be a hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may try the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display. </strong>Under <strong>Display </strong>
below <strong>Scale and Layout </strong>there's <strong>Advanced scaling settings.
</strong>Under <strong>Custom Scaling, </strong>try to enter or custom scaling size between 100% to 500% and click on apply. Check after if there's any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to set an expectation, if this issue still persist, we can highly suggest to contact our support for the other alternative options, to contact our Surface Support, please go to this link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a><br />

<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; </div>
<div>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick</div>
<div>formatted FAT32 (use a Windows computer). Use FULL format and not quick format.</div>
<div>Give the volume a name like surfboot.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in, and then insert the USB</div>
<div>recovery drive into the USB port.</div>
<div>2. Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power</div>
<div>button.</div>
<div>3. When the Microsoft or Surface logo appears, release the volume-down button.</div>
<div>4. When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>5. Select&nbsp;Troubleshoot&nbsp;, and then select&nbsp;Recover from a drive&nbsp;. If prompted for</div>
<div>a recovery key, select&nbsp;Skip this drive&nbsp;at the bottom of the screen.</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>Be sure to select the&nbsp;Troubleshoot&nbsp;option on this screen. Don’t select the&nbsp;Use a</div>
<div>device&nbsp;option. If you select the&nbsp;Use a device&nbsp;option, your Surface will reboot</div>
<div>from the USB recovery drive again and the reset process will start over.</div>
<div>6. Choose either&nbsp;Just remove my files&nbsp;or&nbsp;Fully clean the drive.</div>
<div>The option to clean the drive is more secure but takes much longer. For example,</div>
<div>if you’re recycling your Surface, you should clean the drive. If you’re keeping</div>
<div>your Surface, you just need to remove your files.</div>
<div>7. Select&nbsp;Recover.</div>
<div>Surface restarts and displays the Surface logo while the reset process</div>
<div>continues. This can take several minutes.</div>

            Hey there morriss. Since you have an HP, this can be narrowed down a bit. 
<br />
<br />Do you have the app "velocity" installed? Go into control panel and uninstall the app. From what I have read, This app causes this blue screen on ebay for HP users.

<p><span>Hi Saffyre62,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community site. I would suggest you try out the options below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run intl.cpl, go to the Keyboards and Languages tab -&gt; Change Keyboards. Then click on the Language Bar tab and choose Floating on Desktop</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>You should now see a keyboard menu pop up. Now go to say, Microsoft Word, and press CTRL-SHIFT. You'll see the keyboard menu change text. Keep pressing CTRL-SHIFT and you'll see it cycle through all the available
 keyboard configurations. Say it cycles from "US" to "Canadian French" to "Canadian Multilingual Standard".
</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Just keep it as US - it's one of the ways where you don’t get French characters while typing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to use this option:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Run intl.cpl, go to the Keyboards and Languages tab -&gt; Change Keyboards. Select the keyboard you that's causing you grief and choose Remove.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't remove the keyboard map, when this switch happens, you'll have to exit the application you're in (Outlook, for example), change keyboards, and
 restart the app. Changing keyboards without restarting the app doesn't seem to change the mapping.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if that work. Good luck!
</span></p>
<div><span>
<hr />
</span></div>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards,
</span></p>

<h2>            Visual Studio hangs when trying to publish to Azure</h2>
                    When publishing to Azure from VS 2012,&nbsp; the development environment hangs and only suggests to contact Microsoft support. I have uninstalled and re-installed VS 2012 and I have used a process tool and can see where VS calls a SQLite.dll. and stops there.
 I have deleted that dll and it hangs on another dll... It's vague... I'm wondering if anyone here has an idea where to go from here.

<p>You have to delete iTunes and its associated software in a specific manner and sequence otherwise you get leftover bits on your PC/Laptop.</p>
<p>Go here : <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/</a>&nbsp;and select iTunes, then Installing and Uninstalling etc.</p>

                    Just installed Windows Live Mail on my Windows 7 pc. Everything is working and I put some recurring weekly items on the calendar. However the "Reminder" feature is greyed out when I would click to use it, so I guess I wont get a reminder.<br />
<br />
What has to happen for this feature to be usable by me??<br />

Thanks for any suggestions<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 USB 3.0 - Getting USB 2.0 File Transfer Speeds - ANYONE ELSE&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    So I just received my Surface Pro 2 (128gb model) yesterday and one of the things I loved about the original Surface Pro was the fact that it had a USB 3.0 port.<br />
I was able to reach file transfer speeds of up to 115mb/s peak with ~85mb/s sustained transfer rates. But after receiving the '2' yesterday I noticed that I was only able to max out at ~40mb/s.<br />
I have also tried testing this with multiple drives and I keep getting the same speeds. A friend of mine bought a 256gb model and is topping out at only 50mb/s.<br />
Is anyone else having the same issue and do you all think that this has to do with a driver problem?<br />
I would like to see what kind of results you guys are getting.<br />
Please post your speeds and thoughts on how we can resolve this issue.

            <p>I ran into this same issue and it turned out to be a problem of the Users group not having permission to access the Recycle bin folder on that single partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to simply give the Users group those permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open This PC or File Explorer.</p>
<p>Click View in the menu and select Options- Change folder and search options.</p>
<p>On the View tab unselect Hide Protected operating system files and change the Hidden Files and folders option to "show ...". Then click Apply. This will allow File explorer to display the hidden recycle bin folders on your drives.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/672af117-100c-4065-8374-2eb1b3bc6855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/672af117-100c-4065-8374-2eb1b3bc6855" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Explore the drive having the recycle bin problem and double click on the recycle bin folder. It should normally open to show the contents. If instead of opening the folder you get a "do not have permission"&nbsp;error you'll need to change that folder's permissions
 to allow&nbsp;the Users group&nbsp;to have access to the Recycle bin. Right click on the recycle bin and select Properties, then go to the Security tab. Click the&nbsp;link to give yourself access to the Security settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done you can use the Advanced security settings to add "Users" to the Permissions list with all Basic permissions enabled.</p>

 me to reinstall Windows from scratch by installing it using the ISO tool. That solved the issue, so it seems that the keyboard lag was related to whatever HP has done to the software.</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I recently bought a brand new HP Envy x360 15-ar000nd running Windows 10 (1703) home edition. It's got an AMD a9 processor, 8 GB of ram and a 256GB SSD (<a href="http://store.hp.com/NetherlandsStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=X8P97EA&amp;opt=ABH&amp;sel=NTB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">full
 specs here</a>).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Ever since I got it, I got a keyboard lag issue. It's not too apparent all the time, but sometimes when I type fast, or when I play some Minecraft, it's very noticable. I couldn't find a way to fix it, so I reset my laptop entirely.
 After that, the issue was gone, but after installing a few programs and rebooting the laptop, the issue came back. Windows didn't update while I rebooted the laptop.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The lag is always there and in every app. Even when using notepad and pressing a lot of keys. It's also there when the CPU usage is very low.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I thought it might be Google Chrome, but the issue was still there after I uninstalled it. Also, I've disabled most apps (like dropbox and onedrive, which both came preinstalled) from starting automatically after booting up the laptop.
 I do use an external mouse, but removing it, doesn't solve the issue.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I've booted Windows into safe mode, and the issue is actually gone when I do that, so it's gotta be a software related issue, but I can't seem to figure out what it is. I've already disabled stickey keys and all that and I've removed

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. Yes I've updated the drivers and the issue didn't return after installing a program, but rather after rebooting the computer after the first boot.<br />
<br />
I've also tried a bluetooth keyboard but it has the same issue.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about this matter. For the meantime we would like you to go to device manager &gt; Network Adaptor &gt; Marvel Avastar AC &gt; Right Click it and hit uninstall. Please let us know if there are changes on the connection. I would like

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Check for the following setting:</p>
<p>a. Open Printers and faxes in control panel. <br />
b. Double-click on the icon of the printer you want to change to online. A pop-up window detailing all current print jobs will open.<br />
c. Go to "Printer" in the menu bar of the pop-up window and uncheck "Use Printer Offline". This action will change the printer from offline to online.
</p>
<p>If you don’t find Printer in menu bar then search for "Use Printer Offline" option in pop-up windows and uncheck it and click on Ok button.</p>
<p>d. Click on Ok button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Update the printer driver.</p>

<h2>            How can I avoid toxic people&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, is there some networking feature that prevents me from being connected with toxic people? If not, is there a way to report toxic behavior like abusing exploits to get an advantage on other players? These people antagonize players in game and send a
 message to goad someone into responding so they can report the responder for harassment or offensive language when, in fact, it was the reporter that had instigated and aggravated the issue. I'm tired of encountering this kind of person and I receive the "corrective
 action" for defending myself. Outside of xbox, in the real world, the instigator is held accountable for their actions as well as the perpetrator. Both parties are at fault. I feel like the communication between two accounts is not looked at entirely and it's
 simply a single message that is flagged. The simple solution is that I just shouldn't play competitive online games like: Smite, Battlefield, For Honor; but in that scenario I might as well not even have online as I'll mo

</p><p>This absolutely is the best advice! Don't engage them, don't sink to their level. Just report and block. Blocking them helps to avoid these people in the future. If in the event, you just don't like what their saying but it isn't breaking any rules you can
 mute people in almost every game.</p>

<h2>            Sending messages on Skype over Satellite Internet</h2>
                    I use Satellite internet when at large venues where crowds cause LTE to be block up. I can do everything I normaly do on the internet with Satellite connection apart from sending messages on Skype. I can recieve messages and photos etc, but just can't

 perfect, but some of the people I work with only use Skype.&nbsp;Skype version 8.42.0.60

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the speed of your Satellite connection.
<br />
<br />I don't see why it should be an issue, since I was able to use Skype with even a GPRS connection years ago.
<br />
<br />You can try using Skype for Web to see if the same issue happens with the Satellite connection.

            I have a commercial Satellite account, it has a speed of 3 down and 1 up. Every other program works perfectly with that speed, I believe something is blocking it only on outbound messages. I will try Skype web next time I am connected to the Satellite.

            3 MBs should be more than fine for Skype. 
<br />
<br />You should check if your Firewall might be affecting Skype.
<br />
<br />Click Start, type allow an app
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Change settings
<br />Click Allow another app...
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the Path: 
<br />
<br />@{Microsoft.SkypeApp_12.10.572.0_x64__kzf8qxf38zg5c?ms-resource://Microsoft.SkypeApp/Resources/SkypeVideo_ProductName}
<br />
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Check the box under Private for it
<br />
<br />Click ok
