<h2>            No intel adapters are present in this computer. &#91;NEED HELP&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some solid help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed my new motherboard (MSI z97a gaming 7), and for some reason when I want to update the network driver it keeps telling med "no intel adapters are present". I have found many people have the same problem, but the solutions to their threads doesen't
 work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated all drivers for the board as far as I know, and bios too. Really don't get why it won't recognize the board as intel hardware. Anyway it is rather frustration as this prevents me from installing a network driver, which seems to be preventing
 me from using windows update..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had a problem like this before, so please try and be specific with your answers. Also if you want me to add some logs or something, please do tell me how to obtain them and so on. I am a noob, and it's my first time installing a motherboard into
 a new system from scratch so yea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relevant info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Board: MSI z97a Gaming 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>State: Entirelly new out of the box</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cpu: I5 4790K</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers not working: only network controller with hardware ID (PCI\VEN_10EC&amp;DEV_8176&amp;SUBSYS_84B51043&amp;REV_01)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions tryed: finding all available drivers and installed them if possible (lately getting rejected due to the error i described),</p>
<p>tryed turning windows update on/off in services.msc and hoping for an update to fix it, but still don't recieve any update (just keeps saying checking for updates).</p>
<p>

            <p>I already stated that I have installed all drivers and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubleshooting steps have been checking my internet connection, which funny enough actually works. I can browse, and some programs work with internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird thing is just that some programs and processes don't work, including windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me it seems as if those applications are trying to access a network connection that just doesen't exist on my machine, due to the lack of that network driver, and I can't install that network driver because my machine keeps telling my that I don't have
 any intel adapters onboard, which is a lie...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your links I cannot really use for anything, as I already read the other post, and troubleshooter + fixit and **** like that have done nothing for me. They just claim that there are no problems.</p>

</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you installed the mother board/chipset drivers for the computer from the manufactures website?</p>

</span></span></span>Apart from network adapter problems is your system running slow?</p>

            <p>Yes I had installed the chipset first thing, from the manufactorer's website, and the system is running really fast actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But NOW THIS IS STRANGE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a day with half my games not able to download, some others fully functional, no windows updates able for download (or even discovered for that matter), it suddenly started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have no **** clue what that is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network adapter which required a driver, still does, and still says there is no intel adapters available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder why? Though it isn't as urgent anymore due to the fact, that my pc functions now, as intended.</p>

            <p>So is your system getting connected to the Internet or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this your motherboard:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that is it, the specification say the network adapter is Killer, not Intel:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fus.msi.com%2fpic%2fimage%2flittle_icon%2fBult_ar_org.gif" height="15" width="11" /></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">LAN&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
<br />
• 1x Killer E2205 Gigabit LAN controller</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those drivers might be here on the MSI page (it says Killer Network Drivers):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://us.msi.com/product/motherboard/support/Z97A-GAMING-7.html#down-driver&amp;Win7%2064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.msi.com/product/motherboard/support/Z97A-GAMING-7.html#down-driver&amp;Win7%2064</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or from the Killer page:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.killernetworking.com/support/driver-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.killernetworking.com/support/driver-downloads</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean "the network adapter which required a driver, still does"?</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>What do you see that makes you think that?</p>
<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<p>Where do you see that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean "still says there is no intel adapter available""</p>
<p>Who or what says there is no intel adapter available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open Device Manager and navigate to your network adapter, right click it and choose Properties and on the Details tab chose Hardware IDs and either post a screen shot or tell us what the VENdor and DEVice IDs are as you can see here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2112025-591f-41a0-8d5c-e5ad36fa97de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2112025-591f-41a0-8d5c-e5ad36fa97de" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that example, the VENdor number is 10DE and the DEVice ID is 03EF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the VENdor and DEVice IDs for your afflicted network adapter?</p>

<h2>            Brand new XB One controller wont turn on if i use a rechargeable battery</h2>
                    Hey all. I just opened a brand new controller that I bought last year. I put a rechargeable xbox battery in and it wont turn on. The xbox light on the controller blinks when I press it but thats it. I put AA batteries in it and it works fine. I use that
 same rechargeable battery in another controller and it works fine. I tried updating the controller but its already up to date. any help would be greatly appreciated.

            I know some rechargeable batteries (AA rechargeable, not the play and charge kit) are slightly bigger than normal disposable AA batteries, so just make sure that your batteries are inserted correctly, and are making contact with the metal bits in the controller.

<h2>            Network Connections not available in Windows 10. Worst experience ever.</h2>
                    <p>On my Dell laptop, I upgraded my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 in a lot of excitement. But my excitement was drained out when I found out that the network adapters, both Wired and Wireless and not recognized in the Network Connections. I Googled it a loooooooooooot
 but did not find anything there. May be you have restricted Google's requests in anticipation of that people will post this critical issue and this might blacken up your image.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I took
 a massively wrong decision to move to Windows 10. I was really excited to use Windows 10 but after all this, I have started to give second thoughts in using Windows at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is very frustrating coz I have spent a complete day to fix this issue but to no avail. Worst experience ever with Microsoft which is motivating me more to move to Apple products. The difference in the service quality is way better
 there than at Microsoft.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And you guys from Microsoft say that this so called best product of yours has been tested by more than 5 million users????? Seriously??? And I am very much eager to meet those who never ever faced such an issue. Even if they do, then
 also you do not have a straight answer to this problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You guys are not the best in the market. No doubt you have the mass with you, but the cream is with Apple and I will also move there soon. Pathetic experience with your best ever product.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update 1803</h2>
                    <p><strong>WIFI ISSUES AFTER W10 UPDATE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>after the uodate, the intel wireless AC-9560 displays a code 10 report - the device cannot start. Operation failed. The requested operation was unsucessful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have so far reset the network. Removed the intel wireless software and scan hardware for changes and still showing error. Also removed the intel software and re installed it, still no joy, also tried an earlier version of intel software and nothing same
 error code. Then ran the intel scan utility and uodated the software again but still have the error code so im guessing its either the windows update that caused the intel wireless AC 9560 to fail or its the actual hardware thats failed.</p>
<p>Could anyone please advise&nbsp;</p>
<p>many thanks&nbsp;</p>

            There are two things I can offer that you might not have tried, number one reset your bios to default a few people have reported that to solve the issue, number 2 delete the item from device manager, physically remove it from the laptop check it reinstall it and load the drivers manually.  <br /><br />If it still doesnt work it's probably a hardware failure.<br /><br />Please let me know what model laptop are you using?<br /><br />What version driver are you using?

<p>Hi Chromia,<br />
<br />
Corrupted registry file is one of the possible reasons why you are having this error. We recommend that you try to edit the Windows registry by doing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When you see <strong>The computer restarted unexpectedly</strong> error message press
<strong>Shift key</strong> + <strong>F10 </strong>on your keyboard. This should open
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>regedit </strong>and press Enter to start <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</li><li>Once Registry Editor starts, navigate to the <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\Status\ChildCompletion
</strong>and double click the <strong>setup.exe </strong>in the right pane.</li><li>Change the <strong>Value Data </strong>from <strong>1 </strong>to <strong>3 </strong>
and click <strong>OK </strong>to save changes.</li><li>Close Registry Editor and <strong>restart </strong>your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Important:&nbsp; This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I do not have a DVD at hand to burn the .iso on it. Is there an alternative ?</p>
<p>I tried with the USB drive, and when I run the setup.exe I end up on a screen that asks for my product key and there is no option to ignore this screen. I did not receive any product key for windows 10; I am therefore still stuck.</p>
<p>When I try booting from the USB drive, i do get a screen that asks for the product key but there is an option to ignore this step. I then choose the update option and then i get a messsage that tells me that I need to reboot my computer and let the previous
 OS boot and from there launch the update... and I'm back to the product key screen that is impossible to ignore.</p>

    <title>Partial username being saved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sai raghu ram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partial username being saved</h2>
                    So, this is an issue i have been having since i upgraded to windows 10, so the issue is that only the first 5 characters of my name are being saved by windows 10, my full name is "Sai Raghu Ram". But windows keeps taking "saira" as my user name, it can
 be seen in both the cmd and C:\Users\. Further even the administrator name is also set to "saira". I verified if my name in the my microsoft account online is correct. (PS: I have purchased a new laptop (HP Omen 17 an010tx) which comes with windows 10 home
 and also on my old desktop, i used the media creation tool from microsoft to create the ISO and upgrade, but the issue is present in both machines). If someone could help me out that would be great. :D&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e737b73e-ca8d-44f0-9790-eaf7e47a7d4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e737b73e-ca8d-44f0-9790-eaf7e47a7d4c" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ec074f2-ff47-4dda-b0f5-b25860a55db3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ec074f2-ff47-4dda-b0f5-b25860a55db3" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1968d113-35b3-422e-a03a-8cd3b1b3e205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1968d113-35b3-422e-a03a-8cd3b1b3e205" /></a>

<p>Sai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you ever have to reinstall Windows then you could set up the user accounts to avoid this -
</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect from the internet before starting the installation,</li><li>During the final stages of installation, when you are asked to create a user account, create a "local" user account i.e. do not link it to your MSAccount,
<ul>
<li>Call the user account whatever you want to appear in C:\Users [such as Sai if you want to see C:\Users\Sai],</li><li>Give the user account whatever password you want as you are about to overwrite it [but do note it down to make sure you can enter it correctly during the setting up phase],</li></ul>
</li><li>Log into it and connect to the internet,</li><li>Go to Settings, Accounts, Your info</li><li>Click on Sign in with a Microsoft account instead,</li><li>Follow the procedure through to convert the "local" user account into an MSAccount-linked user account.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have focussed on the issue you raised but I do not want to be a bad influence.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>I would always urge anybody to create two <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
local</span> password-protected Admin accounts in addition to the user account they intend to use for day-to-day computing.&nbsp;
</li><li>This creates good resilience for the future.&nbsp; </li><li>The procedure &amp; my explanations are in my 19th September 2017 post in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/change-pc-greeting-name-from-me-to-my-wife-name/3c28255b-9b7f-4af1-8e51-f09302d04522">
change PC greeting name</a>.</li><li>You can do this now, you do not have to wait for a reinstallation to do it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your advice.&nbsp; My cd is optiarc BD Rom BC-5650H SCSI CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked device manager which says device is working properly, also drivers are up to date.&nbsp; It shows when I put in a cd but it just can't access it.&nbsp; Doesn't say anything, just
 won't show what is on cd or open it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not like windows 10 but I'm stuck with it.&nbsp; I've had 10 for about 2 months, so why now would it not acknowledge cd.&nbsp; My other external cd is working, although yesterday it did do the same thing after a while of use,
 showed a cd but showed blank, I rebooted &amp; it started working correctly.&nbsp; My internal cd not working still.</p>

<h2>            Every single web browser crashes after latest Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>After installing the recent Windows 10 updates, which released on the 11th of July, every single web browser crashes immediately when I try to open them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge crashes</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox crashes</p>
<p>Internet Explorer crashes, because it detects an error and tries to reopen itself. It keeps doing it in an endless loop.</p>
<p>I even installed Comodo Dragon, but it also crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the functionality of my web browsers, by reverting to the restore point, which was created before the updates were installed. I also paused updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following updates may be the culprits:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2017-07 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4025342)</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office 2007 suites (KB3213640)</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3 (KB3191897)</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office Excel 2007 (KB3191894)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could possibly be causing this issue?</p>
<p>How can I fix it?</p>

            In my case,after installing the recent Windows updates Comodo Firewall causes Firefox crashes on startup. today Comodo released an update and after installing it, Firefox works normally again.

<h2>            Display goes off after some minutes and shows &#34;No Signal&#34;</h2>
                    Hey guys, I have been facing a wierd problem recently. My desktop monitor turns off itself after a few minutes but the CPU works, I can hear the fan running and see the lights blinking. One thing I noticed is that when the monitor turns off, the Orange
 light on the CPU stays on which normally just blinks. My PC works normally on safe mode, but the worst part about safe mode is that I cannot work on my software CorelDRAW. Can this be the SMPS problem? because recently my mouse and keyboard inputs were not
 working because of which I got a USB keyboard and mouse. I have recently installed Windows 7 64bit, but I think that should not cause the problem as I have worked with 64bit Windows before on the same machine.<br />
<br />
PC configuration -<br />
<br />
Intel Core 2 Duo 4500 @ 2.20Ghz Processor<br />
ASUS P5QPL-AM Motherboard<br />
3GB RAM<br />
No Graphic Card (Maybe inbuilt, not sure)<br />
1TB Hardisk<br />
<br />
PS - I couldn't find an exact category for my problem.

            <blockquote>Hey Archer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I currently formatted my Windows 7 and installed Windows 8 and am still having those porblems. I did not upgrade but formatted my C drive and installed a new fresh copy of windows 8.....So I thnk this can be a problem of the SMPS. Can it?<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
Hi Sunny
<div><br />
<div>It may or maynot be SMPS..... the reason being .... you have already said that the computer or monitor does work fine in safe mode !!! But since its happening even when you install Windows 8,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lets do the troubleshooting one by one</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to Bios and reset everything to default by selecting the optimal setting in the bios..... Since your motherboard has Ai overclocking feature and selection of IGD... let get it to defaults.... &nbsp;Start the computer and check if the monitor still goes
 off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. if the Step 1 didnt solve your problem...then go to power option in Control panel and select your system power setting to high performance... where you can set your monitor to Never go to sleep. &nbsp;See what happens... If the monitor still goes to sleep
 even after this setting...then you have a problem with the drivers or the motherboard.... try updating the drivers and see if this helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. If updating the drivers didn't help ... then the next option is to look into your hardware.....try to get a spare monitor and see if this could resolve this issue... One things you can deduce if this also fails ... then the obvious reason is that your
 monitor is ok ..... and problem should be the motherboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. First check the display port.. does it feel loose??</div>
<div>&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;have the pins of this port come out ??&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; b.&nbsp;Your motherboard has two power connections (24-pin EATXPWR and a 4-pin ATX 12V... are they both connected ???</div>
<div>&nbsp; c. Your SMPS need to be atleast 400W as per you manufacturer recommendation. Check this....</div>
<div>&nbsp; d. Then ofcourcse the obvious.... reseat the rams and other external peripherals...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do these and let me know your feedback for each&nbsp;</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp; How To Find Drivers:<br />
- search Google for the name of the driver<br />
- compare the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
- visit the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
- if there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program.[/quote]- - The most common drivers are listed on this page: Driver Reference "http://www.carrona.org/dvrref.php"]Driver
 Reference<br />
<br />
- - Driver manufacturer links are on this page: "http://www.carrona.org/drvrdown.html"]Drivers and Downloads<br />

<br />Try re-registering Xbox app. Run following command in administrative Windows PowerShell:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.XboxApp | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}

    <title>.jar file not opening with Java &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            .jar file not opening with Java &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft community, </p>
<p>I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and decided to download the&nbsp;Minecraft launcher (minecraft_launcher.jar) which requires Java to play,&nbsp;which I also downloaded the latest version of. When I open the Minecraft launcher, it asks with which application
 I want to open it. However, Java is not an option and I don't know any other way of opening it. On my old laptop (MacBook air), I simply downloaded the application, with the latest version of Java, and the launcher opened with no problems.
</p>
<p>Any input and/or thoughts would be very much appreciated... Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Dog slow game download - showing either 984.88 Kb&#47;s or 1.44 Mb&#47;s</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to download 26.82 GB Warframe. In the Queue manager, the displayed throughput flips back and forth between 1.44 Mb/s and 984.88 Kb/s. </p><p><br /></p><p>The problem is, I have a 100 Mbps Internet connection. In fact, on this xbox, I flipped over to the Microsoft Edge web browser and loaded up speedtest.net. Speedtest.net says I have a 126 Mb/s download rate. On this same xbox that's downloading somewhere around 1 Mb/s.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why, on the exact same hardware &amp; network connection, would an xbox game download at less than 1% of the speed that's available? How do I fix this?</p>

<h3> nahant150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet explorer window opens too small  &#40;not full screen&#41; in Windows 7</h2>
                    OK, bought new computer due to lead free solder issues in my&nbsp;three year old one. Now I'm playing with Windows 7. &nbsp;I want windows that&nbsp;I click on to open full size and not less than half screen and too small to read. Why do I have to press the maximize
 key everytime I open the screen? Who was the rocket scientist that set the default opening size for clicked on windows to less than full screen and why ? Wait, I don't want to waste my answer on that .... Please tell me and countless others how to fix this.
 I have already tried increasing window size by&nbsp;not using maximize button and then closing the new enlarged normal sized window with control key&nbsp;pressed and "X"&nbsp;or shift key pressed and "X". Neither makes the window open larger next time that I click on it.
 Please help me and all the others who have posted this problem and make the answer obvious on line so others do not need to spend so much time trying to fix this issue. Thanks.

<p>This issue is not&nbsp;exclusive to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Three options.</p>
<p>1: Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size.&nbsp; <strong><em>Do not use Maximize.</em></strong>&nbsp;
<em>Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last</em>. Windows will remember the size used of the&nbsp;<strong><em>last</em></strong> window closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>3: <strong>IE New Window Maximizer<br />
