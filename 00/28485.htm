<h2>            Deleted contacts&#63;</h2>
                    I have 1173 contacts currently sync'd up and just noticed that in the Deleted Items-&gt;Contacts area, 906 of them are again listed.&nbsp; I know I didn't go through and delete any, let alone 906, of them and a quick spot check shows that all of the Deleted contacts
 are still in the regular/non-deleted Contacts section, as they should be.<br />
<br />
While the tasks and other Deleted Items look to be working properly, the Contacts are not for some reason???&nbsp; Should I go ahead and just delete the bogus deleted entries, or is this going to affect my current Contacts somehow?<br />

            You have&nbsp;3 options here:<br />
1 - recover all contacts from trash to storage and use the Find Duplicates to remove the duplicate entries<br />
2 - Purge the contacts from the trash (they are already not linked to the phone and if you are not missing them or are seing them also on the storage it would mean that it would be ok)<br />
3 - don't do nothing and let them&nbsp;on the trash (they are not linked to the phone)

    <title>Valid Installation Source &#40;Office 2007, Enterprise&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Valid Installation Source &#40;Office 2007, Enterprise&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded from Vista Basic and Windows 7 Professional&nbsp;and I had to do a clean install. When I tried to reinstall Ofice 2007 Enterprise, I got the messages: "Outlook cannot find Outlook.en.us\Outlklr.cas&nbsp;and Outlookmui.msi.&nbsp;Browse for a valid installation
 source and then click ok". I select the folder where those files are&nbsp;located, and the installer then tells me that it is an invalid folder.</p>
<p>I read many postings in the MS forums and I did the following: 1. Remove the old Vista files with clean drive. 2. Do error check on the disk and degragment it. 3. Run the setup file from the Start menu. 4. Try in the installation in XP mode. 5. Remove any
 traces of a previous installation (there isn't any because Windows 7 removed everything when I installed). 6. Copy installation files to a new directory and try to install from there.</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 did not work. How can I install Office 2007 Enterprise?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>What about method 6?<br />
It would help determine if your installation&nbsp;CD/DVD is damaged.</p>
<p>As you are using an Enterprise version, ask your IT-support department if they can redeploy Office 2007 to your machine or supply you with a new installation CD/DVD in case it is damaged.</p>

<h2>            Page Numbering in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have a 40 page document (program book).&nbsp; Page 1-27 number correctly but I cannot get the remaining part of my document to continue number.&nbsp; I have deleted the footer, the page number, readded.&nbsp; The problem seems to come from when it the footer section
 changes from 1 to 5--I have no clue why it changes either.</p>

            <p>This doesn't work either.&nbsp; I don't have a continue from previous section except in my text.&nbsp; I think that may be my problem because I can't get rid of the section break (new page).&nbsp; If I delete it, it moves to the previous section break (continuous) and
 changes it.&nbsp; most of my document is a single column but I have sections that are 3 columns, and I didn't mean to be put in the section break (new page).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent hours on this, copying the text into a whole new document.&nbsp; I think I'm going to just forget about it and add a text box to each page and typing the numbers in by hand.</p>

</p><p>To those that helped me out I so appreciate it.&nbsp; What I discovered is that I had to ensure there were no "footers" on the page.&nbsp; Then I added the page numbering, but I then had to go to the pages that were not in sequence and actually go to the page number
 and double click on the page number that was being displayed.&nbsp; Once I did that, I could right click and do the continue from the previous section.&nbsp; I had to do that on about 4 pages, but I finally got it... and I am thrilled to have that issue resolved!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that Doug's macro is the easiest fix for cases when you don't know exactly how&nbsp;many&nbsp;section breaks may be "hiding" in the text.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With "hiding" I am referring to the fact that you may not have full control over section breaks because Word automatically adds (continuous) breaks at any time when you&nbsp;change section-level formatting, such as newspaper columns, for a selected range.&nbsp;If
 you want a bit more control you should (temporarily) switch to Draft view and display nonprinting marks (for example by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab).</p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what often happens&nbsp;is that when users have some front matter that is un-numbered or numbered differently (i, ii, iii) so that when they start the Body of the document in a new Section, that Section is set so that the numbering starts at 1, and then
 they have a multiple Section breaks (particularly Continuous Section Breaks) on one page, it is not possible to access a header footer of the Section between those Section Breaks to change the numbering to Continue from the Previous Section, so that then when
 you&nbsp;do insert a Next Page Section Break, setting the page numbering in that Section to continue from the previous Section, is in effect setting it to continue from the Section that does not have its own Header or Footer displayed and hence there is no page
 number to continue from so that in the new Section, the page numbering starts again at 1 because Nothing plus 1 = 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's where running a macro comes into its own, because it does access the Headers\Footers of the Section that does not its Header\Footer displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other problems that such "hidden" headers and footers can cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a while ago now, I came across an issue where such a footer contained an IncludeText field that referenced some text on the server of a company that was remote to the office
 in which the template was being used, with the result that it took something like 15 minutes for a document created from the template to appear.&nbsp; It was quite a while before I twigged to that being the source of the issue.</p>

            <p>Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the fact that section properties are inherited&nbsp;from the current section when you add a section break may lead to a lot of confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least in theory, there should be less of a problem in ribbon versions of Word, because you can access the Page Number Format dialog box more easily, without seeing headers and footers in&nbsp;a section. Of course, that doesn't help if the problem is seeing
 the sections in the first place. </p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is a problem with using the page number format dialog box when NOT actually in the header\footer pane in that if you have a document with a Section with the page numbers set to start at 1 (after say a section with i,&nbsp; ii, iii numbering) and then
 you have a continuous section break (Section Break A) followed by some other Section Break (Section Break B), both on the one page,&nbsp;and you put the selection between the Section Break A and Section Break B and then access the Page Number Format dialog and
 change the page numbering in that Section (between A and B so that it continues from the previous Section, it will also change the page numbering in Section for which the numbering did start at 1 so that it too continues from&nbsp; previous (i, ii, iii numbered)
 Section with the result that it no longer starts at 1.&nbsp;</p>

            I haven't experimented much with it recently, but clicking inside the continuous section before opening the Page Number Format dialog box (via Insert | Page Number | Format Page Numbers) should work. It should give you the dialog box for the section at
 the insertion point, unless I'm missing something. Are you saying that it doesn't work (anymore)?

<p>I too, get the Kernel_Security_Check_Failure error.&nbsp; I have collected my DM files, and the System Info.&nbsp; I have uploaded these into my Public file in OneDrive.</p>

            <p>See if this article can help. He explains how to read your dmp file quite well. It's not a simple process, but it should help you pinpoint the issue. @reg614 I too have a t100ta but haven't had the issue on it. Is there anything you have installed lately
 that runs in the background?</p>

    <title>Entering Formulas in Columns of MS Project 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Entering Formulas in Columns of MS Project 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to compute the time in hours a task should have completed based on the task duration.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;formula I came up with, to put into a column, is this:&nbsp; </p>
<p>[(Current Date - Start Date) / (End Date -Start Date)] * Work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Date - Start Date = Days Elapsed</p>
<p>End Date - Start Date = Duration in Days</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CD-SD / ED-SD = % Elapsed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>% Elapsed * Work = How Many Hours Should Be Completed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone give me the pathway to insert this formula in a new column?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've tried, to no avail.&nbsp; It's such a simple formula, so I must be doing something wrong.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Andrew,
<div><br />
<div>Right click on the column headers and select "custom fields" in order to create a new custom field.</div>
<div>Then you can select a task number custom field and enter a formula.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that all duration are calculted &nbsp;from minutes, thus you eventually have to convert dates in day. Be also aware that mixing work and duration in a formula might be inconsistent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            <blockquote>Hi Andrew,
<div><br />
<div>Right click on the column headers and select "custom fields" in order to create a new custom field.</div>
<div>Then you can select a task number custom field and enter a formula.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that all duration are calculted &nbsp;from minutes, thus you eventually have to convert dates in day. Be also aware that mixing work and duration in a formula might be inconsistent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Thanks, Guillaume!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are&nbsp;the minutes for a calendar day, i.e. 24 hrs, which makes 1,440 min./day?</p>
<p>Or is it minutes for an 8-hr workday, or 480 min./day?</p>
<p>One of these would be the factor to convert minutes to days, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, yes, you're right about mixing duration &amp; hours:&nbsp; I'm doing this as a rough, almost arbitrary way to show progress over time, even though in reality it rarely happens that way, the work not being spread out evenly over the task duration,&nbsp;rather,
 for example, bunched up at the beginning, middle or end, or dispersed in some other pattern.</p>

            Three things:<br />
<ol>
<li>You need brackets (CD-SD) / (ED-SD) = % Elapsed otherwise the division gets done first, then the subtraction.</li><li>Try using ProjDateDiff( date1, date2, calendar ) function in the formula.

            Hi Andrew,
<div><br />
<div>For a 8hr workday, you'll have indeed 480hr (8*60).</div>
<div>But as Rod suggests, you could use the ProjDateDiff function.</div>

I added the EV Method column after assigning $1 as the Resource Rate (Std. &amp; Ovt.), but all the fields just show '% Complete' now with nothing else, i.e. not the values of % Complete, but the words "% Complete" with no info.

<p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is correct. The best way to backup a notebook is to create a new notebook, open both the old and new one in a OneNote client, and copy (not move) each section to the new one.</p>

<h2>            Group&#47;Ungroup in protected sheet works in Excel desktop but not in Excel Online</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a spreadsheet in OneDrive and we need to work with it in Excel Online (360). The spreadsheet had a macro to protect sheets. The macro is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Worksheets("Nik")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Unprotect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Protect UserInterfaceOnly:=True, AllowFiltering:=True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .EnableOutlining = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro is perfect to protect and allow to use Group/Ungroup function, but only in Excel desktop application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the spreadsheet in Excel Online, the Group/Ungroup function doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, any know what is the problem with Excel Online and how to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>You don't need to do the power button and volume thing. You can just hold down the power button and a prompt will say 'slide down to power off'. Slide the screen down and the phone will shut down, nicely. Hold down power to turn it back on, nicely. (If it
 is plugged into a charger, it will turn itself back on.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two button option is there in case the phone is frozen and you can't get to the shutdown screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the difference between selecting shutdown out of the start menu on you PC and forcefully holding down the physical power button, forcing a hard shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do take a look at how much memory you have in use. Just like a PC, having very little left will affect performance.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2010 keeps changing default font size after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcmcclain  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2010 keeps changing default font size after copying&#47;pasting text from another source and I can&#39;t change it back&#63;</h2>
                    I am creating a large outline in OneNote. &nbsp;It seems that when I copy/past text of a different size from the web or another source, OneNote will change my page that I am working on to that default font style. &nbsp;So when I hit enter to start a new line, even
 if I have selected all of the text and changed it back to my previous default font size, the new line will have the attributes of whatever text I pasted into it before. &nbsp;So OneNote is basically ignoring my default font style in the Options menu. &nbsp;This is a
 permanent change to the page and the only way I can get out of it is to create a whole new page, but even when I copy and past the old outline to the new page, this problem sometimes persists, so I am stuck changing the font style of very line of new material
 I type. &nbsp;If it wasn't for the fact that the new font style OneNote is using is so very large, I could just keep working in this size and then change it all once I'm done, but that is not doable here. &nbs

            <p>Here's a couple things you could try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When you paste either click the little arrow under the Paste button in the ribbon and select "Keep text only"&nbsp;OR press Ctrl+V to paste and then press and release Control again to bring up the Paste options menu then press T.</p>
<p>2. Whenever you see your text is the wrong font/size, press Ctrl+Shift+N or click the Clear All Formatting button in the home tab of the ribbon (it looks like the letter A with an eraser).</p>

<p>Done hard reset, but no use. </p>
<p>switched to 8.1 denim through Windows device recovery tool.</p>
<p>it's an old version, but works like a charm. no battery drain in battery saver, able to stop all background process while i was on the go.</p>
<p>Still wonder how a non-insider build 10.0.14393 is buggy, that battery saver stopped working.</p>
<p>this not the thing a windows mobile fan would expect.</p>

<p>then it doesn't show the notification, what about background process?</p>
<p>let me explain briefly:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WP8.1:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>battery saver is on</strong>. </p>
<p>2. i turned mobile data on.</p>
<p>3. in this case i should receive messages/content (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not notifications</span>) from whatsapp (or any other app that updates it's content) only when manually opened.
</p>
<p>this is happening fine on WP8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>W10 mobile:</strong></p>
<p>in this, if <strong>battery saver is on</strong>, battery is not draining. works fine.
</p>
<p>in this case if you turned mobile data on, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
though app is not opened manually</span>, it's content getting updated (irrespective of notifications), this happens to all apps. this causes unnecessary battery drain while on mobile data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope my explanation helps. </p>
<p>i spent lot of time, checked above scenarios by re-installing WP8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>please help.&nbsp;</p>

            If you uncheck the app from background apps, it shouldn't update itself when it's not opened. Open Settings&gt;System&gt;About&gt;Battery&gt;Battery usage by app and make sure the apps are not allowed to run when battery saver is enabled.

                    I can not select an image that has been added to a Word document &nbsp; I think it is hidden behind the text, but I am not sure as I was not the person who created the document and the person who did does not have enough knowledge to know what they did. &nbsp;I
 have tried removing the text but still no joy. &nbsp;Any thoughts appreciated.

            If the image is visible, then it may be in the header/footer or in the body but if you cannot select it, it has been formatted as behind text. You can access the image from the appropriate view using the white select object arrow cursor available from

    <title>Problem scrolling with the mouse wheel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil hageman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem scrolling with the mouse wheel</h2>
                    <p>In the "Normal" view, when scrolling through a ppt presentation with&nbsp;the mouse wheel, as the wheel clicks, the next slide should come up.&nbsp; Sometimes however, it takes a number of clicks of the wheel to get to the next slide - the slide simply moves up/down
 screen until the last click&nbsp;brings up the next slide.&nbsp; I reduced screen size to 10% and highlighted the entire screen, looking for objects&nbsp;outside&nbsp;the slide borders but found none.&nbsp; What is the problem and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This symptom may exist for just a few slides in the entire presentation, so I don't think it is a slide master issue&nbsp; - but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem does not exist when using the keyboard Page Up/Page Down keys or when in the "Slide Show" view.</p>

            OK, that'll happen whenever anything is off the top or bottom of the actual slide. &nbsp;PPT scrolls downward on the slide as many times as it takes to bring the last bit of stuff into view (even if, as in your case, it's invisible stuff!), &nbsp;Then the next click
 of the scroll wheel goes to the next slide.
<div><br />
<div>A quick navigation trick: &nbsp;hold down CTRL, use the scroll wheel to zoom out, then let go of CTRL and scroll to other slides, CTRL + scroll to zoom back in again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As long as you're zoomed out far enough to see all the slide content in the visible window (even the stuff that's off the slide itself), the scroll wheel will move to next/previous slides.</div>

<p>We need a little bit more to narrow this down.&nbsp; Try basic troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Camera, does the computer see your camera?&nbsp; When you click on settings &gt; audio &amp; video settings, is your camera working.&nbsp; Can you see yourself in the bottom frame?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Connection, is your connection fast enough for video calls?&nbsp; If you are on wifi, try wiring straight into the modem.&nbsp; Is your internet fast enough or are there other users streaming movies and playing games at the same time you are trying to put through
 a video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Everything else;&nbsp; operator issues, software problems defective camera ect.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let's get this resolved. If you don’t find any contacts in the People app, or there are contacts you want to add, the easiest way is to add all of your different email accounts to the People app. Here's how you can add contacts from your email account:</p>

            <p><span>Hi Siopow,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’d like to explain that this folder contains files which allow for SxS support (Office 2013 Click-to-Run installation can be installed on the same computer with Office 2016 Click-to-Run installation).This feature is not supported before, so there
 is no Experiment folder in the downloaded package. From October 11, 2016, some certain installation scenarios are supported since the Experiment folder is added to the installation package.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get more information, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt712177(v=office.16).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Supported scenarios for installing different versions of Office, Visio, and Project on the same computer</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

    <title>Hidden chat history in Teams - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rtm23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hidden chat history in Teams</h2>
                    <p>Will it be possible for users to delete the recent chat history in Teams? </p>
<p>Currently the only option is to hide the chat. </p>
<p>Once it is hidden where can you go to view the hidden chats?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do know that if you "Search" for the chat or the users name it does appear in the Recent windows and you can select it from there but thats not helpful.</p>
<p>There should be a tab called "Hidden" or "History" to allow users to go back and view this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
                </div>
