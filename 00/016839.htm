<p>The problem is there is another website masquerading as office.com/setup but they are people who want remote access to your computer (using logmeinRESCUE), they want to get information from your computer and tell there are many problems you need to fix before
 you can install Office. &nbsp;They are not from Microsoft! &nbsp;They got to me and I'm upset that I let them access my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joshua has confused the error you saw on the masquerading website MSO34017-4 with are real Microsoft error code 30174-4...look closely, they are not the same!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the real Microsoft Office website at setup.office.com rather than office.com/setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>The masquerading website is&nbsp;http://www.office.com-setup.com and is legitimate looking when found in a web search...DO NOT USE IT!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to do something to keep this from happening!</p>

<h2>            To everyone having difficulties sending pictures from their phone to their email and not having the pictures show up</h2>
                    <p>I have sent many pictures to my email in the past with no problems and just recently tried to do so and the pictures would not show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested by a tech, I checked my browser and it is up-to-date to eliminate that possibility.</p>
<p>I also made sure my phone number was in my contact list (which it wasn't in the past so not sure if that ultimately made a difference....I doubt it though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really believe the problem is with Outlook as I was able to send the same picture to my daughter's Yahoo email and it showed up just like it used to for me with my Hotmail email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think the problem is with the <em><strong>Filters and reporting</strong></em> under the<strong> Preventing Junk Mail</strong> section located in OPTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to locate this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign in to your Outlook/Hotmail account.</p>
<p>1. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>gear icon</strong>&nbsp;in the upper right corner of the page next to your name, choose&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under&nbsp;<em>Preventing junk email</em>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Filters and reporting</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under&nbsp;<em>Block content from unknown senders</em>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Show attachments, pictures, and links for senders with good reputations.</strong> (This was already selected)</p>
<p>4. Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was when I clicked&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong> that it would <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> save and confirm. Instead I got a message: <strong>There seems to be a problem with Outlook.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to that section everyday and clicked and experimented with all the choices and it never saved it and I always got the above message, Finally one day I selected:
<strong>Block attachments, pictures, and links for anyone not in my safe senders list</strong> &nbsp;(Und<span>er&nbsp;</span><em>Block content from unknown senders)&nbsp;</em>and clicked&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>....and IT SAVED!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went back and changed it back to the way it was previously:&nbsp;<strong>Show attachments, pictures, and links for senders with good reputations.</strong></p>
<p>This time when I clicked&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong> it actually SAVED IT AGAIN!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly sent a picture from my phone to my email to test to see if anything had changed and the picture showed up just like in the past,. I have been testing it daily and it still works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. Hopefully Outlook will look into this so this problem doesn't keep occurring for other people.</p>

<p>I had sent pictures from my phone and then deleted them thinking they were safely going to my e-mail. &nbsp;Those e-mails are only showing "photo" that I still can't see after going through the steps you mentioned. &nbsp;Have yours shown up in e-mails you had sent
 prior to going though the steps?</p>

            I don't know if this will help anyone else or not, but I "think" this thing is working now if (crossed fingers) it doesn't crash; it worked once before for a few minutes and died:<br />
<br />
In the new user I created I tried disabling everything in msconfig and startup. This caused Excel to start reloading files and telling me I had register Office; needless to say Excel still had problems. I then tried to startup in safe mode and Excel said it
 could not get the license and would not even start.<br />
<br />
I gave up, deleted that user and crated another new one; when I started Excel it loaded some more files, but WORKED. I went through getting all settings transferred from the oldest user (I never use the Administrator) extremely slow - one at a time.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that some files in Excel were corrupt and all the messing around got them fixed. I had previously tried a DVD repair and that did not work; there is no reinstall with this version - a real bummer.<br />
<br />
If it blows up, I will be back - count on it.<br />
<br />
I do have one more question - when I try to save a .xltm to any location besides "templates" I get an error with a number for a file name stating it cannot be found - why????<br />

            MY FAULT. The issue is that I wanted to remove "non-commercial" from the title bar and that requires changes to the registry which disables the ability to write to the key which seems to control a lot of attributes to Excels options. I added the write
 abilities back and everything is working. Sorry for the bother.<br />

            <p>Given the nature of the windows phone OS and the way it restricts applications, documents and related items access to its core software features and functionality, it is highly unlikely that your phone has been hacked. Your issue is probably caused by some
 other thing and,&nbsp;the fact that these things occurred right after you started using a&nbsp;windows phone is a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to an article that lays out some basic steps you can take to recover from this event.&nbsp;Even though&nbsp;the article is written from the viewpoint of recovering from a hacked outlook.com account, which is an account you did not indicate was at issue in your
 case, the article still applies, although you will&nbsp;need to apply the described techniques to your yahoo.com, Google, Facebook and any other accounts that have been affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really doubt your phone has been affected by this, but if you are concerned that the phone has been compromised, you can perform a hard reset of the phone to return it to its original, out of the box status (tap Settings &gt; About &gt; tap the "reset your phone"
 button.</p>

            MS billing does not handle the concept of changing countries very gracefully.  You will have to have a credit card with a French billing address.
<br />
<br />The simplest way may be to let your current subscription expire.  Then, with a little luck you will just be able to start a new subscription.  More likely you will have to contact MS support for help beating the accounting system into submission.

            Take a look at this wiki. About half way down it lists several ways you can save money. One being have "auto renew" turned on initially, but then after getting the bonus, turn it off

            Yes, you can create an entirely new template, and in fact that's the recommended process -- it's a good idea to create a different template for each different type of document you frequently deal with. Each template can have its own set of styles, page
 layout, ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar customizations, macros, and AutoText entries if that's what you want.<br />
<br />
The procedure for creating a clean new template is shown at <a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/templates/how-to-save-a-word-document-as-a-template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/templates/how-to-save-a-word-document-as-a-template.html</a>.<br />
<br />
Once the template is open in Word, there are several ways to create new styles in it. You can
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/styles/modifyastyle.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">modify the built-in styles</a>, or open the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S) and click the New Style button at the bottom of it, or format some paragraph the way you want the style to look and
 then right-click it and choose Styles &gt; Save Selection as a New Quick Style.<br />
<br />
After you create the template and save it (preferably in the Templates folder, which is usually %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates), you can use File &gt; New &gt; My Templates to select the template as the base for a new document. The "Blank Document" is the only one
 that's automatically based on the Normal template.<br />

<h2>            Visio 2010 - Reopening file yields all objects locked&#59; object properties will not open</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using Visio 2010 on XP.</p>
<p>Yesterday I opened Visio and created a new Sequence diagram; I had no issues and everything was working correctly.&nbsp; I exited the program last night.</p>
<p>When I opened the Visio file this morning, not only did I have to open it from within Visio (would not open directly from the file) but none of the objects would allow me to access their properties, either through a double-click or a right-click -&gt; Properties.&nbsp;
 When I tried to do either of those actions nothing happened, no hour glass, nothing.</p>
<p>Using the Developer tab I can select an object and set its double-click value to edit the text, but I haven't been able to figure out how to correctly access the properties again.&nbsp; I have no layers in the project and have not done anything other than create
 a simple sequence diagram/flow.&nbsp; I can't access the properties on any new objects I add to the file either, the problem doesn't exist only on preexisting objects.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions/knowledge on why this happened and/or how I can fix it?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This sounds like a UML solution based drawing, and the solution add-on is not running.&nbsp; There is no way to get to the UML properties unless the solution is properly running.</p>
<p>Check for the UML tab with you drawing open - if it is not there, then the solution is not running.</p>
<p>1) Close your existing drawing, then try creating a new UML diagram (New &gt; Software and Database &gt; UML Model diagram), and see if the UML tab is present and functional.</p>
<p>2) In the clean UML drawing, try importing your existing drawing (Insert tab &gt; Object &gt; Create from File &gt; browse to your drawing and click OK to import).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you have the Visio Professional or Premium versions, you should be able to create UML diagrams, and edit existing ones. If you have Visio Standard 2010, you will not have the UML model diagram template, and cannot interact with the UML properties.</p>

            I'm having the same issue on Windows 7, 64bit using Visio 2010 Professional. It's very frustrating as there's no clear indication of why. I have gone to great lengths to determine a work around with no success. Example, I have the Developer tab open, I
 have unlocked all "protection" options.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Modern Auth, MAPI over HTTPS and Exchange Online.</h2>
                    <p>Few questions about Modern Auth, MAPI over HTTPS and Exchange Online:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If you enable Mordern Auth, does your clients switch from RPC-HTTP to MAPI-HTTP?</p>
<p>2) Can you switch back to basic Auth in case you need to? (I know Modern Auth is the way forward but we are doing some testing at the moment so would be convenient to switch back or else we would need to do more tests before we turn on Modern Auth)</p>
<p>3) If I enable Modern Auth, can OL2010 clients still connect to their Exchange Online mailbox?</p>

            <p><span>Hi ExchBin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Below are the answers to your questions:<br />
Q1:<em> If you enable Mordern Auth, does your clients switch from RPC-HTTP to MAPI-HTTP?</em></span></p>
<p><span>A: No, enable modern authentication or not has no effect on this. MAPI over HTTP is a new transport protocol used to connect Outlook and Exchange, it is gradually rolling out in Office 365 automatically on the service side.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q2: <em>Can you switch back to basic Auth in case you need to?</em></span></p>
<p><span>A: Yes, we can turn off modern authentication to achieve that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q3: <em>If I enable Modern Auth, can OL2010 clients still connect to their Exchange Online mailbox?</em></span></p>
<p><span>A: Yes, it will connect via basic authentication.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Feel free to let us know if you have other concerns about this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook2010 was able to connect to the mailbox prior to turning on Modern Auth. After switching it off, Outlook 2010 clients are still not able to connect. Any idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2013 shows it is connecting on MAPI/HTTP. Although if I check the &nbsp;Get-OrganizationConfig results, MapiHttpEnabled is set to False.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Outlook 2010 not be able to connect to Exchange Online may be caused by many factors. Since this issue is different from the original queries, we suggest you create a new thread

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, Office 365 is designed to work with the latest versions of Office. Office 2010 may work with office 365 with reduced functionality. We suggest you update to Office

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand OL2010 users would work with reduced functionality - which is OK but my problem is the OL2010 clients no longer connect after switching on and off the Modern Authentication. And I'm looking for some explanations since I can't seem to find it
 elsewhere. I have a quite a good number of OL2010 users still on-premises and I would need to be able to plan the client upgrade post migration and not before it.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is still somehow connected to the original issue I'm afraid. OL2010 clients did and were able to connect to Exchange OL mailbox. This is until the point I switched on the Modern Auth at which point it failed. You mentioned earlier that it can be switched
 off (which I assume means go back to the previous&nbsp;operational state)&nbsp;which is exactly what I did but that doesn't let OL2010 clients to resume their connection the way they were before. Certainly it IS related to the original topic. If you can't help, I'm
 happy for you to get someone else who might be able to answer this but I don't see any point in opening a new thread.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I mean the original topic is some answered questions but the current one is an issue. Anyway, let’s troubleshoot it here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, we suggest you run the SaRA (Support and Recovery Assistant) tool by downloading it from the site below and then check if there is any improvement.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://diagnostics.office.com/#/?env=Exrca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.office.com/#/?env=Exrca</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, we need to collect some information below to better understand the situation:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The result after running SaRA.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Can you not open Outlook 2010 or it shows
<strong>Disconnected</strong> status? Are there any error messages?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are all user accounts hosted in on-premises?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Do you mean Outlook 2013 works fine all the time and only Outlook 2010 encounter this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Excel Cell Edit Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tkydon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Cell Edit Bug</h2>
                    <p>I had the same issue on my old Win7 64bit PC with Office 201x 32bit, and not on my new Win10 64bit PC with Office 2016 32bit.</p>
<p>I have several workbooks open on my desktop.</p>
<p>I am editing the cells in one of the workbooks.</p>
<p>I click in the Formula Bar, and edit the contents of the cell, and press enter - OK.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I try to click in to the Formula bar but nothing happens. Try again, nothing. I press the Enter key and Excel switches me to a different open workbook - Random.</p>
<p>I click in the Cell I want to edit, and In-Cell Editing starts. I edit the contents of the cell, and press enter - OK.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I&nbsp;<span>click in the Cell I want to edit, and In-Cell Editing starts. I edit the contents of the cell, and press enter, but the cell loses the change and
</span><span>Excel switches me to a different open workbook - Random.</span></p>
<p><span>I do some editing operation, say Copy Column and then Right Click for dropdown menu and select Insert Copied Cells - OK</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, I do the same operation&nbsp;<span>and then Right Click for dropdown menu and select Insert Copied Cells, but the Drop-Down Menu stays on the Screen, Excel goes Not Responding, and the only way to recover is to Check for Errors and Restart
 Excel... Probably because it was in the same state as above not allowing edits, but I don't press enter, it doesn't switch workbooks, and hangs Excel...</span></p>
<p><span>I have reported this several times, but no resolution.</span></p>

            As stated, this is a brand new PC with a brand-new install of Win10 64bit and Office 2016 32bit, and I am experiencing the same issue as I had on my old Win7 64bit and Office 2013 32bit. I haven't yet installed any Add-Ins. I don't think it's a Display
 Issue. I think it is a Bug in the code that controls the editing, or perhaps a switch in focus, which then does not respond correctly to request to edit the contents of the cell. It's a Bug. The problem did not exist in the previous previous PC with the versions
 of Win and Office that I used back then. The process and spreadsheets are exactly the same...<br />

<p>It would seem that with new FW those who have installed sport tracker are experiencing problems with GPS / OVI maps. Maybe it's your case too?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#47;Outlook 16 Send to mail recipient does not work.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 10 and Office 2016. I am trying to use the "Send to mail recipient" feature to send a photo via email. When I click on this, it closes the Photos program completely and does not open an email message window to
 send. I did select Outlook as the email default program via the Control Panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? I send lots of photos via email, so I really want to be able to use. I am not computer savvy, at all. So please dumb-down your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any information that you can provide!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a Office 365 Account and I got an invitation to a Microsoft Team but I am not able to see the space. The person who send me the invitation sent me to ask for tech support. What can I do about it?. Please, don't tell me to contact the IT Admin for
 the reason I stated before.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Carlos, thanks for offering yourself to help with this problem. Although it seems to be solved, I'm going to describe better the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I am part of an organization here and we use the Office 365 platform.</p>
<p>-I was invited as a guest and I was able to enter the application but I couldn't see the messages from the IT Admin's chat in the Team Space (Idk how you call it in Microsoft yet) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answer of the questions you made:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Could you describe the details of your issue? If it is available, could you provide a screenshot?.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Invitation to the Team</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb24ebf8-e854-4566-9719-6fcd806d4985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb24ebf8-e854-4566-9719-6fcd806d4985" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>What you see when you are in the Team (I wasn't able to see the messges from the chat)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f43f2e8-1980-4a5c-bacd-0b2efad6753f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f43f2e8-1980-4a5c-bacd-0b2efad6753f" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you get any error message?. <strong>No, I didn't.</strong><br />
</li><li>Is this a private team or public team?. <strong>Private. </strong><br />
</li><li>Are you in this organization?. <strong>Yes.</strong><br />
</li></ul>
<p><strong>What I did to solve it?. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I talked to the T-bot in the Team and it told me to contact the IT Admin in order to fix the problem.
</li><li>Then, I enter the forum to see if somebody could help me. </li><li>Also, I went to the page of the application in Microsoft and sent a message but I don't know if they receive it and they told me to "Contact your IT Admin for Tech Support" as well.
</li><li>I tried to get in touch through the Office 365 platform but i was a little difficult.</li></ul>
<p>It caught my attention that this application is for teaching purposes, when I tried to look up tech support I had to specify in a drop-down menu that it was a
<strong>Microsoft Team for Students</strong> (I don't remember exactly right now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's kind of difficult to find support for this application directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end, I sent an email to my boss and it seems like he fixed it because I haven't gotten a response from Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this guides other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nathalie.</p>

<p>
</p><p>IMHO, DVD Playback needs to be supported in Windows Media Player. There are free apps that can play DVD and media file types, why push Users to those apps when WMP should be able to do this and has in the past!

<p>I am a Windows Media Player bigot.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With the help of the K-lite codec pack WMP is by far the nicest player out there.</p>
<p>Unlike some (unnamed) players WMP has no nasty habits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me DVD playback is not a big thing and I have a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, if ya got the best, why not keep it that way!</p>

    <title>Upgrading a UEFI compliant pc running Windows 7 under BIOS with legacy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foozfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading a UEFI compliant pc running Windows 7 under BIOS with legacy boot to UEFI enabled and Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a UEFI compliant laptop, running Windows 7 Pro under BIOS with legacy boot mode. I've hesitated to enable UEFI because I seems that I would have to completely re-install Windows 7 and all my software.&nbsp; Would it be good to move to UEFI as part of
 upgrading my machine to Windows 10? If so, what things do I need to take into consideration?

<br />
Is old Office 2000 SP3 unable to open password protected Mac Office 2011's Word .docx in old, updated Windows XP Pro. SP3? If I remove its password when saving in Office Mac 2011 and opening it, then it is fine. Does the converter packs not recognize password
 protection or something? Opening is detected as Word 2007 format.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. :)

<p><span>Hi Jerry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Hey Cortana feature is turned off unless you activate it. Kindly follow the steps below to enable the feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Launch the Cortana app on your Android device.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Menu</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>Hey Cortana</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Toggle the switch to position <strong>On</strong> for <strong>From the Cortana app</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>Hey Cortana</strong> feature will not work when the phone is in standby mode, however you can follow the steps mentioned in the article below to enable Cortana on lock screen.

<p>Hi Peer, thanks, I can set Cortana as the digital assistant, but there is no option to use the 'hey Cortana' command, and no option to allow Cortana to read my text messages when connected to Bluetooth in the car.

<p>The links you mentioned are very old and do not apply to the latest version of Cortana.
</p>
<p>Please can you update your links/instructions ?</p>
<p>FYI when searching on the web, there are several articles that advise that Cortana for Android will do both the above requests - is this not true ?</p>

<p>1.Before suggesting a KB article, please made sure it's up to date. Your article mentions "notebook", which i understand was a popular film with the ladies, but there hasn't been a "notebook" in Cortana for Android for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Please try the solution on atesta device before suggesting a solution. The menu items you're referring to aren't in Cortana options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so confused right now. What is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

</p><p>Hello Microsoft - Still awaiting a resonse....</p>
<p>I have updated now to Cortana Version 3.3.0.... but no improvement..</p>
<p>I can set Cortana as the digital assistant, but there is no option to use the 'hey Cortana' command, and no option to allow Cortana to read my text messages when connected to Bluetooth in the car.
</p>
<p>The links you mentioned are very old and do not apply to the latest version of Cortana.
</p>
<p>Please can you update your links/instructions ?</p>
<p>FYI when searching on the web, there are several articles that advise that Cortana for Android will do both the above requests - is this not true ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate a reply..</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

The "Hey Cortana" feature is now enabled in the "Microsoft Launcher" settings. (Settings &gt; Cortana &gt; Listen for "Hey Cortana")

<p>We are living in an alternate reality where our 5 year old Windows phones would do things which the very latest Android phone find impossible, i. e., announcing text messages and then asking if we would like them read. I am not enjoying my change for the
 950XL to the Nokia 9. I am in fact nearly ready to go back to the 950 and devil take the hind most!</p>

</p><p>The image above shows the problem - when I start typing, the correct objects seem to be found, but the applications icons are missing. This goes both for "normal" programs and 'modern" apps.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 System Partition - Where is it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Win10 Enterprise</p>
<p>128GB SSD Drive</p>
<p>Clean Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Installed Win10 Enterprise on a test PC that was running Win8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Booted from a USB drive, started the installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the partition screen, deleted the existing System and Windows partitions, and then allocated all the drive space to the new install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 With Win7/8, this is where Windows would tell you it was creating a System partition and create the 100/350MB partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Win10, this did not happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just created the single partition and installed Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems installing Win10, and so far things are going well.&nbsp;&nbsp; But why no System partition?</p>

            Please when you are installing the windows you must switch off&nbsp; your pc while the installation media is inserted or inside the drive e.g a DVD Rom (windows OS inside) then switch it on and press F9 if it is a HP or other Harper Packard&nbsp; model or use F12
 if you using lenovo. Then choose which installation media you want to use DVD or USB make that installation media is there in your pc inserted. Then a certain message will tell you that press any key to boot but only when you are using CD/DVD to boot.<br />

            A picture of Disk Management might help.&nbsp; We don't know if you were installing in UEFI or MBR mode and whether other drives were involved.
