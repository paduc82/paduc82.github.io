<p>Hi Ram - Jaap is correct. In addition, this how to tip reference for media should help:&nbsp; "&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/music-pictures-videos-touch.aspx&nbsp;</p>
<p>and this more technical desktop KnowledgeBase reference to a fix for Windows Media Player might provide some additional insights&nbsp;if needed<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947403</a></p>

    <title>Mac PowerPoint Animation dropdown menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterbrooks4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac PowerPoint Animation dropdown menus</h2>
                    <p>PowerPoint Animation dropdown menus Effect Options, Timing, Text Animations cannot open.
</p>
<p>Powerpoint 2016 Mac Version 16.16.2 (180910). MacOS v. 10.13.6.<br />
Click on arrow of any of the 3 Animation Dropdown menus: Menu items drop down, but then immediately close.</p>
<p>So, the features in these menus are not available.</p>
<p>Same problem with either trackpad or external mouse.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in Sys Prefs, I tried setting double click speed to very slow - same problem.</p>
<p>No similar problems with menus or other single clicks in PowerPoint or other Office programs, or in any other program, excepting one case:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Google Calendar, forward and backward arrows: jump to 2nd time interval. For example, now showing month of October, click on forward arrow, goes to December and same for week view or other views, for both arrow directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fast repeated clicking will sometimes open the Animation Pane menus, making the options available. But this "solution" does not always work, and is obviously not a real fix. The repeated clicking might only work when clicking rapidly with one hand on
 mouse and a finger moving on trackpad.</p>
<p>If by chance, the multiple clicking opens the menus, when go to another open pptx file - menus are closed, and cannot be opened with a single click.</p>
<p>(And once menus do open by the multiple click "method", single click on arrow, begins to scroll close, but then immediately opens completely.)
</p>
<p>In the context of the Animation Pane menus, it seems that a single click is erroneously interpreted as a double click.</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, I would suggest you go to PowerPoint Online to check if you could open Animation dropdown menus Effect Options dropdown list to narrow down if the issue was caused by PowerPoint client or Device itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue only occur in PowerPoint client, I would suggest you try <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
accessing Safe Mode on Mac</a> to ensure it is not caused by 3rd party applications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I would like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Does the issue occur in all PowerPoint files or only in certain files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.When did the issue start to happen? What changes did you make before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Did you join in Office Insider Slow for Mac plan? Please share the screenshot of

<p>Hello Eli,</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt and detailed reply.</p>
<p>With the online PP, I was able to see the drop down animation effects choices, and choose paragraph for a bulleted text box.
</p>
<p>BTW, my main interest is ability to choose sequential appearance of 2nd or 3rd level hierarchy bullet points. (I did not see a menu item for the online version providing this feature.)
</p>
<p>As said in original, same effect with external mouse and trackpad. Maybe in some bizarre contexts, a single click is registered as 2 clicks - which would give the effect of beginning to open a drop down and then immediately closing. As said in first, the
 google calendar arrows give jumps of 2 months, as if a double click. </p>
<p>And, more relevant to MS Office, now with 16.16.2, in MS Word, double clicking on a word selects the paragraph rather than the single word, as if it were a triple click. (For this, I am fairly sure that it began after the 16.16.2 update.) When this began
 to happen, I thought maybe the Word engineers had decided to change the double click behavior, but it's likely this is also a bug (at least for me!).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One possible workaround - frustrating close to making this doable: In the animation pane, I can tab through the various choices. When on one of the 3 effects menus, the arrow is highlighted with a blue box. I tried typing the plus sign which often expands
 such menus, but not here. Might you suggest a keyboard move that would expand?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Trying again, I have repeated the odd combination that does expand the menu: rapid clicking on mouse with one hand plus slight drag on trackpad with a finger - then menu is frozen open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now, too many things in progress to close down and do a safe boot, but will do soon.</p>
<p>To your requests:</p>
<p>1. I cannot check every one of the many pptx on my laptop. I opened some from about a month ago. All tools, including Animation drop down menus were working fine then. But same problem now with these older files.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It may be that the problem began after a recent update to Office 16.16.2. But I am not completely sure about this. In any case, problem only began within last 2-3 weeks. I had not made any changes to any ppt preferences, or anything that seems relevant.</p>
<p>3. No I have not joined the Insider plan.</p>
<p>Here is screenshot - thanks for your interest to sort this out.</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the situation in Word and PowerPoint with the same version as you. They both work fine. So it might be something wrong with your Word and PowerPoint or Click. The issues in Word and PowerPoint might be caused by the same root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this situation, let's focus on PowerPoint first. Since the clicking can work fine in PowerPoint Online, it means your mouse works fine. But if it's convenient for you, please help check if the mouse driver is the latest version to ensure the issue
 is not caused by device itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To my knowledge, the situation is low relevant to PowerPoint settings. The changes I mean are related to Office update, Mac OS update and some System Preference like Mouse &amp; Trackpad you have checked, etc. It might be related to the 3rd party
 add-ins or application. So please share the result of Safe mode on your side to narrow down this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Eli</span></p>

<p>Hi Eli, Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for suggestions and prompt replies.</p>
<p>When I check for updates, 16.16.3 is not yet available. I live in France, so maybe release dates are different than US?</p>
<p>And indeed, I do use Antidote for writing in French. I have not taken the time to try to disable this as an add-in working within Office, without uninstalling all of Antidote. I mainly use Antidote as its stand-alone program.</p>
<p>I have not yet the time to do the safe reboot.</p>
<p>For now the weird workaround rapidly clicking mouse while moving a finger on track pad works.</p>
<p>I had asked about any keyboard shortcut to expand the Animation menus, as I can tab to their titles. Might you know of a shortcut? This would be an easy solution. I tried to make one in sys pref Keyboard but did not work.</p>
<p>I have OS 10.13.6 - no reason to go to 10.14 yet. I assumed that trackpad and mouse driver updates would be part of OS upgrades, no? Guiltless confession: still hammering away on an early 2011 MBPro.</p>

<p>Within last few days, Microsoft AutoUpdate says 16.16.3 is now available for installation.</p>
<p>When I get time, I will try diagnosis of the problems with safe reboot, and then install 16.16.3.</p>

<p>
</p><p>16.16.3 (181015) seems to be released on Oct 16 as the same time with 16.18 (181014). Is it right? Since I don't get any release update regarding version 16.16.3 that time, I know it can be available for users like version 16.18 which is released on Oct
 16 now. Thanks for your initial information.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Please try the following solution of repairing your office package:
<br />
<br />The first thing you can do is to navigate and select the start button
<br />2) Type in control panel
<br />3) Navigate to "Programs".
<br />4) Then select "Uninstall a Program"
<br />5) Then find your office installation and right click (Usually say Microsoft Office 2016 or something similar)
<br />6) Select change
<br />7) Now a window will pop asking for "Quick Repair" or "Online Repair"
<br />8) Select the Quick Repair option and reboot
<br />9) If the problem continues select the Online Repair option and reboot
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped or not, i will happily assist you further.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards
<br />Phillip Roos

<h2>            Excel Help - Macro to create new Worksheet copy of a Template Form &#40;in seperate worksheet&#41; and autocomplete with Data from Schedule Worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi , I would be very grateful if someone could help me out with the coding for the following spreadsheet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently working on a master spreadsheet to produce RFI's during a live contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a main worksheet with the rows of information for each RFI - please see below (ignore the conditional formatting, this is for internal use only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have a template RFI form which I want to <strong>1)</strong> duplicate with the aid of an ActiveX button located on the main schedule worksheet
<em>(I know how to create this button but not the coding to perform the above)</em>,
<strong>2)</strong> Fill the form in using the information from the first sheet (i.e. project name, number, address etc. Then more importantly RFI No. from column A, RFI Description from Column C, Issued By(Originator) in Column&nbsp; and Issued to in Column H.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea being that each time the new worksheet is created (once prompted with the activeX button) it is auto-filled with the next row of information from the schedule (i.e. RFI001, RFI002, RFI003 and so on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new worksheet should be named as per the RFI number in Column A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this is quite a challenge and not sure if its even possible, but any help would be fantastic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f9e077c-f38b-4842-9454-571048cc9bc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f9e077c-f38b-4842-9454-571048cc9bc0" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd96fbf7-c5b6-4b37-b57c-09b825ffcc27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd96fbf7-c5b6-4b37-b57c-09b825ffcc27" /></a></p>

<p>I can not give you a complete example, because that's one of the things that I make my living.<br />
<br />
But the concept is quite simple:<br />
<br />
Within the template sheet create named cells, but the names must refer to the template sheet, not the Workbook!<br />
<br />
The named cells should reflect the heading of your data sheet, means the simplest possible scenario is that you have a named range "Test" in the template sheet and a heading "Test" in your data sheet.<br />
<br />
After you've copied the template sheet, visit each cell in the headings in the data sheet and try to access the named range in the copied sheet (use an error handler to handle not exists names).<br />
<br />
If you found a named range, use INTERSECT and get the value from the column with the heading and e.g. the current row =&gt; Value = Intersect(ThisHeader, ActiveCell.EntireRow) and write it into.<br />
<br />
That's all.<br />
<br />
Andreas. </p>

<h2>            Excel 2003 Startup Configuration  </h2>
                    
<p>Installed with new computer 4 yrs ago, Excel as part of Office Professional 2003 now goes through a configuration step the first time I try to use Excel after a fresh boot.&nbsp; Recently started doing this.&nbsp; None of the other Office programs does this.&nbsp; They
 just start right up as always.</p>
<p><br />
Excel does eventually start without further intervention, but it wastes a lot of time over and over.&nbsp; What can I do to return Excel to its original state?</p>

<p><br />
Thanks to anyone who can help me out!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off I wish to say I am not a techy person, so any responses need to be basic and easily understood by this non-techy person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently received an Apple Ipad 2017. I am using the Hotmail App rather than the mail app on the Ipad because Hotmail was not performing well on the Apple Mail App. Since I loaded the Hotmail app, almost everything with Hotmail is working very well. The
 one issue I am having is that I can't get the Drafts Folder to sync between my Ipad and my desktop computer. Any draft created will only appear on the device it was created on. All other folders sync perfectly. This gets frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help this non-techy person to get her Drafts folders to sync.</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1,
 and 10, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,&nbsp; 8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box
 for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
&nbsp;When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />

<span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook.
 If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>If there are multiple addressees in either the To or CC fields of the data source, the email addresses need to be separated by a semi-colon.</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle “Compound” MergeFields such as the «AddressBlock» or «GreetingLine».</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Instead of using those fields, you will need to insert the individual merge fields.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />

<h2>            Word 2016 high CPU makes it unusable &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Word 2016 as part of my university's Office365 subscription for several months now, and recently it has become so slow it is almost unusable. CPU usage jumps to 30-50% while typing, creating a lag on input that displays characters 1-2 seconds
 after I hit the keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only add-in I use is Zotero, and I have tested with it disabled but it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Lenovo Yoga with 4gb RAM and Core i5-3337U running Win10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest anything? There are lots of posts about Word 2013 having problems, and about Word 2016 on OSX having problems, but few/none about Word 2016 on Windoes 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. I'm trying to write my PhD thesis and Word is making it extremely difficult.</p>

    <title>Office For Mac 2011 reinstallation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r_dg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office For Mac 2011 reinstallation</h2>
                    Hi all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apologies if I picked the wrong 'Office Topic' for my question, there wasn't really one that fitted ideally.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My 2012 Macbook Air recently failed and upon reboot Disk Utility showed no drives aside from the base OX System. No Macintosh HD, no nothing. So all software data is lost (files/media are thankfully backed up), and the laptop is with Apple awaiting a new
 HD.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So this pertains to my Office for Mac Home and Business Version 2011 that was installed on the previous HD and is now gone. As the MB Air has no CD drive, I bought the install from the MS website as a .exe download, and still have the product key. My question
 is what are my options going forward for reinstalling Office? Will i be able to reinstall through a back up .exe download, or am I expected to purchase a whole new package?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help you can give me!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best</div>
<div>Rob</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as you still have your 25-characters product activation key you can reinstall your office license.

            Hi Mark,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just wanted to confirm that the download link is for Office for Mac 'Home and Business' 2011, or are specifics such as this just determined when I enter my product activation key?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also I forgot to mention, my original purchase of the license was through my employer's Microsoft Office Home Use Program - in case this is of relevance.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again for all your help.</div>

            the download itself is universal.<br />
When you put in your key determines what gets unlocked and locked<br />
If you bought a home business key that is what you will end up with.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the issue, please try the following method to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Reset OneDrive for Business client via the following command</span></p>
<p><em><span><strong>%localappdata%\microsoft\onedrive\onedrive.exe /reset</strong></span></em></p>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>The OneDrive system tray icon on the desktop should disappear and re-appear after a minute or two. If the OneDrive system tray icon does not re-appear after a few minutes, run the following in the run window:&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>%localappdata%\microsoft\onedrive\onedrive.exe</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>2. Unlink your OneDrive for Business account.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Restart your PC and then sign in with your account again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do any&nbsp;other users in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
2. P lease try to use the same account to&nbsp;login to your OneDrive for Business via browser to check whether this issue is related to the Office 365 account.<br />
3.Please provide a screenshot of the error message for our reference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Allan</span></p>

            <p>I had tried the /reset info already. No other users so, so this is isolated. I can login into portal.office.com and do all O365 activities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this error everytime I reboot or manually try and start the onedrive service. After I click close, the Trayicon disappears. Event Viewer info is below. Thanks</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I would suggest you uninstall the OneDrive native client and reinstall it again to see the outcome.<br />
&nbsp;1. Log in your system as Administrator &gt; open command prompt &gt; run<strong> taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe</strong><br />
&nbsp;2. run <strong>%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall</strong> to uninstall OneDrive.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: For 32-bit Windows, replace syswow64 to system32.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then download and install the OneDrive for Business client via the link below:<br />

<p><br />
It returns an error because it's not a logical formula.</p>
<p>If you want to average G2:G48 if D2:D48 = 10 or 12...</p>
<p>Try this array formula**:</p>
<p>=AVERAGE(IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(D2:D48,{10,12},0)),G2:G48))</p>
<p>** array formulas need to be entered using the key combination of CTRL,SHIFT,ENTER (not just ENTER). Hold down both the CTRL key and the SHIFT key then hit ENTER.</p>

    <title>Power Point &#34;flicker&#34;. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Power Point &#34;flicker&#34;.</h2>
                    Been using vista w/2007 PP for years. Worked fine. But out of nowhere when I go to full screen I see a "flicker" that occurs about every minute or so. For about a half second a horizontal black bar appears right in the middle of the display. After about
 15 minutes of this flickering, the whole display blanks out. I don't see any flicker when I'm in preview mode but only when I bring up the full display.

            <p>It's possible that this is a hardware problem that's triggered by something PPT's doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, depending on your slide show settings, PPT might be changing the video resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the Slide Show tab on the ribbon and look for monitor resolution settings; if it's not set to Use Current Resolution (or words to that effect) change it to that, or at least set it to whatever resolution your monitor's currently set for.&nbsp; Then try
 the slide show again to see if this helps.</p>

    <title>4 second delay before touch screen is active nokia 920 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enyot  say:</h3>
<h2>            4 second delay before touch screen is active nokia 920</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; I have seen people posting issues with a delay before their touch screen becomes active.
<br />
My nokia 920 has just developed this problem and it's not just an annoying second or split second.&nbsp; After pressing the power key the screen lights up but does not respond to touch for 4 seconds.<br />
The problem is the same when I'm in a call.&nbsp; I finish the call, and I have to wait 4 seconds before I can hang up.</p>
<p>Basically any time the screen shuts down I must wait 4 seconds before it responds.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soft resets didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; I love my WP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd love an answer if anyone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers. Andy</p>

<h2>            DISM and SFC no longer run</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trouble downloading 10586, and when I tried running DISM or SFC, the following error messages show up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For DISM, when I run "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth":</p>
<p><strong>Error: 11</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>You cannot service a running 64-bit operating system with a 32-bit version of DISM.</strong><br />
<strong>Please use the version of DISM that corresponds to your computer's architecture.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log</strong><br />
</p>
<p>And for SFC, when I run "sfc /scannow":</p>
<p><strong>Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current build is 10576 64-bit. This was through an upgrade from 10565, and in this previous build (and even the older ones) DISM and SFC were working as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just hope that they'll provide the ISO of the next official release.</p>

            <p>I'm afraid I don't have any idea of why DISM or SFC would decide it was the 32-bit version. As I'm sure you know, they're included with the OS release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, I guess you could go back to 10565 and check whether DISM and SFC run correctly there. &nbsp;If they do, then you could update directly to 10586. &nbsp;Otherwise, as you say, just wait for the 10586 ISO, which should be coming soon if it's really the
 RTM for the Fall Release.</p>

<h3> hidrologo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I recover my wife&#39;s SKYPE account as it was&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My wife and I are long time PAYING Skype users. We established a US phone number and I use it as my normal phone number.</p>
<p>We now live in Spain and I want to maintain the account as it is. Recently, Skype required my wife to connect her SKYPE&nbsp; account to a microsoft account and she used my Hotmail account. In the process of merging it, appears that we have lost our SKYPE account.
 On all our machines instead of entering Skype automatically, we are asked for a username and password for the microsoft account. In the meantime, Skype considers my wife a new user. I had my daughter call our US number and she gets a leave message recording,
 and there is no rings on any of our Skype devices in Spain. I have used Skype for over 20 years and all my accounts, business stuff, taxes, EVERYTHING is linked to my US phone which has now stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this. If we establish a new microsoft account in Spain and link to it, will we be able to keep the US characteristics of the account, or do I need to have someone in the US establish a microsoft account in my wife's name to link and keep the
 characteristics. My wife is also complaining that she has lost her US contacts in the transition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this fixed fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help, Carl&nbsp;</p>

                    Edge Takes up to much top header space on my screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use an alternate browser too, allowing more website/page space like IE allows.

    <title>How do I add to Outlook &#40;desktop version, Windows&#41; a PANE, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aw-chaos  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add to Outlook &#40;desktop version, Windows&#41; a PANE, which contains all email correspondents, so if I click on a name, I see all emails to&#47;from that person</h2>
                    <p>To be clear...</p>
<p>I was visiting an office. I saw someone had their Outlook set up this way.</p>
<p>There was a pane, it had a lot of names.</p>
<p>1 line per name, and JUST the name.</p>
<p>When the user clicked on a name, all emails from/to (?) that person appeared in a different window/pane to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not talking about just sorting by "from".</p>
<p>It was a separate pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must have this! &nbsp;:-)</p>

                    I know one can choose to work offline once Outlook is started, I am looking for a command line switch for the case where Outlook is not already offline when it was closed.
