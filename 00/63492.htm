    <title>wrong icon in media player - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            wrong icon in media player</h2>
                    Once I bought a music album online but didn't like the quality and deleted it. I have since copied the same music, only much better, form some old, but good quality vinyl records. When I play this music on Windows Media Player the icon of the deleted music
 appears on the screen. This is irksome because the artists are of much better quality than is shown on this icon. I don't care about icons when my music plays but displaying wrong info goes too far. Help ?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like Windows Media player is showing the wrong icon information for medias.
</p>

<p>This issue normally occur when the media player library is corrupted. </p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>Tried all that. No success. </p>
<p>I don't mind having no labels and icons shown in WMP at all but if they persist at least they have to be the correct ones. Is that asking to much?</p>
<p>One small snippet of info might help here. The music is Russian and the title is written in cyrillic. That shouldn't make a difference but the NCH Wavepad Sound Editor regards it as an unsupported file type although it is wav.</p>

            <p>I have solved my own problem but I think others may benefit from this experience.</p>
<p>Firstly the music in question is Rachmaninov's Vespers. Quite accidentally&nbsp;I found amongst my old vinyl records the Sheshnikov version which is regarded as the "Gold standard" for this music. I bought another version from classicsonline (Korniev) but found
 it quite poor in quality and of course not op to the Sheshnikov standard. So I diced the Korniev music and after thorough cleaning and polishing the vinyl I copied the Sheshnikov version into my music\Rachmaninov\Vespers . The quality is quite acceptable.
 By the way the Sheshnikov version is available online only in vinyl or copies from vinyl and are scratchier than my own records. When I played this music the Korniev icon appeared in the Windows Media Player's window. After Methods 1 ans 2 hereabove failed
 to solve the problem I&nbsp; copied one of the Sheshnikov pieces into the Rachmaninov\Piano Concerto folder. When this copy played the Korniev icon did not appear. I then copied one movement of the Piano Concerto into the Vespers folder and the Piano concerto played
 quite happily in WMP with the Korniev icon. So the icon was clearly associated with the Folder. After copying all the Vespers into a temp file, deleting the Vespers folder and renaming the temp folder to "Vespers" the Sheshnikov music now plays without the
 Korniev icon. I can't remember where I had filed the downloaded Korniev version but I am fairly cetain that that was in the same "Vespers" folder. A vexing problem with a simple solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h2>            Windows trial for Parallels</h2>
                    I'm try to load a trial version of Windows in a trial version of Parallel 11. I have a small program that won't run natively on my mac laptop but that I need for my research. I'm hoping it will work in the VM but I'm not sure. So I want to try it in a
 trial before I buy the software. I can't seem to find a windows install that doesn't immediately require a license key.

<h2>            windows 10 won&#39;t connect to the store and not able to log in but browsing works just fine</h2>
                    I upgraded my laptop to windows 10&nbsp;yesterday from windows 7 and since them I've been trying to connect to windows with an account and i'm just not able to it, also the store does not works and also seems like the windows update is also not working, and
 in the store says the error is 0x80072EFD. I think what is causing this to happen is the proxy setting in which the windows does not allow me to change it to automatic and it just makes me leave it in manual. I'm trying to find a solution to it for the past
 day I will be very glad if someone can come up with an&nbsp;answer. I don't now if&nbsp;interferes the location because i'm in Brazil right now. Thanks a lot!!

<h2>            Asus N552vw Shot Down Suddenly</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have an Asus laptop and I upgraded my windows from 1703 to windows 10&nbsp; v1805 yesterday. As soon as the upgrade is done, my battery never gone full charge,it always lock on 81% an steel be charging, I disconnected my power adapter and proceed to use it.
 As soon as the power adapter is unplugged, the laptop just power off and shutdown without warning. This had never occurred before on v1703. I would assume this is a software issue since it occurred right away after my windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the sudden shutdown, I tried to power up my laptop and it would not power up. However, it would power up when I plugged the power adapter back on the laptop. Laptop works fine with the power adapter plugged it. However, I would prefer not to do that
 since having my power source constantly connected to my laptop when the battery is at full can kill my battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe this is an issue with the hardware of my laptop since it came up right away after windows 10 upgrade had completed. I would assume windows 10 somehow had changed some of my original settings to cause this to occur. Please let me know if
 this is a known bug and if future updates will fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Reza
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you have not yet applied these updates, make sure you do so:
<br />
<br />BIOS Update from December 2016
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N552VW/N552VWAS300.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N552VW/N5...</a>
<br />
<br />There was also a chipset drive update from September 2015
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N552VW/Chipset_Intel_Skylate_Win10_64_VER101112.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N552VW/Ch...</a>
<br />
<br />Apply these updates to see if they improve stability.
<br />
<br />If these updates do not help, its possible you might have downgrade back to your previous version.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />How to go back...
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

<p>Hi Reza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sometimes happens when upgrading to a newer edition/version of Windows 10, on some devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that there is no such thing as Windows 10 version 1805 (there is a version 1803 and 1809 respectively) released to public (1903 will be released soon) it would help to know exactly which version of windows 10 that the device is on (1803 or 1809). Find
 this at Settings&gt;System&gt;About.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, many that found their devices in this state of being were able to resolve the issue by following the instructions at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-battery-plugged-in-not-charging-for-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-battery-plugged-in-not-charging-for-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do note that most laptop manufacturers include their own <span>proprietary</span> power (battery) control apps so do check with your OEM (Asus) support page for your exact model for any updates accordingly. (As a matter of fact an Asus laptop that I own
 that is about 4 to 5 years old (Win 8 OEM now on Win 10 v.1809) recently "suddenly" (it worked yesterday) quit charging, all attempts at software/driver manipulation equaled the same result. I then determined that the battery capacity had dropped below acceptable
 thresholds, US $13.25 later all was then, and is still now, good, it happens (the downside of lithium ion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you by a battery try this:</p>

<p>Hi Reza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver(s) (software) that controls a hardware device can become negatively affected (this is why uninstalling and reinstalling the battery driver(s) resolved the not charging issue for many of the few that this happens to). Damage to a physical hardware
 device would be highly unusual (or non-existent?). Incompatibility of a hardware device and or the drivers/firmware that control it can become an issue when upgrading to a new feature update (edition of Windows) (affectively a new OS) as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most typical causes of a failed feature update are 3rd party anti-virus programs, incompatible drivers, and incompatible or outdated (unsupported) 3rd party programs or apps.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Reset Windows Update</h2>
                    How can I stop wuauserv.exe? I tried to reset the Windows Update manually, as described in&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/de</a>.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But if I try to stop it, I get an error, saying: The service ist starting or stopping. Please try again alter.</div>
<div>It never stops. When I tried step 4, for each command I get an error saying: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do?</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks Lisa</div>

<h2>            windows 10, edge and hotmail problems</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 (which I'm rapidly regretting) I've discovered some problems - it's bad enough not being able to "flick" between programmes when using Chrome (which I prefer) so I've now had to resort to Edge.&nbsp;
<br />
The two problems I'm now encountering are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; sending emails using my Hotmail account via Edge - I send an email (which does send) ..... but the email stays on the screen with no way to exit - I have to resort to using the "back" arrows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; it's impossible to add an attachment - I find the attachment, click and it and ....... I get thrown out of the email I've written and back to the inbox.&nbsp; I've even tried saving the email as a draft before trying the attachment but still it doesn't work.&nbsp;
 Really annoying when I have to send dozens of emails with attachments!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resorted to Google Chrome to send the emails .... no problem ...... but then I can't flick between programmes :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have these problems and, if so, how did they resolve them (short of reverting back to their previous Windows version).</p>
<p />

<div>2. Look for the service Print Spooler. Double click on it and click Stop under service status.</div>
<div>3. Go to the following location: C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS</div>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#58; Can&#39;t Adjust Screen resolution&#58; VPN Dell Sonicwall</h2>
                    With support from our IT company, we still have not been able to resolve the problem of when I work remotely and VPN into our server going through a Dell SonicWALL the screen resolution causes the display to be extremely small. We've tried every possible
 screen display adjustments on the Surface Pro; we've conducted internet searches for a solution; but nothing seems to work.

            <p>On the Surface, went to Display Settings/Advanced Display Settings; please keep in mind I'm using the Surface docking stating where I have 2 24" monitors; in the Duplicate Desktop on 1 and 2 resolution is set at 1920x1080 which is what works best when I
 am using the dual monitor configuration.</p>
<p>I've reviewed the various advanced settings options. </p>
<p>I believe this issue is not the anything that can be adjusted to the display settings of the Surface; rather there's an issue with the Dell Sonic Wall; but as of now our IT guys have not been able to figure out what can be changed on the Sonic Wall to improve
 resolution/size of icons/files.</p>

<h2>            Skype phone is muted when typing</h2>
                    <p>i use Skype for business for 2016.&nbsp; I typicaly take notes in Outlook email or in OneNote during Skype calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHenever i type a d on my keyboard the Skype call is put on mute.&nbsp; i cannot hear the other people on the uncall until i "unmute" Skype.&nbsp; it doesn't seem matter if i am in a microsoft app (OneNote, Outlook) or some other app (chrome).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this was working fine until recently.&nbsp; i have upgraded Win10 to rel 2 but not clear this is the reason behind the problem.&nbsp; i have looked at the skpye options to see if there is somethinng about typing a "d" causes the call to be put on mute but i cannot
 find anything.&nbsp; i have found it is the letter d causes this every time.</p>

            I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem.

<p>Hi Perry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, "d" isn't the Keyboard shortcuts to mute in Skype for Business. In this situation, it is suggested to reboot your PC without other programs and check if the issue persists. If not, there might be a conflict between Skype for Business and
 another program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please do the followings for further assistance:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can sign into another PC to narrow down the issue.&nbsp;</li><li>Please make sure the Skype for Business is up to date. You can see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3123065/how-to-obtain-the-latest-update-for-skype-for-business-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to update Skype for Business 2016</a>.</li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2769349/repair-process-for-an-office-click-to-run-application-does-not-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Have a repair</a> and check if it works.&nbsp;</li></ol>

    <title>Empty folders after W10 update 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gianmarco ria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty folders after W10 update 1809</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I have a critical issue. A few hours ago I updated my laptop to the 1809 Windows 10 version. After the reboot my Documents and Pictures folders are empty! Desktop, Download and Music folders are ok. In the C: disk a windows.old folder has been
 created but the folders inside are also empty.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;C:\Users\my_name and in&nbsp;C:\Users\my_name\Onedrive I have duplicate folders. The Download folder containing my files is outside of Onedrive, while Desktop folder containg old files is insiede&nbsp;Onedrive.</p>
<p>Finally I tried a search of old files using command prompt (by administrator). None of my files were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone having this issue?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>

            Hi Gianmarco
<br />
<br />A few users are reporting this over the last few days, and it is not looking good. Please do not roll back that update in the hope of finding your files - honestly, that won't work!
<br />
<br />What has worked for a few users is, Restart (not **** down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . ..

<h2>            Upload Studio</h2>
                    Hey guys, So I wanna ask a couple of questions concerning Upload Studio. First off, am I allowed to upload a vid of just myself talking, without game footage? It would be a convenient way of making solo podcast vids. Second, are vids created with Upload
 Studio allowed to be monetized on YouTube, provided that any footage is either solely owned by me, or the usual permission from whatever game developer? I just want to make sure there's nothing on MS' s end, especially as I'd like to use one of the Upload
 Studio skins. Thanks!

<h2>            Windows Media doesn&#39;t see TV signal or cable card</h2>
                    I have Vista Home Premium with Windows Media Center. I have a ATI TV Wonder Digital Cable Tuner w/cable card slot. I bought it when I bought my Dell. In January I hook the tuner to my satelite receiver and kept getting TV signal not detected. I called
 Dell and Direct TV. Neither could figure it out. Dell sent another tuner. Still same problem. I held off until this month&nbsp;when I ordered Verizon FIos. I got a cable card. Still I get TV sinal not detected from Media Center. Again Dell can't figure it out nor
 could Verizon. Can someone help?

<span>Hi Rharb,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest you first follow the troubleshooting steps on the following page and see the result, especially the steps in "Why is there no TV signal on any standard TV channel":

<h2>            Sniper Elite V2 ver COD</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Well i guess the next game I will be&nbsp;running for the longest will be (Sniper Elite V2) for its the most realistic sniper game that i have found, Right now it's just a&nbsp;FREE TRIAL VER.<br />
It's in the DEMO area in the XBOX360&nbsp;games,&nbsp;But i have Pree ordered it.(5-2-2012) Drop date.&nbsp;For all of the COD games they list in the guns.(GUN RANGE). Hand gun has limited range,&nbsp;In COD&nbsp;someone that is&nbsp;in a last stance can shoot a sniper from across the map
 in one shot with a hand gun (We all have had that done to us).In this old but new game.(The old Xbox),&nbsp;<br />
Theres no (Quick Scope) (RUN-N-GUN) for you have to make a REAL SHOT !! And range is for REAL (Bullet drop and windage).<br />
For you have to addjust for the wind and range (not like COD'S where you aim for a head in the crosshairs and head shot right off the bat!) and it is VERY GRAFIC!! when you watch the bullet cam, None of&nbsp;this (money shots like in COD MW3&nbsp;) where all you see
 is money pop out,&nbsp;This is like&nbsp;back to the REAL&nbsp;OLD SCHOOL&nbsp;COD style from the PC days of COD BIG RED ONE.COD1 COD2 kinda stuff, Where here you get to see bullet damage to one's body (Bones and Brains,Guts and all that nassy stuff) Fly allover the place!! Even
 tho i have ELITE COD MW3 i think ill play it still but when the Sniper EliteV2 ill be over there doing the
<br />
CO OP and the missions .<br />
<br />
L8R and happy camping!! <br />
<br />

<p>Yeah, I pre-ordered it as well, $45 bucks... I saved a lot of money and got the "Kill the Fuher" (need the double dots on the u) bonus mission as well.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Oh and this cannot be compared to CoD, to compare it would be a disgrace to Sniper Elite. The gameplay is TOTALLY different. Bullet Ballistics and damage mean squat in CoD. In CoD you can quickscope, now do that in SEV2. XD</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Ghost Recon is a good one,So is battlefeild .&nbsp;But as far as snipeing, On&nbsp;COD&nbsp;WAW was&nbsp;a beast! Then it went down hill from there,&nbsp;MW3 like has like&nbsp;only one map that you can half way
 snipe on, Other then just laying in a hallway with a 50cal&nbsp;and wateing for someone to enter the hall way, to me thats not snipeing. Dont get me wrong i do realy like all the COD'S for i have them all!<br />
And play them all .(other then the&nbsp;few thats been hacked to death)&nbsp;<br />
It's just a prefrance of playing type. <br />
Then agen why do they give you all these fancy snipers and no map to use them on?<br />
I&nbsp;would like to see a few more maps for a real good sniper fest with a few run-n-gunners to stur things up a bit :-)<br />
Kinda like the maps from COD4 MW wow many maps for a good 600m kill ! :-)<br />
Not saying that i want the old maps to run in MW3 but somthing of the sorts :-)<br />

<h2>            Windows HOMEGROUP network when changing to new computer</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am replacing my current computer with a brand new one. This will be my main computer. My current computer is set up with HOMEGROUP network and has a password associated with it. I have two other laptops attached to the current HOMEGROUP which use this password.<br />
How do I go about setting up my new machine for HOMEGROUP - will I need to change anything on my laptops so that all machines can see each other.<br />
Thanks.<br />

            It depends which machine hosts the Homegroup.<br />
<br />
Leave the Homegroup on all machines. Then create a Homegroup on your new machine, note the password and join the laptops to the new Homegroup.<br />
<br />
Machines can only be a member of one Homegroup at a time, but can leave and join another Homegroup.
