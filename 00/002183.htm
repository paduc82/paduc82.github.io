<h2>            Detected Items List Always Empty</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Security Essentials for a number of months now, but have not removed my prior virus software as yet.&nbsp; I am using Windows Firewall with Advanced security as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;observed that following a full scan with Security Essentials, the&nbsp;History Tab, with &nbsp;"All Items Detected" selected,&nbsp;list box is empty, yet if I run Trend or Sypbot subsequent to a full scan, both detect items.&nbsp; Is this due to the low severity of the
 threats?&nbsp; Or something else?</p>

Different antimalware tools have different policies, different detection techniques.. Different threshold levels .. If it is&nbsp;Trend or Sypbot you have to consider posting their forums as well...&nbsp;

    <title>Upgrading to Hotmail Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shp_shp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Hotmail Plus</h2>
                    We are a small company of 10 and we use outlook.com to handle our company email. We have about 10 member accounts to our domain and we would all like to upgrade to Hotmail Plus for more space. Do we have to upgrade each email address (entering the credit
 card information and paying for each email address) or could we log in with our main account and register for Hotmail Plus through that one and it would automatically upgrade all of our registered accounts to hotmail plus? I'm guessing you'd have to pay for
 each one, but I'd just like to be sure how it works before going through with it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the error that you received, it can be that the email account that you are trying to send emails to has been banned due to detected spam activity. You should first contact in a different way (by phone or text message) the person you are sending an
 email to and ask what is wrong with the account. Also, the links that you have provided are supposed to be filled up and filed for the Outlook.com Team to review. It will be reviewed but there's no definite time as to when the issue you are getting will be
 resolved. Moving forward, I will also search for other steps that can help you solve this concern. Thanks and Merry Christmas!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I received states that I am the banned sender though, so it's not the recipient. It even provdes my IP, which I've removed.</p>
<p>Preventing the banned sender from even emailing the delisting email seems like an oversight on Microsoft's part as it becomes impossible to get removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I have no other way to contact the recipient. They contacted me via email, and that's all I have in order to get back to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did fill in the form, they found no issues and, when I contacted them for further information, informed me that I need to try support. Other users with this issue have received help from Microsoft support engineers on this forum, so that's what I have
 to wait for I guess, as there appears to be no other way to get in touch with them, especially if they are going to request the full header information from me like they have in other situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help though. :)</p>

</p><p>2. When I tried to add a google account today, well no luck. I tried Outlook's auto account setup but it found no settings. I then set this account up manually with the recommended settings that google said to use, it kept coming back asking for my password
 which was right as I tested the account. &nbsp;Note: I did tell gmail to use imap and also pop3 in it's mail forwarding tab before doing this so all was set on the Google side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked for 6 hours trying to figure this thing out and found out that Outlook and other email clients do NOT keep up with the security protocols for Outlook 2010 etc. I then found out that I could tell gmail to use the old less secure email protocol to
 allow Outlook to work using the settings I set up and it then worked. They did warn me about using the older security protocol makes my system more vulnerable to spam etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS needs to put out an update with the latest security protocols to this type of problem is not an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the links to help you understand this issue and for MS to see what the problem appears to be with not being able to connect with Gmail or maybe other email systems that stay up to date. Because of MS switching to office 365 from hotmail's old system,
 as to Outlook, MS has not make syncing on a daily basis available to outlook.com users, so we are forced to go to other email systems such as gmail, yahoo etc.</p>

            Setting up as IMAP still requires you to change the gmail account to less secure or to the older method of using an account - MS needs to update outlook to work with this updated security method. Please check into this further so this can be done as I

    <title>Audio lag in video created from presentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellen jacks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio lag in video created from presentation</h2>
                    <p>I just created a video from a PPT presentation. I recorded the audio directly to the slides. Some of my slides have animations (text call outs appearing, images moving to reveal additional text, etc.). In those slides, the audio is not starting until the
 first animation. I timed the animations to the audio, so there are several silent sections, then all the audio for the entire slide plays following the animation. &nbsp;I am using PPT 2013 with Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio does not appear in the Animation Pane. Here is a screenshot of an animation pane from one of the slides:&nbsp;https://www.screencast.com/t/YX9iaWm6F9 There should be 49 seconds of audio prior to the picture moving, but the audio for the entire slide
 does not start until the animation at 49 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            windows 10 restarts itself</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new lenova tower with windows 8 pre installed, as the supplier could not supply me with a windows 10 product. I down loaded windows 10 from the invitation from Microsoft when I first &nbsp;started the system up.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have installed&nbsp;microsoft word and
 Norton security. I have now checked for any corruption and it is ok. The problem is when I shut the computer down after a few minutes it starts itself up.</p>

                    "You attempted to reach blu173.mail.live.com but the certificate is not valid. This is probably not the site you are looking for! Instead you've reached a server IDs itself as mail.live.com. This maybe caused by a misconfig on the server or by something
 else. An attacker on your network could be trying to get you to visit a fake version of blu173.mail.live.com."The page turned red and made this above statement after I typed in my Outlook user name and password then clicked log in. I did not go further when
 I saw this warning page above mentioned.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked on various forums for solutions. I have tried the following but when I go back into either Chrome or IE Browsers I still get the red warning page above mentioned. So the certificates are some how gone bad as I checked on them in Chrome by clicking
 on the "chk certificates". Under untrusted certs, I found about six untrusted certs there. The one above at hand is fraudulent as claimed by Google Chrome browser. Its named live.mail.com. Which is one of my logins for outlook.com or live.mail.com. The Chrome
 browser search window turns green at first with https:// in front end of addr but then goes to the red warning screen. I use 16 digits for my pw and I have changed it 3x. I have assigned two step login to my acct but after using this method to login, I still
 am taken to the red warning page in Chrome 27 and IE-8. I have cleared browsing history and cookies and ipconfig/flushdns before I try my login to outlook in either browser I still get the red warning pages,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So there you have it. Please reply with some solutions if possible. Note I have the special app setup for my cell phones, so I am able to log into a 3 of my cell phones using the special 1x password app on the cell phone config email page. So I can still
 get into my outlook email acct on the cell phones but not on my laptop computer.&nbsp;</div>

            Yeah, I checked out your recommendations to verify whether or not I am actually logged into my correct authenticated MS Outlook server. And yes when I hoover over any of my folders including my inbox folder I do see the following address in my lower left
 hand corner inside my email acct. Which is "blu173.mail.live.com/# but when I hover over just the OUTLOOK logo top left inside my email account on Outlook I just see "blu173.mail.live.com. Also in the Chrome browser text input search bar, I see this address:&nbsp;<a href="https://blu173.mail.live.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blu173.mail.live.com/default.aspx</a>.&nbsp;
<div>I have updated my MS Support ticket as partly solved tonite. Here I will also share with the Community Class..... how I was able to get back into my Outlook acct inbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I turned off my antivirus program Kaspersky. Then opened a new tab in Chrome Ver 27 browser, logged into Outlook like this: Https://mail.live.com, then type in my email user name and pw, then click on my two step code request to send a single text code
 message to my cell phone. I retrieve the text and typed it into the Outlook code box. It takes me right away to my Outlook inbox.... So thats it. The Two step verification works beautifully and I would recommend it to any one wanting an additional security
 login step.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tonite I will be running a FULL out SCAN w/Kaspersky Antivirus. Then Tomorrow I will be working with Kaspersky antivirus Tech Support to resolve this issue as to whether I have a virus or trojan or malware that has masqueraded as a third party login in
 Chrome Ver 27 browser, as software that issued the red warning screen above mentioned that I had reached a page that was saying that Outlook.com had a invalid certificate and was not to be trusted. So do not continue to log in unless you want to go to a page
 that is unsafe and pretending to be Outlook.com. So of course I did not go further, but did delete the page.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It goes deeper. So I checked out the Chrome/settings/advanced... under Https/manage certificates. I located the tab called untrusted publishers, there was one called "login.live.com" along with 5 other ones. Which are: addons.mozilla.org, login.yahoo.com,
 login.skype.com, mail.google.com, www.google.com, global trustee. All these have in the right hand &nbsp;column tab&gt; Fraudulent Certificates. A rather gasping thought.... I do say.... so how did these get there??? Good question...And good that Chrome and of course
 IE ver 8, did tag these for me as Untrusted Publishers. So someone has bought these domain names and/or another domain name then rerouted/cloaked to look like these untrusted publisher domains above mentioned. But the addresses of where they are physically
 located and other verifiable info do not match the authenticate owners of the original SSL certificates. Good catch on Chrome and IE's part. Now how to rid one's computer of the virus or trojan that is lurking around waiting to implement itself the minute
 I turn back Kaspersky and try to re: login on to Outlook. Hopefully the FULL Scan tonite will take care to rid it out but if not then Kaspersky Tech support maybe able to identify it and help me delete it out of my computer. That's all for now, have a good
 evening Class.&nbsp;</div>

            <div>Greetings Class,</div>
<div><br />
<div>As of 6-17-13, I found a solution on my own within my KIS Antivirus 2013 self help support center @ kaspersky.com. It suggested to add the url in question to the trusted url's in the web antivirus settings under the main preferences section called 'Protection
 Center' w/green shield. So here is the sequence to setup the url that the KIS 2013 Antivirus was blocking because it was typed in using a different url than the original one that the antivirus gave permissions certificate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
Open Kaspersky 2013.<br />
Click on 'Settings'.<br />
Click on the first icon in the upper left, it looks like a shield.<br />
Click on 'web antivirus' on the left.</div>

That worked. I can get into 'Outlook.com, live.com or hotmail.com. Also need to check the url certifcate signature against all the Microsoft Certificate Signatures on file within your browser to make sure it is one of theirs. Otherwise you will be allowing
 in a third party malware url to your email program. This is all solved for now and without the help of any Technical Support Moderators or So called Geek experts from this site.</div>

            If you are receiving an invalid certificate, then you likely have something reading/decrypting the HTTPS traffic between you and the web server. I highly recommend against adding these sites to your Trusted zone as a way to bypass this, as you are not
 fixing the problem. The reason you're seeing this error is because all of the data you are passing and receiving from blu173.mail.live.com is not guaranteed to be secure. This could be caused by a proxy server or web filter that scans HTTPS traffic (often
 used in offices and corporate networks). It could also be malware that has infected your computer, attempting to steal login credentials or other personal data. If you are not behind a web filtering proxy at work, I advise scanning your PC for malware and
 remedying the error properly instead of blindly trusting a certificate that is clearly invalid.

 in all encrypted urls to my settings as trusted. I said no way as I did not think that was the way to solve this.</span></font></div>

<div>I am going to log out of my email program and log back in with KIS turned off as that is the only way to get in without receiving the bad certificate red screen warning. Then I am going to change my passwords within for all my logins including the mobile

<div><br />
<div>Do you have any other suggestions to try?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also what site do I go to look up valid Microsoft certificates for live.com and outlook.com so I can check the one presented within the red screen login issue and the one presented without the red screen issue with KIS turned off? (KIS = Kaspersky 2013)</div>

Thank you for posting back.<br />
<br />
Since the issue happens when your antivirus is enabled, then it is possible that the settings of your antivirus triggered the issue.<br />
<br />
Please contact their support team on how to customize the settings of your antivirus, so it will allow Outlook.com.<br />

<h3> jamesbanks1378  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 apps and 0xc0000142 error</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Office 365 and had to contact tech support to resolve an installation problem. It would not install due to a 'Click to Run' glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS tech was able to resolve the problem and Office 365 was successfully installed. It did however leave me with a problem with Malwarebytes and Acronis backup. I did eventually resolve those but at the same time ( before I had fixed the two faulty apps)
 I found I could not open any Office component. I just got the 0xc0000142 error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS again and a different tech was able to resolve this problem, or so I thought. The Office apps appear to be working fine and then on another occasion the same error appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did watch the process the second tech used and by running AppWiz.cpl then right clicking on Office/Change/Repair I have been able to clear the fault.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Settings/Apps in the Win 10 start menu to try to fix it doesn't seem to work but it the fault has recurred three times now.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error keeps on recurring, then this may have something to do with the Office installation files. The factor that we see here is that the installation files has been duplicated, and it needs to be completely removed from the system. This means that
 we need to remove all traces of Office. So, to fully resolve this error on your Office suite, you need to uninstall Office manually. You can perform the step-by-step procedure from this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manually-uninstall-Office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manually uninstall Office.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Before you start, you need to know removing Office manually is a long, complex process and might require that you reinstall the operating system if certain steps are done incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This procedure also involves removing or deleting the registry subkeys for the Office system. So, we suggest that you back up the registry for restoration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this went well for you. Get back to us with the result.</p>

<p>Hmm, just reading through the removal procedure and it looks exactly what I observed the first MS Tech person doing when they had direct control of my PC last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office suite has always caused major installation problems on this system. It came preinstalled on the PC but the PC manufacturer was compelled to install software from McAfee that proved to be a real nightmare and almost impossible to remove. This
 seemed to have interfered with the Office suite and for a couple of years I had to resort to Open Office. Several McAfee techs had control of my PC over this time and eventually after nearly two years they did finally manage to get rid of the awful software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time I found that Office 2013 would still not install. As soon as it was available I updated my PC to Win 10 and then was able to install Office 2013 and it has worked perfectly ever since Win 10 became available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My curent problems only arose when I tried to update to Office 365</p>

<p>If you already performed the manual removal of Office, and reinstalling it doesn't make any difference, then you can follow other helpful solution from this article:

<p>At the moment it seems to be working. I have removed Open Office from my system as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I select any Office app sometimes nothing happens at all, checking Task Manager shows no Office apps running. Trying again a few seconds later and then all Office apps will open and run perfectly.</p>

<h2>            Windows Technical Preview&#58; WiFi&#47;LAN &#34;LIMITED&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One minute my Laptop is connected to the internet just fine, the next connectivity drops out. I reboot and now all internet connections are now "limited". Looking back in my update history I notice and update on the day it all went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried my home WiFi, ethernet, and hotspot from my smartphone. All are "limited". All these other connections work just fine with other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet up and down the last two days for solutions, learned a lot about diagnosing network issues none of which have helped. Using ipconfig in the command prompt I notice the IP address is 169.254.x.x. As I understand it this is automatically
 used when the device can't get a valid IP properly assigned from the router? I tried assigning it a unique static IP instead but this didn't seem to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried dropping the Firewall. No effect. However I don't know enough about the Windows Firewall to know if it is actively blocking internet connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following in command prompt as admin:</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset catalog (reset winsock entries)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
netsh int ip reset reset.log hit (reset TCP/IP stack)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling the ethernet and WIFI drivers from the DVD supplied with the laptop. No effect. I have tried downloading Windows 8.1 WIFI drivers direct from ASUS and installing those too. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried using the installation DVD I made in an attempt to repair Windows, but those tools are refusing to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without anyway of connecting to the internet and therefore no way of getting a possible fix through updates, the only option I can see is to completely wipe and reinstall. I don't want to go through the hassle of downloading and reinstalling all my software
 and graphics drivers again, so if anyone has a solution please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop. Formerly a fine Windows 7 64bit, now a (broken) Windows Technical Preview 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Qualcomm Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet controller (NDIS 6.30)</p>

            <p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall help you related to your invalid product key issue, however I have a quick question for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use a product key which is for a different edition / version of Office you may receive invalid product key error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which edition of Office did you purchase (Office Home and Student 2010, Office Home and Business 2010, Office Professional 2010)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse to the location below and check which edition of Office installed in the computer:</p>
<p><span>Click on <b>Start</b> /<b>Control Panel</b> / <b>Program</b>/ <b>Program and feature</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you find a different edition of Office installed in the computer apart from the one which you have purchased, y</span><span>ou may run the
<b>'Fix It'</b> tool available under <b>Method: 2</b> from the article below this will remove all the installed components of Office 2010 from the machine:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301/en-us</a><span>
</span></span></p>

Hi Raju</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I did as you suggested with the FixIt Programme but I received an error message saying FixIt hadn't processed. I tried to uninstall Office 2010 using the normal Control Panel route and tried to down;oad again using the link you gave
 - the error message said the product could wasn't a valid code for a free download (?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You asked what program I have - on my laptop I had Office 2010 (which I've tried uninstall) but the email giving me the Product Key says the download is for Microsoft Office Professional Plus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you can help </p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jamie&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous post, <span>if you use a product key which is for a different edition / version of Office you may receive invalid product key error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may start the computer in clean boot and then run the Fix it tool to uninstall all the installed components of Office 2010 from the machine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To start Windows in clean boot you may refer to article below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: After you have finished troubleshooting in clean boot, ensure to restart the computer in normal mode</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have a valid product key for Office professional plus 2010 you can download the trial and convert the trail to full version and activate it using the product key.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may download Office professional plus 2010 using the link given below:

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2016 Issue with Email Signatures</h2>
                    <p><strong>I created a simple signature, as shown below:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/352d0905-3a5d-43d1-840b-f9940edd22e5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/352d0905-3a5d-43d1-840b-f9940edd22e5?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>And it will work fine for the day. However, when I shut down the computer and return the next day, the email with the signature looks like this:</strong></p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the picture and the description of the issue, it is seems that this issue may caused by the encoding error. Please try the following steps to resolve it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Try editing the signature with a different fonts or editing your signature in Notepad in text format and then pasting it in the signature block to see if it helps</li><li>Navigate to File&gt; Options&gt; Language&gt; under Choose Editing Languages check if any other language is enabled, if yes highlight it and click on Remove.</li><li>Change the default encoding: navigate to: File&gt; Option&gt; Advanced&gt; International options, and then change the Preferred encoding for outgoing messages as Unicode (UTF-8)</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the issue might be related &nbsp;the add-ins, I suggest you to start Outlook in safe mode following below mentioned steps and verify the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Hold Windows key + R.</p>
<p>* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</p>
<p>Outlook /safe </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: There is space between Outlook and /</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Outlook works in safe mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</p>
<p>b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. </p>
<p>c) Close the Office program and restart it. </p>
<p>d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the above information helps. Reply with the result and Ill be happy to help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 has forgotten my password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perry kincy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 has forgotten my password</h2>
                    <p>Today with no changes to my msn or outlook password, Outlook 2010 has been asking for it. &nbsp;When entered it will not accept it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Live will accept it for my email and msn account using a browser and my iPhone and iPad will accept it and give me my mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Outlook 2010 will not accept it. &nbsp;I have rolled back from Office 2013 since Outlook 2013 is so bad and that is the main reason I use Office now. &nbsp;I cannot stand to read my email in a browser. &nbsp;If I am going to do that my Yahoo email client is much better
 than Msfts iteration. &nbsp;Any good ideas on why Outlook 2010 and only Outlook 2010 would be having password problems?</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve the issue, try setting up your Yahoo email account in a new Outlook Profile in Outlook 2010.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Create a new Outlook Profile following the steps from the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After creating the new Outlook Profile, try setting up your Yahoo email account in the new Profile.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To setup your email account in the new Outlook Profile you may refer to the following Microsoft Article:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758902</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you are able to setup your email account normally in the new Outlook Profile and send and receive emails without being prompted to enter and re-enter the
 password.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step works, make sure to follow the step:
<strong>Turn on or off profile prompt </strong>from the instructions in the above mentioned article and make your new Outlook Profile as the default Profile (on the same window follow the steps
<strong>Set a default profile</strong>). </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above steps help you to resolve the issue.
</span></span></p>

            <p>I apologize and realize that on this forum English is not everyone's first language, but my question remains:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did Outlook 2010 alone forget my email password, and MSN and IOS9.2.3 did not. &nbsp;And how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the mechanism for Outlook 2010 to change a password on its own and why won't it accept a proper password after it makes that change? &nbsp; I am using a Hotmail (actually MSN) account and as I say the password works in all devices but my laptop with Outlook
 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At this point I have done the "Large 20 lb Sledge Hammer" approach and deleted my MSN account from Outlook 2010 and reentered it. &nbsp; That likely will eventually work, but I have run into the "Cannot Synchronize your Account..." error that is ubiquitous throughout
 Outlook land. &nbsp; In my experience it simply takes some days or weeks for MSFT servers to get their stuff together as no fix ever proposed for this particular error has ever worked for me other than being patient and generally within a couple of weeks it will
 start synchronizing again. &nbsp; So in the meantime I am in the purgatory of using Outlook Mail from MSN.com.</p>

            <p>Actually no. &nbsp;I have had to do a 2nd Profile before and it is terribly annoying having to pick a profile every time I open Outlook. &nbsp;Didn't want to go there, so deleted the MSN acct and reloaded it. &nbsp;Still in "can't synchronize your folder...." &nbsp;purgatory
 but that will eventually clear.</p>

            <p>Well I spent the morning doing my emails on Outlook.com. &nbsp;I can't say a single thing good about that browser based email client. &nbsp;It is totally horrible. &nbsp;Way too much white space so there is very little visible content. &nbsp;The slider on the side which has
 to be used to read any email or to see more than 2 headers is way to skinny to find easily with a mouse or pointer. &nbsp;I have a touchscreen so can move around with that but that frankly is not a quick way to do production emails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have watched MSFT stock move up in the $50's after languishing for years below that and simply wonder what the new CEO is doing that is moving the needle. &nbsp;He sure isn't paying any attention to the basics, is he?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally frustrating particularly for an email address I have had for 20 years and now may have to change due to no company innovation or support. &nbsp;My backup is Yahoo Mail and it appears they are in worse shape than Microsoft.</p>

</p><p>If you saw the latter, re-add the account by choosing "Internet mail" as the account type, entering your @msn.com address and password, and then allowing Outlook 2010 to configure the account automatically. It should configure as an Exchange account. Do
 not try to configure it using the Outlook Connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the first of the two menu bars, however, you should be able to re-add the account via the Outlook Connector.</p>

            <p>I greatly appreciate you trying to help. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I don't understand the relationship between Outlook.com, Outlook.mail and Outlook 2010 which is a separate program. &nbsp;I think your directions relate to Outlook.com and you are right I see Outlook.mail instead as I access it from MSN.com. &nbsp;But your
 directions seem to ask me to do something in Outlook 2010 which is a separate microsoft office program. &nbsp; And I don't know where or in which of those 3 choices I would choose "internet mail".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have successfully reloaded my msn.com email acct into Outlook 2010 and eventually that will work once it decides to synchronize my folders. &nbsp; Are you saying I should do something with Outlook.com to make it easier to use and reduce the wasted white space
 which makes it impossible to use (accept on my desktop with 2 QHD 27 in monitors).</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience the issue causes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are aware of the issue. The following is the current status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue description:</strong></p>
<p><span>When trying to sign into an Office app, you
</span>get a spinner forever saying loading after you type the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>
<p>Several community members mentioned that <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-go-back-to-office-2016-for-mac-15-xx-versions-from-16-xx-e88ed6c8-6fb4-40a1-9540-529000d3d20f?omkt=en-US&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Installing 15.41</a> can get rid of this issue. Affected users can choose to install this previous version or use Office Online temporarily before the final fix released. We will keep working on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>
<p>As the issue only happens to specific users, and we can't reproduce the issue, we just got issue log provided by one of the affected users, we are reporting this issue with the log for further investigation.&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>I have a HTC TyTnII running Windows Mobile 6 (WM6)
<br />
<br />
I can connect to the internet through GPRS / EDGE on the Virgin Mobile Network in South Africa.<br />
<br />
I can connect to my work WiFi connection (through an ADSL wireless Router that handles PPPoE authentication) and surf the internet.<br />
<br />
My problems is that most other wifi connections I regularly need to use require that the DSL connection be established by the computer (in this case the HTC Mobile Phone) through PPPoE in order to access the internet.<br />
<br />
Is there any way for WM to do this?<br />
<br />
Your help will be greatly appreciated!<br />

                    <p>Across our entire company we work with a many word templates with hidden text to describe what should be in each chapter, etc.</p>
<p>But EVERY TIME we open those template-based documents, the hidden text is visible.</p>
<p>No one needs to see the hidden text all the time.&nbsp; It is tedious to constantly hide the hidden text every single time we open a doc.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stop the hidden text from appearing when I open a document??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should be able to save the document with "hidden text visible" = OFF.</p>

            <p>Strictly speaking, Word isn't forcing the display of hidden text; what happens is that the last user setting will apply when you open your document. If hidden formatting was displayed when you closed the last document window in your previous Word session,
 it will reopen in that state. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You could install a macro which hides nonprinting marks each time a document is opened or created, but your users probably wouldn't like it, because it&nbsp;overrides their preferred setting.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Many old files in our document system are now banned by WORD 2010. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Many old files in our document system are now banned by WORD 2010.</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We make a document repository system for policy and procedure management. &nbsp;We have many clients that have used our tools for a while. &nbsp;Part of our system includes document automation using ASPOSE on the server side, and an ActiveX control that automates
 WORD/EXCEL on the client side and opens it in a browser window. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have several clients that are moving to Word 2010. &nbsp;When they do, they can no longer open some .doc files from our ActiveX control that they have been fine for years. &nbsp;We get the error:</div>
<div>"<span>Office has detected a problem with this file. To help protect your computer this file cannot be opened."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>This message led me to this knowledge base, which was a good start, but not nearly enough info.</span></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973736</a>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When we try to just download the file to a local drive and open the file directly in WORD, it opens it in protected mode with the warning message:</div>
<div>"Office has detected a problem with this file. &nbsp;Editing it may harm your computer."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>IF we place our document URL directly in IE, and have IE try to download it and open it using its own WORD automation, it also fails. &nbsp;So it appears that there is something with the document that Word 2010 does not like.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have tried using the Trust center without success. &nbsp;The ActiveX control does not have the ability to access anything WORD would call a "Trusted" folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was able to work out how to turn the file validation feature off completely, but Microsoft (understandably) REALLY REALLY does not want you to do this. &nbsp;Here are a couple of references for those interested, but in short, add/change this registry setting:</div>
<div>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Security\FileValidation\EnableOnLoad</div>
<div>type: REG_DWORD</div>
<div>value: 0</div>
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg985445(office.12).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg985445(office.12).aspx</a>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We might be able to get our clients to push this kind of thing out and "fix" the problem, but the better thing would be of course to work out what the problem with the file is. &nbsp;Is there a way to trouble shoot the document to find out what WORD thinks
 is squirlly?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for all of your help,</div>
<div>-- Rick</div>

            <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After further investigation, I found that in some prior version of our server-side software, we must have done something using ASPOSE that caused this minor corruption.&nbsp; I was able to open the document in prior versions of WORD, and even in WORD 2010 in
 protected mode as long as I downloaded the file and opened it directly rather than through my ActiveX control.</p>
<p>Re-Saving the document from any version of WORD would remove the corruption, even without making any changes.&nbsp; I also found that I could run the document through OUR software again, using ASPOSE, and that it would remove the corruption.</p>
<p>Long story short, I was able to get around the issue merely by running the document through our server-side software and clen the document up.&nbsp; I was nt able to find out was the problem was specifically, but I apparently did not need to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for the great answers.&nbsp; Who know but perhaps I will need to clean up bigger problems in the future.</p>
<p>-- Rick</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The templates that are saved in the workgroup templates file location are basically the same as the templates that are saved in your user templates file location. However, the location is typically a shared folder on a network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're still having an issue finding the "Workgroup Templates" even after you've already set the location to a network drive where you have stored the templates,
<span>we encourage you to submit a feedback about this. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Full text follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gordon F. Kelly of Forbes is at it again, whipping up a frenzy over Windows 10. This time he claims to have found SHOCKING EVIDENCE that Microsoft's telemetry is collecting STAGGERING amounts of data from Windows 10 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, what Mr. Kelly's post* proves is how very, very little he understands about modern computing or networking. Seriously, his article is pure gibberish, technically. But more than 100,000 people have read it so far, and apparently they believe Mr. Kelly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel sorry for those poor benighted souls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What makes this whole sorry state of affairs even worse is that Mr. Kelly hasn't even done any of his own research. Instead, he is relying on ... well, I'll let him tell you:</p>
<blockquote>Blowing the lid on it this week is Voat user CheesusCrust whose extensive investigation found Windows 10 contacts Microsoft to report data thousands of times per day.
</blockquote>
<p>Voat is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reddit clone.</a> The user CheesusCrust is ... well, we really have no idea who he is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Henceforth, I shall refer to him as "Mr. Crust."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing in Mr. Kelly's article to indicate that he spoke with Mr. Crust to verify his credentials or gather any additional data.</p>
<p>What Mr. Crust did was to install Windows 10 Enterprise edition (apparently an evaluation version) in a virtual machine, using the free VirtualBox running on Linux Mint. Mr. Crust says he performed a custom installation where he "disabled three pages of
 tracking options."</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[A side note here: Actual network administrators configuring Windows 10 Enterprise have hundreds of Group Policy options at their disposal, including fine-grained controls over telemetry and privacy settings. There's even a fourth option, not available
 to users of retail and OEM Windows 10 editions, that dials telemetry back to an absolute minimum. There is no evidence that Mr. Crust is aware of these options.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, Mr. Crust reports, he "configured the DD-WRT router to drop and log all connection attempts via iptables through the DD-WRT router by Windows 10 Enterprise."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Crust says his intent was to "analyse the network traffic of Windows 10 on a clean install." If there are any readers with networking experience in the audience, they might see the flaw in his methodology. If your software needs to connect to an outside
 resource to perform a specific task, and the connection drops unexpectedly, you will not get any traffic to analyze. Even worse, when the software detects an unsuccessful connection it will try to connect again. And again and again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what might have been a single, short data exchange could instead turn into multiple connection attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Kelly is outraged:</p>
<blockquote>The raw numbers come out as follows: in an eight hour period Windows 10 tried to send data back to 51 different Microsoft IP addresses over 5500 times. After 30 hours of use, Windows 10 expanded that data reporting to 113 non-private IP addresses.
 Being non-private means there is the potential for hackers to intercept this data. I'd argue this is the greatest cost to owning Windows 10.</blockquote>
<p>I might have to pause here for a second to allow those of my readers with networking experience to try to make sense of those last two sentences. Don't even try. It's gibberish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helpfully, Mr. Crust <a href="https://voat.co/v/technology/comments/835741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">supplied the raw data</a>, which I plugged into a spreadsheet so I could perform my own extensive investigation. The results are unintentionally hilarious.</p>
<p><em>[Update: It appears that Mr. Crust has deleted his post and indeed his entire Voat account. The Forbes post that relied on his data remains unchanged.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, 602 connection attempts were to 192.168.1.255, using UDP port 137. That's the broadcast address where Windows computers on a local network announce their presence and look for other network computers using the NetBIOS Name Service. It's perfectly
 normal traffic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another 630 of those connection attempts were Domain Name System lookups to the router itself, 192.168.1.1, using UDP port 53. That address is the router itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Windows performing those DNS lookups? One big reason is that's how Windows checks whether you have access to the Internet. If there's a problem with your Internet connection, you get a yellow overlay on the network icon down at the right side of the
 taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that test, Windows first performs a DNS lookup of <a href="http://www.msftncsi.com." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.msftncsi.com.</a> It then makes an HTTP request to retrieve the page ncsi.txt from that site. This file is a plain-text file and contains only the text "Microsoft NCSI." (NCSI stands for Network Connection Status Icon.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it performs a DNS query for dns.msftncsi.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole procedure is <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/networking/2012/12/20/the-network-connection-status-icon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
extensively documented </a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DNS queries aren't "spying." Neither are NetBIOS name broadcasts on your local network. So far, that's 22.3 percent of the so-called traffic that's easily accounted for as "not spying," unless you think there's something sinister about a two-word text file
 that has been downloaded trillions of times from that poor Microsoft server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next up is a staggering 1,619 connection attempts using UDP port 3544 to the address 94.245.121.253, which Mr. Crust was unable to identify, along with another five attempts using the same port to other servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That address does indeed belong to Microsoft. It's a Teredo server, teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com. Teredo is an Internet standard that is used to supply an IPv6 address to a PC that speaks only IPv4, making it easier to perform secure and reliable communication
 between two endpoints without having to worry about network translation. It's also
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722030%28v=ws.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
well documented </a>and doesn't involve any exchange of information other than IP addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, Windows keeps trying to make a simple connection using its IPv6 capabilities, but the router keeps dropping those connection attempts. So it keeps trying again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's another 1,624 entries we can add to the "not spying" list. So far, by my tally, more than 52 percent of the connection attempts are completely harmless and involve no data collection at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another three connection attempts are using port 123. That's the Network Time Protocol, which devices use to retrieve the current time from authoritative servers on the Internet. Setting the clock on your computer is not "spying."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Crust's list has another 549 connection attempts on port 80, which is plain old HTTP. Windows doesn't have a web server installed by default, so those are all incoming connections, with Windows trying to retrieve data. They're not sending it the other
 direction.</p>
<p>We also know from Microsoft's documentation that it all telemetry data transmissions are encrypted, so it's highly unlikely that any of those unencrypted HTTP connections on port 80 would have included telemetry data had they been allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the addresses on the list belong to content delivery networks (CDNs) like Akamai Technologies and CloudFlare. Some of those downloads are possibly trying to refresh live tiles in the provisioned MSN apps (News, Sports, Weather, Money, and so on).
 There are perhaps some updates to Windows and the Windows Store in there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We might know more if Mr. Crust had allowed his machine to complete some of those connections so he could perform some actual traffic analysis. But he didn't, so we can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can, however, safely conclude that none of those connections would involve any "spying."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which leaves us with 2,100 connection attempts in eight hours over port 443. Those are secure (HTTPS) connections designed to exchange data so that it can't be intercepted in transit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have no idea how many secure connections that machine would have made in eight hours had Mr. Crust actually allowed them to complete. The number would almost certainly have been smaller, perhaps by an order of magnitude or even two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, those connections are not all about telemetry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most important one is the Software Licensing Service, which checks the state of Windows activation periodically. By dropping those connections, Mr. Crust is not allowing those activation and validation checks to complete. Windows gets very cranky when
 that happens, which could explain why there were more than 1,700 connection attempts to a handful of addresses in a single range of IP addresses managed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other content that gets delivered securely over port 443 includes Windows updates, Windows Defender updates, and updates from the Windows Store for apps that are provisioned on every Windows 10 machine. Windows 10 attempts to contact OneDrive, also securely,
 to see if there are any saved settings for the current user. There are lists of known malicious websites that get delivered to the SmartScreen service in a hashed and encrypted format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, there is certainly some telemetry data in there. We have no idea whether Mr. Crust changed the default Diagnostic and Usage settings to Basic. If he had, there would probably be a single ping to Microsoft's servers when the machine starts up, which
 would disclose what that setting was, whether Windows Defender was up to date, and whether his installation had experienced any failures in software or driver installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If he had kept the Enhanced or Full settings, Windows would periodically deliver a batch of anonymized usage data to Microsoft. (Of course, since he wasn't actually using the machine, there would be no data to exchange.) But we don't know, because Mr. Crust
 didn't actually do any traffic analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Kelly might want to write a little less and study a little more. I know some networking experts who've done some excellent video training courses where he could learn a lot about TCP and UDP and HTTP. I could even recommend some books that
 might be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But something tells me he really isn't interested in learning.</p>
<p>* As always, I hate to line Mr. Kelly's pocket with traffic for such shoddy work, but if you insist on reading, the Forbes post is
