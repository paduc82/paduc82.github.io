<h2>            Polytonic Greek keyboard for windows phone 10 &#40;eg. for LUMIA 950&#41;</h2>
                    <p>MS Windows for desktop has since many years an excellent Greek polytonic keyboard.<br />
That, however, is not the case with windows phone 8 and 10.<br />
</p>
<p>-I am a satisfied user of a LUMIA 820 and recently of a LUMIA 950.<br />
I was greatly disappointed when I found out that even version 10 of windows phone does not have a Greek polytonic keyboard.<br />
That makes the windows phone incompatible to the corresponding desktop environment.<br />
<br />
I also possess an Android mobile phone, a RedMi Pro running MUI 9 under Android 6. Android itself does not provide a Greek polytonic keyboard but there is an excellent freeware app, named Hoplite, which does just that.<br />
<br />
Keyboard support should be part of the operational environment, be it Android or Windows Phone or whatever and not be left to the discretion and initiative of third party software designers.<br />
<br />
For Microsoft to solve the problem with the keyboard shouldn't be more than a few hours work. But, even if it takes a week or a month, it would still be worth it. Many scholars round the world need, for various reasons, such a keyboard. So does also the church
 whose members insist on the use of polytonic Greek.<br />
<br />
Finally, had it been possible to port Android apps to Windows Phone, then one could have the best of both worlds but, that's another (perhaps a little painful) story.<br />
<br />

    <title>Table of Contents Bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kammac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table of Contents Bug&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I create and modify Tables of Contents on a daily basis, so I am fairly familiar with&nbsp;the procedures.&nbsp; And 9 times out of 10, my TOC is perfect.&nbsp; Occasionally, I will add a new heading to an existing TOC in a document, and it appears with the page number
 about 5 spaces away from it, and with no dot leaders.&nbsp; Today, for example, I&nbsp;just added&nbsp;two TOC level 2 headings that use the same heading style and same TOC style, and they are positioned one below the other in the TOC.&nbsp; The first heading is formatted correctly,
 with the dot leaders and the page number in line with the right tab.&nbsp; The second heading has no dot leaders and the page number is only about a tab away from the heading.&nbsp; The problem heading is only 2 characters long, so line wrapping isn't&nbsp;contributing to
 this&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; In this case, the problem heading&nbsp;happens to be&nbsp;the last entry in the TOC, but that is not always the case, so the position of the heading within the TOC does not seem to part of the problem.&nbsp; Am I doing something to cause this or is it being
 caused by a Jason Tab?&nbsp; More importantly, do you know how I can fix it?&nbsp; This problem has been plaguing me intermittently since Word 2000.&nbsp; I am currently using Word 2007.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!</p>

<div>Are the headings numbered? In that case, it seems likely that the short heading is causing the page number to end up at the wrong tab stop. You will have to adjust the tab stop(s) for the corresponding toc style (TOC 2 in this case). You should display
 the horizontal ruler (if it isn't displaying already) and also nonprinting marks to more easily see what is happening.

<p>I don't know precisely what the definition of a "Jason Tab" is, but AFAIK the Styles used by the TOC have one tab defined, and in that case the dotted leader should always be there no matter how short the text. If you have modified the style, either directly,
 or so that it is based on a style that has more tabs defined, then if the heading text does not extend beyond the first tab position, Word will only tab to that position, and if the tab does not have a dot leader defined, you won't get a dot leader (rather
 obviously, I suspect!). So if you click in the offending paragraph and look at its paragraph style details, you should be able to check that stuff. If there is another tab, it's then a question of working out how that tab definition got there. And the "default
 tabs" should not be a factor, i.e. they should be overridden by the presence of non-default tabs.</p>
<p>If there is a specific known bug that causes this, you probably know more than I do.</p>

<p>here's another analogy - as you don't seem convinced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you go in the shop to buy the phone. when you are paying for it, a criminal enters the shop and shoots you.</p>
<p>your logic would be "why did I get shot? was it because I was buying a windows phone? who is to blame? i'll blame Microsoft! I'm sure that If I was buying a different phone the criminal would not have shot me!".</p>

    <title>Moving Excel Sheets From One .XLS File To Another in Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve thornton sg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Excel Sheets From One .XLS File To Another in Excel 2010</h2>
                    We have recently upgraded from Excel 2003 to Excel 2010. This has broken one of our basic financial processes.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Our financial package (Sage Accpac) can only export as .XLS, not .XLSX. We have a function in Accpac that exports a large series of spreadsheets every month, one for each of our dozens of grants. Part of the process of analyzing these involves copying
 a worksheet from a different spreadsheet into each of these.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now that we have 2010, we can no longer copy a sheet from one workbook to another, because they have the wrong number of rows and columns. I understand why this is true trying to copy a 2003 sheet into a 2010 workbook, but not why it's a problem going
 from one .XLS to another.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only way we can work around this is to Save As... each of the spreadsheets as an .XLSX file, and then the sheet copy works. But this is extremely tedious to open, File | Save As... close to one hundred spreadsheets every month.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to either allow copying from one .XLS file to another .XLS file, or to bulk-convert all the sheets in the folder?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I can't explain why you are seeing what you say you are.... if I open two .xls files on my pc, both have ~65k lines and I can move sheets between them fine.</p>
<p>But I noticed that a sheet is only reduced to&nbsp;~65k lines when it is re-opened... (i.e. to create my .xls files to test, in Excel 2007 I did save as .xls, so before (and after) doing the save as, there were ~1M lines... only after closing and re-opening the
 new .xls did it show ~65k lines).&nbsp; Does your problem ocurr &nbsp;when your software exports the data into Excel, but you don't close and re-open the file before trying to copy/move the sheet to another .xls file?</p>
<p>You said "<em>The only way we can work around this is to Save As... each of the spreadsheets as an .XLSX file, and then the sheet copy works. But this is extremely tedious to open, File | Save As... close to one hundred spreadsheets every month</em>." but
 have you tried doing Office/File button &gt; Convert... ?</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could write a simple macro to batch convert all .xls files in a folder to .xlsx...&nbsp; let me know if you want help with that.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#39;send to onenote&#39; behavior changed.</h2>
                    <p>Today I noticed the 'send to onenote' button in my outlook has somehow changed significantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first it's no longer under the 'move' ribbon section, but has got it's own ribbon section now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then it no longer opens the desktop onenote when clicked, instead it opens a popup side panel inside outlook and asks me to select where to save, totally ignoring the 'default save to' settings in onenote. although this is not the most annoying part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the most annoying thing is after it finishes saving, it shows a 'close' button and a 'open in onenote' link&nbsp;, but clicking that link doesn't open desktop onenote , but instead goes to the sharepoint site where the local notebook is synced from. this is extremely
 frustrating as not only this sharepoint site requires 2FA login every time, but the web version is both functionally crippled and very very slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i want the old&nbsp; 'send to onenote' experience back. (is there anyway i can opt-out of this? cause i faintly remember seeing some opt-in prompts regarding onenote in outlook before, and might have accidentally clicked one of those by mistake)</p>
<p>

<p>The other disappointment I have with this new Send to OneNote feature is that it will only link to notebooks from a single account. In the past, I could have personal and work notebooks open in the desktop version of OneNote. When I used Send to OneNote
 from Outlook (which I must use at least 30 times a day minimum), I could select to send to any of the open notebooks regardless of account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I want to send to the account that is not "active", I have to switch accounts and enter a password. Next email goes to the other account, switch again, password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already greatly miss the behavior of the earlier versions of Send to OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have also tried printing to OneNote instead, but it prints an image and not searchable text.</p>

<h2>            Execl Online - Selecting data from another sheet automatically not possible</h2>
                    
<p>Hi team,</p>
<p>I need to know if it's possible to select/reference data from another sheet in Excel Online automatically. In Office desktop, i can select the other worksheet and do selcting of the data range. But in Excel online I cant do this automatically. Only way is
 to type Sheet!AX:BX manually.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Based on my research and test, it seems that we can only type &lt;Sheetname&gt;!Ax:Bx in Excel Online to reference data from another sheet.</p>
<p>Since this is a Excel Online feature related question, I recommend you post a new thread in

    <title>Outlook&#47;hotmail not receiving forwarded emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmjedi74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook&#47;hotmail not receiving forwarded emails</h2>
                    I am not receiving emails that have been forwarded from other accounts. They are not in my 'junk' folder, either. I have checked my outlook settings and the multiple users that are trying to forward me messages are not blocked. There are no 'rules' set
 that would block these messages from coming through. I have tried multiple browsers and clearing the cache, but the problem persists. Newly-created 'Test' messages sent from these other accounts to my account show up in my inbox as usual, but a 'forward' of
 any message from these other accounts does not; the other accounts have no error/bounceback messages saying the email could not be forwarded - it appears to have forwarded normally on their end, but it never shows up in my account.&nbsp; We've been testing this
 for 48 hours and nothing has changed.<br />
<br />
How do I fix this problem?

            Similar problem. &nbsp;After sending test messages and having some arrive and some not, (best result is from gmail auto forwarding), I discovered all the missing mail is
<u>in</u>&nbsp;my outlook inbox <i>if I view it on my XP SP3 computer</i>&nbsp;instead of the win7 I normally use.
<div><br />
<div>I can send these one at a time to myself and can then see them on my win7 pc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fluke or permanent problem?&nbsp;</div>

            Initially, the problem did not occur with a specific domain - I was not getting forwards from @live.com, @gmail.com, or @hp.com; the @live.com -never- came through and the other two domains were sporadic.<br />
<br />
All three domains were able to receive forwards from my @hotmail.com account.<br />
<br />
None of the forwarded emails contained attachments.<br />
<br />
All forwards were manual, not automatic.<br />
<br />
I had already tried adding the @live.com address to my safe senders list, and that did not solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Further investigation this morning finds the following with a random message:<br />
<br />
@hotmail.com forwarded to @hp.com = delivered<br />
@hotmail.com forwarded to @gmail.com = delivered<br />
@hotmail.com forwarded to @live.com = delivered<br />
<br />
@hp.com forwarded to @hotmail.com = delivered<br />
@hp.com forwarded to @gmail.com = delivered<br />
@hp.com forwarded to @live.com = delivered<br />
<br />
@gmail.com forwarded to @hotmail.com = delivered<br />
@gmail.com forwarded to @hp.com = delivered<br />
@gmail.com forwarded to @live.com = delivered<br />
<br />
@live.com forwarded to @hp.com = delivered<br />
@live.com forwarded to @gmail.com = delivered<br />
@live.com forwarded to @hotmail.com = NOT DELIVERED<br />
<br />
And, additionally:<br />
<br />
@live.com forwarded to @hp.com (delivered) and then forwarded again from @hp.com to @ hotmail.com = NOT DELIVERED<br />
<br />
@live.com forwarded to @gmail.com (delivered) and then forwarded again from @gmail.com to @hotmail.com = NOT DELIVERED<br />
<br />
This would lead me to believe that there is a forwarding issue between @hotmail.com and @live.com.<br />
<br />
I did see the reply from GoatherdatLakeshore - I am using XP SP3 with a Firefox browser. I have used Win7/IE8 and checked on my mobile devices, and the forwarded messages involving @live.com in any form are not being delivered.<br />
<br />
One IMPORTANT thing I just noticed - the issue is specific to forwarding an email received from Craigslist; it will forward to all the other domains, but not @hotmail.com.<br />

            I meant outlook.com. &nbsp;But I was probably wrong in my diagnosis. &nbsp;I think I was accessing my hotmail.com on the XP machine, the win7 was automatically going to outlook.com when I tried to get hotmail.com and all my mail was there because hotmail previously
 was auto forwarding to outlook.com.
<div><br />
<div>I again set hotmail to forward all mail to outlook.com and retain a copy. &nbsp;After 24+ hours it has not kicked in yet. &nbsp;I have to read both mail accounts to see all my mail.</div>

            I have tried grouping and ungrouping messages and it makes no difference; those messages that are forwards from the @live.com account connected with my Craigslist account are not getting through to my @hotmail.com account at all.

            Letter mailmerges have Section breaks between the pages, so you need to specify the section numbers rather than page numbers for printing. The section numbers should appear on the status bar. To print sections 17 to 25, for example, you'd specify s17-s25.

<h2>            6303 freeze short after startup</h2>
                    
<p>hi all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a nokia 6303 classic and have been very happy about it, but here half a month ago my phone froze a couple startups after deleting messages which it also froze in... now here today i had to deletee som messages(space) and went to delete sms(?) and
 pressed "after folder" i think that's what it was, it started deleting and went to about 450 where it froze, at first i pressed exit, then i tried to shut it down with the power button. but it would'nt... i then took the battery out and had it out and put
 in again, and after that, it freezes after about half a minute to minute after startup... hope you guys can understand what i mean, and also hope you can help me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>greetings a nokia fan&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem as you describe: it's extremely frustrating, but often resolves itself after a while. That said, the problem has gone on quite a&nbsp; long time for me this evening!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an official solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons as to why your Outlook.com stopped receiving emails. It is possible that some of your messages go to your junk folder. To check if the messages are on your junk folder, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log in to <a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>
</li><li>Click <strong>Junk</strong> <strong>Email </strong>on the left navigation pane of your inbox.
</li><li>Check to see if the missing emails are there. </li><li>If you see any messages that should have been delivered to the Inbox , click the box on the left of each message to put a check mark and then click the<strong> Not Junk</strong> button.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try sending out a test email to yourself to check if you will receive the message or not. If you didn't receive the message, are there any error message received or bounce message sent on your inbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for further concerns.</p>

            Outlook.com Premium is Outlook.com with a few added features: no ads and a custom domain. Other than that, behavior is identical. All MSN, Hotmail, and Live accounts are Outlook.com accounts. All mail was subsumed into the same mail service.

<p>I have Outlook 2016 as part of Office 365, I believe.</p>
<p>I have Outlook.com - an internet-only email, I believe.</p>
<p>I have Windows Mail app in Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 or 4 Microsoft email accounts (Hotmail, msn, live); but an email addresses to me *** Email address is removed for privacy *** fails to come thru, although it is not rejected from wherever I send it - Gmail, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the distinction among all these choice? Why are they so confusing and, especially, why did my @outlook.com emails stop working a few days ago?</p>

<p>Connect the phone which is already switched ON.</p>
<p>Go to 'Device Manager' on your PC. Do you get to see the phone under 'Portable devices' with a Yellow Triangle ? If so, Right click on it and Uninstall it. Then go to Actions--&gt;Scan for hardware changes .. and let the drivers reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't help, <span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Restart the computer in Safe Mode, and then select&nbsp;</span><strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">.
 This rolls back to the most recent successful registry configuration.</span></p>

    <title>Why isn&#39;t the default font in Office Times New Roman size 12&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why isn&#39;t the default font in Office Times New Roman size 12&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Original title:&nbsp;Office Default Font</div>
Why isn't the default font in Office Times New Roman size 12? I know a total of 0 home endusers who like Calibri size 11. If this is the result of some propriety market research that can't be shared I'd understand, but I've never understood why this is.

<p>I think you'll find that support for Flash is generally going away because of Flash's reputation as a security risk.

<br />A lot of users are reporting this lately, there is actually no action to be taken, it seems to be a bug in the reporting system, for the moment there is nothing you can do, hopefully Microsoft will get this resolved shortly . . ..

<h3> cts606  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLOOKUP stack ranking</h2>

=RANK(VLOOKUP(A7,'Rankings Input SSR'!A:P,16,FALSE),'Rankings Input SSR'!P:P,1)</p>
<p>I want the highest to be between 8-13.5% and all of the rankings decending as they get farther away from this bracket. Is there a formula that will do that?</p>

<p>&nbsp;What do you mean by "I want the highest to be between 8-13.5% and all of the rankings decending"?&nbsp; What if there is a value of 14% are you saying you want to exclude it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is the difference between ranking them in descending order and ranking the highest?&nbsp; Do you want to rank some from low to high 8-13.5 and some from high to low?</p>

<p>I want it to start with the green numbers ranked as #1, and then anything that falls outside of the parameters 8-13.5 to be ranked lower as the values get farther from the target area. Right now they are being ranked based on the value from highest to lowest.
 I'm sorry if I am not explaining this very well, but I didn't create the spreadsheet to begin with.</p>

<h2>            Font and Size - Number lists</h2>
                    Hi Guys and Gals. This ones been doing my head in. Every time i select a simple number list (i.e. 1. 2. 3. etc) the default font changes from Arial 10 to Times new Roman 12. The actual number remains in Arial 10 but the Font after the tab space changes
 to TNR 12. The default font is set to Arial 10 for all documents (i have verified that this is the case by checking the Normal.dotm file) and the default font set for the number list is Arial 10. I have tried removing the number list and creating a new one,
 tried starting with a blank document and doing the same thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing seems to work. Its really frustrating because everytime i drop to the next line i have to change the font from TNR 12 to Arial 10. Any ideas?

            <p>By default, Word 2010 uses the List Paragraph style for numbered and bulleted lists. This is what you will doubtless have to modify. In the Styles task pane, with Recommended styles displayed, in "As Recommended" order, List Paragraph will be the very last
 one. It is based on Normal, which is based on the document defaults, so it would appear that you have not changed the default font in the document (which you may not want to do).</p>
<p>If you don't want to use the List Paragraph style, there is an option to "Use Normal style for bulleted or numbered lists." Find it in the Compatibility Options (Layout Options) at the very bottom of File | Options | Advanced.</p>

<h2>            junk and scam emails received by my inbox disguised as paypal or even microsoft to get personal details</h2>
                    <p>I received one &nbsp;scam email from Microsoft and several from paypal that asked me to click to go another site to log in and give personal details.
</p>
<p>when I checked the site and email addresses they were long and suspicious emails and they were not detected by Microsoft as junk or scam.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems very easy to me. Microsoft Hotmail should give the option to see the whole email addresses , instead of a short name. then we would automatically recognize whether it is coming from a reliable source or not. Also they should have a smart name check
 so people can not create names similar to companies like Microsoft or paypal with just a&nbsp;comma added somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please make our life easier. you can do a lot more than what you are doing, I had a scare few times thinking someone purchased&nbsp;in my name&nbsp;or accessed my account, while they were trying to get info from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scammers will really do anything to deceive people. What we highly suggest is that whenever you get an unusual email messages and if on the body of each of them asks you to click on something, don't do so. We also suggest that you familiarize the legit email
 addresses that legit companies are using. This will help you easily determine the type of email. If in case you receive this scam messages, straightly

<p>
</p><p>Adding up, <strong>Microsoft will not ask personal information through email</strong>. If there's a need of changes in personal information, we always suggest that you log in to your account instead.</p>
<p>
