<h2>            Audio error code 10 on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>ASRock 11945-17b <br />
</p>
<p>BIOS Version ConRoe 1333-D667 1.0, Intel Pentium dual cpu E2140 (64 bit supported)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried everything, from downloading <strong>all available realtek audio driver versions
</strong>and even reinstalling windows but nothing works (earlier it was working fine with realtek 1.83). i don't have extra sound card installed, just the inbuilt motherboard sound device. i'm using windows xp sp2, everything was working fine until 2 weeks
 back. Also there was PCI Device error and SM bus controller error, it was fixed by installing updates but for audio driver nothing works not even updates.
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Is there any other audio driver for intel 945 motherboard other than realtek?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>i downloaded the drivers from ASRock.com, <br />
</p>
<p>i've googled and tried everything that i can find at help centers, if theres any new way to solve the problem please help or is it hardware problem?
<br />
</p>
(This device cannot start code 10)
<p>would really appreciate if someone can help asap</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<h2>            프로필 로그인 문제&#40;게임&#41; &#91;Edit - Translation&#93; - Profile login problem &#40;game&#41;</h2>
                    <p>포르자 호라이즌4 기본 화면에서 넘어가질 못한다.<br />
프로필에 로그인이 되어있지 않아서 그렇다는데....<br />
필자는 xbox프로필 성인인증 완료(아이핀!!!), 마이크로소프트 계정 보유중이다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>많은 오류가 있었고, 많은 시간을 소모했다.<br />
게임을 산 지 20시간이 지난 지금 아직도 즐기지 못했다는 것에 매우 큰 불쾌감을 느낀다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>대체 무엇을 해야하나?</p>
<p>프로필이 필요해서 접속이 되지 않았던 Xbox 프로필 생성(오래 걸렸다!), 실행 되지도 않던 아이핀(J100511이라는 오류마저...),</p>
<p>짜증과 화를 참아내 우회해 인증했다.</p>
<p>많은 기대와 설렘으로 실행했던 호라이즌4.....결과는 참담했다. 같은 곳 같은 방식으로 문전박대....</p>
<p>왜!! 난 프로필 연동이 되지 않는가!!ㅉㄻㄵㄱ혿ㅁㄱㅎㄷㅓㅅㄷㅈㄱㅎ후...</p>
<p>
</p><p>필자는 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 많은 시간을 소모했고, 인내심 있게 원하는 모든 것을 했다.</p>
<p>그런데 대체 무엇을 하는 건가? 트리플A급 게임을 판매하고 원화 6만원 이상을 지불할 것을 명시해놓고선</p>
<p>소비자들의 게임 이용을 원활하게 할 가이드 하나 없다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>시간이 지나 고치는 모습이 있다면 이렇게까지 화나진 않았을 것이다.</p>
<p>내가 이 문제에 직면하면서 보게되었던 자료들은 2년전 Xbox 플렛폼의 패키지 상품들을 PC 이용이 가능하게 된 그때부터 지속적으로 갱신되던 문제점이다.</p>
<p>그런데 지금까지 해결되지 않았고, 정확한 해결책이 없다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>하지만 목마른 자가 우물을 파는 법&nbsp;</p>
<p>나는 아직도 호라이즌4를 위해 조금 더 희생할 수 있다.</p>
<p>나는 해결책을 원한다.</p>
<p>복잡한 것이든 간단한 것이든 상관없다.</p>
<p>많이 올려주면 더 좋다.</p>
<p>모두 다 해볼 것이고 성공한다면 난 기분이 매우 좋아질 것이다.</p>
<p>
</p><p>하지만 지금은 굉장히 짜증이난다. 짜증이!ㄹㄷ매;ㅣㅈㄷㅁㅈㄱㅎ;ㅣㅁ;ㅏ'ㅣㅈㄱㅎ맥해;ㅣㅁ</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - the Porza Horizon 4 does not have to go beyond the main screen.</strong><br />
<strong>I'm not logged in to my profile....</strong><br />
<strong>I am having an Xbox Profile adult authentication complete (ipin!!!), Microsoft account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There were many errors, and it was much time consuming.</strong><br />
<strong>I feel very uncomfortable that I have not enjoyed the game for 20 hours now and still enjoy it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to do with the alternative?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Create an Xbox profile that doesn't require a profile (it took a long time!), an eye pin that was not running, or an error called J 100511.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Annoyed and bypass certified to endure my mad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizon 4 was run by many expectations and The results were terrible. Concealed in the same way....</strong></p>
<p><strong>For what!! I don't have a profile linkage!! Roach Lukeytao ᆬ a hod...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ive spent a lot of time to solve this problem, and had everything I wanted to be patient.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But what the hell are you doing? To sell the triple A-class games and pay more than KRW 60,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no one guide to facilitate the use of consumers ' games.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the time has been healed, it would not have been so mad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I was facing this issue, the data that I was seeing was an ongoing update from the time the PC was available to the Xbox platform package for two years ago.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But it hasn't been solved so far, and there's no exact solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But how the thirsty self sells wells I can still sacrifice a little more for Horizon 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want a solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It doesn't matter whether it's complex or simple.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's better if you lift a lot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you will try and succeed, I will feel very good.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But now I'm very annoyed. I'm so annoyed! I'm a C. P. P. L.</strong><br />

            Hi seiichi1021 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />That's a 3rd party app that you have running that is causing this not a Windows issue.
<br />Do you need that app?
<br />If not i would recommend uninstalling it.
<br />Quick google search looks like the company is Blackmagic.
<br />I have put their forum link below, you might be able to get help from them on how to get rid of that bar.

<p>Thanks but I'm sure there's nothing to do with any apps from&nbsp;<span>Blackmagic, I don't have any of it installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It's caused by everytime I connected to "Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter" , there would be a pop up notification task bar saying you are connected to it, and it will pop up everytime I move mouse course to the top
 edge of the screen, which is annoying as I move my mouse course there quite often to switch from browser tabs.</span></p>
<p>

            There must be some sofware that installed with that wireless card.
<br />How did you rename it?
<br />That software that you used does it have an option to remove toolbar?

<p>I'm having the very same issue. It, unless hidden VERY well, is not from a 3rd Party developer. Certainly not Black Magic Design, as I have never installed any of their software, or had even known them to exist prior to this thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using MS Wireless Display adapters for a while now, and have not had this issue until the last update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is VERY aggravating, as the bar can only be unpinned, and not completely disabled. Which turns into a major issue anytime one needs to use the top portion of their screen, i.e. changing tabs in browser, exiting applications, etc.. The bar is also about
 50% the width of the screen on my Surface Pro, so it isn't easily navigated around when browsing either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exhausted all display and associated&nbsp;settings to try to alleviate this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone can bring some insight to the solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Windows Technician Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cladams&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows Technician Scam</h2>
                    I was called by "Steve" who said he was a Microsoft Technician (in the state of Washington)&nbsp;and was getting "messages" from my computer that&nbsp;Windows had "stopped working" on my computer. I had just logged off my laptop but I also have a desktop &amp; asked
 him which computer. He said "the one&nbsp;you're on." I logged back on, but asked him questions like&nbsp;his phone&nbsp;# (206-855-5883), which was not the number he was calling from (206-317-7361).&nbsp; Then he gave me my computer ID&nbsp;&amp; told me where to check it to make sure.
 He said press the "Windows icon on the keyboard along with the R key." I did this&nbsp;&amp; the "run" search box appeared. He said put in"cmd" and hit ok, which I did. He said "at the black window, which showed my name, he said type "assoc" &amp; hit enter.&nbsp; I did &amp; under
 the "CLSID" my computer number appeared. He said "don't share that with anybody." So I thought ok, he appears to be legit, but suspicious I wanted to see where he was going with this&nbsp;&amp; I was writing everything down.&nbsp;He told me to go back to the "run"&nbsp;search
 box &amp; enter <a href="http://www.microsoft.aios.us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.aios.us</a>&nbsp;&amp; click "ok"&nbsp;which I did. A new screen opened called "Welcome to Support for&nbsp;Microsoft Products...Learn about Microsoft products...connect with out certified engineer..choose one
 of the support channels..." &amp; showed three boxes titled "Teamviewer, Supremo, Ammyy."&nbsp;He told me to click "Supremo, click run, yes then Accept."&nbsp; At "Accept" there was an ID &amp; a password # which he asked for.&nbsp; After I gave it to him, he&nbsp;said "see the mouse
 on your computer, I have access but will show you what's wrong with your computer.&nbsp; I am going to run a program so don't stop it.&nbsp; I'll also have my supervisor call you in the meantime."&nbsp; I saw a small black window appear twice where he quickly&nbsp;input some
 letters, too fast for me to write it down. I watched&nbsp;the program rapidly going through files before I clicked the X, unplugged my computer &amp; took the battery out. He&nbsp;called me back but I did not answer.&nbsp; Instead I called a technician&nbsp;friend at Office Depot
 who&nbsp;told me I may have stopped his access but&nbsp;to bring in my laptop anyway &amp; he will remove anything that was attached.&nbsp; He also told me to call Microsoft to report this SCAM because they would never make those&nbsp;types of calls. When I tried calling the two
 numbers the guy gave me,&nbsp;one kept ringing, &amp; the other no answer.&nbsp; In the end, I heard of these&nbsp;calls, so I was ready when I got this call, asked&nbsp;questions, &amp; wrote everything down.&nbsp; I hope this will help others after reading this.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it happens to 1,000s of people every day around the world</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice given to anyone who has any phone calls like this about Malware, License Expiry, etc.</p>
<p>And your computer does not send out messages to anyone that it has problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have errors and warnings&nbsp;in our event viewer, which is another ploy they use to scare you</p>
<p>

            Hi  eabear, keyboard lag is generally caused by something else using all your resources on your PC
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager
<br />
<br />Leave that window open, then when you are typing, monitor your CPU, Disc and RAM to see if something is using up your resources, if there is, please report back which process(es) is doing that.
<br />
<br />Another thing to do is:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Keyboards section
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose Uninstall
<br />Restart your PC

<p>
</p><p>I can't keep Task Manager open and type at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox, Windows Defender and Windows Update seem to be using the most Memory. So does Thunderbird.

<p>Dell has been trying to help and I've tried so many things but I still have the problem. I've updated Bios, Chipset, changed Repeat Delay, Repeat Rate.</p>

            Hi Nancy. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Here's how to clear the browser cookies to again get the check box choice to Keep Signed into Facebook (which also should work with Gmail): <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=635402199839158" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/community/questio...</a>
<br /><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/54490?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/5449...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use the FaceBook app from the Microsoft Store app.  
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sorry a technical error.  But it worked for Nancy.  <br /><br />If you cannot stay signed into Facebook or Gmail then I gave the fix which works most, which is to remove cookies to restore the check box to stay signed in.

<h3> joshm289  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse buttons won&#39;t switch</h2>
                    <p>Normally, I use the touchpad on my laptop for the mouse with swapped buttons for left-handed use. Lately, I've had a problem where every time it comes out of sleep mode (or is powered on), the buttons are configured back to default even if they still show
 to be set otherwise. As it stands now, I can't get the touchpad to switch the buttons at all: both settings are configured the same. However, my USB mouse can be switched back and forth just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what's going on here?</p>

<br />If you recently upgraded to a new version of Windows 10, there might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Can I install Windows 8 on a machine with 768 MB RAM&#63;</h2>
                    I'm considering upgrading to Windows 8 but I'm worried if it doesn't let me install Windows 8 after purchasing it.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium functions wonderfully on my PC, the only thing that I miss out is the Aero feature, which I don't mind not having.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the message read that only .1% or 1 in 1000 Surface RT users were experiening the problem, but that the RT 8.1 update through the store was removed for all RT users.&nbsp; It has just&nbsp;re-posted on the Windows Store, so I would consider looking for it
 now.</p>

            Thank you, Charles, my first time ever in any forum.<br />
I have a Dell XPS 10 running Windows RT since Aug 5, 2013. I am very new to windows 8 and windows store. I went to windows store at 8:50pm CDT and, unless I don't know where to look, I could not find any app or notice or listing in the main apptiles sections
 from the opening Spotlight section all the way through to Government. Is this upgrade tile inside one of the categories?<br />
I expected the upgrade link to be easily found and it is not.<br />
I'll keep waiting.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What exactly are you referring to when you say: "It has previously updated from windows 7 to windows 10 without a problem but when it automatically updated to windows 10 pro the update has failed."?
</p>
<p><strong>Originally the pc had windows 7 installed and I carried out the update to windows 10 without a problem. The computer worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then it completed the automatic update from Windows 10 to Windows 10 pro. When this happened it
 got to approx. 25% installing the upgrade and then it restarted. When it attempted to restart it came up with an error saying "Your PC/Device needs to be repaired"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Which are the bootrec commands have you tried while resolving the issue?</p>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">bootrec /fixboot</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hey Rakesh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>II have already set my computer to boot from a USB drive and tried the repair your computer option but it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is an Asus Eee Slate and the strange thing is that I got 2 of those computer, one I updated to Windows 10 last summer without problem and the second one (exactly the same hardware) I just bought used and had refreshed to a new installation of Windows
 10 that keep doing the Raw drive error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still looking for a way to fix that problem. I will try downloading the latest version of the window 10 installer and hope it fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Please see my topic member cpp0702 - topic Windows 10 Feature Update 1703 issues&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have the same Missing Operating System message trying to install 1709 after a clean install of 1703... lots of details of what happens and what I have tried. This Missing Operating System issue definitely needs Microsoft to investigate urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that you can access the missing C drive (now raw) by booting the ISO dvd disk, access command prompt -&gt; chkdsk c: /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have an etl file that doesn't show much except error code 15003 at about the time of the failed second restart.</p>

<p>Hi Joaquin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd be happy to help but we need more information to assist you. First, what platform and edition are you playing on? If you are playing on Xbox One, then you will need an<a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/gold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox Live
 subscription</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different ways of playing multiplayer on Minecraft like Local Area Network (LAN), Online servers, Realms, and Split-screen if you play on consoles. I highly suggest reading the Mojang Support article titled, "<a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/429052-how-do-i-play-multiplayer-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 do I play multiplayer?</a><span>". It has everything you need to know about playing multiplayer on Minecraft.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>LifeCam Cinema &#34;Not Connected&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geojayhawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeCam Cinema &#34;Not Connected&#34;</h2>
                    My LifeCam Cinema works great on my XP system and it works (without features) in Live Messenger on my x64 Vista system. I am running 2 different computers.<br />
When I open the software on my Vista computer the LifeCam black screen opens with a message "Camera Not Connected". So I unplug and plug back in to the same USB, no change; i plug into another USB, no change. I have updated everything there is, I have used
 remote access with Microsoft (said it was a softare issue,yah), spent about 1.5 hours with dell. They would help me for $69 on a brand new Dell Inspiron 545. They said it was hardware/software issue:yes that they pre-installed (nothing wrong with the cam or
 compatability with x64 Vista.Thanks Dell, I'll be sure to tell people how helpful you have been.<br />
Enough ranting. Anyone have any ideas about this problem. I have seen a whole lot like it on various forums. Most of them referring to driver problems.<br />
Help if you can - please, I'm beginning to sharpen the knives lol.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
You are right, most of the times this kinda issues is caused due to drivers. However, apart from that, try the simple possible steps mentioned below:<br />
<br />
1. Check for the drivers of webcam which is compatible with 64bit OS, (32bit drivers will not help).<br />
2. Also make sure you are using the No proxies connection!<br />
3. You can try disabling/uninstall the hardware device from the Device Manager and then restart the computer which should by default try installing the drivers automatically.<br />
4. Try to uninstall and re-install the live messenger and all its components. (install latest messenger)<br />
<br />
<br />
$ Good Luck $

<br />
I'm going to need luck because I have tried your suggestions many times.<br />
It seems unfortunate that Microsoft Hardware will not work on Microsoft Software on a brand new Dell.<br />
I am so frustrated. If I could use a Mac for what I do, I would give this thing (Dell PC)&nbsp;back and get a Mac.

            I also have&nbsp;the problem as described in the first post. Check the screenshot below!<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my specs and what I have tried<br />
*Windows XP SP3<br />
*Also have Intel Core2 Duo E8500<br />
*No IRQ conflicts<br />
*Tried all my USB ports. Directly connected avoiding my USB Hubs.<br />
*Tried with clean boot - without any third party services and startups<br />
*Tried http://sites.google.com/site/pwdionline/Home/Intel_INF_V8301013_xpvista.zip?attredirects=0 as described above. Did not make any difference<br />
*Installed the exact same installer (LifeCam3.0.exe) on my laptop - same OS with same SP3 - and it WORKED. In other words the hardware is OK. This is probably a driver/software issue OR a Intel Core2 Duo E8500 problem<br />

*Can it be a codec issue? I have tried some different codec packs, including the lastest version of&nbsp;K-Lite Mega Codec<br />
*When I run Winamp, I can see that the webcam activates (the blue LED is on) - why?<br />
*When i ran the LifeCam3.0.exe on my laptop (where it worked), it also detected a sound hardware in addition to the balloon viewed in my screenshot above. This did not happen on the machine it does not work on.<br />
<br />
And of course - so I don't get any silly replies: I have reinstalled the LifeCam several times, did some nice reboots, disconnected all my other USB devices and checked for any firmware upgrades for my motherboard etc.

            I re-installed my OS (windows 7) to the factory settings and then installed the camera. It worked after that.&nbsp;I had used PCMover to migrate settings and files from an XP computer. For whatever reason, there was no way to get the LifeCam to work under this
 situation. That is why I had to "go back" to the factory settings.<br />
I think MS is "The Cube" - independent compartments that have little idea of what any other department does.<br />
Good luck getting your hardware working all.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm usnig an older Dell P4 2.8 GHz and it too says "no camera" on this system with the installed s/w that came with the Lifecam Cinema but it works on another computer P3 1GHz but low RAM.&nbsp; Took it back to the Dell and tried Messenger and can see video there
 but really want the other s/w features.<br />
<br />
Come on MS; no update.&nbsp; Heck the Lifecam Cinema doesn't even appear in the product list though you have a nice presentation on the home page but support apparently doesn't know about it.<br />
<br />
Getting sorry I didn't get Logitech.<br />

            Sorry, my screenshot from dump.no is not working anymore.<br />
I just had a HDD crash and had to do a reinstall. I have now exactly the same specs on my computer.
<br />
Also SP3 and all the latest patches. And now the lifecam software works like a charm. So Microsoft: You have&nbsp;a huge bug to fix here!

<p>Funny, I got the same issue on Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled it after 3 usb ports went down with the same problem, and I found this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently the cultprit (at least in my case) was the windows live device integrator, I restored the system (to a point created 2 hours prior) and everything was OK, that was the way I found who was creating the problem and where it was, I hope this helps
 a little</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the problem is in the Registry, I cant pinpoint where</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Lenovo appears limited access to all WiFi networks</h2>
                    Please teach me a step-by-step solution on how can i connect again to the available WiFi Networks. It is Lenovo Windows 7. The&nbsp;****** connection started yesterday when i open my laptop. I even tried connecting to my friends modem yesterday but it also
 shows limited access same as to my pocket WiFi. I restarted and restored my laptop earlier today and it appeared as connected but in the upper corner it says Unidentified network/No internet access. I tried every solution I've read in the forums and blogs
 including changing the IP address but none of it has worked yet. I know there is still a solution. By the way this is the only lapto I have and I'm just using my phone right now to post this. So if there's something that I need to install then I'm afraid I
 cannot do it since I've no other available device to do it. Please help as I need to work on my emails.

<p>I am attempting to use 64-bit versions of my 32-bit programs under Windows 7 Professional 64. Since Adobe has yet to release a 64-bit version of its Flash Player Internet Explorer will have to wait.</p>
<p>However the Windows Media Player can be changed. The 'Start in:' field for the Windows Media Player reads: "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Media Player"</p>
<p>I have two questions: 1) Why are there '%' signs on both sides of 'ProgramFiles(x86)'? and 2) Why are there no spaces in the character string 'ProgramFiles(x86)'?</p>

<p>I am well acquainted with the <span>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node Registry Key. My computer was 'bundled' with all sorts of 'trial' software which I decided to remove prior to the end of the trial period. As usual the removal process left me with folders and registry entries which I
 decided to remove. The folders were problematic because I had to take their ownership away from the 'TrustedInstaller' but I was successful.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response. This means that in order to switch to the 64-bit version of Windows Media Player I need to replace the '%ProgramFiles(x86)%' in the shortcut to: Program Files.
 I also need to unpin the shortcut to the media player from the taskbar. Next I need to pin the shortcut to the 64-bit media player to the taskbar. Finally I shall need to update the 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\</span><span>App
 Paths\wmplayer.exe' registry entry. Pretty simple.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to update to the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer but, alas,&nbsp;Adobe has yet to release its 64-bit version of Flash Player. Due to this I have decided to wait for it to be releaseed
 prior to making the switch.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I view files starting with &#126; &#40;tilda&#41; in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I view files starting with ~ (tilda) in windows 10? &nbsp; </p>
<p>These are .tmp files, which were copied onto a new PC over my network while I was setting it up. I want to remove them, but cannot find a way to view them on the new Win 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting 'show hidden files' in my Windows 10 PC still leaves any .tmp file beginning with ~ hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see them over the network using windows explorer from a another computer running XP and can delete them remotely (and the extra space freed up shows in disk properties under Win 10).</p>
<p>The invisible files can be made to become visible on my Win 10 PC if I change their name across the network by putting characters before the ~ (tilda). &nbsp;e.g. changing '~ filename.tmp' to 'copy of&nbsp;~ filename.tmp' makes it visible on the Win 10 PC windows
 explorer. &nbsp;Removing the prefix makes it invisible again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be welcome! &nbsp;Thanks</p>

    <title>Skype keeps dropping calls after 10 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype keeps dropping calls after 10 seconds</h2>
                    I use to be able to use Skype all the time. In the past 2 weeks it keeps bumping me out after 10 seconds. I actually talk to my destination for 10 seconds only and it bumps me out. I've&nbsp; tried to go back to the old Skype and it is still doing it. It also
 does this when logging in using my phone. I can't even call the echo test as it bumps me out right after I record my message. I have not been able to hear back the message I left.

<p><span>To further investigate, what is your device’s operating system and the version of Skype you are using? Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype? How about using a different internet connection?
</span></p>

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Check if the issue is caused by some of the hardware malfunctioning on your computer. I suggest that you disconnect all the External devices connected to your computer, except the mouse and keyboard
 and check if you can able to boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>After the Windows Logo displays or after you log on to Windows, a Windows XP-based computer may only display the wallpaper, a black screen, or a blue screen:

    <title>MTU Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldiablorobotico  say:</h3>
<h2>            MTU Issue</h2>
                    
<p>a couple of days ago i turn on my 360 and it shows i am disconnected from xbox live. i run a test and it says my MTU settings are too low, needs to be at least 1354. never been an issue before and i didn't change any settings on my router or xbox prior to
 this error. i changed my MTU settings, tried a few different numbers between 1354 and 1460 (my isp's max). still won't connect. i removed the router from the equation and hooked up the 360 directly to the modem and i still get the same error. i called my ISP
 and they say everything is fine on their end.&nbsp; i've spent probably 6 hours now changing settings on my router and 360.&nbsp; i've gone through all the troubleshooting pages on the xbox live website and still can't get past the insufficient MTU error.&nbsp; any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hey mate, when you connected directly to your modem, did you take a few seconds to power-cycle it? You'll run into issues if the power isn't reset on the modem. If you've tried that, you'll need to continue working with your ISP, as the issue is with the
 base connection, and not any network settings on your end.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delayed response. If the desktop icons position is displaced, you may select auto arrange settings for the same. To do this, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the desktop <span>(between icons to get the desktop context menu, not on an icon itself).</span></li><li>Click on the <strong>View</strong> option.</li><li>Choose <strong>Auto arrange icons</strong> on the menu. </li></ol>
<p>While Auto Arrange is now disabled, Windows&nbsp;8 will not randomly shuffle your desktop icons. If this is not what you are looking for then do reply so we can help you further.</p>

<p><br />
No this is not what I mean. I know auto arrange is the MS arrangement. I keep auto arrange unchecked but sometimes MS moves the icons around.&nbsp; I want to prevent this from happening.&nbsp; There is a program that can be downloaded from the Internet that worked very
 well on Windows XP. It does not state that it is for Windows 8.&nbsp; Shall I try it anyway?</p>

<p>Under the same settings I suggested earlier, please check if <strong>Align icons to grid</strong> is unchecked. If so, check the same and see if it helps.

<h2>            recover skype hacked account</h2>
                    I tried to log in today using my skype credentials but was shocked that someone has hacked my account and not only changed the password but even the reference email id. I tried to contact skype help line but the procedure was beyond my comprehension. Please
 advise.
