<h2>            disable random addresses for my wifi adapter through registry entry</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>I want to disable random addresses for my wifi adapter from the registry entry. I have tried modifying&nbsp;the RandomMacState in "</span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WlanSvc\Interfaces\{C310FC3F-372B-419D-A620-58CD3CDB3481}</span><span>"
 to 00000000 but its still changing MAC address and bypassing my home gateway.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            What&#39;s Another Audio Driver &#40;Besides Realtek&#41; That Supports Audio Enhancements&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, I've been having an annoying issue where my games would freeze and the audio would cut out. I turned to some forums and found that the problem was Realtek's audio driver. I uninstalled the driver and was completely glitch-free, however I also
 use programs like TeamSpeak and Skype to chat with some friends while playing games. My mic has some annoying static, so I constantly used the noise suppression effect on my mic to help w/ the static. However, now that I have Window's Default Audio Driver,
 I have no enhancements. So, now I'm looking for any type of solution or replacement that take can Realtek's spot. Please respond as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I don't think you understand, I already tried this and stated that this was the solution to my error. I am now using Microsoft's Default Audio Codec, however I still need the audio enhancements for my recording device. I'm searching for any other codec
 that can bring that upon me.

<h2>            Funimation Website - cannot get through</h2>
                    My son has a new subscription to Funimation.com, a website that streams anime videos. Certain episodes are blocked by Family Safety and when I try to input my password to allow him access, it doesn't work. In fact, the Family Safety screen always freezes.
 I've tried using Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. Same problem with all three browsers.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To fix this, you need to delete any corrupted files, and re-download your settings from the Family Safety website. Here’s how:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure your children are signed out of any monitored accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in with an administrator account and find the folder that contains the corrupted files.
<br />
<br />
There are two ways to do this. The easiest way is to enter the complete file path:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the Start screen, type <span><strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls</strong> and press Enter.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you’d rather open each folder individually, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press the start button and type Parental Control.
</span></p>
b) Open <strong>C:</strong>, open the <strong>Program Data</strong> folder, open the
<strong>Microsoft</strong> folder, open the <strong>Windows</strong> folder, and open the
<strong>Parental Controls</strong> folder.
<p>c) D<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">elete all contents of the <span><strong>Parental Controls</strong> folder.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This will delete any corrupt files. Your settings will be downloaded again from familysafety.microsoft.com the next time you sign in.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note that it’s possible for the files to become corrupted again. If you experience more problems with Family Safety time limits and PC activity reporting, just follow these steps again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let us know if you need further help.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <blockquote>In fact, the Family Safety screen always freezes. </blockquote>
<p>What exactly does this "freeze" entail?&nbsp; Are you referring to the "Ask in Person" and "E-Mail Your Request" buttons not functioning? If so, this is a persistent issue among many Windows 7 users that Microsoft has neglected to answer whether they've checked
 things out on their end, and nobody who's reported it has come forward saying they've had it fixed yet. If that's not it, sorry for bringing it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit: But if you are having that same issue, and Pranav's solution hasn't solved it yet, I can offer a temporary fix.&nbsp;You can&nbsp;go into the Family Safety website (<a href="https://familysafety.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://familysafety.microsoft.com</a>)&nbsp;and
 manually add the blocked site, then open the Family Safety filter from your computer (mine, at least, is located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live\Family Safety\) and hit the refresh button in the top right corner. It's a hassle, but it's better than
 being locked out of your sites. Of course, if that isn't the same issue you've been having, again, sorry for going off track.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PranavMishra, I've tried doing this in case it's related to my own issue, but it seems that I don't have a "Parental Controls" folder where you say it is. I was able to find the hidden "ProgramData" folder, but not the one marked "Parental Controls".&nbsp;Out
 of curiosity, is this perhaps the file path that's meant for Windows 8 PCs, rather than Windows 7? (This question is listed under the Windows 7 section.)&nbsp;A Google search of that file path returned results related to Windows 8, and people I've been discussing
 my own issue with have indicated that the reason the aforementioned Windows 7 Family Safety issue persists may be that tech support is only checking for Windows 8 functionality. At any rate, if there is a difference, then knowing the equivalent file path on
 Windows 7 systems would be helpful.</p>

<p>For me, I use the Aug and the Enfield. I haven't used the Famas in months now and I never really used it or liked it that much ever. It's just too easy. I find it funny people who are 15th prestige with 15 plus days played still using it.... Doesn't it get
 boring? Um, subs... Mac11 until I get the Spectre. Spas for the shotgun and I agree with the Korean person, I like the Psg1 way better than the L9.

            There can be several reasons why Windows is not accepting your product key. To troubleshoot the issue, follow the instructions mentioned on the link below:<br />

<br />
If the issue still persists, you are advised to contact HP technical support through the link below for further assistance as you have got this Windows pre-installed by OEM:<br />

<h2>            Hard drive failed, want to keep windows 7 for new hard drive or SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently windows told me there is a problem with my hard drive and that I should backup my data onto an external storage device, in case it fails but don't want to backup my files since they're not important. When I tried to access file explorer the
 next day after i got the warning my computer froze. I'm haven't rebooted the laptop since then in fear that it might make it more worn out, since I may still need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to order a &nbsp;new hard drive or SSD and do not want to buy windows 10 because it's expensive. Instead I want to keep my current OS, which is windows 7 Home premium which came preinstalled on my laptop. &nbsp;I do not have any recovery disks and I didn't
 do any backups at all, but here is a windows 7 product key stuck onto the back of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I was wondering if I can use the product key to install windows 7 onto the new HDD/SSD and if so how I would go about it. Also, if I can't do it using the key is there any other way (since I may be able to still use it), because I do not want to have to
 buy any other OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifications:</p>
<p>Laptop: TOSHIBA Satellite A660</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>(Let me know if you need more details)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.<br />
</p>

            <p>If you are still able to boot to the Windows 7 desktop on the current hard disk, try creating a recovery disk set. See instructions in the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/toshiba-recovery-disk/#Create_disc_for_Windows_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/wiki/toshiba-recovery-disk/#Create_disc_for_Windows_7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating the recovery disc set, shut down, install the new SSD then use the recovery disc set to reinstall Windows 7 on the new SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need 4 blank DVDs. </p>

<p>Kann ich nicht Nachvollziehen.</p>
<p>Für mich ist die XBox One schon eine gute Lösung.</p>
<p>Von woche zu woche Laufen mehr XBox 360 Spiele die ich noch am Spielen bin.</p>
<p>Und wenn meine Freundin warum auch immer mal die Glotze belegt, setze ich mich an meinen (schon Älteren PC) und kann dort meine XBox One Spiele spielen.</p>
<p>Zum Spielen ist der PC zu alt und die Spiele würden dort auch nicht Laufen.</p>
<p>Sicherlich werde ich bei dieser Kombi bleiben.</p>

<p>Naja das ganze wird aber ein Großteil der Leute nix nutzen da sie nicht den entsprechenden PC dafür haben und wenn ich sehe wieviel schon bei 399€ für die PS4 zB gejammert haben weil es so teuer ist werden sich diese sicher lieber eine Konsole kaufen anstatt
 einen PC für 1000€+</p>

<p>Was bei der PS4 "perfekt" sein soll, kann ich auch nicht ganz nachvollziehen. Der Grütze Controlller ist so unergonomisch, das er für mich kaufentscheidend war ! Ein Kumpel von mir (bekennender Playstation Fanboy), hat sich für seinen PC nen ONE Contoller
 geholt, seitdem zockt er nur noch PC und die PS4 verstaubt in der Ecke ! Zudem will er sich die VR Brille jetzt auch nicht mehr für die PS4 sondern ebenfalls für den PC holen. Die Kombi PC/PS4 könnte also für die PS4 ziemlich nach hinten losgehen, wenn die
 PS4 Besitzer mal erfahren, wie sich Ergonomie wirklich anfühlt ! ; )</p>

<p>Ich finde es schrecklich, dass MS scheinbar seine Exklusive Spiele auch für den Windows 10 PC &nbsp;bringt, die sind nämlich das Kaufargument für eine Konsole.</p>
<p>Nintendo würde sowas nie machen!</p>
<p>Das wirkt jetzt auf mich als ob die Xbox Sparte nicht mehr so wichtig für MS wäre .</p>

            <p>Ja - Nein - Vielleicht.</p>
<p>Du hast durch das Crossbuyfeature als Xbox Spieler ja keinen Nachteil - Die Spiele gibt es ja auch weiterhin auf der Konsole - Nun kannst du aussuchen wie und wo du die Spiele spielen willst.</p>
<p>Wenn man sich den Preis für einen PC anguckt den du für Quantum Break brauchst~ ja kann man mal kaufen....wenn du so ca 1500€ irgendwo liegen hast~</p>

<p>also ich seh das nicht so negativ.</p>
<p>Für die Publisher ist es gut, da sie so einen größeren Absatzmarkt haben.</p>
<p>Zudem könnten Leute, die sich einen entsprechenden PC leisten können, durchaus motiviert sein, sich mit dem Zukauf einer ONE "günstig" ein kleines Heimnetzwerk aufzubauen !</p>

<p>Aber warum benötigt man dafür dann noch eine Xbox in der aktuellen Form? </p>
<p>Da kann MS doch genauso die Xbox einstampfen und eine Art "Steambox" rausbringen, oder? Wenn's denen doch um das Wohl der Spieler geht, dann sparen die Spieler sogar noch die Goldmitgliedschaft, und die Spiele sind auch günstiger.</p>
<p>Für die Spieler finde ich die Entscheidung von MS ja in Ordnung, aber bei den zukünftigen Verkaufzahlen der Xbox bin ich da eher skeptisch.</p>

            <p>Eine Xbox brauchst du deswegen noch immer weil auch nicht alle Spiele kommen werden und die Xbox immer noch enorm viel billiger ist als ein PC für 5-6 Jahre mit Blu-Ray-Laufwerk und der Ausstattung das du die Spiele spielen kannst~</p>

<p>Na ja, ein PC mit der Hardwareleistung der Xbox wird bestimmt kein Vermögen kosten.
</p>
<p>Dafür spart man aber auch die Goldmitgliedschaft, und neue Spiele kosten für den PC häufig ca. 20€ weniger als für die Xbox.</p>
<p>Wegen dem Bluray Laufwerk wird sich ja kaum jemand eine Konsole kaufen, die Zeit ist ja eigentlich vorbei.</p>
<p>Bin jedenfalls gespannt, wie sich das weiter entwickelt...........bevor ich mir die nächste Xbox kaufe, würde ich jedenfalls über den Kauf eines PC's nachdenken. ;-)</p>

<h2>            Intermittent Connectivity Issues with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded, there have been some connectivity issues with Windows 10. &nbsp;My computer will suddenly stop successfully loading webpages until I manually turn off and on the WiFi switch and let the computer automatically re-connect to my network. &nbsp;This
 never happened with Windows 7. &nbsp;Yes, I've cleaned out my browser history. &nbsp;Yes, I have enough RAM. &nbsp;Yes, I turned my router and modem off/on and waited. &nbsp;Yes, other devices are connected to the same wireless network and have no connectivity issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem?</p>

            There is another thread for this, but yes I have had this problem for two weeks. Spent 90 minutes on the phone to Microsoft this am they could not fix it. Apparently they need to speak to someone more senior and are going to ring me back. Mine crashes
 in clusters, will be OK for hours and then crashes five times in 30 minutes. I have in addition a Windows 7 laptop that continues to maintain it's connection! Also spoke to my PC manufacturer HP, they reckon I need a W10 Driver but it has not been released
 yet!<br />

            <p>I have had this same problem for over a month after switching to Windows 10.&nbsp; The catch is that when Windows 10 was made available to me and said it was ready for the upload, while following the steps to upgrade, never once did it tell me to backup my system,
 so I can't go back to Windows 8.1 which is what I was on before the upgrade.&nbsp; Maybe this is common knowledge to IT savvy individuals, however, to us common folk, we may not think of that while following instructions.&nbsp; I bought this laptop with Windows 8.1
 on it, so we don't have a disk to reinstall it, and I cannot figure out where I can download it again to switch back to it until Windows/Intel has fixed this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, the minute the upgrade was finished and my computer restarted to unveil the Windows 10, I immediately started experiencing connection issues, where this was never an issue previously.&nbsp; It would connect for a few minutes, then no connection.&nbsp; Sometimes
 it will show the surrounding networks, sometimes it won't.&nbsp; When troubleshooting the connection issues, sometimes it says its the default gateway, sometimes that's not the issue and it just restarts the wireless adapter, and sometimes it says the DNS server
 is unavailable (308).&nbsp; I've tried downloading a different wireless adapter, which my computer won't or doesn't recognize and I can't get my computer to switch over to the newly downloaded adapter.&nbsp; I am on an HP Envy TS 15, and my default adapter is an Intel(R)
 Centrino(R) Wireless N-2230 (version 15.16.0.2).&nbsp; sometimes my internet will work for hours, and then sometimes I can't get it to work for 30 seconds straight.&nbsp; I'm required to work from home at times, and I cannot get enough of a fluid connection to be able
 to get anything done.&nbsp; I use Cisco VMWare Horizon.&nbsp; I never had these issues before I upgraded to Windows 10, and after 4 wasted Saturdays trying to troubleshoot this issue, I'm really no further than where I was when I started.&nbsp; Ive tried following all the
 troubleshooting steps I've found on various threads, all of which have obviously not worked.&nbsp; It doesn't seem that I am the only one based on everything I have read.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh and to add, when I go into Device Manager and view the properties of the wireless adapter,
 It always tells me I am using the most up to date adapter and that the device is working properly, even when it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance in fixing this would be appreciated.&nbsp; I don't want a troubleshoot, I've already done a million.&nbsp; I want a fix.</p>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To amend to this gentleman's comment, the connection being "INTERMITTANT" does mean what we are implying... the connection in my case is on a wireless PCI card (Linksys WMP54G v4.1 Wireless-G PCI Adapter.) ONLY SOME APPLICATIONS are having issues connecting...
 Microsoft Edge will NOT connect (Never since Windows 10 Upgrade&nbsp;(even while WinAmp is streaming music live from Paris, France.)) Internet Explorer WILL (most of the time, sometimes, I'll open IE and connect - do a search, and new tab cannot connect.) Ping,
 well, sometimes, I can't even ping my router... Cortana HAS to open Microsoft Edge, so a web search there fails... I'm typing this message on this "issue" pc with Windows 10 on it (fingers crossed I can submit this.) I've tried clearing cache (told IE to clear
 upon exit,) resetting the Winsock Catalog (at a command prompt (no quotes): "netsh winsock reset catalog". tried the OEM driver after using Windows built-in failed... tried network troubleshooter... OF COURSE it CAN connect... sees no issues... I will have
 to try compatibility mode driver install, after I post this, then I will update, IF I can connect.</p>

            Hello, Sad&amp;Unhappy,
<br />
<br />Download Windows Defender Offline and run a full scan to rid yourself of possible malware.

<br />Did you have copyrighted material taken from you?
<br />
<br />If a work is registered prior to infringement or within three months of publication, statutory damages will be available as an option for monetary relief, and the recovery for attorney’s fees may be available. In addition, a registration made before or within five years of publication of the work provides a presumption of the validity of the copyright and the facts stated within the registration certificate. A certificate of registration (or a rejection of an application for copyright) is a prerequisite for U.S. authors seeking to initiate a suit for copyright infringement in federal district court. See Circular 1 Copyright Basics, and sections 410, 411, and 412 of the copyright law.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may wish to seek professional legal advice from a copyright attorney and to discuss your legal options. The Copyright Office is unable to provide referrals or a list of attorneys. Your local or state bar association may be able to recommend a copyright attorney, or an attorney who specializes in intellectual property, arts, or entertainment law matters. Alternatively, you may wish to investigate whether a public interest organization that offers services to authors and copyright owners, such as Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, has a regional office in your area that may assist you with locating free or reduced fee legal services or assistance. In addition, local law schools may provide representation through clinical programs in Intellectual Property or Arts and Entertainment Law. 
<br />If you believe that a criminal infringement of copyright has occurred, you may contact the Intellectual Property (IP) Program of the Financial Institution Fraud Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<br />Two main FBI divisions investigate intellectual property crimes: 
<br />Cyber Division
<br />-investigates intellectual property crimes involving all digital and electronic works (including Internet, CDs, DVDs, etc) www.fbi.gov/ipr
<br />Financial Institution Fraud Unit
<br />-all other intellectual property crimes
<br />There are three ways a complaint made be filed:
<br />Complainants may contact their local FBI field office, and the complaint will be properly referred. 
<br />A complaint may be filed online at the Internet Crime Complaint Center www.ic3.gov and, again, it will be properly routed. 
<br />Suspected criminal activity of any nature may be reported online at <a href="https://tips.fbi.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tips.fbi.gov</a> and will be routed accordingly.

            Hey Sad.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear this.  What tells you this has been done by hackers?
<br />
<br />What I'd immediately do is change your router password to a more complicated one:  <a href="https://www.techradar.com/broadband/how-to-change-your-router-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techradar.com/broadband/how-to-chan...</a>
<br />
<br />Do likewise with your Windows or Microsoft Account password:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/change-password-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/change-passw...</a>
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402697...</a>
<br />
<br />Then change to a much more secure password for all of your email accounts, bank sign-ins, merchant website accounts, etc.  
<br />
<br />An example of a good strong password is a childhood address + phone number only you would remember, e.g.   *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.+213-123-4567.  Note there are six memorable symbols there which always count more than characters.  
<br />
<br />Uninstall any TeamViewer or remote connection you ever had installed.  Go through  Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features to uninstall anything you don't recognize, or ask back.
<br />
<br />Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>I tried the recommendation given on this page by the user PeterHup for upgrading to 8.1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/6d4baee8-80e6-4f52-902e-7a598a7d5533/error-0x80070714?forum=w8itproinstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to have done the trick for me on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions copied from that thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
1. Run MSCONFIG, click on the services tab and turn off each service that starts with "SQL Server" -&nbsp; Reboot</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
2. Install upgrade</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
3. Run MSCONFIG and turn on your "SQL Server" services back on- Reboot</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Enjoy</p>
<p>I can't take credit for this but I hope it helps someone.</p>

<h2>            Skype Obituary&#58; if you don&#39;t fix the disappearing Skype dial-pad...</h2>
                    <p>Hi Skype Support</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many articles about how Skype is like the airline pilot that won the lottery.&nbsp; When asked about what he was going to do with the money, replied:&nbsp; "I'm going to invest it, reinvest it, and keep on investing it until it is all gone..."&nbsp; If
 you cannot fix this problem, I'm canceling my service:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dial pad&nbsp;often,&nbsp;but not always, disappears when a call connects.&nbsp; If the call is answered by a phone tree, "Push 1 for sales, Push 2 for support or push 0 for the operator",&nbsp; you can't push anything and the call fails or goes to voicemail.&nbsp; So you just
 have to hang up and call using your mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm tired of this and you will either fix the problem or I'm going to cancel my service and post this as Skype's epitaph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Firstly, thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now about those questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) As I said, I have deleted the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCALMACHINE_SOFTWARE_MMC_CLSID: FX:{b05566ac-fe9c-4368-be02-7a4cbb7cbe11} (not quite sure about the whole name but it was something like that),
 this is the only change I've done to the computer prior to the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2) Yes, I have only one account and that is the Administrator one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3) Yes,
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Firewall</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> is enabled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">...and about that suggestion, I did that, restarted the PC but it didn't have any effect.</span></p>

<p>I just picked up a 1 month xbox live gold membership a few days ago, I purchased the xbox 360 games with gold and also the xbox one games with gold. The xbox 360 games work just fine I get achievements and everything on them, but &nbsp;I have only downloaded
 Zheroes<span>&nbsp;for my xbox one and I looked at my achievement list for that game I have gotten 100% on some of the achievements but they have a lock on them do you have to actually purchase the games after you gold membership runs
 out to get the achievements to unlock or what is wrong here?</span></p>

    <title>Missing dll thanks to malwarebytes, help&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vista...sigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing dll thanks to malwarebytes, help&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I quarantined a file that malwarebytes considered a trojan.agent.GGEP which was mfvdsp.dll located in the winsxs folder. I don't know if this is a false positive or not because malwarebytes refuses to let me restore the file, it just disappears
 and then returns if I click back on the quarantine tab. After trying to restore the quarantined file I ran an sfc /scannow which came up with corrupted files that it couldn't fix. As you can see below the file that couldn't be repaired was the file Mbam nuked
 and won't give back.<br />
<br />
Can you please help me figure out if this was indeed a trojan or of this was a false positive. If it was a false positive can you explain how I can fix my windows install now that the file is gone? What is the missing file related to? Are there any risks if
 I just continue to use the install?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I posted this on the malwarebytes forum but they refuse to help or even bother with a response. Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was looking over this issue and noted that the dll is not a standard one.</p>
<p>The message that you are seeing is most likely a remnant of that file in the registry or startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find and rid yourself of this through clean boot troubleshooting, a process detailed in the following article:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in
 Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></p>

            <p>Certainly... go to Control Panel - Programs - Default Programs - Set Default Programs...</p>
<p>In the left hand pane highlight <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WMP</span> - click 'set this program as default' then 'OK'. - That should do it.</p>
<p>(Just be aware that if you are using any other media programs as your present default choice that they may be changed as a result - if this is a problem you'll need to choose default settings for particular file types instead.)</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<h2>            Win 7 Pro 64 won&#39;t boot after motherboard upgrade</h2>
                    I have upgraded the motherboard in my HP Slimline desktop and my existing Win 7 install will not boot. Is there a way to start and fix existing install. There is a OEM install on the D partition but I believe it is specific to the old motherboard. If that
 is the case, can I download Win 7 Pro from site and use my HP License and Product Key from back of the computer?

<p>When you change/upgrade a motherboard you normally have to do a clean install due to the fact that the installed operating system has the drivers installed from the prior motherboard and there is no way to change them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you have created another problem for yourself with activation&nbsp;by upgrading your motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not replace&nbsp;the Motherboard with an OEM preinstalled License with whatever Motherboard you wish to when you have a preinstalled OEM License (HP, Acer, etc)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>You have to follow the directives or you void your OEM License.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The link no longer goes there but the information is correct.</p>

</p><div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>If my customer asks me to upgrade a PC with new hardware components, when is a new operating system needed? When would the PC be considered "new"?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>—and still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC
<strong>as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought and installed your own Retail&nbsp;Windows Liceese, you can change Motherboards, but doing that will now require a Phone Activation and you should not follow the Auto prompts, but hold on for a real preson to explain to.</p>

            This is the same person as above. Had problems getting back in so I made a new account. I actually had to replace the motherboard due to failure. I replaced the Nara6 board with a HP Aloe board I bought on Ebay. Different board, same era.

<p>If after you get the system running it fails to activate give the Microsoft activation humans a call and explain your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the first person you talk to can't assist, call back and the chances are good that you will talk to somebody else and pretty soon you may find a sympathetic understanding ear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've called them before and they have gone so far as to send me a genuine installation DVD with a brand new product key (US Mail) at no charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the right person(s) and they'll even send you an XP installation CD and product key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e98783dc-ca50-4e42-ae5f-0ab45584e78d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e98783dc-ca50-4e42-ae5f-0ab45584e78d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the product fails to activate you can see if you can activate online or usually the easiest thing to do it talk to an activation expert (an actual human being) at
<del>Microdot</del> Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>slui&nbsp; 4</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose your nearest country (United States in the example), call the toll-free number to speak to a human being:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2701bc34-e26b-49a5-9c69-387e40808a6e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2701bc34-e26b-49a5-9c69-387e40808a6e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't press any keys on your phone, don't respond to any voice prompts, just wait, wait, wait and you will be connected to a human being.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explain your situation and they should help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If they don't help or can't help just hang up and call back again and the chances are good that you will talk to a different person and eventually you should find some nice person that will help you.</p>
