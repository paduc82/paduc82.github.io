            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to use add-ins in Word online like Word application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do note that add-ins cannot be installed in Word for online. I suggest you to post your feedback from the Word online. For more information, please refer to the following article and check if it helps:</p>

            Thank you Sagnik. Yet i am not clear. I have gone through the link http://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/word/word-add-ins-programming-overview to get an idea of how to develop word add-in. My doubt is what is the difference between the add-ins that is created
 using VSTO and the add-ins created by using the methods specified in the above link? Can we create all the VSTO add-ins(for the desktop version) on word online version also by using the above mentioned method? &nbsp;

            Are you sure it came from Nokia? The chain of Received: headers in the mail will tell you that as the From: header can be forged easily.

<p>I had a similar issue with them about leaving a review about a game. i left a positive comment about it but they said it violated their terms and threatened to lock me out, like they have you, if i did it again. my comment was this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'speed touch is simple great fun but i must warn you that it is massively addictive as you constantly want to beat your own high score'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if you ask me thats a great review but since then i refuse to review their products because we seem to get punished for it for no apparent reason.</p>

<br />
Isn't it obvious? You used the word "but" - that's a big negative word. Especially when read by moderators. The moderators could be analytical computer software, or human morons, it doesn't much matter which.<br />
<br />
The only thing&nbsp; to get into your head here, is that you're dealing with the new Nokia. The new Nokia doesn't understand people. Therefore it doesn't undertand how to care for people.<br />
<br />
The new Nokia, with it's smartphone ranges, are no longer shifting boxes with simple, technically reliable phones inside. They were good at producing simple telephones. However, they are now producing small computers, which can be used in many ways, just like
 any PC.<br />
<br />
They were never setup to deal with users. They are a "techy" company which delights in demonstrating its technical developments to "techy" reviewers - "Look how clever we are". They haven't a clue what to do about reviews from real users, whether of their phones,
 or, now, their software.<br />
<br />
In addition, the staff involved with this new Ovi Store are equally inexperienced (immature in the people management function ), and so are overly sensitive to criticism.<br />
<br />
All credible online stores relish customer feedback on their websites. Negative feedbsack makes the supplier think twice about producing rubbish in the future, knowing it's going to receive poor reviews. Also, the store, in this case the Ovi store, gets credibility
 for publishing negative, but honest reviews.<br />
<br />
eBay, QVC, and others rely on true feedback being published on their websites. People are not stupid, whatever Nokia / Ovi thinks. They know the feedback /reviews cannot be trusted if they are all positive.<br />
<br />
Another poster put it best when he said that the Ovi site is like a 6th form school project, run by immature school students. They have no clue how to deal with mature adults and the mature busines world.<br />
<br />
Somebody like Richard Branson needs to have a word in Nokia's ear, at a high level, before they implode. They just don't know how to listen to their own customers.

<p>I have received the same email for posting one critical comment about the lack of ability of the ovi store to allow me to purchase the Angry Birds expansion pack.&nbsp; I then got the same email, and my account is closed with no warning.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my comment I did
 not use foul language etc.&nbsp; I just said it is crazy that nokia has released a store with out the ability to buy anything!&nbsp; That seems like a valid complaint, but I guess that is so bad you get your account cancelled.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that the management of Ovi Store terms and policies is a badly configured computer. Have any of you tried to email Nokia separately? I mean not replying to the email sent to you but a more direct email to their customer service? I think
 at least those guys are real people.</p>

<p>Hi, just a quick update. If you take a look at the post by gdlocon, it's from 22.07.2010. The user hasn't visit since either, so it's unlikely that he will reply.<br />
<br />
No offense, but a good tip is to just look at the date of the post. I've made a couple of these mistakes my self:)<br />
<br />
If the device is locked to an operator, you will have to contact that operator to get it unlocked. Various operators works with various prices on unlocking devices. It also depends on how long time is left of the lock period. Some operators offers free unlocks
 if the phone is bought with a subscription and the subscription is still on. Call and ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the user turns up again, call your friend who got it and ask if your friend could call the operator and get it unlcoked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers:)</p>

    <title>How can a text editing software be as bad as Microsoft Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william von brinzanschauer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can a text editing software be as bad as Microsoft Word&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using Microsoft Word for three years and I have serious complaints about the horrific way it works and how poorly formated it is. It does a lot of actions that cannot be reversed and only makes the document worse. It is the worst program to
 work with, knowing that other programs such as paint or paint.net don't mess a document up so much, there are a lot of alternatives, WAY better than this horrible mess. If you don't want to waste your time and your calmness, use InDesign, for example. I'm
 glad i didn't spend money on buying a license. Congratulations on frustrating people who have a basic idea about what they're doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This function calculates age&nbsp;as a&nbsp;number with decimal places. When I try to convert this number to a integer it is&nbsp;rounds it up, so that if a person's age&nbsp;is 17.9 (in real&nbsp;terms) it is rounded to 18.</p>
<p>I would like it so no rounding occurred and if a person was 17.9 in&nbsp;real terms it would be&nbsp;convert to&nbsp;17, and&nbsp; rounding occurred.</p>
<p>Can you help</p>

            For greater flexibility add the following function to a standard module in the database:<br />
<br />
Public Function GetAge(dtmDoB As Date, Optional varAgeAt As Variant) As Integer<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsMissing(varAgeAt) Then varAgeAt = VBA.Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAge = DateDiff("yyyy", dtmDoB, varAgeAt) - _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIf(Format(varAgeAt, "mmdd") &lt; Format(dtmDoB, "mmdd"), 1, 0)<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
The second argument is optional, so if it's called with just the date of birth passed into in, GetAge([Dob]) then it returns the age at the current date, but if a second argument is passed into the function, it returns the age at that date, so in your case
 you'd put the following in the query design grid:<br />
<br />
Age at Review: GetAge([DoB], [Review Date])<br />
<br />

    <title>Space Bar doesn&#39;t work in Composition area - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keith r. starkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Space Bar doesn&#39;t work in Composition area</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just weird. Out of nowhere, my Space Bar no longer works in the area in which you compose an e-mail. It works fine on the the subject line, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after restarting my computer, the Space Bar just won't work. Works fine in everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why it doesn't work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, my browser is Chrome Canary</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Found the problem. For some strange reason, Hotmail (Outlook) is changing the input in the Compose area to HTML, which is making the Space Bar cease functioning as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just below the Composition area, where you see SEND, DISCARD, Attach (paper clip), Insert Picture, etc., there's a little downward arrow; clicking it and choosing "Switch to Text" solves the problem; however, it resets back to HTML when closing or finishing
 the composition. This needs to be fixed, obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

    <title>Bing maps can&#39;t sign in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeduguid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing maps can&#39;t sign in</h2>
                    <p>I can't sign in fully to Bing Maps to access My Places:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the top bar user icon, I click this and sign in to my microsoft account successfully</li><li>I then click on the top bar icon My Places</li><li>A sidebar opens on the left title 'Temporary Collection'</li><li>Clicking 'Sign in' within this sidebar opens a pop up window that close instantaneously</li><li>This achieves nothing.. I still see the temporary collection sidebar with sign in button. No further functionality enabled</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking around the other similar posts here, I'm almost certain to receive a cookie-cutter response blaming me, so to preempt the expected answer:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried on multiple browsers (chrome, firefox, ie11) on multiple PCs, multiple OS (7,8,10)</li><li>This includes a fresh install of firefox</li><li>Have also tried on a factory reset ipad and safari</li><li>I have cleared cache etc</li><li>I have either no anti-virus or have switched it off</li><li>Browsers have either no addons are have had them disabled</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The results are the same everywhere: no sign in to My Places. The account is active and used for email, onedrive etc with no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Signed out of upper right user icon</li><li>Click sign in on Temporary Collection sidebar</li><li>Create a new account in the pop up</li><li>New account created</li><li>Still left with Temporary Collection sign in..?!</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Bing Maps doesn't work. A real shame as the maps are nice and some good features, but if the basics of signing in are completely broken then what's the point?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to reproduce this issue so can only ask if potentially your were having internet issues or DNS routing failures?&nbsp; My apologies for the delayed response, has the problem resolved?&nbsp; Does it work if you are on a different network?&nbsp; Any other issues
 that you can think of that might have impacted your access?</p>

<p>This still doesn't work. I've tried on multiple PCs, multiple networks, both home and corporate.
</p>
<p>It's clearly not a network issue when in the right hand menu I am signed in, yet on the left hand menu I'm not. It's just rubbish development with no quality control, so stop trying to blame users and making excuses.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/526dba8a-6eaf-4edc-b406-2724e51c93aa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/526dba8a-6eaf-4edc-b406-2724e51c93aa?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Money Version 14.0</h2>
                    <p>I am running MS Money v14.0 on an old PC.</p>
<p>I would like to transfer it to my new lap top but cant find the original set up disc</p>
<p>I have tried using the Sunset version but it doesn't recognise the .mny file</p>
<p>Using a search engine I have been unable to find a version of MS Money 14.0 that I can buy.</p>
<p>Any suggestions people?</p>
<p>I have a few years files on this and would rather not start all over again.</p>

<p>Not been able to open a *.mny file can be because the Money version that created it had not been updated</p>

<p>Hi Vikas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my test, I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dawiese/2017/04/15/get-office365-usage-reports-from-the-microsoft-graph-using-windows-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
registered&nbsp;an App in Azure AD to access the usage reports</a>. But when I ran the script, it exported a blank Excel file. So may I confirm if you encounter the same situation? If so, the issue could be related with some abnormal function areas of the script.
 Meanwhile, when did the issue occur?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, did you get any error message from the PowerShell? Please capture a screenshot of the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Hi Vikas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code lines 154 to 161 are part of function which gathers data via Graph. So if it goes wrong, it will fail to collect the usage report data and export the blank file. Meanwhile, the error InvokeMethodOnNull indicates the script is attempting to do something,
 but another part of the script does not have any information to permit the first part of the script to work properly. For your reference,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            C7 - switches itself off</h2>
                    
<p>I've always had a nokia phone since my first one 12 years ago.&nbsp; I really like my new C7 which I've had for about a week.&nbsp; The only problem is that every now and again, it switches itself off.&nbsp; Usually it will switch itself back on but today, when it did
 it for the second time, it wouldn't come back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battery was fully charged, I pressed the menu button, on/off button, took the battery out etc and eventually after a few minutes it came back on when I switched the on/off button on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can stop it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
