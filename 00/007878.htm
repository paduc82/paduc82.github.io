<h2>            IE not completely loading web page</h2>
                    I've had this happen to a few people at work. Internet Explorer doesn't load all of the elements on a webpage, sometimes leaving weird residual ode where other elements should be. It's hard to explain so I have included a screenshot. I have blacked out
 some sensitive information but the stuff at the bottom should show icons.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0771970-6d7f-47da-9ef4-c9a2c5123466?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0771970-6d7f-47da-9ef4-c9a2c5123466?upload=true" /><br />
<br />
<br />
</a>A couple of things are worth noting. This happens on a few web sites, not just one. This is only a problem with IE, other browsers work fine. I've been unsuccessful in figuring out how to resolve the issue and there are a few weird things going on. First,
 the page will load fine in private browsing mode. I can't recall for certain but I'm pretty running it with the flag to turn add-ons off doesn't fix it. I know manually disabling all add-ons doesn't fix it. If I run IE as administrator, it will work. I tried
 clearing cache, even resetting IE and it did not work. I uninstalled IE, deleted all IE folders from user profiles, and reinstalled and it still has the issue. This is somewhat an issue because we have a few web based programs that are only supported in IE.

<p>Hi bobbintb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes websites don't look like you expect them to—images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. This might be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet Explorer and the site you're on. Sometimes this
 can be fixed by adding the site to your Compatibility View list. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Internet </strong><strong>Explorer</strong>, select the <strong>
Tools </strong>button, and then select <strong>Compatibility View settings.</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Add </strong><strong>this </strong><strong>website</strong>, enter the URL of the site you want to add to the list, and then select
<strong>Add</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you turn on Compatibility View, Internet Explorer will automatically show that site in Compatibility View each time you visit. You can turn it off by removing the site from your compatibility list. Not all website display problems are caused by browser
 incompatibility. Interrupted Internet connections, heavy traffic, or problems with the website can also affect how a page is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You need to be very precise. The "Address book" in Outlook is merely a special view of your Contacts folder.</p>
<p>Presumably all your Contacts are still in the Contacts folder?</p>
<p>Are you saying that when you click on the To field in a new message that the address book doesn't show?</p>
<p>How did you reconnect your Outlook data with the new installation of Outlook?</p>

<h2>            OUTLOOK STILL SENDS AND RECEIVES WHEN OFFLINE</h2>
                    <p>When Outlook 2010 is in Offline mode, I have found that it can STILL send and receive if I do a MANUAL send/receive</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I do the same in Outlook 2013 at work , I have found that I can still send a message BUT receive is still disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently migrated from OE6 and found that if I wanted to do a manual send/receive when OE6 was Offline I ALWAYS got the message "do you want to go online?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is this normal behaviour and if it isnt does anyone know what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you havent explained why Outlook 2010 also RECEIVES as well as sends when Offline whereas Outlook 2013 ONLY sends but dose not receive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, why would Outlook Send OR receive or BOTH when set to Offline?? &nbsp;This doesn't make sense to me. &nbsp;If I select Offline, I want to disconnect Outlook from the internet and if I try and send/receive I want Outlook to ask if I want to connect to
 the internet,</p>

<h3> vstevka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Option to turn step counting off</h2>
                    I am suggesting to Microsoft they include an option for turning off step counting while keeping the Band turned on. I workout on machines that add steps continuously even though I'm not stepping. I have to turn the band off while I workout, but then I'm
 not seeing important work emails and texts. I must have my phone with me, which is a drag to carry around from workout to workout.

            <p>Hi,<br />
AlexCollings</p>
<p>The xlsm file is a workbook that enabled macros running. Too many macro codes may take you a lot of time to open from windows explorer. But the reason why you open from excel is fine is that the excel application had already loaded and initialized. However,
 the cause of this problem can be in many situations.</p>
<p>Here's some suggestions you can follow:<br />
1. Upgrade your offce 2007 to the newest version(such as install the Office Sevice-pack).<br />
2. Reduce excel add-ins,[File] -&gt; [Options] -&gt; [Add-Ins] -&gt; [Manage: COM Add-ins] -&gt; [Go], then remove unwanted plug-ins.<br />
3. Run the Office repair mode.<br />
4. Run an Anti-virus software scanning on your system to see if any other alicious plug-ins or virus exist.<br />
5. Reinstall office 2007 again.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 IMAP Folders and MDaemon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dadoggybone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 IMAP Folders and MDaemon</h2>
                    <p>I have an IMAP profile connected to the MDaemon server.</p>
<p>The IMAP folder has only Lookup and Insert permssions on the server (Such as the Bayesian Learning folder where I can only place messages into the IMAP folder, but not able to see/read any messages).</p>
<p>When I place the message into the folder, I am still able to see the message in that folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, If I try to delete the message, I get the following error:</p>
<p>"The folder 'Non-Spam' cannot be selected.&nbsp; This may be because of a limitation of your IMAP server or the folder may hav been deleted or moved."</p>
<p>This error is understandable, as I only have Lookup and Insert permissions, and not delete permissions on this folder.</p>
<p>The question is, why is there a "cache" of the message that I placed into this folder, and how can I prevent this?</p>

                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I was trying to install Garmin Mobile XT to my phone N95. However, during USB data transfer, the phone would kept on beeping...and at about 3/4 remaining during data transfer, the connection would suddenly drop. And me had to reattempt installation all over
 again! Please advice what could be causing these problems? This is very annoying and frustrating...

<h2>            Setting default value to blank</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a new Access user on my second day working with the database. I have created a table and a bound form, but have come across a problem that's driving me crazy. I've searched tons of forums and have found no answers. Here's the problem: my form has several
 combo boxes, and they work fine. When I go to create a new record, however, the selections in the combo boxes that I had for the previous record stay up. I want the combo boxes to be blank every time I create a new record in order to be able to see which ones
 I've left blank. Even when I changed the default value to "No Answer", new records appear with the previous entry's info. All the text boxes are blank, but the combo boxes carry info over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my first record (sorry for the blacked out boxes, I am not allowed to show that):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb714c05-796a-480c-a8ae-560b47a9d3a3" /></p>
<p>Then I click the create new record button, and this appears:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8858c109-b065-420d-8e98-146044831608" /><br />
</p>
<p>How do I make it so that the combo boxes in the new records appear blank? Your help is much appreciated!</p>
<p />

            <p>I'm guessing that these combo boxes are Unbound - nothing in their Control Source property. If they are bound to a table field, and if neither the combo box nor the underlying table field have a Default Value property, they should come up blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using unbound combos you need a more complex setup, but I'm not clear why you would need to do so.</p>

<h2>            How to remove LNK.Jenxcus-p worm virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I woke up to my PC being infected with this virus, or at least to the virus being activated, since it seems I've been infected for a while now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last couple of days I've been seeing direct accesses being created on any USB drive I plug in on my laptop, since they seemed harmless I didn't do a thing, until yesterday when my Avast antivirus started notifying me about a lot of .lnk files being
 infected and deleting them, only for them to be created once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different methods found online, from deleting registry entries referencing googleupdate.lnk, windowsupdate.lnk, googleupdate.a3x and autoit3.exe, deleting those files from the hidden folders the virus created and running multiple analisis since yesterday
 using various tools (Avast antivirus, Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool and Microsoft Safety Scanner), they've found threats, but not the source, since all they do is remove the .lnk files created by the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm desperate right now and don't own a copy of Windows to do a full formatting, is there any other way to solve this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Not all phones are supported, so they will not be able to upgrade.</p>
<p>Basically all phones with an (older) Qualcomm Snapdragon S4(+) SOC are not supported for running windows 10 mobile builds.</p>
<p>And It's Facebook who has decided to drop the support for older OS'ses like WP8.1 and also some older IOS and Android versions. You should complain to Facebook about this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ubcdbaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlink endnotes vrs regular footnotes&#47;endnotes</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a manuscript in which, for some reason, the endnotes for the first chapter are all hyperlinks. &nbsp;In revising that chapter, I tried to add an endnote, but that endnote was treated as totally separate from the other endnotes. It was given the
 number 1 and placed after all the other endnotes! &nbsp;I'm using MS Word for Mac 2011. Is there anyway to either get all the endnotes to convert to being regular endnotes, or to make the new endnote also a hyperlink endnote so that it sit among the other endnotes
 where it belongs? &nbsp;(When clicked the hyperlinked endnotes read "sdfootnote#sym, with # the number for the endnote). Any help any of you can give me with this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sadly, some clever person has produced endnotes that are not endnotes :-) &nbsp;Those are the hyperlinked ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to insert new hyperlinks in their place.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the text of the endnote</li><li>Look for the note reference character in the text.</li><li>Immediately beside it, insert an endnote. &nbsp;It will get an automatic number, which will come right when you have done them all.</li><li>Paste the copied text into the endnote.</li><li>Delete the old endnote reference mark.</li><li>Delete the old endnote.</li><li>Rinse and repeat for each of the non-endnote endnotes.</li></ol>
<p>The key to this is to understand that a Word "endnote" is an entry in a generated table within Word. &nbsp;The actual text of the endnote is stored in the endnote reference mark, which is a little container that stores the text, the formatting, the numbering,
 and the positioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who do things such as manually insert endnotes, or save the document in one of the freeware Word look-alikes, convert the endnotes to ordinary typed text. &nbsp;When that happens, the whole endnote structure won't work. &nbsp;When you get a document like that,
 about the only thing you can do is re-insert the endnotes as real endnotes, as I described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<br />You can try to chat with a live Skype support agent from here:

<br />Payments and purchases
<br />Account, Profile and sign in
<br />Privacy and security

<br /> Then click on chat.

<p>Hahahahahahahahahah!&nbsp; (Hysterical laughing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to get a real person on the phone for literally over a year and there absolutely isn't anyone who can deal with Skype technical problems.&nbsp; As stated below, you can try contacting the Skype&nbsp;"community support" but that seems to be a few technical
 people who may or may not work for&nbsp;Microsoft trying to share what they've worked out themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Skype itself doesn't have any tech support at all.&nbsp; Some times you can get someone from Microsoft&nbsp;on a chat but that has to be done in writing back and forth.&nbsp;
 Slow and usually non-productive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The most effective thing I've found is to **** loud and long in every social media forum you can access about how awful Skype and Microsoft are.&nbsp; Last time Microsoft tried to upgrade Skype, they finally returned to classic Skype after&nbsp;several months of
 users screaming their heads off.&nbsp; I found some degree of success by publicly describing that Skype upgrade as "Windows 8 all over again!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I totally agree with everything you said. Those IT idiots who keep updating systems just for the sake of it don't realise that 95% of the people using the system are not IT nerds, and all they want to be able to do is push one button and talk to their
 friends. Is that really so hard to do in this age of technology? (guess it keeps them in work and pays the mortgage!)&nbsp;

<p>If you are connecting by USB, you can at least keep ActiveSync from<br />
popping up by disabling USB connection in Connection Settings.</p>
<p>If you really want to make sure it doesn't run at all, you can rename<br />
wcescomm.exe and wcesmgr.exe (probably in \Program Files\Microsoft<br />
ActiveSync\).</p>

<h2>            Hmmm...can&#39;t reach this page</h2>
                    When I first start Edge I often get a message "Hmmm...can't reach this can't page" with a suggestion to go to my home page.&nbsp; The issue is that my home and startup page is "about:blank".

<p>You don't say if this is Edge in an Insider build or what build you are using. You also don't say if you have tried anything to remedy the problem? What page is your browser looking for? Have you tried troubleshooting or resetting and/or another browser?</p>
<p>I have had, and still get, occasionally this response from Edge. But troubleshooting or resetting Edge has usually cleared it.&nbsp;</p>

            Ah yes, problems with Edge. Well personally if that is the sum &amp; total of your problems with Edge, I would consider that you are lucky. Especially if it is a one off! Please file it away on FBH with the myriad of other Edge problems &amp; complaints. Use the
 replicate the problem and record it for transmission to MST.

<p>I do not think there is anything wrong with your build if this is your only issue.&nbsp; As an insider I have pretty much stopped using Edge.&nbsp; Microsoft updates make a big play on improvements and I will give it ago and then stop as I also get fed up with&nbsp; the
 "Hmmm....can't reach this page" and resort to Google or another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My partner hates&nbsp;<span>"Hmmm...can't reach this can't page"</span> when she gets it on Edge on her a normal Windows 10 install but keeps trying Edge, until going to a more reliable browser after a lot of frustration.</p>
<p>

<p>I changed the start page to Microsoft.com. It still fails when first opening Edge however the message changed to "This page is having a problem loading".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must point out that this happens only the first time Edge is started after booting Windows.&nbsp; After Edge is started once after booting it runs with many other issues, but as expected.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to organize favorites? Like move a favorite that listed to a folder that you established after you had added the favorite. Example: I had saved some YouTube pages that I wanted to quickly refer to but then later to set a folder to put
 them in. I now want to move these favorites to that folder but cannot seem to find out how. Any suggestions?</p>

            This is what I do: add again the page you want into the new favorites folder<br />
and delete the old one. I know it's a little tedious but I didn't find any other way<br />
to do it. Hope it helps...<br />

<p>Sort them through using the Explore Device option.&nbsp; What alot of people don't realize is that the interface is the same as windows just explore device and goto the favorites folder and rename or add new folder.&nbsp;

<p>You can move a Favorite by selecting the Favorite and hitting Menu -&gt; Edit.&nbsp; From there you can change the Folder field to set where it should be stored.</p>

<p>Hope that helps,</p>

            How do I change the Google calendar url?&nbsp; I had one windows live calendar, then changed it to a google, and can't figure out how to change the favorties or save the new one to the google calendar favorite.&nbsp; I'm using windows mobile on a TMobile Shadow.&nbsp;
 When I try to save it to that folder, it doesn't give me that option.

<p>
</p><p>IIf([Duration]=0,"Milestone",Switch([Finish]&lt;[Status Date],"100%",[Start]&gt;[Status Date],"0%",True,(ProjDateDiff([Start],[Status Date],"Standard")/[Duration])*100 &amp; "%"))</p>

</p><p>IIf([Duration]=0,"Milestone",Switch([Finish]&lt;[Status Date],"100%",[Start]&gt;[Status Date],"0%",True,format(ProjDateDiff([Start],[Status Date],"Standard")/[Duration],"##.00" &amp; " %")))</p>

            I just realised you removed the "*100" part of the original formulae, does the "format" addition implies "*100"?
