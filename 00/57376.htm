<h2>            How to read my old emails from windows mail of Vista&#63;</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 8 from Vista. Lost all my programs, how do I get to my saved e-mails from Windows Mail I was using before the upgrade? Anyone with helpful information would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question. I will help you to find a resolution regarding the Old E-mails to Windows Mail app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you Synced the Mail app with the old account? </p>
<p>2. What happens when you add the account? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to sync the mail with&nbsp; the account and try to add the old account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for responding to my question. I have synced my email and can read new emails. What I really want to do is to&nbsp;access&nbsp;my archived emails on my hard drive from before the upgrade. I don't know where to look. Can Windows 8 Mail read those emails?</p>
<p>Another thing is I used to be able to set Windows mail to delete the messages from server after retrieval. Can Window 8 Mail do that and How do I do it. Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>NO, I AM NOT GETTING ANY ERROR MESSAGES.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I DON'T KNOW WHAT "VERSION" OF PHOTO GALLERY I HAVE.&nbsp; I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A VERSION.</p>
<p>ALL I KNOW IS THAT NOW I HAVE&nbsp; ONEDRIVE. &nbsp;IT HAS CHANGED IN WINDOWS 10 FROM WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN W INDOWS 7.&nbsp; MY PHOTO FOLDERS STARTED TO DOUBLE (SOME) IN WINDOWS 7 AND I WAS IN THE MIDST WHEN 10 CAME ALONG.&nbsp; NOW IT IS WORSE.&nbsp; NOT ONLY ARE THE FOLDERS DOUBLED,
 BUT WHAT IS IN THE FOLDERS ARE ALL MIXED UP AND THEY ARE NOT IN THE ORDER THAT I HAD THEM.&nbsp; THERE ARE ALSO SOME DOUBLE AND TRIPLE FOLDERS.&nbsp; I'M AFRAID TO DELETE AN EXTRA FOLDER FEARING THAT I WILL LOSE THOSE PHOTOS.&nbsp; THE WORSE OF IT STARTED LAST WEEKEND WHEN
 WINDOWS 10 WAS COMPLETED.&nbsp; NOW I CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE PICTURES.</p>

            Yes, Elaine,&nbsp; I have the albums also.&nbsp; They just add to the clutter and confusion.&nbsp; My pictures are in so many different places I never know where to look for them.&nbsp; I also have lost pictures, and sometimes cannot even delete a photo I don't want.&nbsp; I am
 seriously thinking of giving up with windows and Microsoft and going to a Mac if this does not resolve soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who on earth designs these programs?

 ALSO A MESS AND I DO NOT APPRECIATE PEOPLE GOING THRU MY PICS AND THINKING THEY CAN MAKE ALBUMS.&nbsp; I TOLD THEM TWICE NOW TO STOP BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHO GOES WITH WHO AND SO ON.&nbsp; DO THE LISTEN?&nbsp; **** NO.....&nbsp; I AM SO FED UP AS I'M SURE YOU ARE TOO.&nbsp;I'M

<h2>            Getting Error 8024008 when attempting to Update Windows Vista 32 Service Pack 1 to Service Pack 2</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; This Dell Inspiron laptop is running Windows Vista 32 bit Service Pack 1, and Windows Vista stopped updating about a year ago. &nbsp;I just got the Update Service to start working again, sort of... &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; However, when I tried to update to Service Pack 2, it gave me Error 80246008, and when I tried following the link to fix it, Services did not show the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) under services, so I followed the suggestions of Jose
 Antonio Ponton Posada CEO and tried the BITS repair tool, validated my Windows Vista 32, and ran the tool, but it said that BITS repair was not necessary on this computer. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I checked the status of the Windows Event Log, and it was running. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; Please advise how I can update Windows Vista Service Pack 1 running on this machine to the current Service Pack.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>For the live tiles themselves, you can right-click on the tile and turn off the "live" mode.&nbsp; For any app that is/was running and you closed it, move your pointer to the left side of the screen and see if any are running and if so, click &amp; drag the tile
 to the right and then down to the bottom of the screen and then back to the left.&nbsp; You will see the tile 'flip' and then it closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a weird setup but is the only way to "turn them off" or "stop running".</p>

            They were made to be efficient. Don't worry about apps in the background. They're not really doing anything in most cases.

            New to Surface. Can't believe I'm asking this ;-O ...how do you right click a tile without a mouse? PS: Reason for turning it off; I find all the movement a tad&nbsp;annoying.

            <p>Okay, I think all you wanted was to turn off the "live" tile and without keyboard, simply press and hold down on a tile and when you see a square shape appear, release and a mouse menu will appear and you can shut off the "live" mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any running apps, usually, like what LCRT had said, the Metro UI apps don't really eat up much in resources.&nbsp; When not displayed when you switch apps, they usually eat up about as much in resources as a RSS news feed which is nothing.&nbsp; Some apps like
 the Metro UI version of Internet Explorer can cause the tablet not to shut down by not closing when you power off.&nbsp; That is also nothing and you just force it to close.&nbsp; That doesn't happen all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Metro UI app you want to just plain exit and not run in the background, swipe from the left side of the screen and the Metro UI task manager (slide out bar) showing the running apps and you press and hold down on the app you want to exit and then drag
 it to the right and then down to the bottom of the screen and then back to the left, far left corner and you will see the app 'flip' and then it is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative to that if you have the keyboard attached is CTRL + ALT + DEL and select the Task Manager and those apps should display in the list and click on "End Process".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all may be goofy but welcome to a Microsoft version of Android!&nbsp; You have two systems instead of one - an Android like system and a super modified Windows 7 system.&nbsp; Metro UI is the "Android" like system and is why those apps will not run on the "Desktop".&nbsp;
 That changes in Windows 10 where the apps run in a "run time window".&nbsp; That way, they can run anywhere.</p>

<p>How are you shutting down the computer?</p>
<p>Have you looked in Scheduled Tasks? [Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Scheduled Tasks]</p>
<p>If there are any entries in Scheduled Tasks (other than the Add Scheduled Task Wizard), right click on each one, click on Properties, and then click on the Settings tab.&nbsp; Look at the box at the bottom of the Settings tab to see if the task is set to "Wake
 the computer to run this task."</p>
<p>Less common causes:</p>
<p>Is the computer connected to a network other than one that you created (e.g., a school or corporate network)?</p>
<p>Does the computer have a modem that is connected to a telephone line (NOT your DSL modem)?</p>

<p>thank you LemP for responding</p>
<p>I shut down by using the option on the start menu to "Turn Off Computer".&nbsp; The light on my cpu then turns off and shuts down.&nbsp; For awhile I did not have the login password protected so the cpu would then turn itself back on, login&nbsp; and connect to the internet.&nbsp;
 Now I unplug the computer after shutting down, which is a hassle.</p>
<p>There are no Scheduled Tasks.</p>
<p>I am not on any network such as work or school.</p>
<p>I am not connected to a telephone line.</p>
<p>I use a Linksys wireless moniter (version 1.08 / driver version 4.150.31.0)</p>

<p>MS for some reason has decided (without asking anyone) that you should accept that during a business meeting your pc will "just begin an update" and you may eat the loss. &nbsp;Cool huh? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or it will update and then leave your pc on all night, when you're paying for electricity. &nbsp;... Gee multiply this by millions of users and ... class ... action ... city ... fed ... eral ... regu .. lation ... smack ... down. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After talking to their mindnumbing tech support, the only way to stop it is to literally unplug. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Horrible. &nbsp;I will never buy windows again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello Microsoft, My account <b>[mod removed]</b> was banned early thismorning. My dad regually plays my account every day. He enjoys Xboxlive and had just baught more member ship and 1500 Microsoft points. My dad is currently at work and dosen't know that
 his account has been banned. My account got banned because i had 15th for 1500msp. I was currently sleeping over a friends house. He wanted Microsoft points and decided to put that in there without telling me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very sorry about this, I have made a lot of good friends on my Xbox Live account, I have worked really hard to achieve my goals on Mw2 and was getting there on Black Ops. So i really hope that i can get back into the game. Thanks.</p>

<p>yeah what your friend put in there is the main cause you got banned and there is no appeal for it, you will have NO choice but to create a new account, and FYI NOTHING can be transferred to the other account. &nbsp;but since it is a perm ban it would not matter
 as any and ALL content and MS points, live etc are forfeit when a perm ban is issued, so you have no choice but to start all over again, and in the future put a password on your account so nobody BUT you can use it.</p>

<p>Dude i only play <b>[mod removed]</b>&nbsp;when my dad is at work. He is going to be home tonight and freak out. We have just baught new stuff for his account and when he finds out it is banned, he wont be happy. I know i stuffed up but i have never got a warning
 i know what and what not to do now. It's my first year of Xbox Live and i have done so much on that account. I got a 35k difference in KD on Mw2. That took me for ever and i was playing Black Ops and was working hard on that aswell. I know i stuffed up but
 i love that account. :( I really want to play it again. Even if it gets banned for a week just no Perm.</p>

<p>your 'warning' is the TOS (terms of service), and since your friend put "15th for 1500msp." it is 100% a PERM ban, and as the TOS says, YOU are responsible for YOUR account. &nbsp;so if somebody puts a message that is BAN worthy or MODS a game score it will YOU
 who has to suffer the consequences of any actions taken against that account. &nbsp;so it is time to create a new account and start over, that is your ONLY option sorry to be the one to break that to you, but that is all we can tell you about it.</p>

<p>You should pay more attention next time and not let anyone else access your account like that. Even if you did it, its not a very good idea.</p>

<p><i><span>It IS your fault. Just because you were at a friends house and not around when it happened doesn't make it not your fault. There are tools on the console and account that you could have used to protect
 your account from unauthorized access. For future reference you should store your profile on a USB Flash Drive when you travel to friends houses, that way if you leave for a bit you can unplug it and take it with you for safe keeping.

<p>Do u know how hard it is for me. What if you were in this postition and i said that to you. Microsoft can unpermban my account if they felt like giving me another chance. i was 12 when i had xbox. I could hardly read any of the Terms And Agreements. So please
 just don't take it down on me. It was a mistake i didn't even do it. So please just considerate about unbanning my account. You wouldn't like to be like i am now! Yous are all lucky you have friends that work for Microsoft/ or work for Microsoft</p>

<p>sorry, the case is closed, if it is perm banned you HAVE to get a new account and move on, there IS NO second chance when it comes to accounts that are perm banned for solicitation (the 15th for 1500msp). &nbsp;you can post till your blue in the face or your
 fingers fall off from typing, but the matter is, the case is closed and your done FOREVER on that account. &nbsp;get a new account, and move on, and next time do as we suggest, make your account more secure so this does NOT happen again.</p>

    <title>Trouble w&#47; Bluetooth Headset after Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel_sv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble w&#47; Bluetooth Headset after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and I have been using a pair of Sennheiser PCX 550 Bluetooth headphones, and also another &nbsp;on-ear headset. Before the creators update, both devices worked perfectly. Following the update, I have had nothing but problems with
 these devices -- primarily using them during calls with Skype for Business (****). The behavior is that I will be on a call, the audio will cut out, and then Skype for Business will stop responding. Once this happens I have to force quit, **** and the i see
 high CPU utilization from a system task . If I try to launch **** again, it just hangs up, and I need to reboot the PC to get my headset working again and get everything to be stable again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem didn't occur at all prior to the Creators Update. Using a wired headset doesn't cause the same issue. I've run through the Bluetooth and audio troubleshooting tools, un-paired and re-paired the devices. Nothing seems to work.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation after changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#615;&#603;&#8467;&#8467;&#603;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation after changes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had downloaded Windows 10 via Microsoft (upgraded from 8.1), everything was fine until my computer's power went. I contacted an IT guy who came and rebuilt my pc (not sure if he put in a new motherboard - he's slow at replying to my emails and text
 messages!!). However, the activation was fine and all went smoothly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not used the pc for a few months until today as I thought to myself that I had better do the updates. When it was doing the Windows updates, I went to try to change personalisation but it said I couldn't do it until Windows was activated. I thought
 that was strange, so I checked activation and there it was: 'We can't activate Windows 10 on this device because we can't connect to your organisation's activation server. Make sure that you're connected to your organisation's network and try again. If you
 continue having problems with activation, contact your organisations support person. Error code: 0xC004F074'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm not with any organisation as this is a home pc and I do not use it for business either. I tried the activation troubleshooter which came up as: We can't activate your copy of Windows. Make sure you're connected to the internet and try again. If you're
 connected to the internet and continue seeing this problem, contact your system administrator for more information.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss what to do. I don't even know the product key when I downloaded the software from Microsoft because when you look at it in the Settings, it comes out in a lot of 'X's with the last 4 showing in letters and numbers. I've no idea how to find
 the product key either and I am certainly not buying another one when i already acquired one. Microsoft really should have given me the product key when I first downloaded it from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help (IT guy is still not responding and I've texted him twice today).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much thanks.</p>

            <p>I'm not an expert on the detail but this sentence in your post </p>
<blockquote>'We can't activate Windows 10 on this device because we can't connect to your
<strong>organisation's activation </strong>server. Make sure that you're connected to your organisation's network and try again. If you continue having problems with activation, contact your organisations support person. Error code: 0xC004F074'<br />
</blockquote>
<p>says that the edition you have loaded is an Enterprise Volume edition rather than the version you got when you upgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if your motherboard was not replaced, your issue should be resolved simply by re-installing the correct version - probably Home?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your motherboard has been replaced, then depending on the licence of your 8.1 (retail or OEM), you may or may not had the right to re-activate but again, only the version which you got when you did the upgrade.&nbsp; Again, it needs a re-installation.</p>

            Hello Sloane100,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
The student discount offer through DigitalRiver is for hte "upgrade", there is not a option to purchase the "full" version through the student discount.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

    <title>How do I change File History settings to use the computer name when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> be_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change File History settings to use the computer name when backing up my files &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new pc with Win 10 Home 64 bit installed on it.&nbsp; As part of the initial new pc setup process, I took an image copy and setup file history and ran it backing up files. However I noticed that the path to the external HD I'm using contains
 the generated Windows computer name - <span>DESKTOP-U0IG0SK. I subsequently changed my pc name, recycled my pc and ran another file history backup.&nbsp; I then reviewed the hard drive and it shows the generated name in the path (all backups were there).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Interestingly enough, when I open File History and choose 'select a drive' and then select the hard drive, the popup window for 'select an existing backup'&nbsp; shows my changed pc name not the generated name....&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp;opened the configuration folder in the File History path on the hard drive and then opened the xml files I found, CONFIG1 and CONFIG2.&nbsp; Both contained the generated name not the changed name...
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, I'm guessing that somewhere there is a settings config file for File History that contains my generated name..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does anyone know how&nbsp;and what to change in order for File History to use a file path with my changed pc&nbsp;name ?</span></p>
<p><span>thanks</span></p>

            It'll keep using that folder to avoid problems. &nbsp;The only way to change the folder name, if you really really care about it, is to turn off file history, delete the folder entirely, and setup file history again.

    <title>Windows 10 - Disable click to tap and gestures &#40;ELAN&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lancetti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Disable click to tap and gestures &#40;ELAN&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just wanted to share this information that I found after a lot of searching for answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased a new laptop with Windows 10 Home edition. I was able to figure out that I had an ELAN touchpad, but no controls to modify the settings beyond sensitivity in anyway. So if I wanted to turn off scrolling, or make the touchpad sensitive to
 my palm, or stop the click to tap feature, I was unable to. A lot of the search answers involved either drivers or registry editing, which I didn't want to do a registry edit. My laptop kept erroring on installing the Synaptics controls from the Microsoft
 Store, and the Dell touchpad controls didn't work and kept forwarding me to the "mouse properties" window. I did finally find a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR: Windows 10 Home with an ELAN touchpad does not come installed with the ELAN software. You'll need to install it yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System Restore point</span>.</li><li>Make sure you have allowed applications to be installed NOT from Microsoft Store.</li><li>Search up "Mouse Settings". On the right, click "Additional Mouse Options." It'll open a WinXP looking window titled: Mouse Properties. You're looking for the red ELAN logo on the tabs (should be on the right). [In this process I did find that there's two
 different Mouse Properties windows, one will show the ELAN icon and one will not.]</li><li>Click the ELAN tab. At the "enable" area of the window, it should be "enable"d. Double-click the word "ELAN smart-pad Enable" or whatever is listed, and Windows 10 should prompt to ask you to install a software. Click confirm.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e90903c6-78af-4f16-bc62-df5ba5875df6?upload=true" /><br />
If you want to make sure your touchpad is working, select for it to "Display Dynamic/Static Icon" and the icon will appear in the task area in the start bar.</li><li>Once the software is installed, it should automatically open the ELAN touchpad software.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8b7625b-5fde-44bc-b65c-d11821a12b96?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8b7625b-5fde-44bc-b65c-d11821a12b96?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
This software is FREE.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop I bought should've been updated with this software but for some reason it wasn't.</p>
<p>It seems that upon using this software I've been able to turn off the "gestures" that came with Windows 10.</p>
<p>The only follow-up you might need to do once you've installed and set-up the ELAN software is restart. I didn't need to, but I need to update the ELAN mouse drivers to a version from July 2018 (auto-found through the internet search).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this solution helps people who are having issues with their touchpads!</p>

<h2>            Transferring content from a banned account to an active account.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I have a situation where my Xbox Live account got banned until the year 9999. &nbsp;I have spent well over $200 on downloadable games and DLC and all of it was gone when my account got banned, well not really since it was saved to my hard drive and I could
 play them on a new account. &nbsp;However, my hard drive recently went corrupt and I lost EVERYTHING! &nbsp;I was wondering/hoping that there is SOME way to get my lost content from my banned account to my new account that I am actively using. &nbsp;I really do not want
 to put all of that money back into something I already purchased for a stupid reason that I got banned for which I take the blame on. &nbsp;If ANYONE can help me out on this, (download codes, content transfer between accounts, licence transfer, or anything that
 would do the trick) it would make my day and then some. &nbsp;If not, well it's what I am expecting. &nbsp;Thank you for taking the time to hear my plea and I look forward to seeing what can possibly/not be done about my dilemma. &nbsp;If Gamertags are necessary I am more
 than happy to provide them.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 down but that hasn't helped :( Any other suggestions appreciated, was looking forward to playing this.

<p>Motion sickness can happen to anyone on various video games. &nbsp;I don't think there is a guaranteed cure that works for everybody, I suggest reading some articles about it though to understand why it happens. &nbsp;Here's an example:

<p>Thanks for that, it's quite an interesting little read, unfortunately I have a quick read around now and it seems as though the field of view have quite a big effect and Dishonored does seem to have quite a small FOV with no sign of an adjustment on consoles
 so i think it may be heading to trade in city :(</p>
<p>Such a shame because it seemed as though it was going to be my type of game from the brief amount I saw.</p>

<p>I was ok with Dishonored but I remember the last Earth Defence Force game, I was really bad with that to the point where I asked a doctors advice. Apart from the usual lecture, take regular breaks, sit further away from TV ( sitting further away didn't cure
 it but it did help alot ) he advised me to get my eyes checked, I did and didn't need glasses etc but the optician basically said over the last 10 years he's seen more and more people complain about it with games, going to see 3D movies, he said something
 like 20% of people will suffer from some sort of headache, vertigo or a combination after watching a 3D film.</p>

Like I said mate and be worth a go, try sitting further away from the TV, didn't totally cure it but it was a big help, also I'm no doctor but be worth getting the old eyeballs checked just to make sure you don't need glasses, unless of course you have them
 already ;)</p>

That gamer pic is not too far from the truth. I've not had a drink in quite a while but last night my brother inlaw fetched a bottle of brandy he got on holiday, not good, not good at all ;)<br />
<br />
Getting back to this motion sickness, it is getting more and more common mate, especially with all these fancy graphics, open worlds! I've just recently been playing Uncharted 3 and the mrs can't even sit and watch it, makes her quite light headed, mind you
 that could be all an excuse, going to go check our drinks cabinet lol.<br />
<br />
As I'm a nice guy, if you have any problems with other games, send them to me, I'll make sure they get a good home ;)<br />

    <title>Touchpad turns off after laptop sleeps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnlark5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad turns off after laptop sleeps</h2>
                    Whenever I put my Acer Spin 7 to sleep and then wake it up again, my touchpad is turned off and I have to go into the touchpad settings and turn it on again. I tried uninstalling the Synaptics drivers and reinstalling, but no dice. The problem definitely
 has something to do with the Synaptics drivers, though, because I did not have this problem with the generic HID compliant mouse driver (but the generic drivers lack the advanced functionality like scrolling with two fingers).

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I suggest checking the following thread of the community where it explains how they managed to uninstall the Synaptics drivers.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/cant-uninstall-synaptics-driver-after-april-2018/bab43f86-99d9-42ad-a865-6fbc99f4001a">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I could download the generic driver.
<br />

<br />Let me know to continue supporting you in this incident.

<p>Hello Dayamis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not had any trouble uninstalling the Synaptics drivers, but reinstalling them didn't fix the problem. The page you linked does not seem to have any downloads for generic drivers, only a notice saying to use the drivers for your specific model. I don't
 see any links where I can download drivers from there.</p>

            Thank you for commenting and I understand your incident much better, I want to tell you that there is an incompatibility of the driver corresponding to the touch pad with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I would like you to continue the following order of actions, please perform a driver update, using the instructions found in the following technical article: Update drivers in Windows 10.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402844...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if you continue with the same incident, it means that the driver needs to be manually configured, with the assistance of our Acer technical support colleagues.

<div>I have used external keyboards, external mouse's, different mouse drives and manufactures, disabled and used different mouse/kbd Sw drivers to no avail. I have gone in and stopped all but critical services and it continues. I have gone all the way down
 to reformatting the drive and reloading all the SW to no avail.&nbsp;</div>

Sounds like a hardware issue (probably keyboard of track pad.) which is re-enforced because it continues to happen after a re-install.<br />

<p>Hi Joseph</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to Disk Management I had to type "Manage" into the search which then gave me the option to "Computer Management".</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point I could view the new Hard Disk Drive under "Disk Management" and was able to initialize.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is now good and I have a copy of my computer file on a separate HDD.</p>

<h2>            Account merging</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to merge my old Xbox 360 account with my new Xboxone account.&nbsp; the problem is that the email that was on the old account is no longer an email and was my dads.&nbsp; I have days of time played on games that now since some are backwards
 compatible i would not like to lose. </p>
