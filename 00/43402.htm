            <p>hey Paul, thank you for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have downloaded the NPR One app it is a pretty basic app that simply plays the local NPR radio station on my desktop, I am trying to set up a Task where every day at say, 7:00 am the app starts and plays the NPR radio station</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. during the task creation in Task Scheduler I browse to folder&nbsp;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps where I find 2 separate folders pertaining to the NPR One application, each of these 2 folders contain somewhere between 5 and 10 items/folders containing various
 parts of the application.&nbsp; I have tried creating the task in scheduler pointing the task towards different items in these 2 folders including the .exe and .dll items but nothing ever happens once the task has been created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The application runs just fine when I select it from the start menu or from a desktop shortcut (I also tried creating a task in scheduler that was pointed at the desktop shortcut link, same result) but it does not start at appointed time when I create
 the task.&nbsp; I created some other tasks to do simple things like open a word document, etc. just to test that scheduler was working properly and all of the test tasks worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. when I create the task to open the application and then go back into scheduler it shows the task in the task library and after the task was scheduled to start the task scheduler shows the task as 'Running' but there is no application open and playing
 the radio on my desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>please let me know if any other information would be helpful and thank you again for your assistance Paul</p>

    <title>Why Has My Windows 10 Mail App Stopped Syncing on Only One of My Two - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Has My Windows 10 Mail App Stopped Syncing on Only One of My Two Computers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On 9/26/15, my Windows 10 Mail app stopped syncing on one of my two computers. I waited and pressed sync and waited and pressed sync again, but it wouldn't start working again. So yesterday, I tried to remove all of the 5 accounts I added and re enter them.
 My first problem is that I couldn't do anything with my Outlook account, so please tell me the secret to uninstalling that one. Then I removed all of the others with no problem, but the app kept putting up error messages saying that it couldn't do that now.
 So I need someone to tell me how to remove me Outlook.com account and then, how to re add all of my 5 accounts so that I can get the app working again on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please hurry with this response.</p>

<p>I checked ans Firewalls are not the problem. &nbsp;I suspected that they weren't at the outset because it just happened out of the blue on 9/26/15 on only one computer as I said, and both my computers use the identical anti-spyware and and anti-viral software.
 &nbsp;But i checked to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think it could have anything to do with the state of the Vault Service/Credentials Manager? &nbsp;How could i look at that?</p>

</p><p>I am also having the same problem. My mail app stopped syncing 2 weeks ago. Also there is no problem on the firewall setting. I have been using Windows Firewall and the Mail and Calendar apps are included in it. I use Avira as antivirus software.</p>

<h2>            Skyrim keeps freezing... Surprised&#63;  Me neither.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, I just recently bought all the Skyrim DLC, and have started having major freezing issues since then.</p>
<p>Here are the steps I have taken so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleted and re-installed the game to my HDD. </li><li>Deleted and re-installed the "Title Updates". </li><li>Cleaned the system cache. (Y button on storage in the dashboard) </li><li>Deleted all autosaves </li><li>Turned off autosaving* </li><li>Checked my number of keys. (heard this could be an issue) </li></ol>
<div>*Back to the autosaving; I have turned it off on all 4 parts (Wait, travel, menu, &amp; rest), but IT STILL KEEPS AUTOSAVING. &nbsp;</div>

<div>So... now what?</div>

                </div>

<p>My question is did this start right after you downloaded all the dlc or after you played through some? Mainly the hearthstone dlc. Did you build a house and furnish it? That dlc is so poorly made and wasn't bug tested very well.

<p>Did the issues start shortly after that? Sadly on my game it got so bad I had to load up a save from about 15 hours progress back. Before I built the houses. It fixed all my problems. Which sucks cause the houses were really nice especially the amount of
 storage space.</p>

 playtime before freezing. &nbsp;No autosaves, no excess keys, no clustered cache... &nbsp;This is a @#$(*%&amp; joke.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Bethesda has made a statement (some time ago) regarding TESV crashing. It's an expected error. If you really think about it, there is so much to do, the game is so expansive, it's inevitable. If you'd like, I can give you a link to the source.</p>

<p>In addition, the more you have stored in barrels and chests in your homes, and the higher the level you are, the more frequently you may experience these game freezes. Never keep a duplicate of a key &nbsp;or other item in your homes, don't do the Solstiem Dlc
 before you finish the main storyline, and reduce or limit the number of autosave features you have. Choose one autosave (such as save on fast travel ONLY). Also, remember to save your game at regular interval, and for me, if I clear system cache before each
 play session, I am mostly able to avoid this particular problem.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</li><li>Try sending email from another app or device: If you have another email app or another computer or mobile device, try sending and receiving email from that app or device. If you can't, there might be an issue with your email server. Contact your email provider
 for support.<br />
</li><li>Check with your email provider about the status of your email server: If your email provider doesn't have a website and you can't set up your email on another app or device, contact your email provider to see if your email server is accessible.</li></ol>

            Did you go to&nbsp; Programs &amp; Features in control panel and then visit&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn windows features on or off ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In there you will see .Net 3.5 which includes&nbsp; .net 2.0&nbsp;&nbsp; You can enable it there, it will need to do some windows update downloads.

            I tried your troubleshooting, with no result. Same error code which is findable in your website.
<div>I found the problem btw. NET 4.X doesnt support ZUNE. So if Win8 succesfull updated itself from NET3.5 ,then ZUNE can not installed to system, however before NET update it is working properly.</div>
<div>Very strange, that ZUNE and WinPhone is unusable IF System up to date.</div>

            <p>Almost every PC I have seen show at least some errors in the log at some stage and if the system itself in showing no symptoms of having problems can generally be ignored. An error can be generated then the software reinitialised and successfully complete
 the task but the error is already in the log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the majority of users the event log should only be used in conjunction with investigating actual issues and otherwise not referred to.</p>

<h2>            Skyrim Theives Guild - Stuck</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Okay, so, I've done all of the Main Theives Guild missions, Nightingale and all.&nbsp; It's down to just doing the larceny&nbsp;quests from Delvin (I've also been doing Vex's) and getting the "Special Clientelle" related missions after, about, every 5 larceny quests...that
 is, until now.&nbsp; There was a point where Delvin was offering me special missions, aside from his typical larceny quests&nbsp;e.g. fishing, numbers, beldam etc.&nbsp;There was even a time where he offered me a clientelle job after I did only one larceny quest.&nbsp; Now, I
 am at the point where I am doing them going on&nbsp;15-20 times now, selecting a different one every time and I cannot get the Guild Master quest to initiate, or another special clientelle quest to initiate.&nbsp; I honestly have no idea what's suppose to come next,
 I only know that eventually, after about five larceny quets are done, he issues you a special job but everything is greyed out on his list and they are all repeating.&nbsp; I tried waiting for days, if not weeks and his list does not update, everything is still
 the same jobs, even stealing the same items from the same people.&nbsp; Vex is the only one that has new dialogue entries but some of those are the same as&nbsp;usual stuff as well&nbsp;(at least, I believe).&nbsp; How many of these bogus quests do you have to do before the Guildmaster
 quest initiates? Or my next major clientelle job?</p>

<p>You have to do five side quests in each city to unlock the final part of the Thieves Guild quest line.</p>
<p>After you complete five quests in a city, Devlin will offer you a "special" job that applies to that city. Keep doing them till you receive and finish all five special jobs and then you'll get the last part of the story.</p>

<p>So Riften isn't one of the cities? So far I had the special job in Markarth and Solitude. I have just started getting Riften jobs, but I won't do them if that city doesn't count. I have more gold and jewels than I can shake a stick at.</p>

<p>Sorry for hijacking the thread but i think I've encountered a glitch in the Thieves Guild. I just completed that quest for the thieves guild where I had to steal some stuff and then set 3 bee hives on fire. I returned to Brynjolf and he told me I was to
 speak to Maven Black-Briar (or whatever she is called). After spending about 30 mins trying to find her she has nothing to say to me. I also didn't get a new quest to speak to her, so assumed that the new quest would appear when I spoke to her - but as stated
 earlier she has nothing to say to me, and whenever I speak to Brynjolf he tells me he is to busy to speak.</p>
<p>After some searching on the internet it turns out the quest that should have activated once he told me to meet Maven is called "Dampened Spirits".

<p>That's what I did. I would just quit the job until I got one in a city I needed. I finished the storyline last night and it was only four cities that I had to do a main quest in.</p>

<p>how else can i check which tool is sending the bad password.</p>

<p>I'm assuming the lockout is due to failed logins...&nbsp; You should be able to use standard Windows Auditing tools to trace this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will need to turn on "Audit Logon Events" in order for the system log to record these events to be displayed in Window's
 Security Log.&nbsp; Then you can use the Event Viewer to review the logs.&nbsp; To&nbsp; enable "Audit Logon Events", follow the procedure in the following KB article except instead of clicking "Audit Object Access", click on "Audit Logon Events" instead.</p>

 me back to the same page! I pressed on refresh, but what will that do? Will it delete my photos, i dont think i backed up my recent photos and documents yet. Wll they keep ALL my photos and stuff? Or will they delete it? Will this even fix my computer?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. From the description, I understand that you are unable to boot from Windows 8 disc and get black screen, please be assured that we will do our best to assist you with this issue.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Answer the following questions which would help us to provide a better solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. From which operating system are you trying to upgrade to Windows 8? </span>
</p>
<p><span>2. What is the make and model of the computer that you use?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This can occur for few reasons. </span></p>
<p><span>a. If the computer has multiple monitors then it is suggested that you need to disconnect one of them and try the installation again. Also, this could be caused by video a driver which needs to be installed.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If the steps mentioned do not help then remove all unnecessary hardware including any additional monitors and check for the latest video drivers that are currently installed.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Disconnect all the external devices (except mouse and Keyboard ) and then install Windows 8 and check.</span></p>

            <b>Hey&nbsp;Mayank,</b>
<div><br />
<div>I have a few steps to have you try, run through them in order if you would:</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your system was running Windows 8 for a while, then after a restart your screen was sitting at a blank screen, visit the Knowledge Base article below, this is a confirmed resolution for a number of users in the above situation:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2756559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8 restarts to a blank screen after a standard shutdown or hibernation</a></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Your next step should be to try and connect your computer to an external display (To your TV or an additional Monitor.) If your system displays properly on that external display,
<b>you should look for an updated video card driver and a BIOS update for your system</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still out of luck? Try booting to low resolution mode (<i>You will be using the keys to a blank screen</i>):</div>
<div>
<div>¬∑ Restart (to get a known UI state)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Press the <b>Space bar</b> <i>(to get through the normal lock screen)&nbsp;</i></li><li>Press the <b>ESC </b>key twice <i>(to step out of the last user login)&nbsp;</i></li><li>Press <b>Shift + Tab</b> <i>(to select the power button)&nbsp;</i></li><li>Now press <b>Enter </b><i>(To open the restart options)&nbsp;</i></li><li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Up arrow</b>&nbsp;</li><li>Then press&nbsp;<b>Shift + Enter&nbsp;</b></li><li>Wait a bit <i>(roughly 30 seconds )</i></li><li>Hit <b>Shift - Tab three times</b>.&nbsp;</li><li>Press <b>Enter</b>.&nbsp;</li><li>Hit <b>Tab</b> three times. Then hit <b>Enter</b> again.&nbsp;</li><li>Hit <b>Shift-Tab</b> three times, then <b>enter</b> twice&nbsp;</li><li>Wait a bit, the machine should be rebooting <i>(This usually takes 15 seconds.)</i></li><li>Finally, press <b>3</b>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>If you are still having issues post back more info on your system, specifically if it was a Pre-Built system, the&nbsp;manufacturer, make, and model.

<p>Hi Mewdex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible the game was claimed using another account, but if you have that same account on your Home console then it should be shared and you should be able to play it with the active Gold subscription. Do you have multiple accounts on your Xbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting, go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">

<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that helps!</p>

<p>Hello Mewdex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was downloaded on a different account, you can set the home console on your brothers account. This will allow you to play it. If the account that you downloaded it on originally is not on the Xbox you will need to add it back.</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry to hear you are having issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What subscription is the game prompting you to renew? Metal Gear Solid 5 was once included in Xbox's Gamepass subscription. Is it possible this was how you originally gained access to the game?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, the game is no longer available even if you have the Xbox Gamepass subscription. You would need to purchase the digital copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hello Pascal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check for missing or disabled Windows services, by doing the following, and post detailed results when done !!<br />
From Start button,&nbsp;&nbsp; (or <strong>Win-key +R</strong>) and in the search-text-box type in
<strong>MSCONFIG</strong> and press OK or Enter.</p>
<p>On Vista or Windows 7, press Windows-key on keybooard, and type in <strong>MSCONFIG</strong></p>
<p><br />
You should see the <strong>General tab</strong>. <strong>Click </strong>the General tab.&nbsp; It should have Normal startup selected (in the radio-box=selection)</p>
<p><br />
IF it does not, then you click on Normal startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Services</strong> tab.&nbsp; To get it's display of services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep a written list of any changes from my list of services below. That way you and I have a reference document.<br />
Look at the bottom line Hide all Microsoft services<br />
<strong><em>IF and only IF its is checkmarked, then un-check it.</em></strong></p>
<p><br />
the list of servies may be shown in non-alphabetical order, so ....<br />
Look at the heading titled "Service". Click on it as needed so the list is sorted and top of list starts with the "A" services.<br />
You can toggle as needed to get the desired order.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>IF any of below services are NOT shown, don't panic &amp; do not stop, just write down the info for me and proceed with the others !</p>
<p>Then using the scroll-bar scroll down the list</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Base Filtering Engine</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>COM+ Event System</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>COM+ System Application</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Cryptographic Services</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Ipsec Policy Agent</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown?&nbsp; Is it checked?&nbsp; If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>RPC Endpoint Mapper</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for<strong> Windows Firewall</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Windows Installer</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>Look for <strong>Windows Update</strong>.&nbsp; Is it shown ?&nbsp; Is it checked? If not, click on that checkbox to checkmark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When done, press the Apply button, and the OK button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're likely to be prompted to Restart Windows, do so.</p>
<p><br />
If not prompted, you do a Logoff and Restart of Windows.</p>
<p>Then report back here with details.<br />
If any of the services are not shown, just let me know which.</p>

            <p>They were all as you said. <br />
<br />
I think there is a problem with the windows updates. I ran System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 (KB947821) but its installation didn't complete.
<br />
<br />
How could I fix the windows updates? There might be some updates blocking others.<br />
<br />
What is your recommendation?<br />

History is empty likely due to your having run some Fix-it .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explain what you meant (above) in your first post.</p>
<p>Which "update" are you trying to find ?&nbsp; and why do you want to remove?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Windows Update &gt;&gt;<strong> Installed updates</strong></p>
<p>select the<strong> Details</strong> option</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then scroll down to the section titled "Microsoft Windows"</p>

<p>Your screen should look <a href="http://i1283.photobucket.com/albums/a557/MnWIN8/Installed-updates_zps09cea92a.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Can&#39;t access images, &#34;permissions&#34; issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryana_iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t access images, &#34;permissions&#34; issue</h2>
                    When I try to open any image on my computer (jpeg) I get an error message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My only option is to hit "OK". This doesn't make any sense as I am the administrator and only user of my laptop. &nbsp;I was also having trouble opening PDFs, but that error message said that the App didn't open in time. &nbsp;I solved this by getting adobe acrobat.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got an HP update installed today, I'm wondering if maybe this is conflicting with my Windows 8 apps somehow? &nbsp;Everything else seems to be working fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help, from what google told me, it seems that this issue comes in many forms and a lot of people have it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the issue with permissions, I would suggest you to follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<b>Search</b>.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<b>Search</b>.)</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Enter ‚Äú<b>CMD</b>‚Äù without quotes in the search box, tap or click
<b>Apps</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Touch and hold the <b>
Command prompt</b> tile in the search results. Then drag your finger down until the tile is outlined by a solid line. Once it happens release your finger from the screen.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Tap or Click <b>
Run as administrator</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type ‚Äú<b>takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y</b>‚Äù without quotes and then press
<b>ENTER</b>. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then, type ‚Äú<b>icacls &lt;foldername&gt; /grant administrators:F /T</b>‚Äù without quotes and hit enter. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the above mentioned commands, we took the ownership of the folder and then assigned the Administrators group
<b>Full Control</b> Permissions for the folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question regarding Windows with complete information and we will be happy to help
 you.</p>

            <div>Rohit,</div>
I tried the sequence you suggested and this is what my cmd prompt says:
<div><br />
<div>takeown /f &lt;Libraries\Pictures&gt; /r /d y</div>
<div>The system cannot find the path specified.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm too familiar with command prompt so this is probably user error. &nbsp;Is this going to be a fix for all the pictures on my computer or just the ones in the folders I specify?</div>
<div><br />
<div>thanks again,</div>

<h2>            Using a Lacie Rugged Mini 1GB as a network share to backup multiple PCs</h2>
                    <p>I have a 1TB Lacie Rugged Mini backup device using USB 3.0.</p>
<p>I need to backup different PCs and laptops with Windows 7 to 10. The testing PCs have Windows 10 Home edition. When I try to use the backup which comes with Windows 10 Home, I make sure I use a network share. I read you need to make changes to the credentials
 which I did already. However, on the same laptop which the Lacie is plugged in, I tried to set up a backup with the network share I created but get this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network Error &nbsp; Windows cannot access \\Desktop-PC\lacie_win</p>
<p>You do not have permission to access \\Desktop-PC\lacie_win. Contact your network administrator to request access.</p>
<p>For more information about permissions, see Windows Help and Support</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help, please let me know what I can do to get around this error.</p>
<p>Could Windows 10 Home Edition be the problem? &nbsp;Is Windows 10 Pro the solution?</p>
<p>Rich</p>

<h2>            Action Center does not detect Avast Anti-virus after system restore</h2>
                    
<p>I had to do a system restore to a point a few days ago due to some bad drivers.&nbsp; After getting things restored, I found that the Action Center no longer recognized Avast (free edition) as my anti-virus software.&nbsp; It is fully updated and running and working
 fine.&nbsp; I have tried several suggestions found online, including the suggestions on the avast website of verifying the consistency of the WMI Repository (https://support.avast.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=580&amp;nav=0,1,20). I have
 also verified that there's not an underlying virus and have attempted to "repair" the Avast installation from the Programs and Features menu, along with a few reboots.&nbsp; NOTHING has worked. This PC is only about two weeks old, and everything worked fine up
 until the bad drivers and system restore.</p>
<p>I have come here as a last resort...&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Don't know if this will work for you but last night I ran a boot-time scan with Avast and this morning Window's Action Center&nbsp; said Avast wasn't running&nbsp; but according to Avast it was running.&nbsp; So I disabled the Avast's shields then turned them back on and
 Action Center no longer showed Avast as not running</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Vista is in extended Support until April, 2017.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it isn't free to upgrade to 7&nbsp;or 8.1.</p>
<p>You have to buy them and Microsoft no longer sells them.</p>
<p>Try Amazon.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a special offer years ago for Vista &gt; 7, but that has long since expired.</p>

</p><p>You can call Microsoft's Sales office and try and buy a copy of older versions of Windows. They tend to really push for the newest versions that Microsoft is selling though. But if you have an older system, have older programs or your older work computer,
 etc goes down they understand some of their clients want to use the older Operating Systems and some people purchased extended support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't comment on all of the pricing, but it seems really reasonable from when I called them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Canada it is 1-800-426-9400 6AM-6PM PST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if that phone number is worldwide. You might have to search on Microsofts web-pages and maybe someone could post a few up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you speak to these call-center representatives you might find it a bit creepy they know so much about you and your name without you telling them anything. I thought I was talking to Artificial Intelligence a few times or Robots. I would not be surprised
 if Microsoft is using Artificial Intelligence or Robots or is one of those.</p>
