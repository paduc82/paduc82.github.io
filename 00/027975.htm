            So you have two aliases on your outlook.com account or do you have two different accounts set up in Outlook? 
<br />
<br />Two accounts: change the default account in File, Account Settings - open the account settings dialog, select the account and set it as default. 
<br />
<br />Two aliases on an outlook.com account: you need to go into your Microsoft account and set it as the primary. (same place you went to create it <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/profile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/profile/</a> - Manage how you sign in.)

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your account's primary alias is displayed on your Microsoft devices (such as a Windows PC, Xbox, or Windows Phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outlook.com From address is set here:</p>
<p>

<p>this is all fine and working dandy in outlook.com.</p>
<p>It is outlook 2016 which has an issue as emails by default are sent as&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;; on behalf of; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account is called&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** inside outlook 2016 even though i set it up as&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can manually select the&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the from addrees and it works fine bu the default is&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and this does not work</p>

            When a non-Microsoft address is set as primary (also known as EASI) , its assigned an internal address -f877655576578@ in your example - but this address is not routable. You need to set it up as a connected account to send using it. 
<br />
<br />You need to have an outlook.com alias set as primary in order to use it in Outlook desktop. You wont be able to send mail from the EASI or connected accounts though - they will be sent from outlook.com on behalf of the other account.

<h3> tce  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone excel version keeps overwriting my local cloud version of file.  Even though I don&#39;t edit the iPhone version and only look at it.</h2>
                    <p>I use Excel on my windows 10 laptop using WD MyCloud as a network drive to save a file.&nbsp; MyCloud has an app that lets me access the files from the hard drive.&nbsp; I opened Excel mobile version on my iPhone and then browse to the file via&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Locations</span></strong><span>
 list, tap </span><strong>More</strong><span> to see MyCloud listed.&nbsp; First time I see the file it has a cloud on it with a down arrow.&nbsp; I assume I need to click it to see the file and once I do that the file no longer has the download cloud on it.&nbsp; I view
 the file just fine and then leave the update (the app always says "updating" as I leave the file).&nbsp; I then go back to my laptop and open the file to edit and save items.&nbsp; I go back into the iPhone Excel program and open the same file and I don't see the updates,
 just the last version of it.&nbsp; I then exit the program and see the "updating" again.&nbsp; I go into my laptop and what ever was on the iPhone has replaced my updates.&nbsp; I am unable to do an update on my laptop that doesn't get over written with the iPhone version
 once I load up the file on the iPhone.&nbsp; I have to do the update on the iPhone in order for the laptop version to get saved edits.&nbsp; Talked with Microsoft and they just told me it is the WD MyCloud causing the problem, but I believe the iPhone Excel is opening
 a local version of the file once downloaded and then it automatically updates it to the cloud which overwrites my laptop version.&nbsp; My thought was to just erase the iPhone version every time I do a laptop update, but when I did that it erased the laptop version.&nbsp;
 So the laptop to iPhone sync seems to be the problem or excel just doesn't look for an update if there is a local version.&nbsp; Can't get rid of the local version either.</span><br />

<p>Little update.&nbsp; So I erased both files and then copied an older version that I updated back into the desktop.&nbsp; Opened the file to confirm it is there.&nbsp; See the iphone and WD version are the same.&nbsp; I then make a small edit to the Desktop WD version to see
 if it will pass to the iphone version.&nbsp; I open the recent and it shows 2 versions which seems to be the iphone version is the old one and the one above it is the one I want to replace on the iphone.&nbsp; I select the new version and go to properties and see it
 matches the date and time of the updated version I want to now use.&nbsp; I then open the file and the will you believe the older version opens.&nbsp; So I go back to open and the recent version is no longer seen and only the local version is seen (see below).&nbsp; I go
 back to my desktop and open the file and guess what?&nbsp; The recent version is gone and I have the old iphone version available.&nbsp; This has got to be a bug, but MS tells me to talk with WD to solve the problem.</p>

            There is no option to modify the date format that shows up in the Skype application.
<br />
<br />Thank you for bringing this up. I will take note of this topic, and pass this to our developers so they can consider adding a feature to change the date format in future updates.
<br />
<br />Please visit the Release Notes for Skype for Desktop, Mac and Linux from time to time for updates. 
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.

<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Leave Windows Insider Program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> origami1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Leave Windows Insider Program</h2>
                    <p>I joined the Insider Program to get updates for my Lumia 1020 phone. When I learned that my phone was being abandoned by Microsoft--i.e., never updated to Windows 10 Mobile--I RELUCTANTLY abandoned the Windows Phone platform. (Now using a Nexus 6P with Project
 Fi as my carrier and LOVING the carrier even as I miss the WP UI.)</p>
<p>I would like to stop receiving the Insider Update emails, but in order to do that, I need to leave the program. When I log into the insider website on my desktop--which was never part of the insider program--I do not see a "Leave" tab/button/whatever anywhere
 on the page (top, bottom or middle), so the answers to other questions about leaving don't help me.</p>
<p>I no longer have the windows phone that was registered to the Insider Program so how do I get out???</p>
<p>TIA--Origami1212</p>

            <p>Sorry, this does NOT help (but thanks for trying).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I no longer have the Lumia 1020 that the insider program was installed on, it is NOT POSSIBLE to "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">erase the Technical Preview and install your old version of Windows</span>". That
 phone "died" with the insider program installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can, of course, just start reporting the Windows Insider emails as SPAM, since that is what they are to me now that Microsoft and I have both abandoned the Lumia 1020. But that feels rather ugly.</p>

<h2>            Heading numbering disappeared after updated changes on shared document</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From time to time I'm experiencing problem&nbsp;with heading numbering in Word 2013 document. Here is a background of this problem:</p>
<p>Document is shared by 2 people. It's published on SharePoint 2010 library.&nbsp;This two people are making changes on the document at the same time. In the document&nbsp;heading styles&nbsp;are changed, so that they are outline numbered.
</p>
<p>Sometimes when one person is updating changes on the document, heading styles loses their numbering and the paragraph indentation change its values, although the other person haven't made any changes to styles. It's a nondeterministic behaviour and we haven't
 found any circumstances why does it happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help us resolve this issue? It's very frustrating that from time to time we have to fix styles in our document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Artur</p>

<p>In the Replace dialog, click the More button to expand the dialog and then click the Special button at the bottom. The menu you see differs depending on whether the cursor was in the Find What box or the Replace With box, and on whether the Use Wildcards
 box is checked or unchecked. Clicking any item in the menu inserts the corresponding code into the Find What or Replace With box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search and replace syntaxes for wildcard replacements can be much more complex than you can make with just the Special menu. For a tutorial, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/replace_using_wildcards.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/replace_using_wildcards.htm</a>.</p>

Did you have&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TweakUI</a>&nbsp; installed before?&nbsp;&nbsp; You could have used it to create a&nbsp; Custom Places bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise a difference you may be noting would be due to

LCIE</a>, e.g. that effectively causes each new tab to be a new instance of&nbsp; IE, unlike IE6 or IE7.</p>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the downloaded file is available in the following location.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>C:\Users\</span></strong><em><span>your_username</span></em><strong><span>\Downloads</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> This is the default location for downloads.&nbsp; You will likely find your file there.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Whenever we download, we get a dialog box that prompts us to Run, Save or Cancel the download. Once we click on Save, it tries to save the file in the current default location. We can either accept
 the default location or simply change it. If we choose to change the location, then the new location will become the default download location in the future.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Also refer the steps from the link below: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/download-location-in-ie8/3ff3b136-05b8-429d-82fd-5b7bdc49313e">

    <title>Color of a data grid control&#39;s header and grid lines. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Color of a data grid control&#39;s header and grid lines.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with a color of certain control. It's not a major one, but annoys me to no end because I don't know when it happened and was it something I did or some update or an app I installed. Looks ugly too. The color of a grid and headers of a grid
 control changed to something it wasn't suppose to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a picture from Visual Studio property page that shows the problem. The left side shows what it's suppose to look like and the right one is what it looks like on my computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb9c5a0-00ac-41bc-b0d0-b81844cac02d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cb9c5a0-00ac-41bc-b0d0-b81844cac02d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The color is not affected by the system color or theme settings, neither by a Visual Studio theme settings.</p>
<p>From what I was able to figure out the control is .Net's DataGridView, and some of its colors come from the old system's advanced colors settings now hidden in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By some trial and error I found out that the control is using the ButtonShadow value (RGB 160 160 160), and manually adjusting it in the registry (HKCU\Control Panel\Colors\ButtonShadow) does change the color. But I don't want to change that because it affects
 other elements of the ui too. As far as I can tell it should not use that value (it doesn't on a machine that is not affected by this problem), so something somewhere erroneously makes it use it. I'm at a loss how to find what that is.</p>
<p>All the colors in that registry key (also in&nbsp;HKCU\Control Panel\Colors\Desktop\) seem to be at their defaults and are the same as on an unaffected machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other idea I have is that maybe for some reason that particular control reverted to some Windows95ish style, which uses this particular value for grid and headers, but I don't know what could cause this or how to change that. The app doesn't seem
 to be in any compatibility mode or anything like that (as far as I can tell).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. This is a minor issue but it drives me nuts.</p>

            The issue has nothing to do with Microsoft Office or programming. I think the category "Desktop, Start &amp; personalization" was accurate because it's about global system colors.

            It sounds like it may be corrupted.<br />
<br />
Backup your contacts to a pc, erase them from the phone then reload them. Hopefully that will cure it.<br />
<br />
You may also want to try a factory reset from the settings menu. A software update may also fix the issue.<br />

    <title>Word 16.26 keeps bouncing on Mojave 10.14.5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 16.26 keeps bouncing on Mojave 10.14.5</h2>
                    <p>I take to this forum to ventilate my grievances about an affliction that appears to have blighted Word users on a Macintosh for too long now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>About 10 days ago, I purchased a 2019 MacBook Pro 15 inch.&nbsp; It came pre-loaded with Mojave 10.14.5.&nbsp; I took out a license for Office Home and Business 2019 and installed Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel and Word.&nbsp; &nbsp;Save for Word, all the other programmes work
 fine.&nbsp; In a throwback to the old malaise, Word simply keeps bouncing and has to be force quit.&nbsp; I have since spent an indeterminable amount of time on these forums looking for solutions.&nbsp; I stumbled upon several threads proffering one suggestion upon another
 as to how users should get Word to work again.&nbsp; These suggestions have included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Safe Booting and checking to see if any programmes interfere with Word;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Disabling log-in items;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Turning the wifi-on and off and signing in and out;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Adjusting Word preferences in the Library and moving certain files to the desktop;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Deleting .dotm templates;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Uninstalling and re-Installing the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all these suggestions failed, for good measure, I performed a clean install of Mojave 10.14.5 and proceeded to immediately install Word to see if it would work.&nbsp; On this occasion, Word opened a couple of times but soon enough, reverted to its original
 position of bouncing and requiring to be force quit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I welcome all suggestions and thank the community for ridding me of this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>It turns out that the equation-input problem was solved by deleting the cache file (~/Library/<span>com.microsoft.Word</span>&nbsp;folder), and opening Word twice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the update looping from Install back to Getting Things Ready?</p>
<p>If it is you have to just wait it out.</p>
<p>Or delete the SoftwareDistribution folder and try the update again.</p>

<p>Yesterday I did two failed attempts with the 0cx1900101 error, after deleting the software distribution folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update process started as usual, getting the things ready, then downloading and installin. All of them got 100%.
</p>
<p>
The problem always appears after the restart, the configuring gets 100% but when it starts to make the changes, the process stops at 40%, after almost one and a half hour. Sadly I couldn't see the message when it stopped, but inmediatly, the system started
 the return to the inicial version, and after another 45 minutes all were as the beggining.

<p>Joe, just a head's up that this solution may not work.</p>
<p>I tried that last week with 18252, but the looping issue</p>
<p>causes a problem.</p>
<p>The Install cycles back to Getting Things Ready, but then</p>
<p>hits Download again which it can't do if you've disconnected</p>
<p>from the internet. So it just sits there.</p>

<h3> stevezky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please help me with setting my Yahoo mail account up in my Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I purchased Outlook 2013 a month or so back and tried to set up my Yahoo email there.&nbsp; I loaded Outlook fine and my email started appearing after I added the yahoo account.&nbsp; For some reason it stopped and doesn't update at all: can't send or receive and
 get errors about POP3 servers or something not working.&nbsp; I was recently given Outlook 2013 Professional at work free and uninstalled the old version (never could get it to work and spent a long time on the phone with Microsoft with no help).&nbsp; The new version
 loaded great and all my Office products work fine, but cannot get my yahoo email to work.&nbsp; Followed some detail steps here about how to put in the POP3 server details, etc.&nbsp; no help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't get an actual person on any Microsoft line to help me.&nbsp; Any suggestions
 would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks. Steve

            Steve, this is the section for questions about outlook.com - the online version of Outlook.<br />
<br />
For the desktop application that is part of Office, you might want to ask the Office section (look under the Categories menu above)<br />

<p>Why not leave the emails in Outlook and search from there?<br />
</p>
<p>Exchange (OWA), Outlook.com and Gmail&nbsp;also offer online mailbox wide search capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having lots of individual eml-files will not make it easier to sort and filter on various message properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, you'd need a convertor add-in to export them into the eml format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is for archiving purposes, you could also consider the pdf-format.</p>

            <p>Hello Mister Sparnaaij,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe we use "Outlook 2013".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have about a 100.000 e-mails&nbsp;a year&nbsp;in our inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With dropbox we can acces the information in the e-mails easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there&nbsp;a way to export all of them automaticly in pdf with ocr ? and maybe automate this in order to have a searchable up-to-date&nbsp;data base accessible from any location by smartphone or tablet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>with kind regards,</p>

            <p>How do you find them easier accessible in Dropbox than searching in an actual mail client?</p>
<p>Also still: Which mail account type are you using? Exchange, POP3, IMAP, Outlook.com, other...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said before, keeping them in an Exchange mailbox is the most flexible solution. Even when you don't cache the contents on a mobile device, everything is still searchable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the method described in the link I gave you generates text-based pdf-files and not picture based pdf-file so you don't need any OCR.</p>

<h2>            Conditional Formatting</h2>
                    <p>I have med error records that I want to apply conditional formatting with multiple staff.&nbsp; These cells start on D7-D11, I need to following conditions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If med error is brand new then no formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If med error is 3 months old then highlight green.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If med error is 6 months old then highlight yellow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If med error is 1 year or older then highlight red.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be done?</p>
<p>As more staff get med errors will those conditions work if I add them to the excel spreadsheet?</p>

<p>Microsoft, I can confirm this behavior two times in the last two weeks with MSN.&nbsp; On two separate occasions, while view an article that was on MSN, the browser would start redirecting to a strange URL.&nbsp; I immediately closed Edge when I saw this.&nbsp; My settings
 are to clear temporary storage from Edge when I close the browser. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It seems advertisements are still becoming plagued with drive-by downloads.&nbsp; Some of the reason users resort to ad blockers is to avoid this kind of issue. &nbsp; What is Microsoft doing about plagued advertisements?</p>

 And it’s amazing that this thread actually made it to the top of the list, with all of those pages and pages of SpyHunter-sponsored sites that turn up in the search results for<span> “Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D”</span>. So the whole default “Windows experience” is

</p><p><span>The fake Adobe Flash Player update page isn’t being spawned by any malware residing on the local system drive – the webpage that you’re on is simply being redirected to a malware site with a JavaScript
<em>forced redirect </em>– where <span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">window.top.location = "http://malware.com"</span> is being set from a cross-domain advertising iframe:</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are several different versions of the fake Adobe Flash Player update that you might encounter, depending on the browser and the specific website, and there are also several other “fake update” templates out there. The one that’s currently being
 delivered on MSN portal pages is detected as Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D, which is specifically a detection for the FlashPlayer.hta file associated with the KovCoreG malvertising group. And since this fake update is being delivered via a compromised advertising domain
 that's been connected to the host site – the detection will recur frequently upon returning to the host site, without indicting the presence of any persistent malware:</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Microsoft Edge, the best defense against these malvertising redirects is to install uBlock Origin, or another ad-blocker extension, directly from the Edge Settings menu:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We’ve had a couple of reports indicating that uBlock Origin isn’t consistently blocking the fake Adobe Flash Player update page. If this becomes an issue, then consider trying the frame-blocking option:</span></p>

<h2>            margins - excel in Macbook</h2>
                    <p>good afternoon,</p>
<p>I am facing issue with margins in Excel.</p>
<p>I tried already everything.</p>
<p>I did custom Margins, page margins.</p>
<p>I put everywhere 0cm margins but still when I print page is printed with 5cm margins from Top.</p>
<p>left, right and bottom are fine just Top is keeping massive margin.</p>
<p>anyone could help me to solve this problem?</p>

<p>Hi Natalia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test with Excel for Mac, I can change the margin on the top by the following process:</p>
<p>1. Click File in the top menu &gt; select Print &gt; Show Details;</p>
<p>2. In Margins, select Manage Custom Margins;</p>
<p>3. Click the Margin tab &gt; reduce the margin of Header and Top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this process doesn't work on your side, to check if this behavior is related to the workbook, you may create a new workbook and see if you could change the margin on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your reply but it doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>Margins are all set to 0mm, I tried on a new workbook, nothing works.</p>
<p>This problem only happens with Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Top margin, once paper printed, represents like 5cm from the top of the paper.</p>
<p>Left/right &amp; bottom margins are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Natalia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information you shared with us. According to the screenshot, I assume that in the print preview the workbook is normal, but when printed the workbook to papers, a margin of 5 cm at the top appears. In this case, I'd suggest that you may
 try printing with another printer and see if it may be caused by the printer's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue is not related to the printer, please try printing the workbook in the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a> of your Mac and see if the issue is caused by the add-ins or the other software on your Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may also try updating the Excel application to the latest version to fix the issue:</p>
<p>1. Download and install the latest version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft AutoUpdate tool</a>;</p>
<p>2. Open Excel &gt; click Help in the top menu &gt; select Check for Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my above information couldn't help, please click Excel in the top menu &gt; select About Excel &gt; capture a screenshot of the detailed information and share it with us, to help us further investigate the issue for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>
