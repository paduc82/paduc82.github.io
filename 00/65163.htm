<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Windows key not working</h2>
                    Pressing the Windows key on my Surface Pro 3 has stopped working as has clicking on the Windows icon. It was fine 24 hours ago. Cortana has suffered the same problem and my pen won't launch Onenote. Once again all OK 24 hours ago. However, if I press the
 Windows key + R, the Run Window opens. &nbsp;If I double click my pen a Window opens stating that "You'll need a new app to open this onenote-cmd." This whole thing is very frustrating as I can't get to my mail or calendar on my Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;Does anyone have
 this problem or know of a fix?

Have you run a thorough hard drive diagnostic?&nbsp; Tested RAM?<br />
It certainly seems like there is a hardware problem.<br />

<p>Are you trying to update your BIOS from within Windows? You can't do that. You need to boot from the BIOS update disk.</p>

    <title>Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am&nbsp;currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We play&nbsp;every Halo that was ever&nbsp;made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</p>
<p>2. Halo 2 (PC)</p>
<p>3. Halo 3</p>
<p>4. Halo 3: ODST</p>
<p>5. Halo Reach</p>
<p>6. Halo Wars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also&nbsp;expand to the upcoming Halo:&nbsp;CE Remake and Halo 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. KillJoyseries89 made&nbsp;our websit &nbsp;where you can view more of
 Team Forerunner's information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so, and&nbsp;junglecatz81&nbsp;(So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!

<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings&nbsp;every other&nbsp;Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;crazed so&nbsp;(Team Forerunner Co-Leader), and junglecatz81 (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>

<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"

"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365 <br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so and/or junglecatz81. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if
 necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

    <title>Top 10 best fully auto &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; rifles in cod history - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killer lnh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Top 10 best fully auto &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; rifles in cod history</h2>
                    1. M4 (cod4) - in my opinion more versatile than m16 and even faster fire rate than mp5 2. Famas (blops 1) - faster fire rate than most smgs 3. Acr (mw3) - highest tier gun no recoil outclasses even the mp7 4. Mtar (blops 2)- gun that can compete with
 smgs in an smg game 5. Sc 2010 (ghosts)- new acr, decent rate of fire 6. Ak 12 (ghosts)-1st good Kalashnikov rifle in any call of duty game, before it was just a niche weapon 7. Acr (mw2)- no recoil but first game to introduce flinch with no focus perk so
 somewhat random 8. Scar (mw2) - mostly used until acr is unlocked 9. Tar 21 (mw2)- if you prefer POWER 10. Sturmgewher ( waw) - ONLY **** rifle lol

<div>I see why you chose to do full auto only...but I'm struggling to put together 10 very good full auto ARs. &nbsp;But if we're going full auto AR it's all about low recoil with high damage.</div>
<ol>
<li>ACR - MW3: Hands down the best full auto assault rifle IMO. </li><li>AN 94 - Blops 2: Pre-patch </li><li>AK 12 - Ghosts </li><li>AK 47 - COD 4: One of the most satisfying full auto guns to use. &nbsp;Feels powerful and is powerful.
</li><li>Scar H - MW2 </li><li>SC 2010 - Ghosts: pin point accurate </li><li>Famas - Blops 1: Didn't play alot of bo1, but this was the best AR I played with.
</li><li>ACR - MW2: &nbsp;Very accurate with high rof </li><li>Mtar - Blops 2 </li><li>M4 - COD 4: Quality gun that was overshadowed by the m-16 and ak 47. </li></ol>
<div>My complete AR list:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>M16 - COD 4: Probably the best gun in any call of duty. &nbsp; </li><li>ACR - MW3 </li><li>Famas - MW2 </li><li>Type 95 - MW3 </li><li>AN 94 - blops 2 </li><li>AK 12 - ghost </li><li>AK 47 - COD 4 </li><li>MK 14 - MW3 </li><li>M8A1 - blops 2 </li><li>Fal - blops 2 </li></ol>
<div>These lists are based off of the pre-patch versions in core game modes. &nbsp;The list could change depending on how tired/lazy I was feeling, but this is based off of my full try hard mode.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Typically every call of duty has a borderline OP 3 burst AR which is the best gun until the first patch comes out. &nbsp;Usually the 2nd best AR is full auto with low recoil and high damage. &nbsp;Then if we are lucky there is a single shot AR that has very high
 damage. &nbsp;i.e. one shot kill to the head, 2 shot kill to the body, moderately fast ROF with low recoil.</div>

<p>AK has been fairly reliable in every call of duty. &nbsp;Good iron sights with high damage. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I get the feeling from your list you like high damage ARs.<br />
<br />
I Loved the way the stg sounded in waw. &nbsp;I wish more guns had cool sounds...whether that be unique sounding or just straight up powerful sounding. &nbsp;PPSh, AK 47, stg, ect.</p>

            <p>Okay, I ran into this issue and googling it did not solve my issue. So I hope this helps someone else out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a ups zp 450 printer and new windows 8.1 pc.</p>
<p>First tried the drivers from ups at <a href="http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/create/labels/technical.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/create/labels/technical.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into the issue where it would not install the drivers and the error was driver was not digitally signed. Phoned ups support and they said it was a Microsoft issue and&nbsp;directed me to a youtube video here titled 3rd party inf not digitally signed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlYGfJM2BJ0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlYGfJM2BJ0</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/dlYGfJM2BJ0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/dlYGfJM2BJ0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>While I did not perform the task I was already familiar with temporarily disabling the digital certificate checks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not believe the ups support that this was the only fix. So I went to the manufacturer website here:
</p>
<p><a href="https://ups.zebra.com/UPSZebraWeb/support/product-detail-ZP450.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ups.zebra.com/UPSZebraWeb/support/product-detail-ZP450.html</a></p>
<p>You have to create an account but eventually you can download the drivers from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran their install and it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps anyone having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h3> ahmad afifkhan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I type in the windows search bar and can&#39;t access the language bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Pro 64bit (Build 14393).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to press [Windows] and then type any command (say "region" or say "sniping tool") and accessed that settings or program. But unfortunately, I can't do this right now! Even I've opened the "Windows Settings" window and tried to type in the "Find a
 setting" field. But it didn't take any input...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really cannot understand why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my language bar has also disappeared. I used to use this shortcut [windows + space] to access the language bar menu... but neither the language bar is showing nor the shortcut command is working. I went to control panel to see whether anything was changed...
 but it was okay. As I have to type in different languages, I need this shortcut barely to quickly switch between languages and I also need to see them changing. But the pop up which used to appear when [windows + space] shortcut command was pressed and can
 see which language is getting selected, is not coming and I can't track which keyboard is active right now. I've to blindly press [left alt + left shift] and expect the right language to be selected.</p>
<p>Have windows changed the shortcut in the latest update to [left alt + left shift]? This is awful (if they have changed it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me why am I facing those two problems?</p>

            <p>Are those the only solutions to these problem? Why did these occur in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows search bar is not working still.</p>
<p>The second solution posted by <strong>unnoted</strong> is like a temporary solution. And it didn't bring back the language bar like the Windows 10 style rather it is primitive looking win7 style. Also the shortcut key [win + space] isn't working either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems that I've mentioned still prevails. None of these worked as I had expected. I want it to restore to the previous state.</p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate that you provided us the results after running the Start menu troubleshooter. Since it is asking you for the administrator permission, we suggest that you create a new local administrator account even if you already have an existing one.&nbsp; This
 is <span>to see whether you can open the Start menu using that account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Fallout 3, не удается загрузить.</h2>
                    
<p>Добрый день.</p>
<p>Купил Fallout 3 на Xbox360, качаю его с Xbox Shop. Когда загрузка завершается, его нет среди доступных игр, если посмотреть через хранилище, видно, что он в желтом круге с восклицательным знаком. Пробовал закачивать несколько раз и разными источниками (WiFi,
 Витой парой). Очищал системный кэш, все без результата.</p>
<p>Подскажите пожалуйста, как быть?</p>

<p>Очистка кэша мне кажется тут не при чём... сам столкнулся с аналогичной проблемой... в очереди загрузок висели Биошок и Томб Райдер (винт переполнен был), вчера перенёс на флешки застойные игры чтобы освободить место и скачать. В итоге даже не подскажу сколько
 попыток было по запуску повторной закачки, прежде чем всё прошло успешно... качает-качает, потом бах - проскакиевает 100% и выходит сообщение что не удалось произвести загрузку, при этом игра из очереди загрузок исчезает. Приходилось либо через журнал загрузок
 запускать повторно, либо через магазин... может кто подскажет корни данной проблемы? сервера перегружены или Россию так "любят" ? :)</p>

<p>LeastPayload961, здорово.</p>
<p>RommaNrus, сложно сказать, у меня не разу не было проблем с загрузкой, но сервера имеют свойство ломаться, возможно в данном случае имеет факт наличия сбойного сервера или группы серверов.</p>

<p>Сегодня/вчера аналогичные проблемы, но уже с другой игрой.</p>
<p>Кривой все-таки механизм закачивания игр, -1 приставке и такому сервису.</p>

<p>!!!TO ALL!!!, все кто сталкивается с проблемой загрузки игр, когда создаёт пост, так же переводите его, хотя бы через транслятор на английский язык. Это необходимо, чтобы разработчики из США могли прочитать его и исправить данную проблему.</p>

<p>Последние вести с полей, проверяйте соединение tracert tracert.xboxlive.com</p>
<p>Если время отклика более 200мс, со слов поддержки, это плохо. В моем случае около 250мс, попробую уменьшить это значение.</p>

<h2>            gamertags that are in use. an idea.</h2>
                    
<p>do you think that microsoft should delete the gamertags of accounts that are no longer in use so people with gold can use them. i mean the accounts that haven't been on recently or have no game history.</p>
<p>just a thought for microsoft.</p>

<p>it is most annoying when a gamer tag is banned as deemed inappropriate then you change it, only for someone else to start using it soon after ... if it is banned and deemed innapropriate it should not be able to be re registered. (Long Live GlandularBeaver)</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">It would make sense, it is very difficult to create a unique tag and it is always very likely someone else has thought of it. My tag which i did not expect t b taken was and i had to modify it with my DoB, so it would be good
 if they deleted accounts that are no longer in use, or have merely only ever been used on the forums or website, because alot of trolls take tags but they never go onto the console.</span></p>

            Backwards compatibility has been stopped as all focus is on ensuring the Project Scarlett console is fully backwards compatible with all current available games on the Xbox One.

</p><p><span>If your order is refused, it means that most likely the payment was rejected by our payment provider, not by Skype. This can occur for a number of reasons, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Insufficient funds on your card or in your bank account to complete the transaction.</span></li><li>
<span>Using an anonymous proxy to access the internet.</span></li><li>

<h2>            key is not valid for use in specified state</h2>
                    I have been running into this issue lately. I had a game called League of Legends on my windows 7 pc. It worked fine and all till I got&nbsp;tired of it and un-installed the game. Well its been a great while and now I want to play it again. I went to the website
 and tried to download the game, but an error message came up saying "key is not valid for use in specified state". So thought maybe it was my c drive which is where the said game was being installed. I then desided to do a diagnostic test on my c drive. Nothing
 seemed to be wrong, but the same message keeps appearing. I don't get how it wont download now, but it did a while back, when I first downloaded it. I even tried a system recovery, to bring it back to that time, yet the message still came. Is there anyway
 I can get some help&nbsp; with understanding&nbsp;this error and maybe fixing it?

    <title>Sleep Mode Freeze due to USB 3.0 incompatability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamdavo77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sleep Mode Freeze due to USB 3.0 incompatability</h2>
                    <p>There Is a Ghost in My Machine….</p>
<p>Oh woe me and Microsoft…There is a ghost in my machine and MS Win7 HP 64b is unable to function in its vapid nature…..It dates back 2 or 3 years ago when my system developed the hideous habit of locking up in “Sleep” mode. I discovered this in a fledgling
 want to be Green, deciding to use the Sleep mode option; It was great instant start up…However the perceived promise evaporated with the necessity to need a cut power to restore system function, as there was no wake method for exiting the Sleep.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It turned out it was all due to a dispute between the OS) and the SATA drive on my system (any SATA drive). After many discussions with “Mr. Fix It”, s<span>olace was provided by the drive maker who FAQformed me to disable sleep mode for the drive….</span>
 And in a blessing from the OS deity above, MS fixed the issue in an update which occurred 1 year later…..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now just recently (say 2 months past), fishiness re emerged in my system, in the issue of its Ethernet port loss of function…as a hoped for quick fix, I disabled the fishy internal port via the bios &amp; purchased connected a USB 3.0 to Ethernet adapter to
 restore internet function. I should mention, just prior to this, I fulfilled desire to offshore my docs into an external USB 3.0 drive by adding a 3.0 Hub and 3.0 External Drive to my system. In an instant the ghost returned, randomly (and repeatedly) resetting
 the CD and hard drive connected to the new hub. Plus…at the same time, dropping my USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter, whenever the system “Went to Sleep”.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So who knows which addition was/is causing the ghosting, I contacted everyone involved, the Hub maker…the USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter maker…even WD (extDrive) FAQ….All told, to uncheck the “Allow this device to go to sleep" options at the Device Manager&gt;USB
 and Power Options configuration areas….All for not, the ghost continued(s) to haunt my system. Even updating drivers for all involved (where possible) and doing a mass defrag along with a registry cleaning has hastened no solution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So in a desperate measure, I dropped my green desires and initiated the old fall back disabling sleep mode with a new Power Option “24/7 we never sleep”. Now in my wait for the great MS to respond, here I wait, holding the ghost at bay in a 24/7 burn o’the
 midnight Watts recluse.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If any listening have encountered such a situation(s) and have a fix please respond…</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Kernel Mode Heap Corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandmanxo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Kernel Mode Heap Corruption</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a BSOD happening during the shutdown of Windows 10 quite frequently - 2 /3 times per day.&nbsp; It's a new ASUS build with GeForce 1060 6GB graphics SSD and 16GB RAM. Graphics already been replaced last week but still this continues.&nbsp; Also the BSOD
 function doesn't restart the computer once it has collected the info it needed to 100% and force shutdown is required. Seems to happen less if internet browsers are not open .. I use Edge, Opera, Chrome and Firefox but can happen when any one of them is active.
 Security is MBAM Premium and Bullguard, a bitdefender trial came with the machine. When I contact the PC supplier they already told me replacing the motherboard was next step, but now wondering if even replacing all the parts will actually fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            Hi SandManXO,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Hi Vijay&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I've checked the folder but no mini dumps. Checked the settings and changed from automatic to 'complete' crash dump in the recovery options. Checked &nbsp;VRAM settong is double system memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I'll need to wait for the next crash eh? One problem might be that yhe BSOD is permanent &nbsp;after 100% gathering crash dump data. Force power off is always required to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will i wait to see if the next crash produces a dump file?</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Is the issue confined only when playing videos in YouTube?<br />
2. Are you using Internet explorer to access YouTube?<br />
3. Do you receive any error message on the computer?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>:<br />
If the issue occur when playing the video from YouTube in Internet explorer then you may perform the steps from the knowledge base article provided and check.<br />
Troubleshoot video problems using Internet Explorer<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2532294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2532294</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Full Screen Video viewing issue is also due to a Hardware Acceleration issue. To resolve the issue:<br />
a. Before you click on the Video(to view it in Full Screen mode), right-click on the video while it is in the normal size and choose "Settings" from the context menu.<br />
b. Remove the checkmark from Hardware Acceleration.<br />
c. Test results.<br />

            <p>To sae data, it is better to use an Inplace upgrade. Download an ISO once and do an Inplace upgrade, but make sure all PC's are running the same edition, language and Architecture of Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows DVD Maker music problems</p>
<p>Can't get my downloaded music to be recognized by Windows DVD&nbsp;Maker when I try to add it to slideshow.&nbsp; Sample music (that came preloaded with the computer) is the only music it recognizes when I go to add music.&nbsp; I'm guessing this is a format recognition
 problem but I don't know how to download in a compatible format that will work.</p>

<p>==========================================<br />
Might be worth a try to convert your music files to the <br />
.wma format before importing into DVD Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many free converters available on the net...<br />
the following download from Koyotesoft is one example:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Koyotesoft 'Free MP3 WMA Converter'<br />
<a href="http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html</a><br />
(FWIW if you install the converter you may want to uncheck <br />
the offers of Yahoo and Dealio) (also...you may want to uncheck<br />
the CD Ripper and the Easy MP3 Cutter)</p>
<p>After installing the program...open it and drag/drop<br />
your audio files onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Choose a save folder (output path). Or just leave...<br />
"Save in the file's directory" checked and the new<br />
files will be saved in the folder with the current files.<br />
<br />
Choose a format...<br />
<br />
Left click the Convert button.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to know that you're able to call on another computer. There is a possibility you are not using the latest version of Skype in&nbsp;the computer wherein the issue persists. Using an outdated version of Skype might cause issues with connectivity. Kindly
 uninstall and install the <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest version of Skype</a>.</p>

<h3> sceubowj  say:</h3>
<h2>            The tool bar that was at the top of screen on windows vista disapeared</h2>
                    There is a large semi transparent tool bar that appeares at the top of the screen in windows vista with the recycle bin,internet explorer and a few other icons in it. When i reinstalled my printer driver that tool bar is now gone. How do I restore it and
 what is actually called because all documentation on my computer refers to the tool bar at the bottom whenever searching.

<p>Hi sceubowj,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to post.</p>
<p>We are going to need some more information from you.</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>What is the make/model of your computer, Dell, Acer, HP?</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Is it possible to do a System Restore before the printer reinstall?
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/322756</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Right-click</b> the <b>Taskbar</b> at the bottom of the <b>Desktop</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Select <b>Toolbars</b></span></p>
<p>Are any of these the Toolbar you are talking about?</p>
<p>From your description the toolbar maybe a 3rd party toolbar that came preinstalled and&nbsp;that may need to be reinstalled.
</p>
<p>Please let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
