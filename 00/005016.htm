    <title>Microsoft Visual Basic &#34;File not found&#34;&#58; Excel appears to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpretty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Visual Basic &#34;File not found&#34;&#58; Excel appears to have autosaved data from one file over another that now has problems opening and appears to have had all its sheets replaced by those of the other file.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi, I've searched around to see if anyone has a solution to this issue and thus far have come up empty handed so I am hoping someone here can help. Last night I had several files open at one time. I saved them on closing. This morning when I have tried to
 re-open one of those files Excel comes up with a "Microsoft Visual Basic - File not found" message box.</p>
<p>When I click "OK" a new message box says "Excel found unreadable content in 'Daily Summary.xls'. do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes."</p>
<p>When I click "Yes", it opens up a file it calls "Daily Summary.xls [Repaired]" but the file has none of the data from the sheet as it was last saved and instead replicates all the sheets from another file, which was opened yesterday. There was a hyperlink
 to this other file in the original "Daily Summary.xls" but I fail to see how this could have happened.</p>
<p>I really do not want to have to waste time rebuilding a worksheet that took months of incremental work to create in the first place so I hope someone out there knows how to resurrect the original file?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Applying Rules to Emails That Are In Currently in Email Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question regarding email rules.</p>
<p>The scenario is as follows. I am working in a team and our team inbox is very cluttered. To declutter it I created rules to move emails containing certain words in the subjects to specific folders. How can I apply this rule to all existing emails in the
 inbox? Using the desktop app doesn't seem to be an option as it is freezing when trying to do this operation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sweep tool is only working if filtering by email sender (for instance here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-ofolders/how-can-i-apply-rules-to-existing-emails/54f8c905-e3ea-4960-8a81-ac9ca86a6b4c?page=1), but that piece of
 advice is not applicable here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Please let me know.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that does not seem to answer the question as I am aware how to create rules as I referenced in my original question. However, I want to
<strong>apply this rules also to emails currently in the inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>This basic feature seems to be only available through a work around using the advanced search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there maybe a more direct way to apply rules to emails currently in the inbox?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            Your Virus &#38; threat protection is managed by your organization, deleting  HKLM&#92;SOFTWARE&#92;Policies&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows Defender- DisableAntiSpyware  does NOT solve the problem</h2>
                    <p>There is a ton of documentation out there stating how to remove the "DisbaleAntiSpyware" registry key in order to remove the message "Anti Virus &amp; threat protection is managed by your organization" which disables a users ability to use and update Windows

<p>
</p><p>While I am able to remove the bad registry key, it comes back every single time after a reboot. I have run thorough scans by MalwareBytes and SpyBot Search and destroy. All instances of malware have been removed and all scans now come back 100% clean but
 Windows Defender not working continues to be an issue.</p>

<br />
If none of the above help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue
 with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. <br />
<br />
If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing
 it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It could be an issue related to the following:
<br />
<br />- There might be Malware on the system
<br />- The edition of Windows 10 you are running: Pro or Enterprise might be managed by your organizations system administrator.
<br />- You might need to reinstall Windows Defender using the steps below. 
<br />- A repair upgrade might by required to fix it.
<br />
<br />Enable Windows Defender:
<br />Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SecurityHealthService
<br />
<br />and modify the Start value from 4 to 2. Restart your computer to re-enable the Windows Defender Security Center Service.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Defender Security Center Service
<br />Double click it
<br />Set its Start up type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableRoutinelyTakingAction /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
<br />
<br />If this does not resolve the problem, then you need to perform a repair upgrade. See steps:

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you have been given the solution to your problem already in this</p>
<p>thread. However, it is covered up in so much minutia, that it is easy to&nbsp;</p>
<p>miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right that "DisableAntiSpyware" gets a lot of press in regard to </p>
<p>this problem. However, there is another <strong>policy</strong> that is sometime used
</p>
<p>to disable Windows Defender as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should enter the Registry and navigate through this branch.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\POLICIES\Microsoft </strong>and select the folder</p>
<p><strong>Windows Defender.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This folder should contain only one Key.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Default".</p>
<p>Any other Key that you see here is a <strong>policy</strong> change that has been made</p>
<p>to Windows Defender, by Malware, another Antivirus, or by you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see <strong>"DisableAntiVirus"</strong> you should disable it by changing its</p>
<p>DWord from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0. </strong>Then click "OK".&nbsp;&nbsp; Like wise you should do the same</p>
<p>for "DisableAntiSpyware" if it is present. It shouldn't be, you have </p>
<p>previously "Reg Deleted" it. If there are other Policies in the folder, that </p>
<p>you didn't set, you may need to delete the complete Windows Defender</p>
<p>folder... (KEY).&nbsp;&nbsp; As a precaution, you should "export" it first.&nbsp; (to&nbsp; Desktop).</p>
<p>Not to worry, Windows will reconstruct the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best to back out of the Registry by retracing the steps you used to enter.</p>
<p>This keeps the Registry from becoming cluttered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your PC and check Windows Defender. If it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> enabled, enter</p>
<p>the following command string in Command Prompt (admin). Enter the</p>
<p>commands one at a time, and hit &lt;enter&gt; after each.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CD\</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p><strong>CD Program Files\Windows Defender</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p><strong>MpCmdRun -wdenable</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Exit</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your PC and check Windows Defender again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,&nbsp; Glen</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your post I assumed that you were familiar with using the Registry.</p>
<p>As an afterthought, just in case you aren't, when you enter the Registry by</p>
<p>using "regedit" be sure to "Run as administrator". This will allow you to</p>
<p>make the changes that I proposed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to change the DWord value from 1 to 0, right-click DWord in the key</p>
<p>and select "modify". This allows you to make this modification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third. When you say that "DisableAntiSpyware" keeps returning, after you</p>
<p>delete it, would indicate that the cause for it is still present. If this occurred</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span> you had cleared all malware from your PC, that may indicate that</p>
<p>Windows Defender is still sensing the presence of another anti-virus.</p>
<p>If you have deleted one, you should ensure that any remaining fragments</p>
<p>of it have also been removed, by running its removal tool which will be</p>
<p>available from its Web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp; Glen&nbsp; </p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm running Outlook 2011 and I have an old exchange server email account that I cannot delete.&nbsp; When I click Outlook &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts there is no list on the left hand side to select to delete, but I can tell the exchange one is the top because the
 panel to the right shows the exchange server user name.&nbsp; If I click the " - " button the "are you sure you want to delete" window comes up, and I click delete but nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If I click Tools &gt; Accounts it opens up a similar window.&nbsp; See screen shot below.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I want to delete this old exchange email account, I've already backed up my files.&nbsp; I just want the account gone so it doesn't keep asking me for my password when it sends/receives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think you have a un-usable identity which is corrupt now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have to rather create a new identity in Outlook for mac 2011 and here is how you can do it -

</p><p>Hi Pj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The last screenshot you showed us is about OneNote 2016 instead of OneNote for Windows in your situation. The steps there do not apply here. And you are using a work account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, you found the recycle bin and figured the sync was not done via OneNote. There is still possibility that they were synced before. Hence we would like to suggest following the steps in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">the Private Message</a> I just sent to you to check if the lost notes now can be recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the other notes, you may sign out your account and sign in again to sync notebooks you would like to load on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi Pj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us. We apologize for the response from the other channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like you to understand that if the notes are not synced to cloud, then I'm afraid that the notes are lost. If the notes are synced to cloud already, you may go to OneDrive for Business where you store the notebooks via browser &gt; click<strong> gear
 icon </strong>in the upper right corner &gt;&nbsp;<strong>OneDrive&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Restore your OneDrive, you can restore your OneDrive to a previous time. Select a date preset or use the slider to find a date with unusual activity in the chart. Then select the changes that you want to undo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note: to avoid unwanted changes, please carefully select this choice until you are sure the action will complete what you would prefer and not case other data loss.</strong></p>

<h3> trugg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I re-install proofing tools for Word 2007&#63;</h2>
                    Spelling and grammar checking has stopped working and my Word 2007 is telling me that it "cannot find proofing tools for English (Unithed States)".&nbsp; I have my original, Suite disc, and its suggesting that I "try installing or re-installing" the proofing
 tools.&nbsp; How do I do this?

            That indicates a serious problem in the current installation, so the original suggestion to "uninstall and reinstall" the proofing tools is correct.<br />
<br />
Do steps 1 to 4 of the previous procedure. Instead of step 5, click the Add or Remove Features option and click Continue.
<br />
<br />
The next page shows a list of the parts of Office. Click the plus-sign-in-square next to "Office Shared Features" to expand it. Click the Proofing Tools box and choose Not Available from the menu. Click the Continue button and wait for the program to finish.
 Again, it's a good idea to reboot at this point.<br />
<br />
Now do the whole thing again, except that after clicking the Proofing Tools box, you choose Run From My Computer from the menu. That will reinstall the tools (and may ask for the disc). There's no need to reboot at the end of this part.<br />

<p>Hey Qing, I already re-installed MAU several times, issue still exists. Can't help you with a screenshot since in the meanwhile I updated my Office Apps manually. If you're interested I'm happy to share with you my autoupdate.log file, just let me know how.
 I opened this case more to make you aware that there is an issue that might effect several customers.</p>

<h2>            error ImapNoResponseException during IMAP migration from MDaemon to Office365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am busy with IMAP migration from MDaemon to Office365.</p>
<p>I scheduled several jobs and all of them were started properly and I see progress in coping messages to my Office365 accounts.</p>
<p>However I see messages in the report like:</p>
<p><em>Transient error ImapNoResponseException has occurred. The system will retry (1/60, 1/600).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 60 time the message appear:</p>
<p><em>Fatal error TooManyTransientFailureRetriesPermanentException has occurred.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the job stopped&nbsp; and need to be restarted manually.</p>
<p>And so on..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the log of MDaemon I see that my users were properly authorised and finally all IMAP connections were hide "by the other side" (Office 365).</p>
<p>Any idea why I get this error (ImapNoResponseException)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>Out administrator found the reason.</p>
<p>There are some public folders with only "lookup" access.</p>
<p>We excluded access to all public folders and started the migration again.</p>
<p>It is in synced now.</p>
<p>Strange, because I saw "no access" for these folders in the reports but could not see relationship with "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ImapNoResponseException".</span></p>

            The best practice is to define the tab stops as part of the style you apply to the text that needs them. They'll be present in every paragraph that has that style.<br />
<br />
If you insist on using directly applied tab stops, you should get the same tab stops in a new paragraph when you press Enter at the end of the current paragraph that has those stops. That behavior (carry the current paragraph's formatting of all types to the
 next paragraph) is automatic in Word; in fact, there's no way to turn it off.<br />
<br />
But if you already have more than one paragraph in the document, and you apply tabs or other formatting to one paragraph and then just move the cursor to another paragraph with the arrow keys or the mouse, then the formatting isn't carried along -- only the
 Enter key will do that. (Or you can use the Format Painter button, or the shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V to copy and paste formatting from one place to another.)<br />

            One other thing: If you clear all tabs and then want to set tabs for the whole document, you must select the whole document before setting the tabs. That is, newly defined tabs are applied to whatever set of paragraphs is selected at the time, whether
 one or many.<br />
<br />
But using styles is much more efficient!<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be a hardware or software specific issue. Have you tried using the Windows Device Recovery Tool again? Make sure that the phone has been charged before using the tool again. If it doesn't made any differences, it would be best to get in touch
 with nearest service center in your area or our partner <strong><a href="https://support.b2x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X support</a></strong> to have it checked.

 hours to do a full scan.&nbsp; I don't have much on my computer, a few pictures &amp; some music.&nbsp; I periodically delete things I don't use.&nbsp; Perhaps because I downloaded Google Chrome the scan with MSE is taking so long?&nbsp; I cancelled AOL and uninstalled it completely.&nbsp;
 So why the 10 hour scan?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Running a FULL scan means the entire drive/<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all partitions</span> are scanned.</p>
<p>This would include oem &nbsp;and any that you have added. Wasting time scanning non system files that do not change day to day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A more efficient way is to run a "Custom scan" on (C:) only, &nbsp; your System partition. With system/software updates and other downloads from the web, these are the files that change day to day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Scan covers only files most likely to be infected.</p>
<p>Also, any plugged in usb flashdrive would be scanned.</p>

<p><span>A custom scan with MSE will often help reduce the scan time; but something that can potentially be even more effective is disabling Archive Scanning (in the Advanced Settings page)
</span><span>–</span><span> and this can only be done for a Full Scan. So what I used to do was disable Archive Scanning and then exclude the drives and folders that didn’t need to be scanned:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_scanning-windows_vista/security-essentials-scan-time-lengthy/373e7298-c2ad-4cd4-bf90-6807d345a813"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_scanning-windows_vista/security-essentials-scan-time-lengthy/373e7298-c2ad-4cd4-bf90-6807d345a813</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The setting that allows us to disable Archive Scanning was actually included specifically for the purpose of reducing the time for Full Scans, and it basically provides a blanket exclusion for archive files. Archive files don't really pose a threat, but
 scanning them can consume a huge amount of time and resources because these files can be very large, and also because each container needs to be unpacked in order to scan the contents.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Will Windows Phone 8 and Outlook have full sync&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cubspike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Windows Phone 8 and Outlook have full sync&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After three years struggling with Android..I've finally concluded that it is a failed platform and not getting any better.&nbsp;Happy to discuss with anyone that has questions, but not here...this isn't the right (pardon the pun) forum. &nbsp;I have been anticipating
 WP8 and Windows 8 on a tablet and phone...I have always admired the Metro UI and have hopes for the data connections I need.</p>
<p>From what I've read (hear and other forums), the WP7 and 7.5 did not connect completely with Outlook.&nbsp; I live, succeed or die by my notes, multiple calendars and especially tasks.&nbsp; While I would improve a few details with Outlook tasks...it is essential
 to me and my business.&nbsp; I specifically use Outlook because it's everything I need in one package.&nbsp; So...in order for a smartphone and tablet to work for me, I need sync and support for multiple calendars, tasks and notes (although I also use One Note with
 already is connected, so&nbsp;notes aren't&nbsp;critical).</p>
<p>So far I haven't heard or read any details regarding this, however if Microsoft is planning on using the Windows Live account&nbsp; as a sync bridge (the way Google uses Gmail and Google calendar), then I'm worried, as the hotmail (or outlook.com) calendar has
 very bare bones task management...almost worse than Googles.</p>
<p>I know from the thousands of forum posts I've seen, I'm not alone.&nbsp; I could forgive the first iteration of Windows phone and the older Outlooks (2003, 2007) not being in full sync.&nbsp; Lord knows Googles isn't going to lift a finger to improve the situation
 for Outlook users and their Android phones.&nbsp; However, with all of the changes, improvements and basic rebuilding of every MS product...I would expect that Microsoft would fully support and connect their products.&nbsp; If it isn't in the plans...then why bother
 having a task manager in outlook at all..as it would be useless. (Sadly...I had better syncronization between outlook and my old Palm pilot 10 years ago than I can get today).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping someone can give me some good news.&nbsp; After all this, I'd hate to have to resort to an iPhone...(shudder).&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>To add one thing, Windows Phone today, syncs very well with Exchange. Tasks are supported, as well as most other things. So what? Office 365 is what. If you don't have a corporate account using Exchange, you might want to look at the MS Office 365 product,
 not the new metro office, but rather the hosted exchange thing that gives you an e-mail address, sharepoint space and a web presence. It gives you most everything that you would get from an enterprise installation.</p>
<p>Outlook was always designed to be a client to Exchange, not a standalone application suite. Outllook manages tasks and syncs to Exchange just fine. The phone syncs to Exchange tasks just fine.
</p>
<p>The phone will sync to Live ToDo's just fine as well.</p>
<p>What doesn't work is the Outlook connector syncing tasks to Live. I believe Outlook was intended for business and Exchange, and Live was intended for consumers. The phone works with either just fine. The breakdown is the Outlook (business)&nbsp;to Live (consumer)&nbsp;kludge.
</p>
<p>Office 365 is $6/mo/user (and you can have one user), and really provides some good features for&nbsp;business use. It's kind of an IT department in a box, providing basically hosted Exchange, Sharepoint, web presence, configurable with your own domain if you
 wish to invest in that as well.</p>
<p>Like others, I have no idea what WP8 will bring in this respect, but I have a gut feeling that things will work with Exchange or Live (Outlook.com?), but the bridge between those will likely be low priority.</p>

<h2>            How do I remove someone else&#39;s phone from my Microsoft.com account&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought a truck, one previous owner, the previous owner had a&nbsp;samsung phone 'paired' via bluetooth to the UConnect system (radio,etc.). I&nbsp;paired mine and deleted his. Now, every time I get in to my truck I get email&nbsp;from Microsoft that says "Microsoft
 account unusual sign-in activity" and it&nbsp;says:<br />
<br />
To help keep you safe, we've blocked access to your inbox, contacts list, and&nbsp;calendar for that sign-in. Please review your recent activity and we'll help&nbsp;you take corrective action. To regain access, you'll need to confirm that the&nbsp;recent activity was yours.<br />

<br />
I click on Review recent activity, I have to verify my email, I do that, they&nbsp;send a code, I find and enter the code to review and go to:&nbsp;<br />

https://account.live.com/activity. Under devices it shows only the previous&nbsp;owners phone, the samsung and I cannot delete it.<br />
<br />
How do I remove someone else's phone from my Microsoft.com account??<br />
<br />
How do I fix this?<br />

            You should be able to delete a phone from your Microsoft account on account.microsoft.com, but the issue is, does the previous owner of the Samsung has the same Microsoft account on his phone? And is his Samsung a Windows Phone? You might need to use a
 different Microsoft account on your new phone to definitively&nbsp;sort this out.

<p>your problem has nothing to do with this thread. you're not even using the same operating system or accounts. raise your issue (whatever it is) on an iPhone forum.</p>

 is of no importance to me. I need to know how to delete this other person's Samsung 'device' from MY Microsoft.com 'Device List'. It is not my phone nor has it ever been. I find it strange that it was placed there. I came to this forum looking for sincere
 answers and help getting this done. Please, if you are going to be rude please refrain from commenting. Thank you.

<p>it seems like you don't understand how internet forums work. I was replying to someone else who posted in this thread, not you. There's even the quote of the other person's post which you clearly didn't read.

            Yes, I read it. In fact I created it. That is one of my other email accounts. Sent from my iPhone. Maybe it is 'you' who could use a refresher on Internet Forum capabilities? Anyway, I don't want to squabble over semantics, I don't have time for that.
 I still do not see any useful information coming from you on this matter... Do you know how I can delete this other person's Samsung phone from 'my' Microsoft.com account Device List? thx

            <p>My issue was:</p>
<p>
I go to Devices, click: remove phone, I am taken to a new page that says:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Remove your phone<br />
Once you remove your phone:<br />
You won't be able to use Find My Phone<br />
You won't see it here anymore<br />
If you lost your phone, erase it using Find My Phone before you remove it.<br />
I'm ready to remove this device: SAMSUNG SGH-i917<br />
Cancel &nbsp;Remove<br />
<br />
Options are:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check box for I'm ready to remove this device, which I check<br />
Cancel or<br />
Remove<br />
<br />
I click Remove, it says "removing phone..." briefly and am taken to yet&nbsp;another page that says:<br />
<br />
Almost done! Now, reset your phone.<br />
We removed your phone at 9/4/2015, 3:49:57 PM.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To reset your phone:<br />
In the App list on your phone, tap Settings<br />
Under System, tap About, and then tap Reset your phone<br />
Back to Devices<br />
<br />
Options are:<br />
<br />
Back to Devices<br />
<br />
I click&nbsp;Back to Devices&nbsp;and the Samsung phone (which isn't mine and never has&nbsp;been) was still there. Update: I tried this again just now and it worked. The other person's phone is now removed from my Microsoft.com account. Thank you to anyone who made an effort
 in assisting me (Error code fffffcd1). Problem solved. Good bye...

<h2>            How can I fix my Outlook when OST file is corrupted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Outlook 2013 community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bit of an issue. After having closed down Outlook (with no problem) and shutting down my COmputer before the Easter holiday today I have come back today to find that when I try to open Outlook it tells me that there is a problem with my OST file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After then having spent 1.5 hours on hold being transfered from one support team to the next with everyone telling me that they are not in charge but they are going to transfer on etc until I was cut off without warning I tried this &nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That did not work. When I deleted the file and tried to open Outlook it now asks me for my Exchange server Password which I type in and press enter. I then get a 'Microsoft Outlook has stopped working' window with a green bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df2f9a4d-0fa2-488e-945a-c18288c4c40d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It then tells me the below:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9794e117-bd61-4825-896e-c02ad1340da9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open Outlook again it asks me if I want to start in safe mode. If I say Yes Or No I get told 'The File (MyOSTFile.ost) cannot be opened' When I click OK &nbsp;I get the below message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do not know what to do. Can someone please suggest a solution as I desperatly need my Outlook to work, now. I can access it via my Office 365 login but I can not do everything there that i need to use my Outlook for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a quick info concerning my Computer:</p>

            <p>Considering that you are using an Office 365 hosted Exchange mailbox, it might be best to start with a new mail profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a new mail profile via the Mail applet in Control Panel. Setting up your account can be done via Auto Account Setup. Also make sure that you set the option to always start Outlook with the new mail profile or to prompt you for which profile
 to be used when testing it with a new mail profile.</p>

            <p>Hi Roady</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you, I am trying your solution however it does not allow me to setup the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Mail and add a new account I add all of my information correctly however it can not find my exchange server. I tried to copy and paste the mail server ID from one of my colleagues Outlook and insert it manually and it then tells me that 'The
 connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then opens another window to check my details which I did. It then shows me the below window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/588d0d30-55e4-4a6d-996c-65d27c3ef588" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if that is meant to happen, but I still cannot access Outlook on my Computer but online.&nbsp;</p>

            Don't copy over the server details or configure it manually but use Auto Account Setup instead. So you only need to supply your name, email address and password and your settings should be found automatically.

            HI Roady - thanks for the advise but that is what I am doing. It then tells me the certificate can not be verified and if I want to use (Yes) and then it tells me it can not reach the server (encrypted) which it can't. It then tries unencrypted which doesn't
 work either and it then asks me to do it manually which is why I tried to do it manually.&nbsp;

            <p>Then it sounds like there is an issue with AutoDiscover for your domain or you have some other issues with trying to reach it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start troubleshooting; Your administrator should be able to verify whether all the required DNS records for their domain are still in place. Where they should be pointing to depends on whether your are using Exchange on premises, in the cloud or in a
 hybrid configuration.</p>

    <title>Alternatives to Nokia PC Suite&#63; &#91;N82&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avoelp---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternatives to Nokia PC Suite&#63; &#91;N82&#93;</h2>
                    Nokia's PC Suite is too "fat" for my personal taste - it offers tons of features that I will never use, and on the other hand there are some features that are essential to me, which have not been implemented. Therefore am looking for an alternative software
 package for my Nokia N82 (in connection with a PC running under Windows XP). The software should be able to do the following:<br />
<br />
- Exchange files between the N82 and the PC<br />
<br />
- Perform automatic synchronization between the N82 and MS Outlook on the PC (calender, contacts, tasks) accoding to a user defined schedule<br />
<br />
- Write SMS messages on the PC and send them through the moblie<br />
<br />
- Not a must, but a nice to have feature would be the capability to manage phone numbers stored on the N82's SIM card<br />
<br />
Which programs can be recommended for this?<br />
<br />
I want to use my N82 with a notebook pc that is equipped with Bluetooth and also with my desktop PC using the Nokia CA-101 USB data cable that came with the N82. I think that I won't need any N82 specific drivers for Bluetooth communication (right?), but is
 it possible to install the driver required for the USB data cable without having to install the entire Nokia PC Suite?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Andreas

            Are you using the N series PC suite that's supplied with the phone or the proper
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PC suite</a>? If you don't like one try the other.<br />
<br />
To write SMS messages you need PC suite or the new <a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/communicationcenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Communication Centre</a>. The communication centre is set to replace several of PC suite's applications in future versions. Not sure if this program can manage sim contacts or not.<br />
<br />
File transfers can be handled easily by bluetooth without pc suite installed. You can do transfers with the cable without PC suite but you have less control.<br />
<br />
Synchronizing can be done using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SyncML</a> but can be tricky to set up.<br />
<br />
The only full alternative to nokia's PC suite is <a href="http://www.oxygensoftware.com/en/products/symbian/opm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Oxygen Phone Manager II</a> but it's not free.

    <title>Installing Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpoti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 with IE9.&nbsp; I want to upgrade&nbsp;to IE11.&nbsp; Two questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I download IE 11 I get two files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EIE11_EN-US_WOL_WIN764.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE11-Windows6.1.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to run both?&nbsp; If so, in which order?&nbsp; Also, should I delete IE9 first?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; While trying to figure out the above and poking around the uSoft website,&nbsp;I read that first IE10 must be installed and then IE11.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm having a hard time finding IE10.&nbsp; All I'm seeing is updates for IE10 on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Do&nbsp;I really have to install IE10 first?&nbsp; If so, what's the link for the IE10 install file(s)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why I haven't seen upgrades for IE9 to newer versions in Windows Update.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I've seen them in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be appreciated.</p>
