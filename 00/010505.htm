<h2>            How to prevent Send&#47;Receive All Folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm working for a new company and I had to temporarily use my personal laptop to send/receive email using Outlook. I received a new laptop from my employer and proceeded to transfer files (no problem there) and my Outlook pst file. I had some problems
 during the set up of Outlook but finally got it working...most of it anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right now, my main problem is this. With my old laptop, as far as I know, only the Inbox was receiving and only the Outbox was sending. Now, with the new laptop, when it comes time to send/receive email, ALL the folders are being updated! It takes several
 minutes for it to finish and sometimes even hangs up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />#1 - I had some problems during the set up of Outlook but finally got it working...most of it anyway.
<br />#2 - Right now, my main problem is this. With my old laptop, as far as I know, only the Inbox was receiving and only the Outbox was sending.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - What problems exactly did you encounter out of curiouslty?
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - What you're describing is an account configured as a POP3 account where only the &lt;Inbox&gt; is downloaded from the server. 
<br />
<br />a) How many email accounts are configured?
<br />b) How were these accounts configured (POP3, Imap, Exchange etc)? More specifically, in comparison to how everything is configured on your laptop?
<br />c) If you have multiple POP3 accounts - would it be correct that each POP3 account was configured with it's own &lt;Inbox&gt; whereas on the Personal computer, all POP3 accounts are configured to use the same &lt;Inbox&gt; folder?

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>It was Outlook 2013 in my personal laptop and 2016 in the company laptop. As far as I could see, there isn't much difference between the two but you probably know more than I do. (",)</p>

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>It was a bit of stupidity really. When I copied the pst file to the new laptop, I discovered that almost all the folders were empty. Apparently, my folders were not saved to the pst file. I went back to my old laptop and tried to configure it so that folders
 would be saved. I made a few more mistakes and lost a folder or two but I got most of them in the pst file. Unfortunately, Outlook is now sending/receiving on all the folders, which wasn't the case before. I can't tell what I did wrong or changed. (",)</p>

<br />I went back to my old laptop and tried to configure it so that folders 
<br />would be saved. 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following details
<br />
<br />#1 - Type (POP3, IMAP etc) of account these folders belonged to on the old computer?
<br />#2 - Version of Outlook used on the old computer? 
<br />#3 - Version of Outlook used on the new computer?
<br />#4 - What steps you followed on the new computer - specifically, did you just copy and open the newly created PST file from the old computer on the new computer or did you "import" things?
<br />
<br />Something is not making sense with the description since no folders in a PST file would sync with the server if using Outlook '2013 or later. If using Outlook '2010 and the account was configured as POP3 then additional folders wouldn't sync, If using Outlook '2010, the only way additional folders would sync would be if the account was configured as IMAP but that shouldn't require anything being copied from the old computer in terms of email folders.

<p>Okay, we're getting somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old laptop used POP3 while the new one is using IMAP (I don't remember setting that one). If I change to POP3, what else can I expect to be different? I still want the option to synchronize the folders but I want to do it manually.</p>

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not much of an Outlook user. I only used it because my company required it. I'm still exploring its functions and capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old laptop used POP3 while the new one is using IMAP (just found that out). The old version was 2013, while the new one is 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My memory isn't as good as it used to be but I first first archived the old Outlook thinking it would save all the folders. It didn't but then I found a checkbox that said, "include items with "Do not AutoArchive" checked". Apparently, I had neglected to
 set all the folders to archive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After archiving, I copied the pst file to the new laptop and checked. It still wasn't loading all the folders. I tried exporting but all that did was open another account (now I had two accounts with the same name). So, I did what any normal, ignorant guy
 with some knowledge would do. I copied the contents of the second account into the first account. Then I closed the second account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, things look as they did before (as far as I could remember) but now all the folders are going through the send/receive process every time the update is triggered (which I set to five minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that I may not be making sense in everything since I can't remember everything I did and in exactly what way.</p>

<br />

<br />

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - That certainly explains a lot 
<br />
<br />Re: #2 &amp; 3 - That also explains what's going on with the new computer
<br />
<br />With that, a quick review of the difference between POP3 and IMAP. An email account configured using POP3, ONLY the &lt;Inbox&gt; gets downloaded in a one-time one-direction process. With IMAP, under normal circumstances. all email folders in the IMAP folder tree are sync'd bi-directionally which will happen each time Outlook (any email client to be accurate) connects to the account. This allows any device connected to the email account using IMAP to share the same data which 
<br />may not be something you're looking for.
<br />
<br />The reason all folders are going thru the sync process now is that you copied the data from the PST file into the IMAP folder tree (an OST data file) .
<br />
<br />The question becomes, what do you really want on the new computer - POP or IMAP? 
<br />
<br />&lt;IF&gt; you just want things to be the same as they were then 
<br />
<br />#1 - With Outlook closed, start the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app
<br />#2 - Create a &lt;new&gt; Outlook profile and &lt;manually&gt; configure the email account. 
<br />
<br />How to create profile and set up an e-mail account in Outlook
<br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</a>
<br />
<br />Do this by clicking on &lt;Advanced Options&gt; and checking the box for &lt;Let me setup up my account manually
<br />
<br />#3 - During the process, make sure you select using an existing PST file instead of letting Outlook create a new one. Use the PST file where you archived everything to with the following caveat - &lt;IF&gt; in the archive process you did NOT delete anything from the source folders (i.e. delete anything over 1 yr old etc) - then make 
<br />sure you use the original PST file being used by the POP account in OL'2013
<br />
<br />#4 - Start Outlook and you should be good to go subject to the things you'll need to check as to determine any additional steps to take. 
<br />
<br />Rather then go into an encyclopedic explanation for all the possible combinations and permutations in terms of what to do using IMAP etc - will wait for your answer in terms of which you want with '2013 &amp; '2016. The only reason that this has become slightly more messy is because I don't know exactly what was archived etc - otherwise things would have been much simpler.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just a second. This is a company laptop and it was pre-loaded and pre-configured before it got to me. When I first opened Outlook, it was empty so I copied the pst file from the old laptop, hoping to get my old emails into the new one. This being the
 case, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to make a new account. I'll have to clear this up with management.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is there any way to revert to POP3 after IMAP has been configured? Scratch that, I'm not sure if I'd be allowed to do that either.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, thanks for all the help. If I get any updates, I'll come back here and post it.</p>

<h2>            Orginal HDD not working after intalling Win 10 in other HDD bay</h2>
                    <p>So I recently installed Windows 10 beta (10041) on a brand new&nbsp;HDD that I installed in my extra laptop bay. It was working fine for a few days. However, my original HDD that has Win7 wanted to do a startup repair when I went to load it up. Now the startup
 repair says it can't repair this computer. This leads me to believe it's possibly a hardware failure (praying it's not). I pulled some data from my windows 7 drive and moved it over to Win 10 HDD. It's possible&nbsp;this could have damaged it some how? Now all
 I have is an unstable ver of Windows 10 as my main PC. </p>
<p>

            <p>As far as I know there is no control over partitioning in setup yet and what is changed in the boot files. I was only successful with single drive systems and I don't use 'production' systems to test Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it was no problem adding the original hd to one of my test systems again after setup. But if there are important files on it, better unplug before major updates. 10049 for example is a big build (about 2.5GB for 32bit systems) and massages your hd
 for a while without any messages or user access. I don't trust what I can't control.</p>

<h2>            Converting local time to Greenwich Mean Time &#40;UTC&#41; in Access</h2>
                    <p>Although there are some postings on converting the opposite in Excel which could be possibly applicable for Access, they don't take into account that from the central time zone, where I am, it is a five hour difference when it's Daylight Savings Time (CDT),
 but a six hour difference when it Central Standard Time (CST).&nbsp; Is there a way to create a function that would automatically know that you need to add 5 hours or 6 hours to my local time (central) to get to UTC, depending on the current date?</p>

            On second thoughts, while the GetUTC function will work universally to get the current UTC time, the expression to convert a date/time value would only do so correctly if the current date/time and the date/time to be converted are both subject to daylight
 saving time, or are both standard time.&nbsp; The Windows API includes a GetTimeZoneInformation function which should be able to deal with that.&nbsp; I'll have to take a look at Tom's link to see if it handles this.

    <title>Hidden Section Break&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pa311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hidden Section Break&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning All,</p>
<p>I was asked to resolve an issue with a Word 2010 document, as follows:</p>
<p>Originally the document had a next page section break at the end of each and every page.&nbsp; I removed them all, replacing them with page breaks using Find and Replace.&nbsp; I then put a section break at the end of page 2, the back of the cover page and set up
 different odd and even pages, so&nbsp;I could alternate the page number to the outside of each page, on the left of even pages and the right on odd pages in the footer.&nbsp; As I was moving through the document applying styles as I went I notice that I was in section
 3 and the page numbering had gotten messed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;There should only be 2 sections.&nbsp; Lo and behold, between page 46 and 47 is a change of section and the misnumbering of pages begins.&nbsp; It goes from page 46 to page 19.&nbsp; Show hide button on, show hide button off,
 I do not see the section break and Find does not detect it either.&nbsp;The Hidden check box&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Font dialog box is unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any suggestions on how to correct this will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

            <p>Hi AakashRaje_10,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further assist you with your enquiry, I would like to ask you to specify the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exactly would you like to see? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mention most apps have push notifcations built in. Also you can setup your phone to notify you once a phone update is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc A.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to "add" someone to this fabled list in order to have a business conversation. Some directions on here say go to "settings"... Not on desktop; Doesnt exist.</p>
<p>On mobile a settings tab is accessible and it allows you to choose how contacts will be added, but gives NO OPTION to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extremely un-intuitive this site.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you are&nbsp;signed in on the Skype&nbsp;website. You&nbsp;have to download the application to start adding contacts.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;go&nbsp;<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> to download the
 application. You can select which device you'll be using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Skype is installed, it should give you the option to enter your Skype account and password. See image below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz545065.vo.msecnd.net%2fskype-faq-media%2ffaq_content%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa34438%2ffa34438_p.png" height="305" width="416" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just sign in using your email address or Skype username and follow the instructions. Select the add contact icon or click directly in the search text box and type the name, Skype name or email of the person you want to add. Click&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa3281%2ffa3281_8.png" />&nbsp;Search

                    I want to tell Excel 2003 that if the cell contains a Hyperlink then put 1, otherwise put 0.<br />
Something like IF (B1 = Hyperlink, 1,0)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try this non macro approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Suppose data is in range B16:B18</p>
<p>2. Copy B16:B18 and paste it in cell C16</p>
<p>3. Select C16:C18 and press Ctrl+F and click on Options</p>
<p>4. Ensure that the Find what box is blank</p>
<p>5. Under the Format drop down button, click on the "Choose format from cell" option</p>
<p>6. With the mouse now becoming a dipper symbol, select the first hyperlinked cell in range C16:C18</p>
<p>7. Click on Find All.&nbsp; In the white space at the bottom of the Find box, the hyperlinked cells should appear</p>
<p>8. Press Ctrl+A. The hyperlinked cells in range A16:C18 will get selected</p>
<p>9. With the hyperlinked cells selected, enter 1 and then press Ctrl+Enter</p>
<p>10. Repeat steps&nbsp;3 to 9 for putting zero in non hyperlinked cells.&nbsp; The only difference will be in step 6 and 9.&nbsp; In step 6, select the first non hyperlinked cell.&nbsp; In step 8, enter 0 and then press Ctrl+Enter</p>
<p>11. Enter 1 in any blank cell and copy it</p>
<p>12. Select C16:C18 and go to Edit &gt; Paste Speical &gt; Multiply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scheduled clean up is set up before it can take effect on your email.<span>&nbsp; </span>
By default it is set to delete after 10 days or move after 10 days but you have the option to make it 30,60 or 90 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the scheduled cleanup for an email by opening the email then clicking the schedule cleanup on the Sweep tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default it can only be set by 10,30,60 and 90 days allocation and deleted emails will go into your deleted folder. You can delete the email there to purge it out of the system after the 5 day recovery window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can leave the email as it is no need to set up a no scheduled clean up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons why you're unable to update your app. Are you seeing any error messages or codes? When did the issue start? Does performing a soft reset made any differences? Press and hold
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> until the phone vibrates and restart. </p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Cannot sync Verizon HTC Touch Pro 2 to PC running XP3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot sync Verizon HTC Touch Pro 2 to PC running XP3</h2>
                    I'm new to the smartphone scene.&nbsp; Want to sync data between my HTC Touch Pro 2 and my PC running XP3, via USB cable, to install apps and sync data.<br />
Been at it for 15 hours today.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
From initial startup (phone) and Software installation (PC), I receive the following:<br />
<br />
From PDA - need to install ActiveSync software on PC<br />
From PC&nbsp; - (No Partnerships, Not connected)<br />
<br />
In the "GET CONNECTED" dialog box I see "Your device was not detected".<br />
Below that, I see "USB is available"<br />
Under the CONNECTIONS SETTINGS (PC software), I selected "Allow USB Connections".<br />
Just below that when I select "Allow connections to one of the following", I get "No Comm Ports found".
<br />
<br />
I ran a diagnostic tool which indicated 1) I need Outlook 2007 installed on the PC (don't want it) 2) I need to connect a device<br />
I want to transfer data, not contacts or email.<br />
<br />
My PDA is set for USB to PC "Disk Drive (faster file transfer)".&nbsp; Nothing else is selected.<br />
OS Build # is ......2.1.6.5<br />
<br />
In MY COMPUTER (PC), I can see a drive letter for the SDcard in the PDA.<br />
In MY COMPUTER (PC), I can see an icon "Mobile Device".<br />
Am able to transfer data to and from the SD card <br />
WMPlayer sync works fine with the SD card.<br />
<br />
I've over the past week, I've tried the various steps included in the help sections of ActiveSync software and other sites.<br />
<br />
Today, I saved my contacts to the SIM Card and did a hard reset, removed and re-installed PC software and get the same exact problem.<br />
Tried disabling windows firewall too.<br />
<br />
I also tried to do a Windows Update and have not been able to get a connection with the server.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is this enough detail?&nbsp; Can someone point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />

<p>Hello. A few questions:</p>
<p>1. What did you choose as sync options? If you don't want to sync Outlook data, contacts/calendar/tasks/notes should not be checked on PC or TP2. You should choose "files" and a sync file folder should have been created on the desktop.</p>
<p>2. You seem to have some connectivity if you can explore the SD card. Can you explore the device as well?</p>
<p>3. You should be able to connect to Windows Update with an active internet connection. Have you run a malware scan lately?</p>
<p>4. When you initially connected the device USB, did you hear a connection sound and did the driver install wizard come up and install the phone drivers? Can you see the phone drivers installed with the device connected in Device Manager (usually in network
 adapter, mobile devices, or USB controller nodes)?</p>
<p>5. Not sure about the setting "disk drive" in USB to PC. You might want to try without that checked.</p>

<h2>            Exploit&#58;JS&#47;MS09002.C Continuously Detected Upon Restart</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials reports finding a virus Exploit:JS/MS09002.C with the details:<br />
<br />
Category: Exploit<br />
<br />
Description: This program is dangerous and exploits the computer on which it is run.<br />
<br />
Recommendation: Remove this software immediately.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials detected programs that may compromise your privacy or damage your computer. You can still access the files that these programs use without removing them (not recommended). To access these files, select the 'Allow' action and click
 'Apply actions'. If this option is not available, log on as administrator or ask the local administrator for help.<br />
<br />
Items: <br />
file:C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\tmp.edb<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Security Essentials claims to remove the problem, and tells me I must restart my computer to complete the removal. Upon restarting, Security Essentials once again detects the virus, in the same file, and the cycle of restarts/detections continues. I'm running
 Windows 7, and if there's any other information I can provide feel free to ask, would really appreciate some help.

            This is Java Script Exploit which mean this is a vunerability that if you visit a website that contain this code then it code damage you or someone could gain access to your PC. The vulnerability has been resolved in Windows update , look at this

<br />
As you said after you remove this it will come up, I guess that you might have dropper in your PC or downloader that check the location and if the threat is not there then it will put it. In this case, try to upgrade MSE, then update MSE and run full system
 scan and remove everything.<br />
<br />
