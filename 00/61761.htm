<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;Home&#41; Action Centre - How can I view the notifications that I have already read&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just read a notification from Windows 10 in the Action Centre. After I read &nbsp;it, I closed the Notification Centre. I now need to read that notification again, but Action Centre is not showing it any more - it says that there are no new notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I see the list of all the notifications, regardless of whether I have already read them or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to read the already dismissed notifications received through Action Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>Action Center</em> is split into two major sections: <em>Notifications</em> and
<em>Quick Actions.</em></p>
<p>Based on the user actions there are two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dismiss the notification (clears the action)</li><li>Select the notification (respond to the action)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once one of these interactions takes place,&nbsp;the action are no longer displayed. Also, no history is maintained of these notifications and also cannot be retrieved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, coming back to the issue, if it is a critical notification, and you have dismissed the same without taking any action, Windows will prompt you again at some point in future even if you clear it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, If you concern is of a system level, I would recommend looking into the System logs to look for the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view activities in Windows, I suggest you to open the Event Viewer. To do so, follow the below steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to the Control Panel and choose to click on the
<strong><span>Administrative Tools</span></strong> icon.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The above action will open up a new window of the Administrative Tools where you will see the
<strong><span>Event Viewer</span></strong><span>.</span></span></span><span> </span>
</li></ul>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information holds good. If you need further assistance, feel free to write tous again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Hang, Copy files feature very, very, verrry slow, Windows update hangs&#33;&#33;&#33; Software Compatibility issues.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I know many of us are not alone with the issues mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone or Microsoft offered a definitive fix for the above mentioned?</p>
<p>I'm tired of the endless searches which I'm very good at to find fixes, I would think Microsoft or a Microsoft Tech would please point us to a central "Windows Fix" location for these type of issues.</p>
<p>It seems to me different techs offer there own version of a <em>possible</em> solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if Microsoft would announce a fix is coming soon for certain bugs, I understand they need to present a healthy and infallible Business image but I think Microsoft could rule the world much better if they just simply would be very open and
 honest and say they are working on improvements to there newest operating system which is cool, but is going through growing pains which is only natural.</p>
<p>The thing is Im spending an awful lot of time trying to fix issues so I can get back to being productive.</p>
<p>Some drivers that worked with Windows 7 should work with Windows 10, for example The Autodesk version 2013 products I rely on are not functioning now that I went from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Its not fair that I cant roll back to Windows 7 after 30 Days in order to use my software, especially since Microsoft is not making Windows 10 fully compatible.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Joe</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask what is the storage space of your Hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a clean Boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software
 conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>

    <title>Network Firewall turns itself off after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markoce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Firewall turns itself off after reboot</h2>
                    <p>I own Norton 360 Premier Edition and use their firewall, but never disable it. One day, I rebooted my computer and I saw that dreaded flag with a red "X". I clicked on it and it said "Windows firewall and Norton 360 Premier Edition are both turned off."
 This was weird because I never touch my firewall like I said. When I clicked on "Turn Norton 360 Premier Edition on", the screen disappears like it should but the red "X" never goes away. I believe the Norton firewall is on and working (without Windows recognizing)
 because when I go into the app, I cannot manually turn the firewall on because IT SAYS IT IS ALREADY ON. I figured out a way to make the red "X" disappear until the next reboot. What I do is turn the Norton firewall off manually, go back in to my control panel
 action center and click on "turn on Norton 360 Premier Edition", then the red "X" goes away. The reason why I am asking this question is that I am not sure if my homemade solution fixes the firewall problem or not (I do not reboot my system often so I am ok
 with making the "x" go away). Please help. I currently run Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and God bless!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the trouble. I am Vineeth and I am from the Norton Support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've seen this problem a few times. This is a case where the Action center incorrectly reports that the firewall is turned off. You do not have to worry about it as long as your Norton product reports "protected" or "Secure" with a Green tick.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However; I suggest you go through this KB article: <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v81754387_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            games running in safe mode</h2>
                    Im running 64 bit windows 7 and Im trying to use a couple older Win XP games, but for whatever reason they're (and they alone) are being run in safe mode by 7. I have DX 9 installed, drivers are up to date, its just these two games running in safe mode
 nothing else&nbsp;and this pc is a rig I built last fall so it should be smoking them so I know its not doing this as a lack of performance.&nbsp; Any ideas why its safemoding them and how to unsafe mode them? I'll settle for just getting them out of safe mode if no
 one has any ideas why its doing it.

    <title>Synaptics Control Panel Missing From Mouse Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberttucker3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics Control Panel Missing From Mouse Settings</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop which is branded as Zoostorm but it appears to be more of a pseudonym because everything online and under the hood, it is referred to as a Clevo W650. When I got the device, it had multi touch capabilities like it is supposed to have which
 were editable via the Synaptics Control Panel in the Built in Windows Mouse settings program which is located in an additional tab at the top called "Device Settings" with the Synaptics logo to the left of it. Since I replaced the internal HDD with an SSD
 (and fresh installing Windows 10 rather than copying it all over), that option isn't located in the mouse settings menu and appears that it is inaccessible. I have installed and repeatedly reinstalled the Synaptic touch pad drivers which I had requested directly
 from the manufactures of the laptop but the "Device Settings" tab still does not appear. It is noted in the info of my touchpad that Scrybe isn't installed which I believe to be what grants touchpads with the multitouch features. Despite this, the default
 multi-touch settings are in effect and some multi-touch features work but still, they are not able to be customised. Is there any advice as to how I can access the Synaptics Control Panel or install Scrybe by supplying a download link to its installer?</p>
<p>Hardware ID (Of the touchpad): ACPI\VEN_SYN&amp;DEV_1218</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The customization of your touchpad should be configured by your device manufacturer. A quick research tells me that Scrybe seemed to be a gesture software for touchpads. A few tech blogs reviewed this product. These blogs were written some time ago and I
 can't seem to find a valid website for the software. It might be best to contact your device manufacturer for further assistance.</p>

            Boot into Safe Mode then try deleting from there:
<br />
<br />Log out and go to the sign in screen.
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Startup Settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Try deleting the file again using Disk Cleanup.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, see how you can use TreeSize to find and delete huge hidden files:

    <title>Take advantage of Game Pass offer with a debt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ozielgarza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Take advantage of Game Pass offer with a debt</h2>
                    Currently there is a 3 month Game Pass offer for $139 MX and I want to buy but I can not get it because there is a debt of $139 MX for 1 month for not disabling the renovation, my question is: If I pay the debt and buy the subscription can cancel the subscription
 request a&nbsp; Refund and then buy the offer?

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into a dead end there. You should be able to take full advantage of the promotion once that balance has been paid off,&nbsp; go ahead and

            So if I pay the debt is like renewing the subscription? Or if I pay the debt of $139 will have to pay another $139 to take advantage of the promotion?

    <title>Windows Movie Maker substitute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laniebelle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker substitute</h2>
                    I use Windows 10.&nbsp; There is no topic for my question.&nbsp; If I'm in the wrong place, please suggest the appropriate topic. &nbsp; A couple days ago, Windows Live Movie Maker worked.&nbsp; Today it doesn't, so I updated to Movie Maker 12. It doesn't work either.&nbsp; When
 I save a video I've made (sometimes all I've done is rotated right), the saved video won't work right.&nbsp; Says not a correct file type or codec.&nbsp; Am I doing anything wrong?&nbsp; Or should I get a different movie maker for Windows 10?&nbsp; Can you suggest a couple good
 free ones?&nbsp; I heard the VLC was good, but it only plays videos.&nbsp; I want a video editor and movie maker like the old Windows movie maker.&nbsp; Thank you.

            I'm adding to the above reply. &nbsp;I get the sound on any new movie I make, but Windows Media Player won't play any of my old videos/movies that I made. &nbsp;this is what it says "Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file
 type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file." &nbsp;I have to use a different program to play the video.

<h2>            Mouse Scrolling Down Goes Up Slightly</h2>
                    
<p>Have just purchases two new Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 for two different computers. On both computers (Windows 7 x64, all current updates), when scrolling down using the wheel, the page will scroll up a couple of lines every so often as you go down. This
 seems to happen in all applications - IE8, Word, Outlook, etc.</p>
<p>I've tried the default Windows 7 drivers and the latest IntelliPoint software (7.10.344.0) but the problem is the same.</p>
<p>I used the Microsoft Mouse Diagnostics to check and if I monitor the "Last Z value", I see it goes to -30 (as it should) as I'm scrolling down and every so often it will change to 60 and the page will jump up slightly before continuing down.</p>
<p>This is driving me crazy, can anybody help?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Samhrutha but no luck with your suggestions. I haven't had a chance to try&nbsp;the mouse&nbsp;on anything other than Windows 7 x64 but will endevour to do so.</p>
<p>One thing I have discovered it that the problem is the same when scrolling up - every so often it jumps back down a few lines.</p>
<p>I've also tried other Microsoft mice and they work fine. Seems to be something with the Wireless Mouse 5000 and/or Windows 7 x64.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
</span></span><span><span>CrossBolt,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To narrow down on the issue you may try to plug in the mouse to another computer. You may even try to reduce the hardware

<p>Hi Samhrutha,</p>
<p>Tried to follow your instructions but the Change Settings button is greyed out. I have a nVidia GeForce 9600 GT video card installed (with the latest drivers) which may be taking control. I looked through the nVidia control panel but could not&nbsp;find anything
 that sounded like it might be related to hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>Currently, I have uninstalled the IntelliPoint software and set the number of scroll lines to 3. The problem still exists but is less noticeable than before and consequently less annoying.</p>
<p>If I reduce the number of scroll lines to 1, the problem is hardly noticable at all but then wheel scrolling is too slow for my liking.</p>
<p>If I choose the One Screen at a Time option, the problem seems to disappear but then scrolling is too fast.</p>
<p>I can't win. :-)</p>
<p>I'll keep trying things and post here if I manage to solve it.</p>

<p>Hi! CrossBolt,</p>
<p>Same problem... Just upsetting! I cant figure it out either. I tried all the same things as you. I am on Windows XP and its all the same problems. I work with alot of acounting programs that need scrolling so I think I am going to just buy a differant mouse.
 :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Just an FYI, I uninstalled the Mouse Driver and changed the XP standard setttings to One Screen at a Time option and sped up the scrolling speed, then I went back and installed the driver and also modified the scrolling speed. It seemed to have done the trick...
 for now. Hope that helps.

<h2>            Importing from US to UK</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to know if I buy a Blu-ray of the price £18+ do I pay any custom tax fees?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Yes, I did read on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs website that anything over £15 would have a fee but I've read that people who've spent £20 or to even £30 haven't had these kind of issues so I'm wondering.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Blu-rays (anime genre) that I'm after aren't available in UK and are Region B compatible so I want to own them and watch.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I know for games you should have no problem getting them to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I do believe Blue Rays are region coded but someone who knows more about it should be able to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for tax stuff... if you are importing for yourself and customs "check" your order you might face some stiff levvies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if you order something as a "Gift" from abroad I believe the VAT is waived?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double check.</p>

<p>You should try contacting the seller of possible. I have had to do this before with buying Blu-Ray films as it can vary across titles. If you're desperate you could invest in a region free Blu-Ray player if such a thing exists.</p>

<p>As for tax stuff, which is the actual topic in hand... I believe you have to pay when the value of the purchase is $24 or more. I once bought to Pokemon Gym Badges from the US and had to pay a fairly hefty customs charge. I believe it came to around £13
 on top of the purchase and shipping costs and I had to make a trip to the Post Office to get it sorted.</p>

<p>Paying customs tax is a lottery, sometimes you will be lucky and not get charged while other times not so lucky and get charged. If the item is marked &nbsp;as a gift then most often then not you won't get charged import tax. I have been importing for years with
 things from as litlle as £5 up to hundreds of pounds, and only once been charged import tax and thas was mainly due to UPS declairing it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Most places I use though always mark the item as Gift. </p>

<p>You will also need a new PSU(UK 240v), or if you intend to use the US PSU a step down transformer to convert the UK 240v to US 120v (if that is the rating of the US PSU).</p>

            I had the same problem. Turns out Google considers the Mail app and Outlook as "Less Secure Apps." Don't really know why but you have to turn it off for it to be able to sync.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm new to Microsoft Community, and i have a same problem but more uncomfortable than this situation</p>
<p>At the 3 last steps in your guidance, i have make its way clearly and correctly&nbsp; like what you said, i want to get access to my Gmail via Email due to some works from Visual Studio, and it keeps replying to me when i typed my 2 Gmail's accounts, with passwords
 and verify digit codes: "We cannot create your account..." alongside with an error code 0x80000b<br />
I came here, followed what you told us to do, but afterward, the Email said my current account need to update, while my Status checking for this account doesn't have anything!<br />
This is very frustrated and inconvenient for me, and i'm sure there must be a better solution for this, hope Microssoft pay attention to my complaint as soon as possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello l Alfa Mike l,</p><p><br /></p><p>Your VIP&nbsp;Boost to 4 stars required 875 NOK&nbsp;in eligible spending. Since game consumables&nbsp;are not eligible for MyVIP, and therefore not eligible for the VIP Boost offer, you were beneath the required spending to complete this offer.
This is mentioned in both our MyVIP&nbsp;FAQ:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What
content on the Xbox Store is eligible for MyVIP?</b></p>
<p>Normally,
most purchases for Xbox 360 and Xbox One from the Xbox Store qualify, including
full Games on Demand titles (excluding game pre-orders), arcade games, indie
games, game add-ons, game Season Passes, movies, TV shows, TV seasons, themes
and avatar items. In-game consumables, Xbox Live Gold memberships, Groove Music
Passes, Microsoft Movies &amp; TV Season Passes, and the purchase or redemption
of Microsoft Points or Xbox Gift Cards, still do not qualify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and
the FAQ&nbsp;for the offer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Which
content is eligible for this offer?</b></p>
<p>You
must spend at least $XX before tax on qualifying MyVIP content from the Xbox
Store and Microsoft Movies &amp; TV during the offer period. Most purchases for
Xbox 360 and Xbox One from the Xbox Store qualify, including full Games on
Demand titles (game pre-orders do NOT qualify), arcade games, indie games, game
add-ons, game season passes, themes, and avatar items. From Microsoft Movies
&amp; TV, qualifying content includes movies, TV shows, and TV seasons.
However, in-game consumables, Xbox Live Gold memberships, Groove Music Passes,
Microsoft Movies &amp; TV Season Passes, and the purchase or redemption of
Microsoft Points or Xbox Gift Cards do not qualify.</p>

                    I reinstalled my AutoCAD 2014 due to some WIndows 8.1 upgrade issues back then. After clicking the xforce keygen 64bit to activate my license, it disappears. And as I click and click, it just kept on disappearing from the Crack folder. I tried doing most
 of the solutions found on the internet like disabling my Norton firewall and antivirus, but unfortunately it did nothing. PLEASE HELP. I need to use my Autocad ASAP. =(((

                    I have toshiba laptop(not in really good condition) but it was working ok for me.now it isn't turning on .once started (power connected) its stays on till the chkdsk(which doesn't give any option to skip,starts directly) in next few seconds of chkdsk(not
 frozen) it turns &nbsp;off spontaneously. And thats about it its been a week n i can only see my laptop till the chkdsk part!P Please tell if i can skip this chkdsk somehow. It might start working again!!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are not able to switch on your PC as it stucks on the chkdsk part. I will certainly help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to start your PC into Safe mode referring to the link mentioned below and check if it starts:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about Safe Mode please refer to the link mentioned below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it starts in Safe Mode, Please proceed to Method 2 in order to cancel/skip chkdsk at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>To disable automatic desk checking at Windows startup, follow the step mentioned below:<br />
•&nbsp;Press Windows key + R<br />
•&nbsp;Type regedit and press Enter<br />
•&nbsp;Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager<br />
•&nbsp;In the right hand pane, double click BootExecute.<br />
The default value of the key is autocheck autochk *<br />
* means every drive is checked for consistency. Just add /K:C at the end before *. /K switch will disable autocheck on C: drive at Windows startup. So the final value should look like this:<br />
autocheck autochk /k:C *<br />
If you want to add more drives, the key should look like this: (disabling C and D drives)<br />
autocheck autochk /k:C /k:D *<br />
If you want to restore everything to default, just replace the key with the default one i.e.<br />
autocheck autochk *<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also follow the link given below and check if it is of any help.<br />

            <p>Quite possibly your hard drive is failing or has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to test the hard drive hardware by downloading and running the hard drive manufacturer's drive tester software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can not get your system into Windows, you will need to remove the drive and temporarily install it in an external drive housing to test it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If as you say, it is not in really good condition, this is a distinct possibility.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider purchase of a new 7200rpm rotating drive.&nbsp; They are not that expensive or difficult to install.&nbsp; Of course, you will then have to install Windows on it.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>This may mean that that there’s a problem with your Microsoft account. For example, the Microsoft account might have been deleted or blocked, or there may be a problem with the security information in the account.</p>
<div>
Solutions
<div>
<p><b>Solution 1: Verify that you are not signed with the old Microsoft account</b></p>
<p>To resolve this issue, verify that you are not signed in with the old Microsoft account on another device. For example, verify that you are not signed in with the old Microsoft account on your home computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>If you are signed in on another device, sign out and then try again to associate your profile with a different Microsoft account.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Verify the information for your Microsoft account</b></p>

</li><li>Note any error messages that are displayed. </li><li>After you resolve any errors, verify the information for your Microsoft account. For example, verify the billing information and the information in the
<b>Password and security info</b> section. </li><li>Sign out of your Microsoft account, and then sign in again. </li><li>Sign in to Xbox LIVE and try to download your profile again. </li></ol>

<p>Well that is typical Microsoft crap support right from the get-go.</p>
<p>We (I) get this message on my XBOX 360 when trying to sign in (have not signed in in over a year).</p>
<p>What the hell is " the old Microsoft account"? &nbsp;There is no old/new, its just my xbox account!</p>
<p>What the hell is a "Microsoft account" to begin with - is that the live.com account we were forced to create some time back? &nbsp;Is it tied to my hotmail account?</p>
<p>I'm signed in to xbox.com just fine right now. </p>
<p>In fact I signed into my xbox account just fine before I got that message.</p>
<p>I guess its cache clearing time. &lt;facepalm&gt; &nbsp; This is what a 'game box appliance' has devolved into - a PC with all the problems of a web browser? &lt;double-face-palm&gt;</p>
<p>This problem may also go back to basic brand misuse. &nbsp;I'm trying to download and use the Amazon Video app on the XBox 360. &nbsp;It say I need an XBox Live account -so thats what I'm trying to log into as requested. &nbsp;Well the issue may well be that what it REALLY
 should say is it requires an "XBox Live GOLD" account -which I don't have - and when logging in it sees I only have a SILVER account. &nbsp;If that is the problem then say GOLD when you ask for XBOX Live.</p>
<p>So here is the mess of 'microsoft/xbox' related account/brand/spaghetti that is causing a lot of this in my mind - they are/could be all interrelated ins some way and refereed to at different locations by different names, and maybe even mislabeled:</p>
<p>XBox account</p>
<p>XBox Live account</p>
<p>XBox Live Gold account</p>
<p>XBox Live Silver account</p>
<p>Live Account</p>
<p>Microsoft Account</p>
<p>Hotmail Account</p>
<p>live.xbox.com</p>
<p>xbox.live.com</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hello, here's a possible solution. Try creating a new Silver(Free) account for Xbox Live. Deleting your current one is not needed and will most likely not fix your problem. Try signing in to your new account, if you still get the error message try contacting
 Xbox Support. </p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition, I hope you don't mind typing the error message down or at least majority of it so the community can further assist you in this issue. However, I do highly recommend contacting support if this specific error message appears again after attempting
 my previous suggestion. I hope this information came in handy. Take care and I hope your problem gets resolved.

<h2>            How do I install an app visible on one user account only in windows 8</h2>
                    I have two accounts on windows 8. One for me and one for someone else<br />
only I have administrator privilege<br />
most of the apps that I install show up in both user accounts but I don't want this<br />
I want to install these apps only on my account<br />
the apps are not from windows store but other third party apps stored in my pc or on other media and do not have such option on installation.<br />
Some of them even don't have an option to install the app in some specific directory but are installed in C:/program files

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use your Administrative priveleges to restrict use of the apps after they are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open <strong>Program Files</strong> and locate the executable file<strong> (.exe)</strong>for the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right click</strong> the .exe file and select <strong>Propertie</strong>s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the bottom of that dialog, click the <strong>Change settings for all users</strong> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <strong>Privilege level</strong> section, select the <strong>Run this program as administrator</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click <strong>Apply/OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            left mouse click not working but I can left click drag</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been running this install for years now and just this week, windows started not functioning for my mouse left click.&nbsp; I can left click and drag to get a bounding box so I know the button is working but I can't left click on anything, even clicking
 on the start button does not bring up the start bar.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried a second mouse from a different manufacturer (new drivers were installed) with the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open the task manager (first mouse click does nothing, second left click then works and opens the task manager) then the mouse clicks function properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running Win 7 64bit AMD processor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Please answer the following question in context of this issue:<br />
Did you make any changes (hardware or software) to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
It could be due to some other non-Microsoft application or program causing this issue. It may also occur due to any changes in the settings for the mouse.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
You can follow the methods:<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You can refer to the link to run the troubleshooter:<br />
“<strong>Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems in Windows</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/help/mouse-touchpad-and-keyboard-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/help/mouse-touchpad-and-keyboard-problems-in-windows</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists, let’s check if you get the same issue when you boot the computer into safe mode. You can follow the steps:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong>You can refer to the link to boot the computer into safe mode:<br />
“<strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)”<br />
Follow the section “Safe mode</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
If the issue does not occur in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check for the application causing this issue. You can refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state and check if any other application or software is causing
 this issue:<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.<br />
“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong>”<br />
Follow the section “<strong>Windows 7 and Windows Vista</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting for section “Windows 7 and Windows Vista “of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Do let us know about the status of this issue.</div>

            Ok, the troubleshooting just came back with the error "Hardware changes might not have been detected" &nbsp;but no hardware has changed in quite a while except for the second mouse I tried after the problem started.
<div><br />
<div>In safemode the mouse seemed to work fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had autoupdate on and this is a list of updates that were applied during the time frame the problem appeared</div>
<div><br />
<div>Definition Update for Windows Defender KB915597 (Definition 1.149.1902.0)</div>
<div>Definition Update for Windows Defender KB915597 (Definition 1.149.1652.0)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using the clean boot instructions, the following 8 services make the mouse left click not work. &nbsp;If I enable any one of the 8, the problem comes back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Protected Storage</div>
<div>Quality Windows Audio Video Experience</div>
<div>Remote Access Auto Connection Manager</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
I would like to gather certain information related to this issue:<br />
Have you installed any third party security software on the computer?</div>
<div><br />
This issue could also occur due to Windows Firewall or any security software.</div>
<div><br />
You can follow the methods:<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable Windows Firewall and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Refer to the link to temporarily turn off Windows Firewall and try playing the game:<br />
Follow the section “<strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <strong>For Windows Firewall</strong>: You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from
 worms or hackers.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists, let’s temporarily disable any third party security software, if installed, on the computer and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Important Note</strong>: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
Do let us know with the status of this issue.<br />

I would suggest you to uninstall the updates and then check for the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Before uninstalling the updates, you can refer to the link to download the updates from the Microsoft website:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtowd.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/howtowd.aspx</a>
<div><br />
You can follow the steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
You can follow the steps to uninstall the update from Windows update:<br />
a) Type <strong>Windows update </strong>on the start screen and select settings on the charms bar.<br />
b) Click on <strong>View installed updates</strong>.<br />
c) Locate the updates KB915597 and KB915597 that were installed before the issue occurred and right click on the update icon.<br />
d) Select Uninstall and follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the updates.<br />
Check if you get the same issue while using the mouse. If there is no issue while using it, go to step 2.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to install the updates after placing the computer in clean boot state. Refer to the link to place the laptop in clean boot state:<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.<br />
“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8”<br />
Follow the section “Windows 8</strong>”<br />

<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
After restarting the computer in normal startup, check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
Do let us know about the status of this issue.</div>
