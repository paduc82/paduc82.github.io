            <p>Well, a few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The add-in is for Windows Excel, not for Mac Excel,</li><li>Re inserting image into Comments: The functionality, itself, manipulated by the add-in does not exist in Mac Excel 2016,</li><li>Even on a PC, the add-in still does not <em>display images</em> in cells. It inserts a
<em>link</em> to the image which displays as <em>text</em> in the cell. The developer uses very misleading terminology on their site.</li></ul>

<h2>            N95 - a few questions</h2>
                    Hi all, Newbie from the uk here :)<br />
<br />
Just got my N95 on Orange network, and have a few questions. (I have done some reading here already).<br />
<br />
First off is the updating of the phones's firmware, my phone is locked to orange, no problem but the software provided is telling me that there's no updates available. I'm running version 10.xx of the firmware so I know there is, but it's not letting me do
 it.<br />
From what I understand this is because of the orange-flavoured software installed and the phone being locked to the network.<br />
Is there a way around this without losing anything? I'd really like to update it as it's got a couple of bugs I noticed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, I was wondering what sort of stuff people have put on their phones, from what I can tell the symbian software is incredibly versatile and I'd like to use it to it's full potential, so are there any good software/programs/apps/games etc out there that
 you'd consider "essential" for a newbie like myself.<br />
<br />
Great phone I must say, very happy with it so far and look forward to getting the most from it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Stu.

            Hiya,<br />
<br />
There's no way around the firmware version without invalidating the warranty. Further discussion about that is not allowed here.<br />
<br />
As for the software used, that's quite a hot topic...<br />
<br />
There's some you should check out in the "Download" application on the phone, then there's the
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Beta Labs</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/lifeblog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Lifeblog</a> is another wicked application that you may not have used before - for backing up / archiving SMSs, MMSs, Images, Videos, Sound Clips, Notes etc.<br />
<br />
Other than those, the only main one I use is Ultimate Voice Recorder - not free but not unreasonably priced - Google for it. It automatically records all calls, which is amazing when you've got a memory like mine! lol

            Thanks a lot mate, most informative.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly new to nokia having not used them for years(sony ericsson convert), so I'm still getting used to it having just got it yesterday, and exploring the applications and stuff.<br />
<br />
Shame the firmware can't be updated as of yet, fingers crossed for the future I suppose.<br />
<br />
Like the sound of the recorder, think that'll be my first purchase, along with some looking around for a decent IM application and perhaps a few games as I travel a lot for work :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response(s)!<br />
Stu :)

            Your link to Nokia Beta Labs has two download link.<br />
<br />
Any idea what this software accomplishes? Nokia_Contacts_Services_Support_Package.sis<br />
<br />
Also, the link to Gizmo is for version 1.26.<br />
<br />
With Gizmo v2 released, are either of these links relevent?<br />
<br />
N95-1 Type RM-159 firmware 12.0.013

            The link was to the Beta Labs, as it was suggesting some software... If there's a new version of Gizmo available then Nokia need to update that page, but a quick google will find it.<br />
<br />
Not got a clue about the package you've mentioned, install it and see?

<h2>            Error Code 30102-40 &#40;1603&#41;</h2>
                    I am trying and trying to install Office 365 on Windows 7. About 2/3 rds in it hangs with a message that it has been unable to install because of Error 30102-40 (1603). I have tried disabling virus checkers etc and tried a clean boot - but nothing works.
 Any thoughts please?

    <title>Setting a footnote reference to right-to-left - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron weisman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting a footnote reference to right-to-left</h2>
                    I'm writing a document in Hebrew (a right to left language) and am using footnotes. I was able to set the footnotes to be right aligned and using Hebrew letters. My problem is that my document is using a table and if the table is the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br />
A&nbsp; A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6<br />
B B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6<br />
<br />
If I use a footnote 1 in A6, and try to add a footnote in A5, it automatically changes the footnote in A5 to #1 and the one in A6 to #2. I need the footnotes to count from left to right so that a footnote in A5 will be #2. I tried changing the style for footnote
 reference but didn't see any settings that would help me. <br />
I hope my question was clear enough. <br />
Thanks,<br />
Aaron<br />

<div>If your table starts from top left and&nbsp;ends at bottom right, the endnote numbering will be from left to right.
<div>You need to create a right to left table for endnote numbering to work in the format you want.

    <title>The Nokia 6120 Classic Modem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> picosam---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Nokia 6120 Classic Modem</h2>
                    I would like to know what's wrong with this phone's modem please? I have my data SIM inside it and use the USB cable (both Windows and Mac) with the latest PC Suite (and nothing installed for Mac, works out of the box) to connect to the Internet using
 3G/3.5G. Everything works well, until I start downloading something. It gives me full speed (which can usually go up to around 150KB/s) and then at a certain point (usually around 20% of the file) the connection drops. It does not disconnect, it just stops
 sending/receiving any data. I have to manually disconnect and reconnect, resume the file, for it to work again. Only it does this all the time, not only once! Which means as long as I'm not downloading something, it doesn't ever drop. The moment I download
 something, or access the Internet at the highest possible speed, I have to manually disconnect and reconnect every few minutes.

<p>I am also having problems even establishing a connectin between my Mac OS X and my Nokia 6150 classic and using it as a modem (which is, like many others in this discussion group, one of the main reasons I purchased the phone).&nbsp; I ascribed this problem to
 the fact that I can't seem to find a Mac-compatible driver for thhis phone online but perhaps someone can kindly point me to this driver? And any updated tips on how to connect and use the phhone as a modem? Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just switched over from the old 'Groove' client, to the new Next Gen client and noticed I now get errors for any saved HTML pages that have a &lt;pagename&gt;_files folder accociated with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. where you have a &nbsp; <em>name.html</em>&nbsp; file, and then a <em>name_files</em> folder containing things like images, or .js files that were saved allong with the HTML file itself. (If you copy one, the other is automatically coppied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HTML/HTM files themselves are fine, it's everything in the the related <em>
&lt;name&gt;_files</em> folder that fails to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific error is: "<strong>A hidden file with this name already exists online.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a Resolution to "<strong>Move the file to a different folder on this PC to upload it.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving the files does not seem to fix the issue. It seems that OneDrive (NG) uploads the new copy, then hides them on the web site, then compains about syncing them afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If I view on the site (https://*****-my.sharepoint.com/personal/...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the <em>name_files</em> folders are visible, but when you look inside the folder, they are empty, as if Sharepoint is hiding the contents, despite the local folders and their contents not being hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, this issue didn't show up with Groove.exe, and I could sync these files without any error with the old client.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this a limitation of the NG client?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is there anything that can be done to resolve this? As we have quite a few reference documents that follow this 'saved as HTML' format.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>An update to this, as I had a sudden thought, and testing seems to bear this out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it's a difference in how the old OneDrive for Business and the NG clients work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason the old client uploaded these linked folders, and their contents to SharePoint, but hid the contents (no items visible in the
<em>name_files </em>folders via the web site, but are visible locally).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to the NG client, it seems the NG client was trying to upload the folders again, and for some reason (presumably due to the folders being hidden on the SharePoint site, but not locally) clashed with the site contents, so refused to upload
 the files, hence the errors above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just moving the files didn't seem to help, but completely deleting the local folder (and the related HTML file), then waiting for OneDrive NG to catch up and re-sync (so deleting the hidden on-line files). I then copied a backup copy of the files back into
 my local OneDrive again. This time the sync worked file, and viewing the <em>name_files</em> folder in OneDrive online, now shows all the files (rather than an empty folder as before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the steps I followed to work around the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a local backup copy of the files you have the issue with. (If not make a copy).</li><li>Delete the local files.</li><li>Wait for OneDrive NG sync to finish. (I had the SharePoint web site open at the parent folder and hit F5 till I confirmed the files/folder had gone).</li><li>Copy your backup files back into the local OneDrive folder.</li><li>Again wait for&nbsp;OneDrive NG sync to finish.</li><li>Look on the web site, and the files inside the name_files folder should now be visible and no more error in the sync client.</li></ol>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Typo.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, yes I was aware of the old limitation, and that seemed to have been working okay with the old client, at least in appearance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see my other post (must have been writing as you replied), then it looks like a difference in how the old groove.exe client, and the new NG client, treat those type of files. (In that NG doesn't differentiate, but groove.exe does, and this has caused
 a clash between the clients).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work around is easy enough (backup the files, delete, let NG sync, then restore the backup), although for usability in the release version, I'd hope this 'migration' issue would be handled automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. Rather than complaining about hidden files with the same name existing online, just update the online files to match the local files, by removing the hidden flag (or at least asking the user if that's what they want to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct. The name_files folder can be synced with the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client, but after syncing, the folder and the files won't appear on the webpage. Meanwhile, the new sync client can sync and display name_files folder. So, after
 you re-upload the folders with the new sync client. Folder and files in it are synced well. You can see them in both locay synced folder and OneDrive for Business webpage. To learn more, see the

            I'm having the same issue except Mark's solution above did not fix the problem for me.&nbsp; I've been using the new sync client for a while now and recently ran into it not working with any _files in the name.&nbsp; I haven't been using groove for a long time but
 the new client is acting like it has the same restrictions as the old groove client.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            Hi Jon,<br />
<br />
Yes, of course, you could use Ink Editor with Track changes in Word. I just tested from my side with Track Changes on:<br />
1. Drow a line with Ink Editor:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a17e76cb-b269-46b1-9a77-386567c41bfc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a17e76cb-b269-46b1-9a77-386567c41bfc?upload=true" /></a><br />
2. Changes have been marked up:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79c03e82-0de2-4cc9-a101-2802979101ed?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79c03e82-0de2-4cc9-a101-2802979101ed?upload=true" /></a><br />
For more about the Ink Editor you may refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/edit-your-document-with-natural-gestures-7edbcf8e-0004-484d-9b62-501a31c23ee9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Edit your document with natural gestures.</a><br />
It has been noted in the article that this function needs Office 365 Subscription and have the latest version of Office. If you have any concerns about this, feel free to post back anytime.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

                    I have a problem when trying to connect to various "https" sites. I click, for the site to Remember Me, which will only remember&nbsp;my "User Name" and NOT my Password, which is exactly what I want. This has always worked for me before on this PC&nbsp;when using
 Vista and IE9. Now that I have upgraded to 8.1 and IE11, the problem has begun, but will work fine multiple times on each site until I "Shut Down" for the day, then the next day I have to start all over again (by clicking the Remember Me box on each of the
 "https" sites). I have read about Persistent Cookies and Session Cookies, and my intuition is that I have a problem in this area !! I do also have Norton Internet Security running, which I have always had going back to Vista and IE9. Please Help !!

<p>You can use Conditional Formatting; select the textbox in report design view, and choose Format... Conditional Formatting from the menu. There's no explicit visible/invisible option but you can set its forecolor to white if the condition is met.</p>

<p>In the OnFormat event of your report section (like the Detail section) put code similar to the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Me.CustomerName = "ABC" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FieldtoHideName.Visible = False<br />

<p>Hi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble finding the downloaded file on my laptop. &nbsp;When starting the download, from the MS Download centre, I didn't get an option of 'Run' or 'Save'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I have a trial version of Office 365 currently installed, which lapses in 5 days from now. &nbsp;Do I need to un-install this before the Office 2013 trial will work?....if and when I find it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;What will happen to all my 'work' that has been saved during my trial of 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;I am still deciding which one to buy, 365 or 2013. &nbsp;I am stuck in a place with a very slow internet connection, and will be back in civilisation middle of July 2014, when I will buy either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can install the trial suite of Microsoft Office only once on the computer. So as you have already installed Office 365 trial suite, you will not be able to install the trial suite again on the Computer after it has expired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. All the files created using Office 365 subscription, would be saved on your computer hard drive. So after you install the full version of Office suite, you will be able to access and use it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In order to decide on which Office product to be purchased, you may refer to the article given below for detailed information.

            <p>Hi again Nayana</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I understand you correctly, I cannot load Office 2013 as a trial after already having had Office 365 for 1 month now? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for either one of the two, for one PC and one Mac. &nbsp;My daughter will be starting her University studies next year, and I want for her to also have access on her Mac. &nbsp;To me it looks like
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Office 365 University</span></strong> should do the trick. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If and when I "Buy now" on line, will I receive sufficient guidance and instructions to effect the purchase? What can I expect to receive i.t.o. Product Keys, etc etc. &nbsp;(I work in a place with a very slow internet connection)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">One last question:</span> &nbsp;When buying the full version of
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Office 365 University</span></strong> as mentioned above, confirm that I will have to download the whole package again, and the trial will just lapse in total, without it being accessible at all i.t.o. files downloaded
 already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel J.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As described in the previous post, you cannot install the trial versions for the second time on the same computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to buy the Office 365 University subscription you need to have the registered University email account. So check the eligibility regarding the University subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get the complete details about the purchase, it is better you get in touch with the Microsoft Store support before making an Office 365 purchase.</p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Regarding the query about trial subscription installed on the computer, it is better to remove and deactivate the trial subscription once it is expired and before installing the purchased version
 of Office.</span></span></p>

<p>If it is OneDrive for Business, please check the second-stage recycle bin as the article says:<br />

<p>If it is OneDrive, we may not be able to recover the deleted photos. Since our forum mainly focuses on the Office 365 for Business which contains OneDrive for Business, to ensure you receive the best support, I would suggest you post it to the OneDrive forum

<h3> twna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Format individual items in a multiple choice field</h2>
                    <p>Hello community - is it possible, using JSON formatting in Modern Sharepoint, to take the contents of a choice field that allows for multiple selections and display it as tags?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I select "apple", "cherry", and "plum" from a choice field that lists many different fruits</li><li>What I want to output:<br />
&lt;div style="display:inline-block;background:silver;"&gt;apple&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="display:inline-block;background:silver;"&gt;cherry&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="display:inline-block;background:silver;"&gt;plum&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;</li><li>What actual outputs:<br />
apple, cherry, plum</li></ul>
<p>Is this possible?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Writing a macro for save as which allows for dynamic file location</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to write a macro which pulls through the filename based on the data in a particular cell - it copies and pastes it when the save as screen pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whilst I want to define the filename, I want the user to be able to choose where the file is saved on their PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this would be quite simple but I seem to be having difficulty working out how to do this.&nbsp; I'm not a VBA expert but have used it in the past!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help put me right please?</p>

                    <p>I know many similar questions to this have been asked, and I have been through them, and tried to get some to work but with no luck. Below is a sample of my data.</p>

<p>What I need to do is to have values (say 1-500) in column D and for a goalseek to populate column A, I need to use goalseek because column C has a formula in which creates an x factor depending on what value is in column A. Hope this makes sense. Thanks
 in advance</p>

            <p>Thanks for that. Col C has a nested if to select a number depending on what the value of col A is, the higher the value of col A the higher the x factor. I have found using a 'find and replace' technique I can relatively create lots of individual lines like
 below, but I know there is a way just to have one line and loop it, how would I do this?</p>

            Sounds like you are talking about the Academic Discount offer. It is considered a "Retail" or "FPP" license. That license allows you to install it on a "licensed" device (undefined, but presumably a desktop) and a "portable" device (again, undefined, but
 presumably a laptop).<br />

    <title>Calendar &#34;processing&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> datanka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar &#34;processing&#34;</h2>
                    Good Morning, <br />
<p><span><br />
i just got my new ipaq 214 with WM 6.0 classic.&nbsp; I’m using Microsoft outlook 2003 and i already have tried the workaround for synchronisation. (Like opening ports and so on)</span></p>
<p><span>I have reinstalled Activsync 4.5 two times and I deleted the partnership as well.
<br />
<br />
My problem is, that the Synchronisation of my Contacts, Notes is working perfectly. But when the Calendar has received the first 100 entry’s, the status of the synchronisations is changing to "processing" and it will stay there. After 8 Hours, “working” over
 night, it is still at "processing". The status bar just moved 2 mm .<br />
<br />
So it seams that this Problem has nothing to do with Active Sync, because it’s The Job of the Windows Mobile device to "process" the new entries right?<br />
Is there a Limit of entries the wm6.0 can handle? Is there a trick or workaround for this Problem? Or maybe a update?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because I don’t think that the number of entries is the Problem since it won’t proceed to “process” the first 100 entries.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you <br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>

<h2>            CANNOT OPEN OUTLOOK 2003&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot open Outlook 2003.&nbsp; I keep receiving the error message.....The data file "Personal Folders" was not closed properly.&nbsp; The file is being checked for problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The problem is that Outlook never opens.&nbsp; It seems that by observing the Green progress bars, that they just stop and thus Outlook never opens.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync yahoo mail on my Microsoft phone for 7 days</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I can't sync my Yahoo mail on Microsoft phone for 7 days.<br />
Restarted my phone, deleted account, started over again but problem is still here. Every time when I am asked to put my email and password I can see 15 dots on the place for password already there. I didn't have password with so many characters.<br />
What can I do to sync my mail?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>The number of dots in that field doesn't mean anything. if it actually matched the number of characters in your password, that'd be a security risk because people would already know the length of the password.</p>

            But if I reset my phone and deleted yahoo account on my phone, how it is possible to see dots? The first time (and every after that) when I wanted to log in. I was working ok until 7 days ago. It just stopped.

            Hi, If you can unlock the phone, there is a chance that you can get all those data. If you turn on auto upload of photos and videos to OneDrive there is a chance that you have them back up. To check, log in to
