<h2>            Excel 2016 formula question</h2>
                    <p>I have many numbers in a single column. &nbsp;I want to type a formula in a cell above that column that produces the maximum value expressed in one of the column's cells as long as that value is less than 1.0. &nbsp;How do I do that?</p>
<p>Similarly, I want to type a formula for a different column that produces the minimum value expressed in one of the column's cells that is greater than 0.0. &nbsp;How do I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ah yes, the new functions for Excel 2016.&nbsp; I would be reluctant to suggest any of them, since HansV (I think) indicated that some (?) are not (!) in the stand-alone version of Excel 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OTOH, since Jack is using Office 365 -- the online version, right? -- I suppose
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">he</span></em> has access to those functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[EDIT] Then again, in another thread, Ashish indicates that the new "XL2016" functions are only available in Office 365
<p>
</p><p>In any case, again, those constructs solve Jack's problem only if the intent is to get the max or min of only qualifying values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO, Jack's requirements are stated ambiguously.&nbsp; It is a question of whether "<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that</span></em> value" refers to the cell values (i.e. "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>those</em></span> values") or
 to the max or min.&nbsp; And if the latter, there is the matter of what Jack wants when the max or min does not meet the condition.&nbsp; That is, is zero an acceptable result?&nbsp; Only Jack can answer these questions.</p>

            <p>In case you want to return "NA" where no values in the range are &lt;1 except blanks, you may use below formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(COUNTIFS(B2:B20,"&lt;&gt;",B2:B20,"&lt;"&amp;1)&lt;1,"NA",INDEX(MAX((B2:B20)*(B2:B20&lt;1)),,))</p>

</p><p>In case there are some blanks in the range B2:B20 and no value below 1, the above formula will return "NA".</p>

    <title>Nokia 5610 with dead&#40;&#63;&#41; screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 5610 with dead&#40;&#63;&#41; screen</h2>
                    Hey guys I seem to have a problem!<br />
<br />
I was uploading some mp3 to my newly bought Nokia 5610,<br />
I got it 3 weeks ago. I installed the latest software etc etc. Now here we go: I was uploading the mp3's and at some point I had to go to college, and I thought it be alright if I just left my phone on the desk so it could upload the songs while I was gone,
 and it'd be done by the time I would get back.<br />
<br />
Then I thought that maby the battery would be empty soon if it was uploading all the time, so I got my charger, and I plugged it in the mobile... and then suddenly the screen went black. I was like... euh? O.o what was that.<br />
<br />
So I start looking at what could be wrong (no i didnt open the device exept of taking out the SIM card and battery and back in again so my warrenty is still intact) Its pretty weird, the screen is black, but when I put it 'on' it vibrates 1 time as normal,
 I see black letters "Nokia" apear on a dark grey screen. And then nothing happends. The only thing noticable is that the screen goes from total black to dark grey for 2 seconds, it does this 3 times and then it stays black. And then I can push 'on' again and
 the exact same happends again.<br />
<br />
So I thought, maby the battery went dead? I put in the charger again, and this time it kept on going from black to grey untill I unplug the charger. Also when I connect the USB to my computer, the pc finds the 'new device' and then immediatly it disconnects
 again. This happends everytime the 'cycle' starts again (going black to grey 3 times and then black). So it seems like it is going On, and then after the screen goes black for the last time it is turned Off again.<br />
<br />
Its the only thing I see, nothing apears on the screen exept "nokia' (in a weird place aswell, at the middle-bottom instead of the middle where it normally apears).<br />
<br />
I'm bashed... I bought this mobile 3 weeks ago, never dropped it or anything. Nothing seems to be damaged either, from the outside at least.<br />
It was all fine untill this morning. Now im not sure wether it was because of uploading the mp3's, or because I plugged in the charger, or combination of either.<br />
<br />
Again its about the Nokia 5610 Xpress Music, Has anyone encountered this problem or has suggestions? Else I'm afraid I will just have to get it back to a repair center in Amsterdam :( (after I told al my friends my new number and said that they could delete
 my old 1 :/)<br />
<br />
Any help is appreaciated!

            What navigator said, the same thing happened to me this morning.<br />
If you go to this site - <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4228006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4228006</a> then choose your nearest store, it should have the stores number. When I called (one in Gloucester) the guy said it could be fixed on the same day :).<br />

            ye, i figured something like that. If there is a god he must hate my mobiles :P my last mobile was a samsung D500, who had a bit of similar problem (only then the screen was all white :P, mobile still worked tho) and broke 3 times in the 1 year warranty.
 And to think im a guy that is really carefull with his pcs/laptops/mobiles/anything that is electronic and brakes fast!<br />
<br />
O well i'll guess imma bring it to a care centre asap :)

            I got the 5610 device last night- turned it ON, made a call, went throught every applicaion; camera, music, radio etc... it was all okay- then I turned it back OFF and put out the battery.<br />
Now in the morning, I copied some songs to the memory card, put the card in for the first time and when tried to turn it ON it simply refused. It did go through the 'Nokia Hands' screen but then the screen flickers to dark grey lines and ends up in dead black.<br />
The phone is properly showing the charging and some times it even shows the white screen and displys time, I can even type 4 or 5 keys, some times, before it restarts.<br />
I've properly charged the battery, taken out the sim and memory card, changed them, but nothing's changed.<br />
I hardly used it for 15 mins, didn't drop it, it's not abused by any other mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
I reckon it could be some... software problem? but it IS seariously disappointing :-(

            I would like to know if any of you got this problem solved, 'cause I'm having it and I want to know before I try to send it to nokia or maybe it would be better to just return it to the store where I got it.

            rofl, i called the care centre to ask where the hell my mobile was, eventually we discovered it was send to Polen (lol?) and probably that meant that i was gonna get a new mobile or that it would take another 1 or 2 weeks before it would be done.<br />
<br />
And ofcourse in the mean time im still paying the montly bills... way to go nokia!

<h2>            My N80 is forgetting the time and date.</h2>
                    Can anyone advise me what to do?<br />
<br />
While travelling, my N80's battery went dead a couple of times. On restarting, I now have to enter the time and date. I have fully recharged the phone, and used it for a week, but on testing, it still won't retain the date and time when restarted.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice?<br />
Thanks

            You need to take your phone to a service center.<br />
<br />
Basically, there is a secondary capacitor/battery that keeps the clock going when the main battery dies or is removed. This has lost it's charge and needs to be replaced/recharged which can only be done at a service center.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check after each step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On the affected sites, if the Compatibility View icon (torn page next to the Address Bar) is visible, click it. Or, from Tools&gt; Compatibility View settings, add the website to the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away, you have an incompatible browser add-on installed.<br />
<br />

Download (near the bottom of the article- before the comments) and run the appropriate script for<br />

            <p>Yes, you can uninstall IE9 which will automatically restore IE8.</p>

<p>Then download IE9<br />

<p>I would save the IE9 installer then right-click&gt;&nbsp;Run as administrator, rather than running it from the download site.</p>
<p>Did this computer come with a trial version of Norton or McAfee? If it did and you aren't using that program, run the appropriate removal tool.<br />

            <p>Question: McAfee is automatically updating and is the current security program?</p>
<p>Q2. Can you uninstall/reinstall McAfee? Do you have a program disk?</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>1. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced.</p>

            Hi DuncanHewitt 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Q. How can I swap the ownership of MS 365 from my college account to my personal account?
<br />A. You can't swap. This is not allowed.

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Drag and Drop</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to sign in to Office 365, Edge says that this requires Internet Explorer. After I&nbsp;sign in to IE 11, and then switch to Edge, all works well in Office 365 except that I cannot drag and drop&nbsp;&nbsp;ocuments to&nbsp;Edge, despite the fact that it says to&nbsp;"drag
 and drop&nbsp;here". Drag and drop is not a problem in IE11.</p>

            Same problem here - I'm accessing Office 365 using Microsoft Edge on a Windows 10 machine, trying to create a Sway presentation, and the only option for adding images to a Sway seems to be Drag and Drop which they apparently haven't gotten to work in Edge
 yet....works like a charm in Chrome!! hahahaha

<h2>            Microsoft Works 9 Word Processor</h2>
                    Greetings, In MS Works 9 Word Processor there is a function to turn on or off automatic spell-checking and substitution. I unchecked the box to turn it off because it keeps substituting wrong words. For instance I used the term "blogosphere" and came back
 to find it turned into "photosphere". This happened 3 times even though I have that function turned off. This is not a one time thing either. It does it regulalrly and when proofreading my documents I find words that have been substituted which I did not intend.
 Sometimes I can get them to stay the way I want them when I change them back&nbsp;but this time it just kept changing blogosphere to photosphere. Since I write about technology, cyber culture and some still esoteric matters surrrounding the direction of technologcal
 development as I see it,&nbsp;it could be disterous for me to either miss this during proof reading or worse, forget the word I intended and thus blur the recollection of my stream of consciousness when having writt

<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask if anyone was successfully able to display Netflix on an XBOX ONE S in 24hz.</p>
<p>My XBOX ONE S converts 24hz to 60hz when watching netflix.</p>

<p>Also standard Full HD blurays display in 24hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Netflix displays in 4K, HDR but converted to 60hz.</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn't. I contacted both Microsoft and Netflix and they basically blame the other. Microsoft says their platform supports it but Netflix doesn't use it. Netflix says the platform doesn't support it. :-( It's a travesty is you ask me. Both
 say to "wait for an update" of the OS and App.</p>

            Please check this link for tips on battery saving: http://bit.ly/2bnrZ8C. <br />
A lot of applications open do tend to drain battery life, if too many apps are open battery life drains much faster.

I'm also using AADSync <br />

User are created on the cloud and all replication on AADsync are success.<br />
If i create a new user on PREM with mailbox, the user is replicated.<br />
If i migrate this new user, the migration is SUCCESS (Good !)<br />
<br />
But if i try to migrate an existant account, the migration failed with this message:<br />
MigrationRecipientNotFoundException (no mail user)<br />
<br />
On Exchange Online powershell the command Get-Recipient -Identity **** return the user correctly<br />

<p>Hi Paracetamol,</p>
<p>About the <strong>MigrationRecipientNotFoundException</strong> error, does the entire error message look like the following?</p>
<p><strong>Error: MigrationRecipientNotFoundException: A recipient wasn‎'t found for "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" on the target. Create a recipient of the appropriate type for this migration on the target and try again.</strong></p>
<p>If yes, I'd like to explain that the root cause may be related to the Exchange Online server, and our relevant team is now working on a fix. Before the fix is completely deployed, it is recommended that you try this workaround:</p>
<p>1. Run <strong>Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox</strong> to list the deleted mailbox users. If the affected users are included, run
<strong>Remove-Mailbox -PermanentlyDelete</strong> to completely remove them. If not, continue on.<br />
2. Run <strong>Get-MailUser -Identity &lt;user&gt; | FL GUID</strong> to get the <strong>
GUID</strong> of the user.<br />
3. Run <strong>New-MoveRequest -Identity &lt;GUID&gt; -Remote -RemoteHostName 'mail.domain.com' -RemoteCredential $cred -TargetDeliveryDomain 'domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com' -BadItemLimit 10 -LargeItemLimit 20</strong> to try a new batch to move the mailbox.<br />
(Note: please replace all the domain names included in the commands above.)</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response Franky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions, we are using Exchange 2013 hybrid. &nbsp;We were able to complete the users in error using PowerShell and as of last night, all migration batches were finalized. &nbsp;This is the first location of many we are migrating to 365 so I am sure
 we will run into this again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My co-worker now has a case open with Microsoft regarding some of the failures. &nbsp;The tech was able to provide a solution for all but one or our migration issues and has specified that it will require a back-end fix to be applied by Microsoft. &nbsp;For the moment,
 we have 7 of those requiring the back-end fix (<em><span>MapiExceptionSessionLimit: Unable to synchronize manifest)
</span></em><span>and as I am typing this, we just received an email that the fix is in place.</span><em> &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>For those with this error above, you can follow the current incident #EX85364 vis the Service Health Daskboard on your O365 portal. &nbsp;This incident was last updated at 8pm on
 11-14-16. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>As the title states. Is it possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have issues with the new OneDrive client that is supposed to replace OneDrive for Business, and I'd like to revert. However, no SharePoint library now allows me to sync with the old client, despite the fact that I selected to use the old client in SharePoint

<p>Hi Jan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft has introduced the new OneDrive sync client to improve OneDrive for Business service. You may check the following articles to compare the new OneDrive sync client (onedrive.exe) and OneDrive for Business sync client (groove.exe).</p>

</a>&nbsp;groove.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to better understand your situation, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. What are the issues with the new OneDrive sync client?</p>
<p>2. If there is any screenshot of the issue, please provide it.</p>
<p>3. Detailed steps and related screenshots about how you encounter the issues one by one.</p>

<p>Hi Tina. I'm with Jan on this and have been working with your One Drive Team for the past 3 weeks. Here are just some of the issues with the new sync client that I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sync all my files locally with SharePoint so that I can work with the files locally and then have them sync directly back to SharePoint and vice versa. I have been told that because I have required columns with metadata that this is no longer possible
 - BY DESIGN - WHY??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>The required columns and metadata are a BONUS for controlling how my users upload files to SharePoint for easier sorting and searching. Why should I have to give up one bonus for another. Who's brilliant idea was it that this was a good thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my synced files are padlocked and can only be opened read-only and cannot be save directly back to SharePoint . Even if I open the file online directly from SharePoint it is read-only and will not save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had none of these problems with Groove.exe and One Drive has now become totally unworkable for my organization. Please give us the option to go back to Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not true:</p>
<p>"If you want to sync from SharePoint on-premises environments or&nbsp;sync another user’s OneDrive library, you should use the previous OneDrive for Business application (groove.exe).<br />
<br />
Both the onedrive.exe and groove.exe clients can run at the same time."</p>

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could understand your feelings. We suggest voting for
<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/17864110-fix-synch-client-to-allow-editable-synching-of-tea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this feedback</a> which is submitted by another customer in OneDrive User Voice. Understanding user experience makes our service and products better for you and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, please perform the following steps to use the old OneDrive for Business sync client:</p>
<p>1. Install and launch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint Online Management Shell</a>.</p>
<p>2. Run the following commands:</p>

<p>I also noticed that 1 folder does not have the padlocks and was wondering why that is. The entire site has all the same rules for every library</p>

<p>I'd just like to know, YES or NO, if it's possible to revert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried my best to describe my issue, which is related to Office 365 as whole, but I believe this issue is caused by OneDrive, in another topic. Where I eventually got told to write on Uservoice. I'm tired being referenced elsewhere like a moron, for something
 that was working and MS decided to screw it's business customers again, because they thought it will be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, please tell me, if it's possible to revert. Or better yet, why the settings set in SharePoint online don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Jan and Vicki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Glad to know the you can now use the old sync client again. Thanks for your feedback in User Voice. We will improve the new OneDrive sync client over time to meet your demand. When it is ready, you may try it out again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While continuing to use the old OneDrive for Business sync client, feel free to post back if you have any concerns.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10130 - Skype App Crashes</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine : Surface Pro 3 i7 512GB HDD</p>
<p>My actual build : 10130</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptom : I'm launching Skype from the Start menu. The app starts correctly and logs in. As long I stay focused on the app there is no problem. Once I minimize or lose focus of the app after some time the app crashes.</p>

            <p>Hi ! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. FYI I'm an IT guy so I have no prob with technical actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the latest changes I did on my Surface : </p>
<p>-&nbsp;Update&nbsp;from build 10122 to build 10130</p>
<p>- Installation of Office 2016 preview for Office 365 users</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the results of my tests. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 : </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0880394f-2bb6-4fd3-a9f7-e3add3c51a6e" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Method 3 : </p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4 : </p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't test it yet.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another question. Is the app Skype on the Store(Beta) the same as the Skype installed on the build 10130 ? If I connect to the store it says that the app Skype is not installed ... but it is actually integrated with OS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had exactly the same issues with my machine as Mike has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all 4 methods, none worked. Then have noticed Mike's comment on the beta-Store, so re-installed Skype from the store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now getting almost the same with one exception,&nbsp;the faulty module is mshtml.dll:</p>

</p>
<p>I have an office 365 account so my Windows 10 and Office applications are all fully up to date with latest versions and updates.</p>
<p>When I open my spreadsheet I get the message that it is blocked and I cannot then save it after I have made changes.</p>
<p>Surely Excel is a trusted application?????</p>

<p>I have resolved the problem by adding Excel and Word to the list of allowed apps for controlled folder access.</p>
<p>This does not explain why I should need to do this as I would have expected these to be allowed as trsted applications without me having to add them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CFA is not a trusted application (e.g. whielisting) security system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, it's purpose is merely to block access to certain folders that ransomware most often attacks when attempting to encrypt and corrupt user files.&nbsp; This means that any application trying to access these specific folders will also be blocked, regardless
 of who created the application or how trusted it might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question you need to ask about those particular Excel files is where they are stored and possibly what other folders or files they might access, since this is what's actually triggering CFA and not Excel or Word itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose to allow an application access to specific folders if you trust it, but the opening you are creating is that the application itself is now a pathway into that particular folder, so if it becomes compromised it can be used to attack the files
 contained in that location.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Signature Issue</h2>
                    <p>I recently created a html signature in outlook 2016. A graphic designer sent me a html file and i copied and pasted to a word and to the outlook signature. In owa, the signature is fine without any issue, but in outlook view, the signature is different from
 the one in owa, with more space. I tried in outlook 2013 as well, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the outlook update broken the signature?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook version: 16.0.6769.2017</p>
<p>OS: windows 10 64 bit</p>

            <p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings..!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the password, you will have to contact verified admin/global admin&nbsp;so that he can update/change&nbsp;your password even if you do not have any access to email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Global admin can change the password from Yammer by performing a bulk update users or password can be changed from Office 365 admin centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps with your query. For any query or issue regarding Yammer, please revert.</p>

            This problem persists with Windows 17134.345 and Office 1810. Another symptom is that the Office apps can connect to the work account, but as soon as they are closed they default back to a personal account.

<p>I think I have a related issue;</p>
<p>I no longer have Admin privilege on Outlook to Add or Amend Account Settings...?</p>
<p>Only on Insider Edition which I am running on a single machine. </p>
<p>Other copies of O365 working fine.</p>
<p>I think it may be related because I initially had the WAM prompting for password on the account immediately after the update, and it also re-ordered Email Accounts in my Folders list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without Admin I can't re-order them back. Frustrating!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Autocomplete of Username not working on Hotmail Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. raza gardezi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autocomplete of Username not working on Hotmail Account</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I used to sign into my Hotmail account, a drop down box would appear showing the previously used usernames. This made it easier to select the username rather than typing it all. Now that I have windows 8.1 and IE 11, the dropdown box does not appear.
 I have already tried deleting the browsing history on Internet options in the tools tab, as well as the autocomplete button on the content tab.</p>
<p>This problem is only limited to Hotmail, whereas when I use my Yahoo account, the autocomplete drop down box appears. This happens on Google Chrome and Firefox also.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is only happening on my home computer which has Windows 8.1 and IE 11, but not on my office computer.</p>

            <p>The problem seems to be limited to just Hotmail accounts. Yahoo gives the dropdown menu without any problem.</p>
<p>Moreover, the problem on Hotmail account occurs on all the browsers, i.e.&nbsp;IE, Google Chrome &amp; Firefox.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem is Hotmail specific.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm getting the exact same results. Windows 10 IE or Chrome won't save my email login only on Hotmail web page. It was working before they change the login page. Microsoft changed the login page recently and the problem started at the same time. Did you
 get it working? Really would like to find a fix.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Till a few weeks back I was facing the problem on all computers and on all browsers. It started about the same time as hotmail chamged its login page. However, since last one week, the problem has been resolved on my office computer (windows 10) but my home
 computer which has windows 8.1 is still facing the same proble. The problem now seems to be computer specific, since I am only facing this issue at my home computer.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me in fixing this issue at my home computer.</p>
<p>I have already tried the usual remedies.</p>

    <title>Bug&#58; OneNote Mac copying text leaves artifacts on screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug&#58; OneNote Mac copying text leaves artifacts on screen</h2>
                    <p>Some times when I select text in OneNote on the Mac, the selected text stays on the screen above the OneNote window. This is really wierd. By this I mean that you can move the OneNote (or any other window) around and the selected text remains visible and
 on top. If you bring another window on top of OneNote and click on the selected text (which would still be visible) it will bring OneNote to the front.</p>
<p>Is there any way to clear these thing from the screen?</p>
