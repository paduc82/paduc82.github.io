    <title>Outlook 365 will not update my email passwords - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 365 will not update my email passwords</h2>
                    <p>I change my passwords once a year for my two email accounts, so just changed them today.&nbsp; I am now trying to update the passwords in Outlook 365 (most current version), but it will not work for either of them.&nbsp; Here's what I do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click File.&nbsp; Right under Account information, I select the account I want to change the password for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the Account Settings button, and then select Update Password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I type in my new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook says "We're getting things ready", but after a few seconds, it says:</p>
<p>"Something went wrong, and Outlook couldn't update your password.&nbsp; Please verify your password and try again.&nbsp; If the problem continues, contact your email administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certain the passwords I am typing in are correct.&nbsp; I logged into my email accounts via the web with those passwords, and they worked fine.&nbsp; One account is a Gmail (paid) account, and one is an iCloud account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For iCloud, I logged out of iCloud from the iCloud for Windows app on my computer, and then logged back in with the correct password.&nbsp; THEN I started Outlook.&nbsp; My Calendar and Contacts are syncing from iCloud into Outlook just fine, but for whatever reason,
 the password didn't update automatically.&nbsp; It won't let me update it with the above method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had a problem updating my password in Outlook before.&nbsp; So something that has changed in the last year has caused a problem.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<p>I just solved the issue with the Gmail account.&nbsp; There was a setting in my Google account where I needed to allow "less secure" apps to access my account.&nbsp; Once I did that, Outlook was able to access my Gmail account again.</p>
<p>

            Not sure if its valid but I recently changed to 2 step verification for Google and got the same message in Outlook 365 - turns out that since the 2 step can't be completed with an email logon you need to set up an 'App Password' in Google account. Open
 your google account and you will see the options to do this - simple to complete and you end up getting an passcode to put in place of your gmail password

            <p><span>Hi Rossoneris,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please update your Outlook for Mac version. The latest version is 15.30 (170107).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try rebuilding the Spotlight index on your Mac. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Choose Apple menu &gt; System Preferences, then click Spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the Privacy tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+) button and select the folder or disk to add.</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the same list of locations, select the folder or disk that you just added. Then click the Remove (–) button to remove it from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Quit System Preferences. Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Depending on your Mac and the contents of its hard disk, re-indexing may take several hours to days. Until this process is finished, Spotlight won’t know the contents of your disks and neither
 will Outlook. All lists like contacts, events, notes etc. are generated by the Spotlight searches.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still can’t search for people, please provide the following information for us:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Can you search these people when you using <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Regarding “no one can be found,” do you mean all the users in your Global Address List can’t be found?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Is there any error message shows when you do the research? If so, please provide a screenshot of the error message for us.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to your update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Barry</span></p>

<h2>            Overdrive eBook Reader messing up in Win 10 Build 10049</h2>
                    <div>
<p>The Overdrive reading app works well on my Windows 8.1 desktop PC for reading local library eBooks. But in Windows 10 Build 10049 on my Iconia W4 8" tablet, it only shows the first 1-2 pages in each section / chapter. The rest of the pages in each section
 / chapter are black blank screens. The page numbers progress as I tap the right margin so it is going through the pages, just show blank ones instead of the test.</p>
<p>I've only tried it on one book so far, an older one titles Ubik.</p>

            OverDrive worked fine yesterday on Build 10061 but today it's gone.&nbsp; I had an over night update install automatically.&nbsp; That must be related.&nbsp; Anybody have any ideas?&nbsp; I tried downloading the OverDrive again and it seemed to work downloading then it went

            <p>Berndt, here is what I sent to OverDrive.com; maybe it will help you. They are testing Win10P.</p>
<p>
</p><div>"Your OverDrive app works for me the first time I use it in Windows 10 Build 10061 and displays the correct icon, but then it ‘disappears’ from the Start All Programs list. It appears in Settings | Apps and can be deleted, but not run. If I delete it and
 re-install it, it runs fine this first time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And today it is acting differently. It did not show up so I went to the App Store to re-install it without first uninstalling it. After a few seconds, it said it was already installed, but it showed an icon of the program in the Store and touching it,
 it ran. And unlike a re-install, it remembered my settings and library and books so I was able to continue reading my book.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I finished the book, hit the Delete and Return, and closed the app. In the Start Menu, it shows up as the “Recently added” app with a black square as the icon, but clicking on it, it opens the App Store (Beta store). It also shows up in All Programs with
 the same black icon and also opens the Store (Beta) instead of the actual app.&nbsp; Strange."</p>

            I don't have to quit for the change to stick. As long as the&nbsp;checkmark in&nbsp;<i>Add to template</i>&nbsp;is applied, and as long as I don't click on any&nbsp;<i>Cancel</i>&nbsp;button, new documents take on the redefined indent right away.
<div><br />
<div>Let's try this first. Enable <i>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; Save &gt; Prompt to save Normal template.</i>&nbsp;Change the indent once again (don't forget to
<i>Add to template)</i>, then quit Word. At that point,&nbsp;Word should ask you if you want to save changes to the Normal template, and you'll know that the change was added. If it does not ask you, there is something weird going on and you should do as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Quit Word</li><li>Go to the Finder</li><li>In the Finder's menu bar, select <i>Go &gt; Go to Folder</i></li><li>Paste the following bold text: <b>~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office</b>&nbsp;(include the twiddle at the beginning) and press the
<i>Go</i>&nbsp;button.</li><li>In that folder, you should find a file called <b>Normal.dotm</b><i>. </i>If you don't see it, look for it inside a folder called&nbsp;<i>User Templates.
</i>Leave the folder's window open.</li><li>Press the <b>Option </b>key and drag the Normal.dotm template to the Desktop to make a copy.</li><li>Launch Word and, from its&nbsp;<i>File &gt; Open</i>&nbsp;menu, locate the copy of Normal.dotm on your Desktop to open it. (You have to use this menu option, because clicking on the template in the Desktop would just open a blank document based on it.)</li><li>Now you are editing the copy of Normal.dotm and should see the hanging indent paragraph. Correct it and close the template. [Do this through
<i>Format &gt; Styles</i>&nbsp;<i>&gt; Modify </i>to change&nbsp;the paragraph style as per previous instructions.]</li><li>Quit Word and put the corrected template on your Desktop back into the folder from where you copied it from, replacing the original.</li><li>Open Word and test.</li></ol>

<p><span>Hi kevin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply. Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to reproduce this feature with the same Outlook client version on our side but failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please manually type the Network-attached Storage location in the file location path to check if you can see the items in the Network-attached
 Storage.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87b3a75d-6fa3-4353-9617-2c60e25dc7e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87b3a75d-6fa3-4353-9617-2c60e25dc7e3" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, please perform the following steps to check if the problem is related to the specific Network-attached Storage:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Create a folder in your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right click on this folder and choose Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Navigate to Sharing &gt; Share… &gt; type everyone and change permission level to Read/Write &gt; select Share.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then you will see a location under Network Path. Try saving the attachments to this path to check if the problem persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h3> swberickson96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attachments in Meeting in Outlook 2016 for mac appear as pdf</h2>
                    When I attach an email into a meeting invite on a PC it becomes an attachment in that meeting. I have a user that has a mac and is using Outlook 2016 for the mac. When the user goes to open the attachment in the meeting it appears as a pdf and is just
 plain text and a bunch of gibberish. When it is opened on a windows PC it looks just fine. If the mac user attaches an email to a meeting it will work fine for both people. Any ideas on how to get the Mac Outlook client to see the attachment as an email and
 not a pdf?

            It isn't changing the attachment it is just thinking that it is a pdf. so I can see the attachment in the meeting and the one attached from a pc says it is .pdf on the mac. If I attach an email to the meeting on a mac it says it is .ems or something like
 that. It is obiously an email.

<p>Hi everyone. Original poster here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to update everyone on my question, in the hopes that it'll help anyone else. I called Microsoft support and was able to speak to a great representative who refunded me my purchase. She was also willing to go ahead and help me purchase the correct
 version of Word for my Mac. It is somewhat confusing to get in touch with a representative when you call the 877 number, but it's achievable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you are able to download the free trail of Office, if you are in desperate need of Word or any other applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have a serious problem. I am now frozen out of my three (that I know of) skype accounts. They all have different (i guess) logins n none seem to want to let me log in. It seems like I&nbsp; keep getting directed to a different account every time I try to log
 in, without knowing which one it is. I kept having to change my password which worked until the next time I had to log in. I have the old Worldwide Unlimited plan where I get billed usd130/year n don't want to lose it, That is the ONLY account I want. I cannot
 currently log in to any of these accounts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>o One was my original Skype account from back in 2004. It is based on my 
ric*****@hotmail email account. I think this is the one with the Worldwide subscription I dearly love.</p>
<p>
</p><p>o Two resulted just before the Microsoft buyout wherein Skype was being shopped around by management, because I NEVER asked to change my Skype account from Hotmail to be tied to my Google/Gmail account:
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>o&nbsp; Another was started just recently n I seem to remember doing it on my Android cell tied to a recent email I used for a special project...
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>QUESTION: How can I get Skype to eliminate any other account other than the one with the subscriptions (should be the hotmail account)&nbsp; or ... are there any Skype corporate plans to fix this problem another way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps: I don't care to save any of the data on any of the accounts. Also, I am currently able to log into any one of these.</p>

</p><p>We do not delete accounts from our end.&nbsp;This follows a thorough process and&nbsp;&nbsp;should be processed from the user's side. The first thing you need to ensure before you proceed with deleting your account is you have access to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from your description above, you said that you do not have access to any of your Skype accounts. Can you specify the exact error message/s you get when signing in to any of your accounts? We need to address this first and determine the account you
 want to keep before you proceed with closing the other two. I will appreciate it if you can provide a screenshot of the error message so I can look into it and assist you further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to post back with additional information so we can check how to proceed.

<p>Hi Adinda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when you open the bullet list in Word 2016 for Mac, Word crashes. We’d like to confirm some information to clarify your situation so we can better help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this problem happen to all the document you have or just one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Please confirm which button you clicked cause the crash, is the drop down arrow or the bullet button?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Does this problem happen in other Office applications such as PowerPoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Please provide the version of your Word, you can check it in
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>I think Tisky gave you a bum steer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have version 15.16. The current update is 15.40. You are WAY behind on updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DO NOT UNINSTALL AND REINSTALL.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you <em>install updates</em><em>,</em> AutoUpdate will completely remove and update office automatically for you!! There is NO benefit whatsoever for uninstalling and reinstalling in your situation.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps to bring your system up to date, test again and reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think the first troubleshooting step to take is:
<strong>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</strong>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>

    <title>Microsoft Excel 2013 will not install on MacBook Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> savannahcobb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Excel 2013 will not install on MacBook Pro</h2>
                    I just bought Microsoft Excel 2013 and went to My Account on stores.office.com. I clicked Install, the instructions message popped up, and it began downloading. However, when I look in my Downloads, the title of the download is "Setup.X86.en-US_ExcelRetail…7-1a2848aaad26b_TX_PR_.exe"
 and when I double click this, it opens in my TextEdit as lots of code with the first line "MZêˇˇ∏@∫¥
Õ!∏LÕ!This program cannot be run in DOS mode." Some background information, I am currently in New Zealand but had to buy this from the USA Microsoft website (billing address issues), and on My Account I see "Office for Windows" but I have a Mac. Please
 help me figure out how to either install this or get my money back. Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>I am unable to export to video in PPT for Mac 2016. I have seen in another thread that I need an Office 365 Subscription for this. I do have one, however in About PowerPoint it says Volume License. I am an University faculty member. Here's a screenshot of

</p><p>You need to sign out of your volume license and then sign in with your Office 365 credentials.</p>

            Apparently the A1-Plus program does not include an Office 365 subscription. Your install is a perpetual license. You can check with your school's IT department to be sure, but the install you have is not an Office 365 subscription, so the feature is not
 available to you.

If you often use the same layout or data in a workbook, save it as a template so you can use the template to create more workbooks instead of starting from scratch. You can use one of your own templates to create a new workbook, or you can use one of the many
 predefined templates that you can download from Microsoft Office Online. <br />

<h2>            Subform auto refresh based on combobox data</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did the subform called (links) and make the formatting <strong>successfully</strong>, but there are another 2 issues I faced</p>
<p>1) I need the subform (Links) to be automatic filtered based on&nbsp;1 condition in another combobox on the main form which have data changes based on each selection from subform (Links)</p>
<p>2) when I select a record from the subform(Links) by double-click and pass this record to another subform called (Race), I need to write a code to save this record and go to new record in the subform (Race) to receive the next one</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, The data in the combobox changed every time I double click and select from the subform (Links) and what I need is after selection shall I get new data in the subform (Links) and so on</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is new ticket refrence to old ticket (Listbox highlight record )</p>

            <p>1) You can set the Recordsource of your subform based on the value selected in your combo like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub YourCombo_AfterUpdate()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Me.Recordsource = "SELECT blah blah FROM YourTable WHERE SomeField=" &amp; Me.YourCombo.Column(0)</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the value is a Text field, enclose it in quotes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Me.Recordsource = "SELECT blah blah FROM YourTable WHERE SomeField='" &amp; Me.YourCombo.Column(0) &amp; "'"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also Filter instead of doing that, if you'd prefer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub YourComb_AfterUpdate()</p>
<p>&nbsp; Me.YourSubformControlNAME.Form.Filter = "SomeField=" &amp; Me.YourCombo.Column(0)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Me.YourSubformControlNAME.Form.FilterOn = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where YourSubformControlNAME is the name of the Subform CONTROL on your main form, and may or may not be the same as the form you're using as a Subform. Note that if the value is Text, you'll need to enclose it in quotes as mentioned previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Access will save your data when you move off the record, but if you want to force a save you can do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Me.Dirty Then Me.Dirty = False</p>
<p>
</p><p>To go to a new record, run this code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.RunCommand accmdRecordsGoToNew</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must do this from the code module of the Form where you want this to happen, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe it's significant: the system was upgraded with Windows 7 to Windows 10</p>

<p>Stefan, thank you for the attention!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After elaborating the problem with newly created word documents I've found that hyphenation was prohibited by one of my styles borrowed when I'd copied
<em>formatted text</em>. Just the option "<strong><em>Don't hyphenate</em></strong>"&nbsp;was hidden in my old style "Normal" (Paragraph - Line and Page Breaks)... After changing it all works fine.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Hiragana to Kanji conversion not working in Word 2016 on Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    I am working with Word 2016 on a PC running Windows 10. &nbsp;I am attempting to type in Japanese (hiragana, katakana, and kanji as appropriate) and I am having trouble with the input. &nbsp;I can type in hiragana using romaji to hiragana input, however, I cannot
 convert to kanji at all or to katakana without switching the input. &nbsp;In previous versions of Word, when you typed a word in hiragana and pressed the space bar, a drop down menu would appear under the word with suggestions for kanji and katakana. &nbsp;In Word 2016,
 the line under the word appears, suggesting that there should be some sort of option, but the drop down with conversion suggestions does not appear. &nbsp;I have installed the Japanese language pack and I have combed through every setting in both the control panel
 language settings and Word itself to no avail. &nbsp;If anyone can help me figure out how to make this work properly, I would greatly appreciate it.

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to right click on the Hiragana? There should be an option to choose the Kanji. Please see screenshot below:</p>

            <p>Hello Katrina,</p>
<p>Thank you for the pointer. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I have tried doing that, but all that happens is the dark underline disappears. &nbsp;No menu like the one in your screenshot appears. &nbsp;Although, I have noticed my computer seems to struggle with converting romaji input
 into hiragana in Word. &nbsp;(Only Word, though. &nbsp;For some reason the rest of Office seems to give me no problems with typing in Japanese.) &nbsp;I'm not sure if maybe that lag - and it is a pretty severe lag, usually a good 15~30 seconds - between typing the word and
 it showing up or the equally long time it sits there with the blue spinning wheel after right clicking has anything to do with it. &nbsp;I'm not sure if maybe the program just "forgets," for lack of a better descriptor, what it's supposed to be doing somewhere
 in that lag.</p>
<p>Any further information or pointers are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<h2>            Access query field format changes</h2>
                    <p>Alright so I am building a database to keep track of my employees shift cash. An issue that I didn't have earlier just randomly popped up. I have multiple records for the same day i.e. 2 - 3 shifts during a day. I run a query to get the totals cash for a
 day. The query works but when I try to use the query as a subform on a form to report the totals for the day, the format for "day by date" field in the query changes to text, therefore, I cannot link the date field on my daily report form to the query to get
 the value of the total&nbsp; cash of the day. </p>
<p>I have tried setting the format for the field in the query but that didn't help.
</p>
<p>I have set the query to take value from the form's date field but I do not know how to run the query in the background and get the value for a date in to one of the fields on the daily form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is to grab the total cash amount for the day from 2 - 3 records (same date) and populate it in one of the text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Reminders in MAC are not synced with tasks in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reminders in MAC are not synced with tasks in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have interesting issue. When I create reminder in Mac, that is synced to Exchange and task is created.</p>
<p>But wen I create Task in Exchange, the Reminder in Mac is not.</p>
<p>When I modify (rename) task in Exchage, that was originally crieted in Mac, that new name is not synced back to Mac. But interesting is that when I delete original reminder in Mac, then also task in Exchange is deleted although the changed name is different.</p>
<p>So it looks like somehing is blocking communaction Exchange -&gt; Mac. Could you please check that? I tried different Exchange server where I also have account (customer account), and there is it working correctly.</p>
<p>The server name where is it happending you can find from my mail address in profile.</p>
<p>BTW, syncing of contacts is not working at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using El Capitain, with latest update.</p>

<p>Hi Oldrich,</p>
<p>According to your description, I know you have 2 problems in this post. </p>
<p>1. About the task and reminder</p>
<p>The reminder created/deleted in Mac can be synced to Exchange. But, the task created/modified won’t be synced to Mac.</p>
<p>2. About the contacts</p>
<p>They aren’t synced from the both sides at all. </p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood, please correct me and we will further assist you accordingly; if it is the case, Please confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. What mail app are you using in your Mac, the native mail app or Outlook for Mac? No matter what the mail app is, provide us the detailed app version.</p>
<p>2. For “Exchange” (called by you), do you refer to your on-premise Exchange server or anything else (I haven’t found the so called Exchange information from your profile)?</p>
<p>3. What is your detailed Mac OS version?</p>
<p>You can also upload the related screenshots for analysis:</p>
<p>1. The screenshots about the syncing of reminder and task between your Mac and “Exchange”.</p>
<p>2. The screenshots about the “syncing contacts”. Such as, one screenshot is about the newly created contact in your Mac and the other is about the blank part in “Exchange” (not syncing). To upload a screenshot: Click “Use rich formatting”&gt; “Insert media”.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p>Hi Oldrich,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>I have also run <strong>a test</strong> and found that:<br />
1.&nbsp;Connect to my Office 365 account to the native mail app via “Exchange”.<br />
2.&nbsp;Sign into <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA)</a> with my Office 365 account.<br />
3.&nbsp;Create a task in the native mail app and it can be synced to OWA.<br />
4.&nbsp;Create a task in OWA and it can be also synced to Mac. Note: It seems needing to re-start the “reminder” in Mac.</p>
<p>So, my understanding is that the issue might be related to your own Exchange server as you said that (providing the Exchange server version). I’d like to confirm whether you can reproduce it with an Office 365 account (Exchange online). If you don’t have
 the Exchange online account, I can send mine to you via a private message (PM). You can click the following link to see the PM.

<p>hi oldrich,</p>
<p>when i sign into owa and the native mail app in mac, all the tasks (created by you) sync well. also, to identify whether the synchronization works fine, i have created a test task named “is it really” and it is synced to my mac successfully. please see the
 following picture: <br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfcb8be5-3125-4d8d-a95a-1e6562281553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfcb8be5-3125-4d8d-a95a-1e6562281553" /></a></p>
<p>so, my conclusion is that the issue might be related to your native mail app as the test email works fine on my side but not on your side.</p>
<p>given the situation, may i know your native mail app’s version and your mac os’s version?</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>Hi Oldrich,<br />
</p>
<p>I have run through the whole post. Now, I know you are encountering an issue that the Office 365 Exchange can’t sync to your Mac. Given the situation, I suggest you grasp the “synchronization log” in your Mac for analysis. The detailed steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Applications &gt; Utilities folder-&gt;console.app</li><li>Click “Show Log List”.</li></ol>
<p>After your get the log, you can also upload a screenshot about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re very careful with your browsing, then malware detections will be relatively rare, since Windows Defender doesn’t include detections for tracking cookies. You can test Defender’s basic detection functionality with the eicar.com test file:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re concerned about Windows Defender’s overall effectiveness, then you can supplement your coverage with third-party “second-opinion” scanners. &nbsp;These are the malware-removal tools that I generally
 recommend for periodic scanning when you’re using Windows Defender for real-time protection:</span></p>
<p><span>Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus-removal-tool?form=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus-removal-tool?form=1</span></a></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (free version only):</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/</span></a></p>

<p><span>And there’s a longer list of trusted third-party on-demand scanners here:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/407147/answers-to-common-security-questions-best-practices/?p=2413189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/407147/answers-to-common-security-questions-best-practices/?p=2413189</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also be advised that Windows Defender will soon be upgraded to include a new operational mode –
</span><strong><span>Limited Periodic Scanning</span></strong><span>. This will allow users of third-party AV apps to supplement their protection by running periodic scans with Windows Defender via Automatic Maintenance. This should be welcome news to everyone
 who’s been struggling to get Windows Defender&nbsp;running alongside their favorite third-party AV app.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And of course&nbsp;this will also allow people who aren't&nbsp;too happy with Windows Defender to switch to a third-party alternative and then use Defender for the supplemental protection. However, the old rule of thumb –
</span><strong><span>only one real-time antivirus provider</span></strong> – <span>
will still&nbsp;apply in order to avoid turf conflicts and performance issues:</span></p>

<p>Hi PcWork,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately iSync plugins have not been made available for your phone model. You may also be aware that Apple has not included iSync to their Mac OS since Snow Leopard, as they are moving on to cloud based synchronisation of contacts, calendar etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can do, however, is to first synchronise your device contacts and calendar with Google mail (for example) and then synchronise it with iCal. For more information on how to achieve this, please see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/5B679FB9-27D9-4C1E-A109-B3E4305CC3FD">
here</a>&nbsp;(even though the post is for Nokia Lumia, the Mac part should apply).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that most searches point to this recent thread about syncing the newer entry-level Nokia models but with little support from Nokia itself for Mac users, I'd have to give you props for creating the plug-in. Unless I missed a post somewhere regarding
 my intended plug-in, of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Nokia, the boards, in general, do need some active responses from you, too. Wading through search results but with little or no useful or targeted responses from Nokia makes using the discussion boards little frustrating. Quite an opposite experience
 to the user-friendliness of Nokia phones.</p>

<p>Thank you, @N_311.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it helps that there exists a solution, it's a little frustrating that it does not (and may not even) come as a patch or an official download. I read through "Apropos' " site as provided by @aspergerguy in his post and it looks like a hit-and-miss process
 developers' delight but not a casual end-user like myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still and all, your reply provides enlightenment. Much appreciated.</p>
