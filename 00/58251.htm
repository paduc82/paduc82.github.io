<h2>            Why does Windows force Windows 10 users to automatically update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why does Windows force Windows 10 users to automatically update windows, when these updates are flawed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example, December 2017 was forced to update windows, after which bluetooth was disabled and did not appear under settings, so I could not enable it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took half an hour of googling and searching the internet in order to enable bluetooth again. Further the bluetooth support driver was not only disabled, it was set to only start manually! and not automatically. If an update is not thoroughly tested it should
 not be forced on users. </p>

<p>Its ridiculous behaviour and at this point they must be either doing it out of spite, actually pointless stubbornness or actually completely out of touch with and don't care about their customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasn't feeling too well at work last night so took it easy for a couple of hours and fired up my 2 in 1 tablet to watch a movie - despite having connection metering set Windows update decided to kick in - probably because the device hadn't been turned on
 for a week or so - so the first half hour was constant crackling of the audio and frequent rebuffers while Windows update was making heavy use of CPU and disc IO and obviously putting additional drain on the battery!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite having connection metering set it somehow downloaded an additional 1.1GB of data though not sure what was going on there as most updates showed as queued though two had a message something like "download failed - retry when not on a metered connection"
 but I'm guessing they were trying to download. As I was tethered on my 4G (which has fairly limited data) I wasn't too impressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm left with the dilemma now - I could use (and trust) 3rd party software to completely disable Windows update so I can actually use my tablet like it is intended but as I'm often using that device in a public place and less secure connections than at home
 I like to stay on top of security updates but using software to forcefully stop Windows update behaviour makes it a lot more work to get updates when needed so hmm...</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Which update are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed that when you open the 10 web pages in the EDGE browser, you close the browser and when you restart the EDGE browser you will be able to see all the 10 web pages will be loaded which you have opened before you have closed the EDGE
 browser. This will happen only when you set the option to <strong><span>open the tabs</span></strong> with
<strong><span>previous web pages</span></strong> in EDGE browser.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To set the option, open EDGE browser, click on (…) <strong><span>More options</span></strong> at the top right corner of the EDGE browser, click on
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong>, set the <strong><span>Open with</span></strong> option to
<strong><span>Previous pages</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have any suggestions about EDGE browser, you may post the suggestions in Windows feedback app. So that it will be helpful to developers to integrate the suggestions provided in future if it is possible. Open the Windows feedback from all apps
 installed in your computer and post the suggestions in Windows feedback app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly let us know if you need any further assistance with Windows. We are glad to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Anju,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure which update since Windows must does its updates as it likes. I just thought there had been some updates in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, I have 'Open with previous pages' selected in Settings. Edge was working as expected till just recently. Now every time Edge is closed it loses my previous pages. And, yes, I have checked to ensure that 'Open with previous
 pages' is still selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how I can fix it?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could find which update that cause this issue, I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the update and check if it helps. You may follow the step below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press
<strong><span>Windows key + R</span></strong> to open the run command.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Type
<strong><span>appwiz.cpl </span></strong>and press
<strong><span>enter </span></strong>to open programs and features.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. On the left pane, click "<strong><span>view installed updates</span></strong>".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Here, the update that you have installed will be located.'</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. To uninstall, right click on it and select "uninstall".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Once it is uninstalled, proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, I suggest you to perform system restore and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting
 personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature called <strong>system protection
</strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the link below to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time. Refer to the Section Restore from a system restore point in the link.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I was not able to identify any updates that might have been causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My most recent close and re-open of Edge successfully opened with previous tabs.</p>

<p>You can only buy the Family Gold Plan via the console through the dashboard. So long as you have a valid credit/debit card attached to your account you should be all set to get it.
</p>
<p>If you don't see the option to purchase the Family Gold Plan on your dashboard then it may not be available to you in your location.</p>

<p>Sorry, I meant I can print with a USB cable</p>
<p>I have a wireless router</p>
<p>I have more than one icon in devices and printers but have nominated one as default&nbsp;</p>
<p>To print the test page wirelessly I right click on the device&gt;printer properties&gt;general which gives me the option of printing the test page (which it does wirelessly and successfully)</p>
<p>When I try to print with cable disconnected it tells me that the printers is offline&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlighted ports tab says CNBJNP 60128B20AA45 followed by Description Canon Bj Network..Canon MG3600 series printerXPS (Copy1), Canon MG3600 series printer (copy2), Canon MG3600 series printer (copy1)</p>
<p>Enable bidirectional support is highlighted.</p>

</p><blockquote>I have more than one icon in devices and printers but have nominated one as default
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Which of the two MG3650 icons do you use when you print the test page wirelessly?&nbsp; The "Default" printer (with the check mark icon) or the other one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you print a test page wirelessly from both icons?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your description of what you see on the Ports tab is a bit garbled, but as near as I understand it, you are a victim of Canon's efforts to "simplify" wireless printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take a screenshot of the Ports tab for each of the MG3650 icons in Devices and Printers.&nbsp; Indicate which one is your Default printer.&nbsp; For directions, see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the front panel controls on your MG3650 to determine its current IP address (see p. 210 of your user manual):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press and hold the Wi-Fi button and release when the ON lamp flashers</li><li>Press the Wi-Fi button again and two pages should print with network information</li></ul>
<p>Look for TCP/IPv4 and the next line should be IP address.&nbsp; Please report this in your Reply.&nbsp; Save the printout.&nbsp; I may have more questions later.</p>

            <p>Thank you once again</p>
<p>Both of the MG3650 icons will print a test page wirelessly</p>
<p>I have taken screenshots of the ports for each of the two icons in Devices and Printers. However I am having difficulty in inserting the images in this reply. When I right click on the screenshot file I am not offered the choice of Open and Upload. Can you
 help?</p>
<p>The IP address for TCP/IPv4 is 192.168.1.131</p>
<p>So I have been able to answer most of your queries but I am unable to insert the images in this reply.</p>
<p>Right clicking on the screenshots gives</p>
<p>Preview</p>
<p>Set as desktop background</p>
<p>edit</p>
<p>print</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Open with</p>

<p>Share with</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>send to</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>properties</p>
<p>The port for the default printer is CNBJNP_60128B20AA45</p>
<p>Another icon has port USB003</p>
<p>Yet another icon has port WSD_27913814-8dab-4b79-8102-ebffa0efbd92.006e</p>
<p>There are 4 icons in total</p>
<p>Would a solution be to uninstall and reinstall?</p>
<p>Many thanks for your patience</p>

            <p>You write that there are 4 icons in Devices and Printers.&nbsp; I'm only interested in the icons that appear to be related to your Canon MG3650.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer connected to your router wirelessly or with an Ethernet cable?</p>
<p>Do you have other computers/printers/smartphones/other devices that connect wirelessly to your router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further screenshot instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not right click on the file you saved as the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, open a Reply window here and click on the icon in the Reply window's tool bar that looks like a picture of a mountain with the sun over it.&nbsp; This icon is shown circled in red in the second image in my earlier post.&nbsp; When you click that icon, you
 should see this window pop up:</p>

</p><p>Dear LemP</p>
<p>First of all I admire your patience and your evident expertise.</p>
<p>Above are the captured images. The devices image shows my muddled attempts to install the printer&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is wirelessly connected to the router</p>
<p>I have an iPad and apple phone connected to the router on demand.</p>
<p>Again I repeat that I can print perfectly well wirelessly from my iPad and with a cable from my PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

    <title>Keyboard input incorrect after updated to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard input incorrect after updated to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So I updated to windows 10, and everything was fine until I realised that the mt keyboard input was incorrect. I have changed my region and language setting successfully, and the keyboard input along with it. Yet the problem persists. I have logged in and
 out and restarted several times, once after every major change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what could possibly be wrong, whenever I try to find an answer online I just get the instructions to change the language settings etc.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Which was the recent update which was installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below Steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check if the issue resolves in
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode.</span></strong><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer this </span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article to boot to safe mode</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state</span><strong><span>.</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>

<strong>install all the pending updates.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><br /></p><p>as bowski477 mentioned, the Enforcement teams don't use the forums at all and they only communicate through a <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Case Review</a>. Some enforcement actions including, but not&nbsp;limited to&nbsp;24 Hour communications suspensions and Console Suspensions are not reviewable.&nbsp;You can find more information in these cases through the communication sent by the teams to the email address associated with your Xbox Live Gamertag. Remember that all suspensions are only enforced when a breach of the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Services Agreement</a> has happened.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Have you seen any more information in regards to this suspension in your email inbox associated with your Microsoft Account? Please be sure to check your spam folders as sometimes the communication can be sent there instead. It's very possible the suspension on your account is not listed on the enforcement website, but was communicated to you via email instead, since not all enforcement actions are case reviewable.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

</div>
<div>I have two computers with windows 7 connected through a wireless network. I can see the each computer, but I cannot access shared files for some reason. I've been trying to figure this out for hours, but I am at a loss. Something this simple shouldn't
 be this hard to do.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I get an error: windows cant access (name). You do not have permission to access (name). Contact your admin to request access.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have no idea what to do, all I am trying to do is share some files. I've tried setting up a homegroup, but it doesnt work. I even made a temporary network from computer to computer, but I always get the same error when trying to access the other computer's
 files. Any ideas what the problem is?<br />

    <title>MS Jigsaw on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silvabod  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Jigsaw on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Have tried a large number of suggestions, the only result is losing all my own purchased puzzle data gained over many months.</p>
<p>Problem is - on loading a puzzle, the advert comes on, plays to completion BUT the "X" (cancel icon top right of ad screen) does not work.</p>
<p>Have tried the following suggestions -</p>
<p>Checked for updates (both W10 and games) - </p>
<p>Uninstalled and re-installed MS Jigsaw (several times)</p>
<p>Ran "msreset".</p>
<p>I have both w10 and games updates on autoload anyway.</p>
<p>No success, major loss of all data.&nbsp; Situation I now have is that "my collections" no longer displays - when I choose a jigsaw I've done in the past, it downloads, but with the star levels I had previously acheived.</p>
<p>Choosing a "new" one, which I pay for - cannot use it because the advert freezes.</p>

            Hi Silvabod
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />1. Download and run the problem solver for applications and the Windows Store: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a>
<br />
<br />2. Manually restore store settings:
<br />
<br />a) Press the Windows + R keys to open the Run window.
<br />
<br />b) Type wsreset.exe and press the Enter key to execute the command.
<br />
<br />3. Wait for the process to finish, restart your computer and check that it has been fixed.

            Hi Silvabod
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try launching Jigsaw again and check if it works.
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Microsoft Jigsaw
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Terminate
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates       
        </p>

<p>Andre, many thanks for your interest.</p>
<p>For info - my PC has W10 Professional, version 1809 OS build 17763.379.&nbsp; 4GB RAM, and HDD has 300+ free GB.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Virus-free, and frequent CCleaner runs takes care of the accumulated cr#p.&nbsp; </p>
<p>FWIW, Windows now takes an age to load up (about 2 mins to see apps logos after password, another 5 mins of heavy disk activity before full functionality).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Cable internet, claimed 100mb/s, actual 89mb/s average on test.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also FWIW, last major download of W10 update took about an hour to download, over 4 hours to install!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So -</p>
<p>Actioned 1/ - it reported problems, so I followed the procedure as detailed</p>
<p>Actioned 2/ - (I'd already done this from a previous suggestion) but did it again anyway.</p>
<p>The shutdown/reboot process indicated changes being made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately to no avail - exactly the same problem. Jigsaw attempts to load a puzzle, stalls at the end of the advert, no cursor functionality whatsoever, only option, terminate the app (this includes trying to download the advertised game).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked perfectly up to 2 days ago, having been installed for several months.&nbsp; I usually invoke it from the Solitaire suite - both Solitaire and MahJong work perfectly.</p>
<p>I can also trigger it individually from the taskbar, unfortunately it gives the same problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any further suggestions would be welcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
        </p>

            I would recommend you try performing a system restore before this happened. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point more before the problem started.

<p>The one and only visible restore point is today's date, critical update as the result of your earlier advice.</p>
<p>No idea why this should be, there was a major update loaded yesterday that took 5 hours!</p>

            Enabling the Administrator account needs to be done from Command Prompt. See the following article for details. 
<br />
<br />Here is a visual step:

<br />
<br />The step I would try to see if it helps is to remove Jigsaw manually.
<br />
<br />Download the following utility, extract it

<br />
<br />Launch it, scroll through the list then select Jigsaw
<br />
<br />Click Remove
<br />
<br />Restart then redownload Jigsaw then sign in.
<br />
<br />Get Microsoft Jigsaw - Microsoft Store

<p>Andre, success, I believe.&nbsp; the link

https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a><br />
seems to have done the trick.</p>
<p>Altho all my previous pictures in "my list" are lost, I find they can be recovered individually by downloading from the master list (bit confusing when a puzzle is marked "new" and I'd already done it!)</p>
<p>However, the major objective was to get Jigsaw working again - you/we acheived that, for which many thanks.&nbsp; May sound stupid, but I like to keep my brain active.&nbsp; The old grey cells are rapidly approaching their eighth decade, so need stimulation - this
 is one way of doing it.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>This morning - completed an open jigsaw, started another.</p>
<p>Exact repeat of the problem - started the load process, paused for the ad which played to completion, then screen freeze, no function available except exit Jigsaw.</p>
<p>What now, please?</p>

<h2>            -Problemas con el bazar de xbox live-</h2>
                    
<p>... Todo comenzo cuando amaneci de "buenas" un día, y al iniciar el juego de Halo Reach, me dio la curiosidad por jugar el nuevo paquete de mapas desafiant, entonces me dirigi a crear una partida personalizada para conocerlos mejor y sin prisas,&nbsp;busque dichos
 mapas y&nbsp; posteriormente inicie la descarga. Todo iba bien, marchaba sin problemas mientras comia una pan con mermelada.</p>
<p>Cuando llego a su fin el lapso de espera, el menu de inicio del juego se encontraba en mi tele, con ansiedad&nbsp;regrese al modo de partidas personalizadas para ampliar mis orizontes del universo de Halo, me quede como chango sin su banana cuando vi que esta
 maquina no me permitia disfrutar de algo que YO HABIA PAGADO, QUE ME HABIA COSTADO!!.Me decia como al principio... pulsa&nbsp;"A" para drescargar (o algo asi)...&nbsp; --no le di importancia y lo ignore... y me dige a mi mismo casi estas en Bel-Air--... ah no eso no
 paso.&nbsp;Me fui al matchmaking, y otra vez!! --uno o mas jugadores no tienen los mapas recomendados para el juego o algo asi...</p>
<p>Yo no puedo jugar mi nuevos mapas, pero eso si... me descontaron los puntos del precio del complemento!!! ò_ó&nbsp; QUE CHISTOSOS!!!</p>
<p>Que pasa? Por que no puedo jugar estos mapas?</p>
<p>-Ya&nbsp;apague y encendi la consola</p>
<p>-Borre los mapas de la memoria y los volvi a a bajar!</p>
<p>-Borre la cahce del sistema</p>
<p>-Incluso (como al volver a la pantalla de descarga me ponian otra vez el precio) intente comprarlos otra vez (algo muy tonto pero la desesperacion actuo sobre mi) PERO NADA</p>
<p>-Me tropese, se me cayo el control y llegue tarde a un compromiso pensando, ME HAN ROBADO!</p>
<p>Revise en mi correo las notificaciones de compra de esas cosas y solo estaba la adquisicion de 1000 puntos (que use para&nbsp;tal motivo)&nbsp;y la compra de unas cosas para el avatar. Pero revise en la pag de microsoft y&nbsp;ahi estaba, en el historial, con la fecha
 de cuando ocurrio esto. lo que significa que si esta registrada esta actividad.</p>
<p>Espero me puedan ayudar y me digan con quien diablos debo de hablar.</p>
<p>Aprecio sus participaciones esperando un gran numero de ellas.</p>
<p>SALUDOS!!</p>

<p>De casualidad los bajaste desde el menu de descargas dentro del juego? Sobre que hacer, ya hiciste lo indicado y al parecer no se arreglo el problema, la buena noticia es que tienes el contenido en tu historial de compras, te aconsejo lo siguiente:</p>
<p>1. Borra tu gamertag.</p>
<p>2. Borra el contenido que descargaste, en este caso el Defiant Map Pack.</p>
<p>3. Borra el Cache.</p>
<p>4. Recupera tu Gamertag.</p>
<p>5. Desde tu computadora, accede al menu de Historial de Descargas (se encuentra en la opcion de "Mi Cuenta" arriba en esta pagina).</p>
<p>6. Procede a poner en la Cola de Descargas el DLC.</p>
<p>Espero esto logre ayudar, en caso contrario, te aconsejo que hables a Soporte Tecnico y comentes tu aventura, Mucha suerte Hilde.</p>

<p>Que tal!, sí, ya hice los pasos que habias mencionado, pero sigue sin haber respuesta, incluso cambie el disco duro a otra consola por aquello de que mi disposotivo estuviera dañado, pero tampoco!</p>
<p>Y con respecto a la pregunta que me haces al principio, sí, asi fue. De hecho estoy creyendo que fue ahi donde ocurrio el problema, dentro del mismo menu de descargas del juego, a lo mejor no estan bien hechas las cosas por ahi y pasan esos errores o que
 se yo.</p>
<p>Creo que debi haberlos bajado directamente del bazar y no de lugares que puedan redirigir la direccion de descargas de complementos, pero es que ademas yo confie en todo jeje, no crei que hubiera algun problema si los bajo desde los mismos menus del juego...
 pero bueno parece ser que sabes algo al respecto de ese tema. Espero me puedas ayudar y comentar acerca de este metodo que yo use, y que pues, me desepciono.</p>
<p>Gracias y si persisten las molestias, consultare al Soporte Tecnico... jeje</p>
<p>SALUDOS!!</p>

<p>Ah, lo que yo te comentaba era que hicieras los pasos que te mencione al mismo tiempo, de esta forma es mas probable borrar cualquier "daño" en tu perfil, ya que no es cosa del disco o la consola.</p>
<p>Ya han habido varios casos en los que los archivos que bajas desde el menu dentro de un juego salen dañados, a mi me paso con un video, 2 veces, es por eso que nunca confie de nuevo en este tipo de descargas y mejor consigo todo por el Bazar.</p>

<p>Pero bueno, no se si me puedas proporcionar el telefono de Soporte Tecnico y pues, haber que me dicen, te lo agradeceria mucho, al menos se que no fui el unico al que le pasan estos robos caray...</p>

<p>Muchas gracias por tu apoyo!! hable y me comentaron que debia borrar desde la interfaz en la memoria del juego de Halo, un archivo llamado bungie pro, ya que solo se podian 2 elementos del bazar de esta categoria &nbsp;ahi,y pues como te piden los 2 paquetes
 de mapas, es logico que se deba borrar este, y de inmediato se soluciono el problema.</p>
<p>De nuevo gracias por tu interes en mi bronca, y que bueno que no fue tan grave el asunto.</p>
<p>YA PUEDO JUGAR!!!!</p>

            Good day! I apologize that you are having this issue and I am hoping we can work through it and fix it.
<br />
<br />You can use DDU to uninstall the driver and then you just need to reinstall the most recent amd driver. 
<br />
<br />ddu here: <a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />As for the driver automatically downloading, you can turn that off. 
<br />
<br />Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System &gt;  Advanced system settings &gt;  hardware &gt; device installation settings &gt; tick the option for no 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps

    <title>Taskbar not fitting after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shar.nyun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar not fitting after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Originally, before I had updated my Windows 8 to Windows 10, my resolution worked fine (2048x1152); however, after the update, my taskbar no longer fits and I had to go down to a resolution of 1680x1050 just to get the taskbar to fit. Did this occur to
 anyone else? It's just tedious since I have to change all my previous settings to a resolution of 1680x1050.&nbsp;

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to iMac wireless internet network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebelt24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to iMac wireless internet network</h2>
                    I own 2 computers, an iMac (late 2008 OSX 10.5.8 or Leopard) and a MacBook Pro retina display (15-inch 2012 OSX 10.8.4 or Mountain Lion).
<div>The Macbook Pro retina has Windows 8 installed onto it with the correct drivers installed from Bootcamp.<br />
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The iMac has an ethernet port while the MacBook does not and being at college the wireless is God awful.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However I have found a way around this, I created a wireless internet network with my iMac and connected to it with my MacBook Pro.</div>
<div>Using a WEP password encryption (supported by Windows 8)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However after installing bootcamp with windows 8 and the drivers I am able to connect to my college wireless with ease, but not my wireless internet network.</div>
<div>Fearing I had typed the password in incorrectly I checked the password that was assigned to the network and it was correct</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After fiddling with the settings on my iMac I discovered something. I can connect to the network when internet sharing on the iMac is turned off but when I turn internet sharing on i cannot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone faced this problem?</div>
                </div>

            <p>What recent update was installed that has affected your printer, for example were you offered an optional update such as a printer driver? If it was a printer driver that was installed, then try rolling back the driver and get an update from the manufacturer's
 site.</p>
<p>If it was some other update, what was the update and&nbsp;does the problem persist if you remove the update?</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem with my printer&nbsp;with updates to Windows 7 on 6/13/12. I purchased the HP Deskjet&nbsp;printer about 3 weeks ago and it was working fine before the updates were installed.&nbsp;It will not print emails on AOL 9.6 or 9.7 or articles from
 the internet. I can access AOL online using Windows Explorer or Google Chrome and the printer works.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; restored Windows 7&nbsp;prior to 6/13/12&nbsp;and the printer&nbsp;worked fine until the subsequent downloads of windows 7 updates gave me the same problem. The message I kept getting was "Windows Installer Service could not be accessed. This can occur if Windows Installer
 is not correctly installed."</p>
<p>I called HP and the tech tried all kinds of&nbsp;solutions including re-installing the drivers. He got the printer to work when I logged onto the net with Google chrome so he thinks the problem is with Internet Explorer 9.
</p>
<p>So it appears that there is a definite&nbsp;compatibility issue with the drivers that come with the printer on the disc&nbsp;and the Windows 7 updates and that issue seems to be related to Windows Installer.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if there was a patch for the drivers to solve this problem. Based on the response from the tech (In India of course) they are not aware of any issues. I am as lost&nbsp; as you are at this point. Very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Well I did some trouble shooting myself and i found out the printer is "busy" I checked what it was doing in it's task screen, it was blank so i tried to run the print sample and still busy. I ran the doctor thing from the website it says it is ok.</p>

            HP has all kinds of additional printer drivers if you want to pay $24.95. Until I can get a handle on what is happening here I am really not sure if that would correct the problem. &nbsp;Obviously in my case there is an&nbsp;incompability issue between windows 7&nbsp;updates
 and AOL software.&nbsp;I would think there would be an HP&nbsp;patch for the driver that would correct this. The 2050 is a very inexpensive printer but it prints great in B/W and color and has a great scanner. It looks as if I will have to log onto AOL with Goggle Chrome
 to print mail or an article off the internet.

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Thank you for quick answer.</p>
<p>I tried to use ping in cmd and it works! Maybe, there is a problem with browser or some settings?</p>

<p>i don't think slip of the tongue counts towards the 100% from what i've read... it was a pre-order bonus similar to naked city....

<p>Do you mean 100% all the 'cheevos or 100% the game? As you'll be able to 100% the game, just not the 'cheevos.</p>
<p>Think they will add both 'The Naked City' and 'Slip of the tongue' to the market place soon. Otherwise it's a bit unfair to list achievments then not allow you to get them.</p>

<p>You won't require either DLC for the 100% completion achievement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot play every extra DLC case yet but these are supposed to be generally available after a set amount of time.</p>

<p>Slip of the Tongue was Play.com's exclusive. Rockstar have said all the retailer specific content will be available as DLC after a certain amount of time. So you'll have to wait, or buy it again from play.com</p>
