<h2>            Nokia E72 - None of my phone ringtones &#40;call, text, alarm, calendar&#41; can be customised anymore&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted a thread the other week stating that I couldn't re-customise my alarm tone after switching it off (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/FD9B7175-A193-4E55-8854-1108226C4497">/t5/Eseries-and-Communicators/Nokia-E72-alarm-ringtone-no-longer-customisable/td-p/913031</a>).
 However, I've just realised this is also the case for all my other types of ringtones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from my alarm tone, all my other types of ringtones (call, text and calendar) still have their custom tone (ie, a file I have put on my phone manually), however, if I go in to edit the tone, none of my manually input sound files come up as available
 for the ringtone - only the default ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what has happened? It never used to be like this, it just randomly happened the other week. Have I somehow accidentally turned off the ability to have custom tones displayed? Help!</p>

<p>This didn't work; it just lagged on "Refreshing. 0 Files added" indefinitely. (There was no "refresh playlist option, by the way. There was just "refresh library")</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea why my manually-input sounds aren't showing up on any ringing tone list? It's driving me mad!</p>

<p>When your custom ring tones didn't appear in the ring tone list, did you try closing and re-opening the list a few times?&nbsp; I may have seen this before, where the list process seems constrained by some kind of timeout.&nbsp; The list displays, but in the background,
 the entire list is still being built.&nbsp; Try it 2 or 3 times to make sure that's not it.&nbsp; Otherwise, try stopping and restarting the music library refresh operation, to see if something there eventually gives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of that helps, are your custom ring tones on the phone or on the SD card?&nbsp; There may be a hack you could use to manually rebuild the list.&nbsp; Or perhaps find a short, dummy ring tone that you could copy to that directory, with the hope of further jogging
 the list or rebuild processes.</p>

            you must have contact stored on phones memory to assign tones<br />
also to change each tone you must go to the repsective folder as for clock alarm and profiles for email alert<br />
<br />
try a factory reset type in *#7780# security code is 12345

<p>i hope u need no hard reset or a restore to&nbsp; a factory setting the code is *#7370# and&nbsp;default&nbsp;security code is 12345 unless u have&nbsp;changed it and then it would ask u to stop all active calls..etc so you will have to do all of this again but in offline mode
 just press the power button choose offline ,&nbsp;it's a night mare u will lose every thing as it came out of the box (new) contacts messages every thing :( unless you have a recent backup so don't do it now try the following first :</p>
<p>&nbsp;well some how music players sometimes carshes</p>
<p>ok it's easy you just connect your device with your&nbsp;pc via usb (in mass storage mode it's fine)</p>
<p>and then&nbsp;copy all the ring tones u need from your phone to your pc</p>
<p>then delete this tones that u have copied from phone as(a normal flash memory) :) nice and easy</p>
<p>and then disconect phone like a flash memory just from the task bar stop mass storage to remove safely</p>
<p>then&nbsp; go to you music player refresh the liberary again it will be zero :) it's ok then reconnect the device again to your pc recopy them to ur sound folder/tones (for the small tones) or digital folder fo the large music files and songs (optional)</p>
<p>then stop and disconnect&nbsp;your device memory from task bar again like&nbsp;usb storage(flash memory)</p>
<p>then got to your music player and see if ur&nbsp; files is there on (playlist/recently added) if not</p>
<p>just refresh ur liberary again on the (music player/option/refresh liberary)</p>
<p>hope this would help i know how u feel my |E72 drives me crazy :(</p>

<p>I know it's been ages since the last reply, but I've finally gotten around to doing everything you guys suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTHING WORKED. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a soft reset and a hard reset, but the fact remains that I am incapable of assigning custom tones for calls, texts, alarms, and calendar notifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could the issue be?! How is it possible that it is still like this after a hard reset?! I always ued to be able to change them at my leisure until one it it just randomly stopped letting me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really want to resolve this, because I probably will want to change my customised tones one day.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear this problem is still plaguing you.&nbsp; So we're all caught up, would you tell us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Is the problem still a matter of getting the custom tones to appear in the list?</p>
<p>2) Where are your contacts stored (phone, SIM, etc.), and (specifically) where are your custom ringtones stored?&nbsp; (By "custom" I assume you mean sound files that you copied or downloaded to the phone yourself.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't typically use custom tones on my E73, but will play with it for a while tonight.</p>

<p>have u tried my idea yet? well i faced this on n81 8gb and the phone suddenly was unable to read my sound files ( i guess after i copied a song file mp3 it was working fine on windows xp but on the phone&nbsp; it crashed the playlist) &nbsp;even on the music player
 and i did that and it worked just fine</p>
<p>so may be there is a corrupted file that u have recently added and it crashed the whole playlist.</p>

            1) Yes, whenever I go into to edit the tone for say my ringtone, message tone, alarm tone or calendar tone, only the default files are appearing on the list, not any of the ones I've manually added myself (which appear in the music library, though)<br />
2) I'm not too sure where I've stored them. I think what I'm going to do now is another hard reset and just start my phone all over again (what has happened now is that since I did a hard reset, Snaptu refuses to reinstall, which was the one app that I really
 used a lot). If I start from scratch I'm hoping everything will be how it used to be (that is, after I hard reset and this time not reload my phone with my backup files).

<p>as for the snaptu app may be it didn't want to install if it was on memory card so a hard reset won't remove it as u must first format the memory card then hard reset ur phone</p>
<p>also it may help u with ur problem as it may be a memory card issue&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel - Copy Pasting in Reverse Order</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,<br />
<br />
I have been searching for this answer everywhere and have tried several things, but nothing has worked so far.<br />
<br />
I want to reverse paste a column in excel. There are about 9048 cells. That is to say, I want the 12/12/1980 cell to be the first on my list, and the 27/10/2016 to be right at the bottom. Of course, the numbers in each cells are not in linear (i.e. 1,2,3,4
 etc...). Those numbers relate to daily share prices and have fluctuated constantly.</p>
<p><br />
Your help would be much appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

<h3> chrishawnspackman  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project - HELP PLEASE - Multiple resources across multiple activities across multiple developments</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; I am struggling on an urgent planning exercise, and appreciate your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple developers each developing one 'module' at a time, but I have the same 3 resources assigned to perform activities such as, validation, testing, create test cases, training, and documentation for EACH module.&nbsp; I have the resource availability
 in the resource table (ranges from 30-75% per resource), and assigned to the tasks, and the work associated.&nbsp; I have the predecessors set through the first several development cycles.&nbsp; Finally, some tasks occur, then wait, then start up&nbsp;again.&nbsp; For example,
 I test, the developer fixes, then I retest.&nbsp; In most cases, the fixes&nbsp;continue after I completed my&nbsp;testing, so there is a 'gap' in time whereby the testing resource could do other&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;then must come back to the retesting work for the previous module.&nbsp;
 The scheduling is 'working fine' through the first one or two cycles, but once we get deeper into additional modules, I don't understand how to 'roll resources to tasks during gaps, and roll them back' if you will.&nbsp; Make sense?&nbsp;<strong> I need&nbsp;resources to
 keep making progress across multiple fronts by being assigned work each week that is ready, and whereby the resource is available.&nbsp; UGH!</strong></p>

<p>ChrishawnSpackman,</p>
<p>If you're looking for some automated way to have Project allocate resources to fill the "gaps" then I'm sorry but that won't happen. Project just doesn't have that level of automated scheduling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, your description sounds very detailed, (e.g. resource effort back and forth across multiple tasks), and your best bet might be to scale back the detail and take a more general approach. Perhaps a better approach is to generalize tasks within a module
 such that they are fixed duration and run in parallel. Assign resources as appropriate but forego the detail of exactly when a particular resource will be working on a particular task, it's likely not relevant. The only concern is that the task be completed
 in the given time (i.e. duration). This may require you to increase a resource's Max Units such that overallocation doesn't cloud the issue, or set the leveling option to look at larger "chunks" (i.e. month by month).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many years ago I was faced with a similar development scenario wherein there was a series of develop, test, fix, test, fix, etc. task elements. Attempting to track the full spectrum of detail was simply not worthwhile, so we backed off to a more general
 approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd start by determining exactly what you NEED from Project. Then set up the plan to meet those needs. If for some reason you truly need all the detail you describe, then bite-the-bullet and be prepared to spend a lot of time detail managing the plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>John, thank you very much for taking the time to reply.&nbsp; In fact, that is what I am now doing to see where I land, and how it looks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate question from stakeholders is when do I get each module, for how much (may be able to answer that with 'here is when we run out of money in general" - and when do I need to decide to keep going before starting the next module (how much savings
 in time and schedule to NOT do one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>FUN!&nbsp; Very appreciative, thank you again.</p>

<p>You're welcome and thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like your stakeholders are only really interested in the end result, and not so much as to how you get there. That's how it should be, so unless you need more detail for your own needs, I'd definitely cut out unnecessary minutia.</p>

                    <div>
<p>Hi, when I start recording videos on my Lumia 950, the video turn out to be too pixelated. Not normal at all and when I zoom in while recording, it's all pixels and no detail at all ... This wasn't happening before. I'm currently traveling and noticed it
 while making videos.</p>
<p>

<div>
<p>I generally stick to 1080p 60fps, stored on my phone memory. Also, my camera shutter hardware button has stopped working.</p>

            So I have the 950XL and have not experienced that issue. If I was I would Hard Reset to see if it works as expected. I would test it from a clean install, not a backup and before I added any additional software. Just my thoughts...

<p>Hi Jack, Thanks for your input. I tried that as well. Performed hard reset and did a clean install, but still the same results. After trying everything I wrote here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>before recording starts, all seems to be fine. The moment I click the recording button, the results are all choppy and full of pixels.</p>

    <title>Ribbon buttons with text only, without icons &#40;where - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ribbon buttons with text only, without icons &#40;where applicable&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to hide the picture icon for Ribbon buttons in Office 2010?&nbsp; In most tabs, there are icons with text either beside or below icons, but the icons themselves are distracting.&nbsp; I'd rather have only the text there.&nbsp; Is it possible to hide the
 icons for buttons that have both icons and text?&nbsp; (or vice versa for those that prefer not to have text at all)</p>
<p>I realize some buttons in the Home tab don't have text at all, and certainly Styles shouldn't be without their preview options, but some icons are just unnecessary.&nbsp; The ribbon is good and all, but I prefer the&nbsp;typographic format UI of Windows Live Essentials
 (Wave 3, not Wave 4), where buttons are just text.&nbsp; It's easier to support other users that are still learning these programs.&nbsp; I can tell them to click the "Reply" button in WL Mail, and they know what that is, because it's as plain as day on the screen with
 the same word.&nbsp; The command is there in plain text, without the distracting icon.</p>
<p>I love the Metro UI stuff in Zune and Windows Phone 7&nbsp;too.&nbsp; I'd like to see more of that coming to Office and Windows, and much sooner too.</p>

<div>Yes you can do most of that, though not without deleting entries and creating new matching entries configures as you wish&nbsp;- or you could do it manually, but it demands some knowledge of ribbon programming. See<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.
 mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm</a>. This is aimed at Word 2007, but the principles are the same for other apps and 2010. It will take a lot of effort to get the results you crave. Wouldn't it be simpler to minimise the ribbon and use keyboard shortcuts instead?</div>

<div>Yes you can do most of that, though not without deleting entries and creating new matching entries configures as you wish&nbsp;- or you could do it manually, but it demands some knowledge of ribbon programming. See<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.
 mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm</a>. This is aimed at Word 2007, but the principles are the same for other apps and 2010. It will take a lot of effort to get the results you crave. Wouldn't it be simpler to minimise the ribbon and use keyboard shortcuts instead?</div>

&nbsp;There are now so many icons that they have just become visual clutter and are no longer helpful. When is Microsoft going to fix this problem? Do we have a date?

            <p>And a stupid design it is, too.</p>
<p>Nested menus with words only are much more understandable to people who actually know how to read, and use computers.</p>
<p>Icons only are for those who are illiterate and they mostly don't use computers.</p>
<p>Icons all look alike, being small pictures that pretty much all look the same, and you have to memorize the meaning of, whereas with words, you can simply read them and understand them perfectly without trying to guess if some icon with several lines across
 it means "center justify" or "tools" or "calendar" or what.</p>
<p>Also, a screen reader is most likely not able to read an icon, but will read words. Your visually impaired customers will not appreciate small pictures which are not viewable, whereas words can be read by just about anyone, even in braille.
</p>
<p>Making the icons take up much more space than words would, is another problem. In order for them to be visible at all, they have to be much taller, taking away screen space on the new, idiotic, wide screens, which is another matter. moving all the menus,
 or ribbon, or what have you, to the worthless "real estate" on the sides would make much more sense, in my opinion. in a vertical toolbar, there is much more room for these things. it's good design, whereas if you have a horizontal menu (and let's face it,
 a ribbon is a much less efficient version of a simple menu) you have more room for icons, or nested menus, whichever.</p>
<p>I think it's why many common OS's such as Xubuntu have a side quick access bar, it makes much more sense than taking away vertical space which is sorely needed for documents or pages. (I'd like to see that implemented by default in the next version of Windows.)</p>

            There are unfortunately more than a few illiterate computer users and unfortunately again, the interface was designed based on the lowest common denominator as far as users are concerned.&nbsp; Windows 8 goes even further in that direction.

            <p>Whoa there boys. If regular computer users can't understand your interface, it's not because they are stupid. It's because the designers of the interface are incompetent an out of touch with how real people use computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an ongoing problem with all Microsoft products. While the engineering and features may be fine, the UI and the documentation are so bad that the efforts of the software engineers are wasted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when a Word MVP makes unsympathetic remarks about the "lowest common denominator", it's no wonder that Microsoft is the most-despised software maker on the planet.&nbsp;<span>IT managers and CIOs love Microsoft, I defy you to find
 any fans among those who actually have to get work done using Microsoft products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So please try to remember that the people who use Microsoft products are doing the best they can with tools that are the opposite of user friendly.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The information that was provided at the time of the adoption of the ribbon is that it was done on the basis of a significant amount of research in Microsoft's Usability Labs into the way "real" users struggled with the previous menu system.</p>

<p>It seems that the issue that you're having has something to do with the third-party driver of your Virtual Box.
<br />
<br />
We recommend uninstalling the third-party driver and contact the Virtual machine's manufacturer for better assistance. You need to know what driver is compatible with your machine.<br />

<p>Report this bug in the Feedback Hub.&nbsp; The Skip Ahead branch is going to have bugs of this kind from time to time.&nbsp; You are unlikely to be able to fix it if it is a bug in the preview because you are not equipped to do so.&nbsp; You should also discuss this in
 the VB community forum at</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>This not the sort of bug that would have a work-around.&nbsp; If 16353 starts and the green screen occurs later in your seesion I suggest you attempt a roll back to your previous build and then move forward again when the next new Skippy build flights.&nbsp; That
 may be as early as Tuesday.&nbsp; If you cannot run a session at all then you need to re-install Windows.&nbsp; That will take you out of the Skip Ahead branch, of course, but if you cannot use the vm you are effectively out of it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the bugs that Insiders are supposed to find so either MSFT or Oracle can fix them, depending on whether it is a coding issue or compatibility issue.&nbsp; We are not supposed to fix the software ourselves (we don't have the tools or the source code).&nbsp;
 Our job is to find them.</p>

    <title>Wrong MathType formula in PowerPoint 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sichel_01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong MathType formula in PowerPoint 2010</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For several days now I have been fighting (in vain) with a very serious unknown problem.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently working on a PowerPoint presentation. However, each morning, Powerpoint tells me that my files (which I had fixed the day before) are corrupt. During the day, I did not note anything. However, in the corrupt files, many, but not all Mathtype
 formula show the right image, but when opened for editing give a totally different formula in the file, from another page. Yesterday I fixed the problem for each corrupt formula. And today, we have the very same problem with the very same wrong formula content
 --- after opening the formula.<br />

<p>Although this talks about Word, the same problem would exist for PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Math Type is an add-in for Office, so you'll need to check with those folks if you want to use it:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equation Editor comes with Office 2010 and is a free add-in for Office 2007/2003.&nbsp; Unless you really, really need to use the Math Type add-in I recommend using the built-in Equation Editor to replace the equations:</p>

<p>Hi ADuffner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround for now ist to create a folder with all the letters on the left side of the slash and then point OneDrive to that folder during setup. It will then automatically create a folder named with all letters on the right hand of the slash, and sync
 to that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case i created the folder "OneDrive - COMPANY X A", OneDrive then created a folder called "S".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps until the bug is fixed.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of folks complaining that they are not getting all emails. In a few instances, they did not get the first email but when that company sent it again (rather forwarded the same first email - which was not received), they received that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a portal where I can check if any email was held (spam or for any other reason)?</p>

            Hi Ashok, <br />
<br />
As an administrator, you can find out what happened to an email message by running a message trace in the Exchange admin center (EAC). After running the message trace, you can view the results in a list, and then view the details about a specific message (<em>Look
 for a delivery status of <strong>Failed</strong> or <strong>Pending</strong> to explain why the message was not received</em>). See
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Why didnâ€™t I receive an expected email message?</a><br />

<p>Hi Mikael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I did check out that and looks fine. The only problem is that the license is only for one year. Any idea what happens after that? Is there a option of permanantly buying it? Also a bit of small query. When i dissconnect a call and
 if its a new number the phone does not ask me if I want to save it... is there a option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mikael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have purchased the ABBY 2.0. When i downloaded it to N97 it said that the software is not compatiable with N97. I still went ahead with the same. It does recognise and sorts the business card but the camera is not initiated from the ABBY Application. I
 have to click a normal picture and then go to ABBYY and select the image and process.... Is it how it is supposed to work ?</p>

<h2>            Importing data from the web to Excel</h2>
                    I am trying to import historical weather data from Weather Underground into Excel using VBA or AppleScript. I have a code that works on Windows to pull data from the site using Internet Explorer, but it doesn't work on my mac. Does anyone know how to go
 about &nbsp;importing data from the web into Excel for Mac? Thanks!

            One way is to use a web query. This article is a bit dated, but the steps are basically the same in XL2011<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been searching for clues as to why my ATT 8525 (HTC Phone) is not being recognized in VISTA 32 bit.</p>
<p>Device Manager shows: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Device as a HTC USB sync under mobile devices but Windows Mobile Device Center&nbsp;will not recognize it. I have followed multiple posts on the internet and have changed many settings to get my Laptop (Sony VIO) to recognize my PDA phone and sync. This worked
 perfectly on my older HP running XP pro. Getting really frustrated seems you have to be a software engineer to get simple connectivity issues resolved.</p>
<p>Can someone help with this?</p>

<p>Rannca, I assume you have installed WMDC (Windows Mobile Device Center) ... correct?</p>
<p>So with your device connected to your PC, open Device Manager and find where your device is listed.&nbsp; It should be listed in two areas: Portable Devices and Network adapters.&nbsp; Chances are, your device is listed only once.</p>
<p>Delete&nbsp;the device from device manager, disconnect your device and reboot your PC and soft reset the device.&nbsp; Reconnect and it should load the drivers and start WMDC.</p>

<h2>            Inbound Connector routing non-accepted domain messages</h2>
                    
<p>i'm having trouble understanding why messages from my on-premises smtp relay server aren't getting rejected by the exchange online inbound connector.&nbsp; per the following article, the following conditions must be met when using digital certification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>connections must have a matching certificate name.</p>
</li><li>
<p>at least one of the following domains must be a verified and accepted domain in office 365:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sender domain</p>
</li><li>
<p>recipient domain</p>
</li><li>
<p>domain name that matches the certificate's subject name.</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>if the only accepted domain configured for my tenant is mydomain.com, why is it that a message sent with the following details is being routed by exchange online and then sent to the external recipient?</p>

<p>i've confirmed that this message actually got routed through eop by reviewing the message header after it was received.&nbsp; if its obvious that i have an incorrect configuration that is enabling this behavior, please point it out.&nbsp; otherwise, would you be able
 to test this configuration yourself to see if you receive the same results?</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

<p>hi me3994,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>to better understand the situation, iâ€™d like to collect some more information for investigation:</p>
<p>1. did you configure a connector to send mail from your device or application using office 365 smtp relay as this
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx#option3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> says?<br />
2. how many email addresses did you configure onto your device or application, just *** Email address is removed for privacy ***? did you configure any email addresses with accepted domains of your office 365 tenant onto your device or application?<br />
3. may i confirm if you goal is as the following: when sending emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to a non-office 365 email address, you want the mail flow wonâ€™t go through exchange online. please kindly correct me if anything is misunderstood.<br />
4. when creating the connector in exchange admin center, which checkbox in the screenshot below did you check?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=26ec564d-ba29-4d5d-9c7a-d9e59adc7f4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d26ec564d-ba29-4d5d-9c7a-d9e59adc7f4e" /></a></p>
<p>if itâ€™s the first one, is the domain you filled into the blank an accepted domain? how about using the second method? is there any improvement?</p>
<p>5. please provide the mail header of a delivered email through smtp relay for analysis. for privacy concerns, i have sent you a private message to collect it. you can check it via the link below:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>
<p>any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>Aaron, is it possible for you to reproduce this test? &nbsp;It can be easily reproduced by creating a connector similar to mine and using telnet or Outlook Express to send the message. &nbsp;Although my connector is currently configured to utilize TLS, you can use
 IP base auth instead. &nbsp; &nbsp;Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Yes, but instead of having the individual LOB apps or devices send directly to EOP, I have a SMTP relay server that they send to and then the message gets relayed to EOP.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Only one address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Based on the information that I've read I would expect that a message would not be routed to an external recipient in this scenario. &nbsp;Looking for you to either confirm my understanding and log a bug or explain why it is functioning this way.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;I've tried with both. &nbsp;IP address and Certificate. &nbsp;When using the cert method, I used an accepted domain. &nbsp;Same result with both configurations, messages originating on-premises can be routed to EOP and then get sent to external recipient.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;ok.</p>

<p>Hi ME3994,</p>
<p>Regarding â€œOddly, the GUI indicates "sender domain is an accepted domain for your organization", but in the PowerShell output, no AssociatedAcceptedDomains are specifiedâ€, actually, the GUI doesnâ€™t indicate that the sender is an accepted domain for your
 organization. It only means the sender domain needs to be a verified domain of your organization so that Office 365 can identify emails sent from your email server.</p>
<p>Additionally, about the #4 option, you said that you had tried both the IP address and Certificate and when using the certificate method, you used an accepted domain. Do you mean that you filled in a accepted domain under the blank of â€œBy verifying that
 the subject name on the certificate that the sending server uses to authenticate with Office 365 matches this domain name (recommended)â€ when creating a new connector? If so, that might be the root cause of the issue. Based on the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.inboundconnector_tlsnamematchyourorgservercert(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>you provided, at least one of the following domains must be a verified and accepted domain in Office 365: a. Sender domain b. Recipient domain c. Domain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject name. Since neither the sender domain nor the recipient
 domain is an accepted domain, you probably triggered the 3rd condition:<em> Domain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject name</em> because youâ€™ve input an accepted domain when creating a new connector. Thatâ€™s why even though the sender and recipientâ€™s
 domains are not verified domains, the mail flow is still working.</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood, please donâ€™t hesitate to post back. Iâ€™m happy to help you further.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Mouran</p>

<p>Per the configuration stated at the beginning of the post, yes, the certificate used for authentication is the accepted domain. &nbsp;You refer to the condition of "Domain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject name" as being the reason that the message
 is accepted, but I interpret this as stating that the connector would accept a message where either the sender domains or recipient domains have the same domain as the certificate used for connector authentication. &nbsp; In my scenario, this isn't the case. &nbsp;Both
 the sender domain and recipient domain are different than the certificate domain. &nbsp; Is my interpretation of the "Domain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject name" condition incorrect?</p>

<p>hi me3994,</p>
<p>i appreciate your update.</p>
<p>from the initial post, i got to know that your only accepted domain configured for your tenant is â€œ<strong>mydomian.com</strong>â€, and the certificatename is also â€œ<strong>mydomain.com</strong>â€. you input a verified domain and the domain name matches the
 certificateâ€™s subject name. this has triggered the 3rd option â€œdomain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject nameâ€.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=24762c69-2f19-49c7-9b6f-0865d18f4b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d24762c69-2f19-49c7-9b6f-0865d18f4b3f" /></a></p>
<p>so, your understanding of the condition â€œdomain name that matches the certificateâ€™s subject nameâ€ is not correct. it doesnâ€™t require the sender domain or the recipient domain to have the same domain as the certificate used for connector authentication. it
 only means the verified domain you input under the blank â€œby verifying that the subject name on the certificate that the sending server uses to authenticate with office 365 matches this domain name (recommended)â€ when creating a new connector matches the certificate
 name.</p>
<p>please let me know if you need further assistance. itâ€™s my pleasure to help you further.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>Mouran, &nbsp;thank you for clarifying what the functionality of a connector is when a certificate is used for authentication. &nbsp;I'm still have some confusion around what the expected behavior is because I've done some additional testing which appears to show
 behavior different to what you're communicating. My new test is the following:</p>
<p>If the only accepted domain configured for my new tenant is mydomain.onmicrosoft.com, Why is it that a message sent with the following details is being routed by Exchange Online and then sent to the external recipient?</p>
<p>From: FromRelay &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>To: "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>Here's my inboundConnector configuration. &nbsp;This is a very basic connector, of which I created in the O365's Exchange web interface. &nbsp;Notice that the TlsSenderCertificate name is not an accepted domain in O365. &nbsp;No subsequent modifications were made to this
 connector. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ME3994,</p>
<p>This is a bit strange, I need to collect some more information to do a test from my side.</p>
<p>So, could you please send me&nbsp;the screenshots about the steps you did to build up the connector for further analysis?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve built up/created a workspace for you to upload&nbsp; screenshots. Please refer to the information&nbsp; in&nbsp; my private message to upload screenshots to the workspace.<br />
Note: Please donâ€™t remove the personal information in the screenshot so that I can troubleshoot the issue better.</p>
<p>Besides that, please send us a screenshot about the detailed setting of the accepted domain: domain.onmicrosoft.com. To check it,&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign in to the EAC, click
<strong>mail flow</strong> &gt; <strong>accepted domains</strong>, and then double click the accepted domain.&nbsp; To upload a screenshot, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> &gt; the <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

            Hi Timothy,
<br />
<br />Change your zoom setting. There is a control on the View menu for that. There should be a control on the bottom right at the end of your status bar.
<br />
<br />Do this with only one document open. Close that document. When you open another document, it should use that setting.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />

<p>I understand you want to open PDF files in Microsoft Teams assignments, based on my test, we cannot directly open a PDF file in assignments, we need to download the PDF file first. But we can open Word, Excel and PowerPoint in Assignments. And I suggest
 you write your feedback of cannot open PDF files in assignments <a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, your voice will be paid high attention to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t login to MS account WP 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I reset my Lumia 1020 yesterday and I can't login to my MS account on the phone. This virtually makes ny phone useless as I would like Store updates and app updates. What is the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My MS account was working 10 minutes prior to the reset.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a MS backend issue. The fact that we can't even type in our credentials shows that the issue is on their end. Hopefully it solves itself in a couple of days.</p>

<h2>            Unable to cancel meeting requests I created</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am currently having an issue with my Outlook 2010.&nbsp; The hard drive in my laptop went bad, but most of the data was still OK.&nbsp; I installed the new hard drive and copied over what I needed from the old drive, including my Outlook PST files.&nbsp; With the new hard
 drive, I set up my email account in Outlook and then did an import of all the messages, calendar events, and everything else from the PST into Outlook.&nbsp; It all appeared to go smoothly, however any meetings that I had set up with meeting requests being sent
 out are uneditable by me.&nbsp; Instead, when I open the appointment in Outlook, I see the following message: "This meeting was copied to your calendar and will not receive updates. To receive updates, contact the organizer, &lt;me&gt;".&nbsp; I am the meeting organizer,
 but it doesn't know it.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what I can do resolve this situation?&nbsp; Thanks for your time!<br />
<br />
Dave<br />

            Do not import the old PST.&nbsp; Just reuse it.&nbsp; Use the Mail applet in Control Panel to add it to the mail profile and make it the default data file, specifying its Inbox as the delivery location for your default account.&nbsp; Start Outlook and it should look
 just like it did before the hard drive replacement.
