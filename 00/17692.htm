    <title>create multiple transparencies in publisher on a photo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrichard127  say:</h3>
<h2>            create multiple transparencies in publisher on a photo</h2>
                    <p>Last December I was able to make multiple transparent edits or changes to photos.&nbsp; After&nbsp;exhausting efforts to re-create the path I was using I am not able to find how I was acomplishing this edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I have discovered that MS Publisher 2010 states the program has the capability of doing only one (1) transparency.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is how can I do multiple color edits or deletions of more than one color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of dozen pictures I have saved that I was able to edit or create multiple transparencies on so I know it is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone assist with this please?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>Use a third party image editor for best results. As 'improved' as the image editing tools in Publisher 2010 may be, they do not come close to what you can do in image editing software that is designed specifically for such work.</p>

<p>Yes, I ended up reinstalling Office and it seems to be working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that a previous update failed partway through: after it had reset the Updated flag but before actually finishing the update.</p>

<p>When I attempt to start Internet Explorer (IE8) on another computer I use that is also running XP Pro with SP3, I get the following error message "The ordinal 410 could not be located in the dynamic link library urlmon.dll"</p>
<p>I've done the process to register urlmon.dll (regsvr32 urlmon.dll) and ran an sfc scan (sfc /scannow) multiple times and still get the error message when trying to start internet explorer. What do&nbsp;I need to yet do to regain access to the internet vi Internet

<div>
<div>
Outlook does work on the problem machine (again, thank you for bringing that idea to the forefront) and I did, last night, email the FixIT (actually, the link to the FixIt solution for reseting the internet explorer settings) and the email was recieved on the
 problem machine. </div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
In fact, I was only guessing that what the page meant by "Help your friends fix their computer problems" would be that it was providing a link to a download which you could then do on your connected machine and then E-mail (or transfer via Sneaker Net) to your
 problem machine.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
Now, I would say the feasibility of this idea is unclear.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. it looks as if all that link does is point back at the list of all possible FixITs, one of which is the page you were given.&nbsp; Sorry for that confusion.<br />
<br />
So then, what can you do with that&nbsp; Run now&nbsp; button?&nbsp; (Apprehensive pause.)&nbsp; Ok!&nbsp; I get a prompt when I click on that which offers to&nbsp; Run or Save&nbsp; an&nbsp; .exe&nbsp; file.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to continue with the idea I would say, use the Save option; save the file on your working
 machine, and either transfer it or E-mail it to the problem one, which is where you will finally execute it--all without involving IE's ability to connect to the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div>
As far as the issuing of commands - the file association on the problem machine for the ".cpl" extension is the same as on my other PC, where the commands do work. (Both machines are running Windows XP Pro.) I'm at a loss as to what to pursue there.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
You've missed my point here too?&nbsp; ; )&nbsp;&nbsp; You were complaining about not being able to use RIES because 1) you couldn't do it from IE or 2) you couldn�??t execute inetcpl.cpl implicitly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm saying you don't need to execute inetcpl.cpl implicitly; execute it
 explicitly, e.g. using the command line I gave you in a Run...&nbsp; dialog (e.g. press Win-R) and enter:</div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; control.exe&nbsp; inetcpl.cpl,,6</div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
If you have already tried that and somehow been unsuccessful, that is unclear (e.g. the fact that you tried it and more importantly what the symptom was when you did.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It would indicate that there is something much more wrong with your system than an average
 user would see.&nbsp; However, something that you could try before retrying that command is&nbsp; Run...</div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regsvr32.exe&nbsp; /n&nbsp; /i&nbsp; inetcpl.cpl</div>
<div>
<div>
<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
On second thought, thinking about this as a W7 user, it's possible that your problems with both of those commands represent permissions problems (even on XP), so it might also be an idea to do them both via a safe mode command only boot, e.g. to ensure that
 it is being done by the Administrator account or otherwise make sure that they are executed by the Administrator's account, e.g. right-click Run as... on a cmd.exe or Command Prompt shortcut, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do the latter however, the Administrator account must
 have a password associated with it.</div>

Good luck</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have scoured Microsoft support pages and can’t find any gudiance on how to report a potential data breach to Microsoft’s corproate systems that doesn’t relate to a specific product or service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is more, I am forced to choose a catagory, topic and sub-topic to use for this posting on the Microsoft community, but there do not seem to be any relevant options &nbsp;- so I hope this question gets picked up by the right people.</p>

<p>If the first characters of Microsoft Account addresses were evenly distributed across the alphabet, that would amount to about 20,000,000 addresses. Given that an average email address contains about 20 bytes, your spam would have amounted to around 400MB.
 Was it really that big?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lists of email addresses are, I'm told, widely available for spammers to buy and many for free. They are often taken from published data leaks over the years. I don't think Microsoft has suffered a breach like this since 2001.&nbsp;</p>

            Old PC Suite used o have an application called Nokia Phone Editor and that had a contacts mgmt and sms mgmt functionality that was based on some database in PC.<br />
<br />
That is not the case any longer with PC Suite 6.7 which is working with nearly all Nokia phones.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could try to do the following: make sure all the SMS's you like to transfer over and in your 6230.<br />
<br />
Then install PC Suite 6.7 and use that with your 6230 to get your SMS's over to PC. Then attach the new n70 and use that with PC Suite 6.7

<h2>            Office 365 Subscription&#47;Subscripci&#243;n</h2>
                    <p>Hola que tal, en este caso es solo una consulta, no es un error del software ni nada de eso.</p>
<p>Bueno mi consulta es:</p>
<p>Hace unos pocos días en mi PC observe el Icono de Office 365 (App Office 365 Hogar) y hice click en instalar, posteriormente se instalo.</p>
<p>Mi consulta es si pasado los 30 días me cobrarán o automáticamente mi Office 365 se cancelara o tengo que llamar a un soporte en especifico de Microsoft para que no me cobren, pues en mi Suscripción no aparece ninguna opción que diga cancelar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Muchas gracias de antemano</p>

            First thing I'd try is &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;Z&gt; to undo what ever you "did".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Since I have no idea of what it was, it is hard to provide a specific remedies. if you a dealing with a deleted file, one piece of difficult advice is to stop / minimize writing to the drive that the file was on. In the following suggestions, download to a
 USB device and using "portable" versions (don't require "installing" to your system, just run the downloaded exe file instead) of any of tools when possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are several techniques for retrieving "lost files". Maybe one will work.<br />

<p>You can get a free download that will scan your disk for recoverable files. If you find file names that you want, then you can buy the registration code to activate the recovery feature. I played with the free part on my HD. It found a few Word ASD files,
 but not as many as I would have liked to see.</p>

<span>http://www.abstradrome.com/</span></a>
<p>I recently tried this tool (Office Regenerator). It claims to recover files from deleted file fragments. It seems to work. On my 100GB data partition it ran for about 1 hour and found 691 files, 450 MB, going back almost 7 months! I don’t remember if that
 was the last time I used a wipe freespace tool on my drive They definitely were not in my recycle bin.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don’t do first auto run . The interface provides lots of Filter criteria such as: date created range, last saved range, last printed range, title, num pages, editing time, revision number, file type, author.
</p>
<p>All of the recovered files I looked at were properly structured.</p>
<p>Site has a 30 day moneyback guarantee. I haven’t tried it, but that sounds encouraging.</p>

<p>I gave it a try and it looks like a really handy tool!</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;System Restore Explorer is a tool which allows you to browse system restore points on your computer and select individual ones for deletion should you wish to free up some disk space. It also allows you to mount the contents of a restore point into
 a folder so that you can browse and copy individual files, without the need to perform a full system restore.</p>
<p>When you select a restore point and “mount” it the tool will create a shortcut to that particular restore point in the root folder of the drive, which will allow you to browse the contents and copy files. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>Few computer experiences are worse than having a Word document blow up on you. But before you resign yourself to losing the document contents, check out these techniques for salvaging your text.</p>
<p>If you've ever had an important document get corrupted, you know the despair that sets in. You've lost critical information and/or countless hours of work - or so it appears. But hang on: You may not have to accept data loss. Here are some things you can
 try when you're dealing with a corrupted Word document.</p>

<p><b>Summary: </b>A possibility to try if you have a corrupt document.</p>
<p>I had problem this week working on a 500K Word document for a client. Word 97 crashed on his system, corrupting the document. Trying to load the file into his Word 97 or my Word 2000 caused both applications to crash on start up and even bring up Dr. Watson.
 I had a backup for the document, but had lost about two hours worth of work.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Sun StarOffice 5.2 read the corrupted Word file without problem, although one section of text was not recoverable. Saving the file from StarOffice as a Word document file and loading it back into Word recovered the situation.</p>
<p>Well done, Sun—a recovery system for Microsoft Word!</p>

<div><span><b>Corrupt Files and Some Simple Things to Try - </b>http://www.s2services.com/corrupt.htm</span>
<p><span><span>Microsoft Office and other files can become corrupted and/or unopenable in a number of different ways. The corruption can occur if the application crashes, if Windows crashes, if the file is infected with a macro virus, if the actual sectors
 on the disk become unreadable, power outages etc. Click </span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/screenshots.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> to view some typical corrupt MS Office errors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The most common type of file corruption issues faced by users is MS Office file corruption.&nbsp; Microsoft Office programs are finicky about file structure so when you try to open the file again, you can get an error and the file won't open even
 though most or all of your data and formatting are still contained in it. More rarely the file will open but the data will appear garbled. As the version numbers of Office get higher, the ability to recover corrupt files increases.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The best way to start recovery of an MS Office file is to make a copy of the file. The next thing you can try to do on the copy is to open the file in the MS Office program, but to use the "Open and Repair" Option. This is only available in Word
 and Excel.&nbsp; For Access users there is a database "Compact and Repair" Function through the "Tools" Menu.&nbsp; For Outlook users there exists a less well known Outlook file repair program available on any PC with MS Office installed. The Outlook PST Repair Tool
 is described below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To get to the "Open and Repair" Option in Word and Excel, select your file in the Open Dialogue Window and then left clicking on the little down arrow next to the "Open" Button. See the two dark red arrows in the screenshot below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Excel there are three modes of recovery that follow the Open Repair Choice. They are "Repair" and Two under the "Extract Data" Button: "Convert to Values" and "Recover Formulas". In Word, choosing the "Open and Repair" Choice gives an immediate
 response with no further choices required.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Excel there are additional explicit free Excel procedures you can use. You can view and try them
</span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/excel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. Some of the ideas are applicable to Word, PowerPoint, and Access files, for instance opening the applications in safe mode before opening
 the files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another thing I try to do is to open the MS Office File in another Office suite. I have used for recovery, Microsoft Works 7, Lotus Smart Suite 9.8 (the most recent version), Corel WordPerfect Suite Professional X4, Star Office 9, Open Office
 3.1, Ability Office V5, ThinkFree Office, Gobe Productive Office, EIOffice (a Chinese entrant to this field!), and a few other recent entries. I also use the Abiword and Atlantis word processors for recovery. Open Office, Abiword, and a version of Atlantis
 Word Processor are all freeware, and if you have the time, I would encourage you to download these and try to open your files in them before purchasing any software or recovery services.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason other office suites and programs work, is because they are often less finicky than MS Office about file structure. All the office suites and programs have filters which allow the import of MS Office files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regarding Outlook, if you store your messages on your computer, and not on a company server, the place where all the computers user's E-mail, contacts, appointments etc. are stored is in one file with a .pst extension. Unfortunately if you have
 Office XP (Office 2002) or earlier, if this file gets larger the 2 GBs in size, it will not open and you will lose access to all your Outlook folders. Microsoft put out a free program which will safely prune off a small portion of the file to get it under
 2 GB in size. This pruned off piece is permanently lost. There is another free Microsoft program included with MS Office which will restore corrupt Outlook files. That would be pst files that have other problems than the size issue. See
</span></span><a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/scanpst.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> for the explanation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is also some free software for restoring corrupt Outlook Express files (dbx and MBx), again look at this freeware resource
</span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/outlookexpressfreeware.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>page</span></span></a><span><span> for the links to the software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the free methods mentioned above don't work or don't interest you, there are many pieces of commercial software available for quickly recovering files. Please note it is my strong suggestion to try the demo versions of all these programs first
 before buying.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For a good quick solution to Word corruption, I would use my sponsor's
</span></span><a href="http://www.cimaware.com/info/info.php?lang=en&amp;id=622&amp;path=wordfix.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>WordFix</span></span></a><span><span> by Cimaware or
</span></span><a href="http://ref.officerecovery.com/?134994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>WordRecovery</span></span></a><span><span> by Recoveronix. They are somewhat expensive but may offer the best solution.&nbsp; If you have used Word 2007 new docx format, then
 I have </span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/hosted-freeware/dd2txt-1.0.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>released freeware myself</span></span></a><span><span> which will at least salvage the text for free.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Excel, the quick best choice again are two of the early pioneers in the field Cimaware's
</span></span><a href="http://www.cimaware.com/info/info.php?lang=en&amp;id=622&amp;path=excelfix.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>ExcelFix</span></span></a><span><span> or Recoveronix'
</span></span><a href="http://ref.officerecovery.com/?134994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>ExcelRecovery</span></span></a><span><span>. For PowerPoint the only real effective choice most times in the past was Ontrack's EasyRecovery FileRepair although there
 are several other recent entries worth trying that you can get to starting </span>
</span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/links.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp; Again for Excel 2007 xlsx format files I have released a
</span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/hosted-freeware/corrupt-excel2csv-1.0.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>basic data salvage freeware tool</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Access the best program used to be&nbsp; AccessRecovery by Recoveronix although the EasyRecovery Suites came in a close second but only for Access 2003 or older files.&nbsp; The OnTrack EasyRecovery Suite has not updated to the new Office 2007 formats
 and is therefore falling behind other companies probably in general.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>AccessFix by Cimaware has undoubtedly become a good choice due their very active development department but I have not had a file to test it on in 2-3 years.&nbsp; Try their demo too as it is certainly cheaper than the other two if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Outlook (pst) try the free ways mentioned above first then the demos for Cimaware's
</span></span><a href="http://www.cimaware.com/info/info.php?lang=en&amp;id=622&amp;path=outlookfix.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>OutlookFix</span></span></a><span><span>,
</span></span><a href="http://www.iolo.com/sr/5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Iolo's Search and Recover</span></span></a><span><span>, Recoveronix
</span></span><a href="http://ref.officerecovery.com/?134994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>OutlookRecovery</span></span></a><span><span>, and Ontrack
</span></span><a href="http://www.ontrack.com/datarecovery/servicequote.asp?PartnerID=2490383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>EasyRecovery EmailRepair</span></span></a><span><span>,
</span></span><span><span>with the Iolo product the cheapest by almost an order of magnitude but not necessarily the best for you, try all the demos first. I don't have enough experience to differentiate the programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please note: Honestly the commercial software and services is the route you will sometimes have to take to recover your data. Generally, it's a lot easier to find free programs for file repair for non-Microsoft products than Microsoft ones.&nbsp;
 You can explore them by following the links to the left.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On those occasions that you try the freeware and it doesn't work, the software in these pages will appear not be worth the time and effort you put in and this can be frustrating. I try to point out at the top of each page, what I see is the likelihood
 that and difficulty with which freeware can recover your data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Google Adsense Ads displayed on the pages should lead you to the standard commercial software and services available for the problem you are having. You can also try the commercial links by clicking on the Navigation Bar by the file type
 name on the left. It's also </span></span><a href="http://www.s2services.com/links.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To see if the program works before buying, always be sure to try the demos of commercial software first. Also the difference in prices for software that does the same thing, for instance recovering PowerPoint Presentations, can be a large range
 like with PowerPoint case $50 - 299. If possible, try several software solutions before buying.&nbsp; For services, be sure there is a no data, no fee guarantee, and a recovered file preview available.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you need help, I charge $22 per incident. You can E-mail me at </span>
</span><span><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span><span><span>,</span><span> but because of finances and legalities, I I only use free methods.</span></span></p>

    <title>Mail merge Fields collection includes fields that were previously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> racer-s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge Fields collection includes fields that were previously deleted</h2>
                    <p>We have several hundred mail merge documents that reference a table in our database.&nbsp; When the developers are making changes to a column in the table, we run a macro against the documents in a folder that examines the mail merge fields and creates an output
 file with the document name and field name.&nbsp; That allows the devs to identify what documents need to be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Fields collection includes fields that were previously deleted.&nbsp; I can't find a property that identifies it as active or inactive.&nbsp; Is there a way to exclude these fields programmatically, or remove them from the document?&nbsp; I tried RemoveDocumentProperties
 (wdRDIAll) but no luck.</p>
<p>

            <p>It would be better if the developers left the existing fields in the table alone and created new ones if they needed them</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, how are you deleting the fields from the documents.&nbsp; To do that, it would probably be best to toggle on the display of the field codes in the document.&nbsp; Another thing that you may need to take into account is that Word sometimes modifies the&nbsp;names
 in the actual { MERGEFIELD [fieldname] } by the insertion of underscores where there are spaces in the field name in the table and\or by prefacing the field name from the table with M_ where the field starts with a numeral or a space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That can make it difficult to write code that you can be sure will delete a particular field.&nbsp; So better not to modify them.</p>

            <p>Hmm.&nbsp; That's what I expected, as well.&nbsp; There are 26 merge fields in the document and 73 in the Fields collection.&nbsp; It's been updated multiple times over the years with different business and legal requirements, so clearly a number of them have been deleted.</p>

<p>

            <p>If mergefields that are meant to have been deleted remain in the document after the deletion process has been run, that probably means your deletion process is defective. For example, if your document uses textboxes, looping through the fields collection
 won't find mergefields in those. Similarly, if your deletion process is using Word's Find function to look for «MyField», it won't find mergefields nested inside other fields (e.g. inside an IF test:&nbsp;{IF«MyField» = "" "Some text" «MyField»}). Without seeing
 the code that's being used for that, it's hard to say what the issue is, though. In any event, instead of simply deleting mergefields, one would ordinarily replace them with different ones, since deletion could compromise the mailmerge's integrity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of using NotePad, open the mailmerge main document in Word and press Alt-F9 to expose the field codes. You could then use Find to look for 'MERGEFIELD MyField', where MyField is the mergefield name you want to find. Again, doing this programmatically
 won't find the fields in textboxes, etc.</p>

            <p>Sorry it took a while to get back.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I made myself clear.&nbsp; I am not deleting the merge fields programmatically.&nbsp; The person responsible for the documents opens them in word and edits them there.&nbsp; I tried deleting a field in different ways - deleting the field name inside the braces
 first, then backspacing and hitting delete, highlighting an entire line and deleting it, and selecting the field and hitting delete and backspace.&nbsp; All methods worked fine.&nbsp; The Fields collection count was reduced properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I opened the document in Notepad because I know what we see on the screen in Word isn't all that's in the document.&nbsp; It was a verification that they are there is all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have no idea why deleted fields show in the collection.&nbsp; Since I'm only retrieving the field name and not actually operating on it, your suggestion of using Alt-F9 (the VBA equivalent, at any rate) and searching for MERGEFIELD is the way

            Dear Wendy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />This is phishing attempt - scam email, please report this email and block the sender. 
<br />
<br />If you are using your account regularly - your account will not be deleted.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

            Hi Wendy, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Phishing SCAM and it is not even a good one, that link goes to Excel online, where they are trying to accumulate users login details . . .
<br />
<br />You can safely delete that Email and you have nothing to worry about . . .

<p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>Can you please provide little more information?</p>
<p>When you do a validation, did you use a smtp address which mailbox is located on On-Premise exchange ?</p>
<p>Is your on-Premise exchange is having correct O365 Inbound / Outbound connector ?</p>
<p>Did you see any error during Hybrid setup ?</p>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>Basically we don’t need to manually validate the connectors when deploying Exchange hybrid.</p>
<p>To solve the issue, I suggest you manually remove these hybrid related connectors, then re-run the HCW (hybrid configuration wizard) to create these connectors automatically, and check if the mail flows are working between the on-premises and Exchange Online.</p>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. And I’m sorry my response is delayed too.</p>
<p>Do you mean you have removed all connectors and re-run the HCW but still encounter the same error? If yes, does the “RecipientNotFound” error occur to some specific users? Can you see any specific user address indicated by this error? Please provide us with
 a screenshot of the error, as well as any other error message you may see when the email gets stuck.</p>
<p>In order to protect your privacy information, I have created a workspace where you can upload the screenshots and error messages. Please see the private message I sent you at
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations, where some relevant details are introduced.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Yes i removed the connectors and re-run the hcw &nbsp;but still have the same problem.</p>
<p>The error with "RecipientNotFound", for some users i get it, for others i cant run the validation because it says that the user is a cloud mailbox and not an on-prem.</p>
<p>Ive uploaded a screenshot with the error message</p>

<h2>            Is there a keyboard shortcut for selecting all of the text in the cell I&#39;m currently editing&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using Excel 2016 for Mac and want to be able to select the contents of a cell, not the entire cell itself, using a keyboard shortcut. That way, when I paste it into a Word doc, it doesn't paste as a table.

            <p>The only technique I know of can be used in the Formula Bar or while in Edit/Enter mode in a cell. With the insertion point at the beginning of the content use
<strong>Shift+End</strong> [<strong><em>fn</em>+Shift+Right Arrow</strong> on a condensed keyboard]. If there is more than one line you may then have to use
<strong>Shift+Down Arrow</strong> to extend the selection for each additional line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the easiest method is to just copy the cell, then in Word use <strong>
Edit&gt; Paste Special</strong>. Select <strong>Unformatted Text</strong> or try the various options to see which works best for you. In Excel 2016, though, I don't see this as necessary unless you're actually copying more than just one cell... Copying a single
 cell doesn't paste into a document as a table.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>re Renaming the column. You can only "truly" rename Custom Fields (such as Text2, Number7...). Manually this is achieved through Project, Custom Fields, select the field you want to rename and click Rename.</p>
<p>The other fields cannot be renamed, but you can change the title of the column (mind the difference between a field - an object in Project's data base - and a column, something visible in a table and thius in a view). Right-Click the column header, Field
 Settings, enter a title.</p>
<p>To make Project recalculate task data you can define that task by task in teh task mode column (Manually Scheduled or automatically scheduled). Through File menu, Options, Schedule, you can define whether new tasks will be defined as manually cscheduled
 or Automatically scheduled - only for the open project or for all new projects as well.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let's first tackle the rename question. You still give me the impression that you are creating a title,<strong>not</strong> actually renaming the column. Is this renaming of a custom field through Project, Custom Fields? Just entering a title through Field
 settings isn't renaming, and the title will not appear in any fields list.</p>
<p>And yes,&nbsp;you cannot rename when adding a new column, you can only take an existing field name or a field name defined via Project, Custom Fields.</p>
<p>Note that changing the option will only make a difference on new tasks. For existing tasks, have you tried setting to automatic through task information?</p>

<h3> dennisstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            In presentation view with extended screen, picture doesn&#39;t show up on second screen</h2>
                    <p><span>Have you heard of an experience as follows?</span></p>
<p><span>I have PowerPoint 2010. I have my presentation with the presenter view checked. I hook up my laptop to a projector. I have Windows 7 and it is in Extended screen mode.</span></p>
<p><span>When I click on the presentation, it shows up on my screen with the slides below and notes in upper right hand corner as it is supposed to. But the projector screen
 is blank. No picture. I can run my cursor arrow into the secondary screen and the cursor shows up but no picture.</span></p>
<p><font>It seems there is a setting in PowerPoint that&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;set right.</font></p>
<p><span>I can exchange screens so that the laptop is the secondary and the projector is primary and it puts the notes, etc. on the projection screen and the presentation on
 my laptop screen (backwards from what I want it to do). I can also use duplicate screen and that works.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes when I have it set up correctly and the projector is blank, I can click on the marker on the upper left screen for making annotations and then the slide comes
 up but doesn’t allow the animations on that slide to work. Clicking takes it to the next slide right away.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve tried different presentations and different rooms with different projectors. It does the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span>It never used to do that and I don’t know what has changed on my computer or programs or exactly when it quit working.</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned, it seems to be a setting that needs to be changed but I haven’t figured it out.</span></p>

            <p>This sounds to me like a hardware acceleration or video driver issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First try changing hardware acceleration. There are two different hardware acceleration settings to try turning off or back. First one is in PPT under File | Options. I believe it's under the Advanced tab. If it's off try turning it on, and if it's on try
 turning it off. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other is in Windows. <a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00129_How_to_set_graphics_hardware_acceleration_back.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00129_How_to_set_graphics_hardware_acceleration_back.htm</a>&nbsp;explains how to knock it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you can try updating video drivers if neither of those does the trick.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Whenever I listen to music through my headphones it plays fine for a bit but then it stops randomly at the end of a song. It sometimes can go for ages without stopping or it only plays about 2 songs
 then stops again. The only way to start it again is to unplug the headphones then plug them in again and press play. I've tried different headphones and same problem so it's not the headphones themselves.&nbsp;</span>

            <p>Hello AdamScott_87,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting to the forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if you try to listen to the songs without the headphone? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to delete the songs from the phone, then perform a soft reset. Turn the phone off and press the volume down button + power button until the device vibrates and restarts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done this try to sync the songs again and listen to them with your headphones.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you might need to reset the phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Outlook Express is certainly included in Windows XP and it is even more simplistic than Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; It is a POP and IMAP mail client.&nbsp; You can use it to access any mail server allowing POP or IMAP connections.&nbsp; There are also other POP and IMAP clients
 that will work with Windows XP, like Thunderbird and&nbsp;Eudora.&nbsp; A Google search for "free windows xp mail client" will find others for you.</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail also has the ability to use Microsoft's DeltaSync protocol for accessing Hotmail/Live/MSN accounts and their attendant calendars and contacts.&nbsp; Neither Outlook Express nor any other non-Microsoft mail client can do that.&nbsp; The only other
 mail client that can is Office Outlook.</p>

            Do you see cloud computing and storage as a problem? Calling them "dangerous" implied to me you do.

<p>Unless I'm misreading something, I think KahBang.com said advantageous not dangerous...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, in response to KahBang.com... I prefer leveraging the benefits of both rich desktop applications with cloud computing. &nbsp;For example, I like using an Exchanged backed Outlook set-up for e-mail. &nbsp;That way I can access all my e-mail through the OWA when
 on the road, but through Outlook while at work or at home.</p>
<p>Similarly, I store my documents online on SkyDrive where I can edit or view them through the Office Web Apps remotely, but still use the full power of Microsoft Office 2010 from home.</p>

 it says I don't have an account even though I do!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I cannot find any way of logging back in?<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I don't have Office 365.&nbsp; I get the impression that it is asking me to sign into Office 365 but I do not have an account.&nbsp; I am the administrator for the Yammer account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes have been made to the account so I am not sure why this has suddenly happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>
