<h2>            VBA User Form Command Button - add entry to next row - Excel 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have struggled through many youtube videos trying to find the code for a <strong>
command button</strong>&nbsp;to <strong>add </strong><strong>an entry</strong> from a user form to an
<strong>excel spreadsheet, </strong>and another command button <strong>(Close form) to close the form</strong>. Most of the online tutorials are using Excel 2010, I have the latest 2013 version of Excel however, and some things appear to be different between
 the Excel versions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know very little VBA and would appreciate some help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find my form attached:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1635a7a7-44bf-4b9e-8035-dec7e7c43b04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1635a7a7-44bf-4b9e-8035-dec7e7c43b04" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wold like the records added to go to the 2nd row in sheet below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67a1388b-310f-40e9-bcd6-2604300f17e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67a1388b-310f-40e9-bcd6-2604300f17e9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does anyone know how to add a time stamp to each entry? I would like another column added so that the time of entry of each form is displayed. Is this possible?...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Appreciate it!</p>

<h2>            Default E-mail account isn&#39;t default when sending replies</h2>
                    I use two email accounts in Outlook and have one designated as my default email account (not my ISP). However, when I reply to a message, it sends it from the other account (ISP). Is there anyway to send reply messages from the account that the message
 was received on (by default, instead of having to select that account manually)?

<p>Outlook will ALWAYS send replies from the account to which the original message was sent to.</p>
<p>You can't have one account for receiving and a different one for sending replies automatically. If you want to send replies from the other account you need to select it manually in the Compose Reply Window using the Account Button.</p>

<p>You're right! I think that my issue is not at all with&nbsp;Outlook replying from the "wrong" default&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>I have two email acccounts in Outlook. I have one designated as my default email account (not my ISP).</p>
<p>My problem is that I receive a copy of all&nbsp;messages delivered to my ISP email account,&nbsp;that are addressed to my default email account.</p>
<p>Then, with two identical looking emails in my in-box, sometimes the one that has come in to my ISP email account and not my default email account is selected.&nbsp;When replying to a message from that email received in the ISP email account, then, would be replyed
 to from the ISP email account. (solving the "replying from the wrong account" problem.)</p>
<p>Is this copy message a function of Outlook, or is it a setting outside the program (like with the default email account)?</p>

<p>Which is the version of Outlook on the machine?</p>
<p>Check if there are any rules setup in Outlook to forward emails from one account to the other. If yes remove the rule to fix the issue.</p>
<p>If no rules are setup within Outlook ,ensure email forwarding is not enabled in the webmail for the primary account to which the emails are actually sent.</p>

<h2>            considering using onenote for our company knowledge base. if an employee leaves, how is their access to shared folders revoked&#63;</h2>
                    Shared OneNote notebooks look like a great platform for a knowledge base. Our security concern is regarding an employee leaving with all the accumulated knowledge that has been shared. How should we set this up properly so that access can be revoked, if
 needed? Won't they still have a local copy of everything on their computer, or still be able to access the content via web?

            One has always a local copy of an opened Onenote notebook on the accessing computer, at least in the cache.<br />
A knowledgable user can always recreate a notebook locally from the cache, independent from an existing connection to the notebook original.<br />
<br />
So all you can do is stopping the access to the original notebook.<br />
<br />
If the notebook is located on a company's server that's a standard procedure concerning access rights.<br />
<br />
If the notebook is located in Skydrive AND your company is the owner of the corresponding Live ID: change the password for that Live ID.<br />

    <title>Screen Resolution modification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomasz.k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Resolution modification</h2>
                    <p>So I have installed Win1 Tech Preview on a virtual disk on a Toshiba Satellite 750D. It runs a Win7 64x Bit version but for some reason neither of US and GB 64bit versions of Win10 didn't run. A 0x0000005D error was present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is how can I change the screen resolution on Win10 to the same one that Win7 uses. (Win10 uses 1024x768) (Win7 uses 1366x768) Is it the prompt command I would use for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just an exercise for me as I am a Computer Engineering student and I just had a go at playing about the Win10. Additionally this may be a helpful topic for others with the same/similar laptop or just the CPU.</p>

            <p>I do realise that there is the Screen resolution option when you right click on desktop :P</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have formed the question wrong.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(When I do the screen resolution option using the control panel i.e. right click on desktop and go to screen resolution the lowest resolution is 768pixels tall and that is the max my screen can fit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make a screen resolution of 1336x768 which I CURRENTLY have on my Win7</p>
<p>I do not have that screen resolution available in the Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to set a CUSTOM screen resolution?</p>
<p>Or would that be something related to the APU? i.e. I need to wait until my APU needs updated.</p>
<p>(APU is a CPU and GPU combined together, isn't it?)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I am using the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toshiba Portege M750-S7223</p>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T9600 @ 2.80GHz</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the command that you referred me to. It did fix the issue with Project Spartan but one remains, please see the image below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have run the command twice and have rebooted after each had completed.&nbsp;Also you should know that I have a second Toshiba M750-S7223 laptop that did not have the Project Spartan issue but does have the same issue as above. Please advise.</p>

    <title>INETCACHE SETUP.EXE FILE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            INETCACHE SETUP.EXE FILE</h2>
                    <p>What is the file C:\USERS\username\APPDATA\LOCAL\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\INETCACHE\IE\...\SETUP.EXE used for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see users on our network who already have INETCACHE installed but this file is still being detected in network traffic destined for the user's PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this really a "SETUP" file, or is it an "UPDATE" file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - the use of the APPDATA/LOCAL and APPDATA/ROAMING directories as base directories (in conjunction with lower level sub-directories, and .dll/.exe files) have been used to infect PCs with Ransomware and Cryptolocker malware in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this
 malware is polymorphic, it does not lend itself to signature-based detection.&nbsp;&nbsp; So anti-virus software often has custom-rules that use the combination of these base directories and the final file name/type as a pattern/heuristic for detecting malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it's producing a significant number of false positives (no signs of infection) as the action for the rule is to delete the creation of this file in the filesystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I'm looking to understand is what this file is used for and what are
 the consequences of not allowing it to be created.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can get this info then I might have a shot at getting the detection rule modified, eliminating the false positives.</p>

    <title>N8 mixed feelings, anyone else&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greentoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 mixed feelings, anyone else&#63;</h2>
                    Well like many here, I have been a Nokia user for many years (n80, n95,n95 8 gb, n97, n97 mini and now n8 just to name a few) and have been a huge fan always enjoying showing friends and family how advanced my phones have been compared to those readily
 available in the states for most people. That was the case up until I opened up my n97 and soon became embarrased to even show anyone the phone for fear ofa random restart or freeze. The mini was bearable toward the end and I was really looking forward to
 a sort of redemption with the n8. I received my n8 on monday after not so patiently awaiting fedex and quickly unboxed my new phone to power it up and start playing. I put my sim in and hit the power button...... Nothing tried again...... Nothing no buzz,
 no lights just dead completely unresponsive to anything. After messing with it for a while I called customer care who said call tech support. Called tech support, 30 min on hold, then 10 min having to convince rep of its unresponsivenes

<p>trust me it's not just your N97.Similar to you my N95 kept rebooting and i was embarassed to pull it out at work.&nbsp; I started think it was the metal detector at work that caused this.&nbsp; I got excited to pre-order the N8 but a bit nervous now hearing others
 have some reboot issues.</p>

<p>I only hope that mine never has to go through this and if it does i hope to have the courage to return it.</p>

            I have had my N8 for almost a week and the only bug I've encountered is synchronisation with ovi.com calenders. Otherwise it works like a charm. I tried ovi maps today: flawless. I have a bluetooth handsfree: flawless. I have downloaded music &amp; programs
 from ovi.com: flawless. I have two email accounts (IMAP &amp; gmail): flawless. I've played Angry Birds: flawless. Telephone call sound is way better than on my E71. Photos &amp; videos are excellent. Can't really complain.

            That's great. Aside from my initial and one subsequent problem, my n8 has been great. I guess I am just nervous with it. We got off to a rough start. I am more frustrated with Nokia's support system overall. I am beginning to wonder if I have a hardware
 problem or just software glitch out of the box. I guess i will just have to wait and see.

<p>I think that the phone is very nice! Exch is great, Movies, games, etc. Really enjoyable phone. It takes a few hours of messing around to get used to the operating system, but starting to get very comfortable. Not embarassed about the phone at all!!!</p>

<p>Notice you said you have used a bluetooth headset, have you tried it with music?</p>
<p>When I do the volume is load and I can not adjust the volume like I could on my other Nokia phones.</p>

<p>When on a call the voume control works fine but not with music.</p>

            I suppose it's a problem related to these early production devices. As far as I know there's always been a higher probabillity to incur in a device that tends to (auto)reboot randomly, and often for my knowledge the way to sort it out is to get a new device.
 Firmware updates may work but just cure a non perfect hardware outcome.

            We shall see, I have another one on the way. My n8 was playing dead for over an hour today. Then magically started up all by itself after I left it alone. Question for you guys, does your n8 show anything on the screen while charging with the phone off?
 Mine is totally blank. I am pretty sure I just got a lemon.

            btw I had to shell out another $600 if I didn't want to wait 30 to 45 days for a replacement unit. Shame there is no way to take care of a poor customer with a bad device better than that!

<h2>            Access 2010&#58; Linked Table Manager button grayed out and Linked Tables exist</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 Linked tables in my Access database that are linked to SharePoint Lists withing the same site. As I was playing around a bit to get to know the system I stumbled upon the Linked Table Manager button that is grayed out. After a bit of googling I
 discovered that this should not be the case since I have Linked Tables ( <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-access/how-do-i-enable-the-linked-table-manager-button/c5605c7d-e066-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-access/how-do-i-enable-the-linked-table-manager-button/c5605c7d-e066-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5</a> ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is, why is this button grayed out even though I have Linked Tables and how can I get around it as I temporarily like to delete the 'link' to the SharePoint list and later link the two together again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Tom</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply but I actually need the table without the link to the SP-list. Is there maybe an easy way to copy a table's structure to a new table because I didn't see the option anywhere..</p>

    <title>Dynamicaly merging documents in word 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric va  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamicaly merging documents in word 365</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing a book in Word 365 consisting of about 17 chapters. Each chapter is a separate file and still being devellopped. I want to be able to review intermediate versions of the book including TOC etc.
</p>
<p>Of course it is possible to copy and paste the whole bunch for every review but this is too cumbersome.</p>
<p>In 1991 I wrote a book also in Word. This consisted of a masterdocument with subdocuments for the chapters. Very convenient. Push the button and the most recent version is there.
</p>
<p>I see no way how to mimic this workflow in Word 365. In other words how can I merge documents
<strong>dynamically. </strong></p>
<p>An yes, I know very well how to perform a mail merge. But that is a completely different piece of cake. Even though the basic idea is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me out in this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Actually you still can use the master document feature. But you probably don't want to. It is good, until it isn't. Unfortunately the
<em>isn't</em> part happens too often. The feature has a history of causing document corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How big is the total size of this document, how many MB, pages total? Are there many pictures/images inserted? If your computer is reasonably current there is a very good chance you could merge all of the files into one and still have reasonable performance.&nbsp;
 Yes, back in 1991 Word and the computers of the time could not handle very large/long documents.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it, you may like it ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or at least merge the 17 down into something more manageable. </p>

Complex documents in a legal environment are plentiful, and generally these documents are to be filed or sent to clients on a time sensitive basis. That's why knowing the ins and outs of the tools that Word has to offer in the quick creation of Tables of Contents,
 Tables of Authorities, Indices, cross-references (and more) is essential in the timely completion of these documents.</span></p>

</strong>Word can handle very large documents, but some people find it preferable to break large documents into multiple documents. (For instance, a book might be broken down into documents for each chapter.) At some point you may want to create a TOC for those
 multiple documents. This tip discusses three possible approaches to the task <strong>

    <title>Anyway for Mailmerge from excel to take data from Rows and not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flemingvista09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyway for Mailmerge from excel to take data from Rows and not Columns&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet who data, in columns, exceeds the number of columns in the spreadsheet - but I can display the data in rows...</p>
<p>So instead of Header data being in A1, B1, C1, D1 - with the data to merge in A2,B2,C2 etc - - all the way to IF1 &amp; IF2,&nbsp; I have tabulated the "Header Columns", as it were down, so reads A1, A2, A3, A4 - to A265 with Data in B1, B2, B3 t0 B265.</p>
<p>However, when mail merging to Word, it&nbsp;does not recognise and only wants to read off Columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set up DDE&nbsp;and&nbsp;Named the Range - but this still does not work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>

<h3> don891  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search Field Inop and Other Problems</h2>
                    <p>According to the message in the lower left corner of the desktop, I am using Build 10041. In no particular order the issues I am having are listed below.&nbsp;My basic question is how to get beyond them. How do I update my current build to the latest on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clicking on the new icon in the lower left corner of the desktop results nothing.
</p>
<p>2. The Search field is inop. An I-beam is shown but typed characters are not registered.</p>
<p>3. Cannot find where to click to check for Windows updates are to change options.
</p>
<p>4. Programs are basically functional, but because of No. 1, I cannot see not get to them. The only programs I can run are those with icons on my desktop. Some seem to operate very slowly.</p>
<p>5. There is a New Notification icon in the lower right corner, but opening the Action Center through it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems cam at some point after first upgrading to Win 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get things back to working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Disappearing slides in slide sorter view &#40;navigation&#47;display bug&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - please be patient as I try to articulate this phenomenon as best as possible. Here's my setup: MS Office Standard 2016 on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In slide sorter view on a smaller monitor (laptop), I have a 69 slide presentation open and maximized - I mention that because I've witnessed this bug most with a deck high in slide count. I'm at a zoom level of 75%. The slide selected is slide 69.&nbsp;</li><li>I then drag the PPT window (using the mouse by dragging the top of the screen) over to the top of my larger monitor so it autofits and maximizes. Everything seems in place. BUT:</li><li>Then I scroll up using the mouse wheel - and all the slides disappear.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update/just noticed: You can also witness this if you double click the top of PPT so it toggles between a small window and a maximized screen and use the mouse wheel up! When maximized and wheeling up, the slides disappear!<br />

            <p>We apologize for the delay in addressing your concern.&nbsp;Let's isolate the cause of this issue. Do you only experience this issue when you are in the message list? Do you also experience this issue when typing a message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you start Outlook in safe mode. Starting Outlook in safe mode will help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing this issue. To start Outlook in safe mode, refer to the following link:

<h2>            Often not booting after installing 14342.rs1_release.160506-1708</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo Yoga 260 laptop often does not boot after installing the above build.</p>
<p>It just sits at the startup screen (pre login) and shows the rotating circle. No text, no errors, no boot. It can sit there for at least an our without anything happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that seems to work is to keep the powerbutton pressed for at least 4 seconds and then boot again. Usually it boots normally after that. If I press the powerbutton shortly the laptop powers off, but if I power it on again it wil sit at the startup screen
 with the circle again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like it is going in some kind of weird powersave mode instead of powering off and then is not able to power on/recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is not the proper place to report it please let me know :)</p>

    <title>After deleting slides, related Layout in Masterslide disappears - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After deleting slides, related Layout in Masterslide disappears</h2>
                    <p>I have this problem since the new update. Before that, I always had to clean up my masterslides, thats why I'm so sure this never happened to me before. This problem exists in all my presentations, so I assume it has something to do with Powerpoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm deleting slides, it doesn't mean that I don't need the layout anymore.&nbsp;How can I prevent the disappearing of the layouts in the masterslide?</p>

            Please give this a try. Here's a macro-enabled presentation that adds the Preserve attribute to the custom layouts. You may be able to fix the problem by opening both this deck and a problem presentation, then running the macro. Instructions are on the

<p>I've seen this happen on presentations that have been corrupted and I've seen it happen to custom layouts. Are the layouts that disappear custom ones that you created, or the stock Microsoft layouts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds you have layouts that have become detached from the master. When you duplicate the layout, the duplicate becomes reattached to the master and is preserved. I think you should go through every layout and repeat the duplication process to see if
 you can get rid of the problem.</p>

<h2>            Cannot print Word Documents using my Epson NX515 Printer</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using an Epson NX515 Printer for several months now and in the past week it will no longer print word documents.&nbsp; It prints about half of the page and then stops and freezes.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the drivers and checked for updates from MS but
 still have the same problem.&nbsp; If I convert the document into a PDF it will print, the problem is limited to word documents.&nbsp; I have contacted Epson Tech Support and after an hour or so of messing around they concluded, of course, that it's not their problem
 but MS Word's problem.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem or has anyone an idea of how to correct this?&nbsp; I haven't seen any updates recently that would cause this problem but I do need to print documents from word.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Auto copying of Outlook server folder structure&#47;directory to local inbox</h2>
                    <p>So i just join a new coy about 4 months back - made the rookie mistake of creating a list of folder structures on the outlook server itself (i use that to store and keep my mails so that my inbox is kept neat and clean)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have only realized that it is on the server side, and not on my local side. i would like to have that folder structure on the server side, replicated onto my local inbox (thus having the mails stored in my local harddisk)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so question is</p>
<p>1) is there an tool or auto way of copying the files/folder structure from the server side to my local ? My helpdesk told me i have to do it manually (ie re-create each folder one by one, and then drag and drop each email one by one !)</p>

</p><p>Lines across the page in Word 2010 documents - they can be moved up and down with the mouse l<span>ike they are some sort of section dividing line.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>But the obnoxious swines cannot be selected and CANNOT BE DELETED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be rid of the swines forever. If I copy some text to another document, these **** things come with it. Even when they were not visible in the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Document originally a downloaded web page which I have reformatted - BUT THE WEB PAGE DID NOT HAVE THESE MOVABLE BLOODY LINES ON IT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going out of my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
