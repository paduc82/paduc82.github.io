                    <p>Hello Girls &amp; Boys</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a whole week since we got 14332 and I'm getting fed up&nbsp;waiting for the next build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering what the next 'Extremely Interesting' thing will be.&nbsp; I haven't really found anything exciting about the last couple of builds, but I suppose that's just because Windows 10 is finally approaching it's final build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's not even really been much in the way of problems people are having - these&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;mainly from people having 3rd party software difficulties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there was 'Bash' (but that's something I know very little about), I'd be interested in 'BOOM' or 'BOINNGG!' but I don't think we'll be seeing much of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts of something to excite me?</p>

            Actually, 14332 was the best build so far for me. It added enough pen functionality for my Surface Book and Pen that that I've actually started using the pen for something other than a skinny finger to press tiny buttons.&nbsp;

            I clicked my pen and used ScreenSketch to take a photo of a Cortana problem I had. I marked it up with my pen and submitted it with the problem report on the Feedback Hub. Very easy and efficient.

<p>Really?...I found the last two builds 14328 &amp; 332 having many changes with additional features and toys especially in the 'Settings' app and the 'Mail' has a new mail indicator in the task bar...more functions are geared towards the Settings app from the
 'control panel' I've noticed.</p>
<p><em>Quote&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>There's not even really been much in the way of problems people are having</em></p>
<p>Really?...I've been busy replying to many problem threads...there is a lot of 'Activation', User account, and the usual 'Not able to install' for what ever reason.

<p>
</p><p>I do not understand why you did not attempt any of the "Bug Bash Quests" as that was the purpose of this build. I managed to make it through 8 quests and they were very detailed and "exciting". As an Insider you should be following Microsoft announcements
 in the Feedback Hub. Many Quests I could not do for one reason or another but they were given to us to help Microsoft develop future builds.</p>

            <p>I'm just happy that I managed to FINALLY get 14332&nbsp; to install and hold, not exactly the Way MS designed it, but when desperate you do "tricky" "not by the standard procedure" tasks :-)

<p>( it previously rolled back after an hour or didn't install at all)</p>

<h2>            Microsoft office can&#39;t find your license for this application.  Software protection is running with no effect.</h2>
                    <p>I have just recently upgraded to office 365 and downloaded office for the computer. It said activation was not requred as it was activated upon installation.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a21a1b20-a33e-4587-b5a6-be1ec345cf88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a21a1b20-a33e-4587-b5a6-be1ec345cf88" /></a></p>
<p>Now it asks to activate every single time and when you enter your login credentials it ends in<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9f7d5a5-72a4-4646-b155-2c28d71aaffc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9f7d5a5-72a4-4646-b155-2c28d71aaffc" /></a></p>
<p>I have run virus scans and poured over every solution i can find.</p>
<p>To summerise:</p>
<p>software protection is already running. I know that cured it for some but not on my machine.</p>
<p>Running as administratior, getting to this failure then running quick repair does fix the issue without the activation window coming up but this doesn't last and on the next reboot it is back.</p>
<p>I have run Clean up utilities and actually have a very sparse system as fas a software goes.</p>
<p>I am using windows 7 that has only recently been updated (thanks to W10 bad behaviour I turned off updates)</p>
<p>
</p><p>additional Info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different connections to see if it is just my work server preventing activation (its not)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is statring to become a real problem at work as i am spending all my time troubleshooting instead of working. Does anyone know why such a simple procedure is so difficult? this is insane. there are litteraly 350 million hits in google for this problems,
 dozens of similar threads in this forum and seemingly no answers? Help me please</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow us to clarify some information, so we can properly isolate the issue. Is the PC currently running on Windows 7,&nbsp; or Windows 10? Have you tried to uninstall and reinstall the Office 365 Home?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As initial troubleshooting, you can also try doing the <strong>System File Check</strong> on your computer by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open the <strong>Command Prompt </strong>from the start menu as the <strong>Administrator</strong>.<br />
2. Type in <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (please note the space after <strong>sfc</strong>)<br />
3. Windows will scan your system files and repair corrupted ones, if any.<br />
4. <strong>Reboot</strong> your PC.<br />
<br />
By the way, you may have to run <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> more than once until it reports no error.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Liezl, thanks for the advice. I am using windows 7 and have reinstalled multiple times. including the use of quick repair and internet Repair options in the change option of the program manager.</p>
<p>I ran the scan and found nothing. I Also ran combofix yesterday, also with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c5a1492-cb6f-41f7-b014-7fc5262fd9ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c5a1492-cb6f-41f7-b014-7fc5262fd9ee" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to get Office activated using quick repair and running it as administrator but this state is not persistant and only lasts until reboot.</p>
<p>I also tried to compare the file systems of the un activated and activated versions and ended up with 233mb of files that are different from the original install. I haven't compared them on a file by file basis as I was hoping to narrow it down somewhat
 more than that..</p>
<p>Both windows and office now have the most upto date versions.</p>
<p>When I managed to get it activated it I grabbed the product key. Trying to activate with the product key aslo doesn't work as the product key has zeros in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a bug noted in a previous thread but my version number is well beyong this already.</p>

<p>Still at a loss, is this a Microsoft Bug? Its annoying as i am wasting my subscription unable to use the product.<br />

            Additional Test. I have just added myself (with another email that I use on this computer) to share my 365 account assuming that maybe the different accounts were causing the problem. I then did a clean install of Office and it worked without needing activation.
 However after a reboot I am back to the same problem.

            <p>Even more testing. I first uninstalled office completely, Removed everything i found in Program files/Program data and User/AppData/Local. I also removed any office referenced in the registry, ran a clean up utility and the defragged the reg. The idea being
 a complete clean install. I then deactivated all accounts in Office 365 (website) and started completely from scratch.
</p>
<p>New install worked without activation until I rebooted, then the same activation issues and additionally could not find updates</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2dadcde-01d3-45fb-a20f-75688cc54033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2dadcde-01d3-45fb-a20f-75688cc54033" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly the new installed version worked without a signed in user. After trying to activate using my credentials and then getting the above error, I am now a signed in user on the panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last test was to remove user accounts as a post on an earlier issue</p>
<p>http://microsoftplatform.blogspot.co.nz/2015/04/office-365-activation-issue-on-rds.html</p>
<p>I figured it could be an accounts issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck</p>

<p>These manuals have multiple(5~10) chapters.&nbsp;</p>

            And I want one on gold embossed black paper saying that I have done the unpaid job of a Microsoft employee in the forums. Come to think of it, I'll have the free software like Joe please. And a certificate like Cbarnhorst. And an autographed photo like
 D R H. Don't want the Dona Sarkar signature though. No cancel all that I'll just have the back pay, thanks. :-)

<h2>            Excel will not sum values in status bar</h2>

<p>
</p><p>format as number</p>
<p>right click status bar and check the value to show</p>
<p>
</p><p>wasting a lot of time (and money) and this is happening on multiple workbooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>figured it out....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the fact that the column is highlighted to format the values as numbers, the green arrow by the cells indicates that the cell is not formatted as a number. Go figure, silly me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took a chance...Fixed it by highlighting the column, clicking on a green arrow, clicking the command to format as a number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong> from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start bits </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>5. Type<strong> Exit</strong> in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></p>

            Not necessarily, IMAP is a more advanced protocol than POP, it supports email and folder sync which POP does not do.&nbsp; My concern is that you may have another computer connected to it setup as POP account which would have the effect of downloading and removing
 email from the server.&nbsp; What do you see in webmail, is all your email present?&nbsp;

            It took 2 months, but MS has confirmed that there is no way to know if the battery is fully charged on this keyboard. If the charging system is working correctly, it will never take more than 6 hours to fully charge the battery. However, if the charging
 system is not working correctly, you will never know it. Another example of bad design on MS's part.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found by chance (charging in a dark room) that the LED in the top left of the keyboard flashes slowly when the keyboard is being charged and stays solid when charging is complete. Under normal lighting I would not have noticed as the LED is so
 small.</p>

            Thanks much for this, Paul. MS did not know this. The light on ours never goes solid, so it would appear that ours is defective. Now I'll find out if MS will honour its warranty.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds as if your keyboard may be defective like you say. I tested mine this morning and the LED flashed and then went solid when fully charged. When in use and connected my LED is normally off. The MS manual as usual tells you everything except
 the most obvious things you need to know. I wonder sometimes who writes them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do keep in mind that sometimes, the documentation for various hardware devices, made by Microsoft (<strong>and others</strong>) is not written by the people who actually&nbsp;<em>designed</em> the product and/or support it.&nbsp; Such is the way when things are designed
 in one place, and much else is outsourced elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I speak from experience as someone who used to design hardware and back then when I was in the profession, we actually wrote our own documentation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But I did experience, toward the end of my employment journey (I am now retired), when my employer started outsourcing a lot of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The writing was on the wall!</p>

<h2>            Builds 10547, ..., Windows 10 RTM&#58;  Can&#39;t Copy System Image Folder to Mapped Network Drives</h2>
                    <p>Trying to copy a system image backup of my cleanly installed Windows 10 RTM across my network to a mapped network drive on my NAS, I dragged and dropped the directory to the mapping of the drive (Z:). &nbsp;After accepting the UAC prompt for copying that directory,
 Windows popped up a warning that Z: couldn't be found (even though I was staring at it in a separate File Explorer instance and could browse it). &nbsp;If I then dragged the folder to the same directory in the Network area of File Explorer (i.e., non-mapped), the
 transfer began just fine after the UAC prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;This seems to be happening only with the System Image folders that Windows creates. &nbsp;If I drag and drop a regular ol' folder, no problem. &nbsp;Might have something to do with the UAC prompt.</p>

<p>Hi Charith,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In many cases, Office 365 activates automatically over the internet after you install Office on your PC. Other times, it may prompt you to sign in to activate. Since your email address is not associated with the Office account, we recommend that you activate
 it using the product key. To start-up with this, you may click on this <strong><a href="https://office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to associate your email to the Office account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may also check the different option to activate Office on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-365-office-2016-or-office-2013-1144e0de-e849-496e-8e33-ed6fb1b34202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Activate Office 365, Office 2016, or Office 2013">link</a></strong>.</p>

            Have you tried to repair the Windows Mail and Calendar App? Go to your apps and features. Click start and type apps then select apps and features.  Scroll down to Mail and Calendar click on it the click on Advanced options and scroll down to where it says repair. 
<br />Somewhere I read that Windows mail uses Temp Internet files so I would clear my browsers Cache and cookies Open in most browsers by holding CTRL SHIFT and pressing the delete key. After you have done all of the above restart your computer. Check to see if your mail is still coming in as plain text. 
<br />Let me know
<br />Sam

<p>I can't imagine what the problem is? If it's microsoft&nbsp;as it's always interfering whatever I attempt to do. It closes pages I open. Makes me stop in the middle of a search...It;s the behavior of windows 10. It's impossible to work with windows 7 was much
 better.</p>
<p>Anyways I cannot understand why I cannot open my email.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Gail</strong>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There could be an error that has occurred that’s why you’re unable to open your Outlook email account. Just to confirm, are you trying to sign in to your account using the
<strong>Outlook desktop app</strong> or through <strong>Outlook.com website</strong>? I’d like also to know if you’ve encountered an
<strong>error message</strong>. If so, kindly provide a <strong>screenshot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, I’d suggest that you try signing in to your account using a
<strong>different device</strong> to isolate if the issue is with the device or the Outlook email account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let me know the result after trying the steps.</span></p>

</p><blockquote>Let me correct you @93tid, Mobikwik is not a retailer of phones and no one purchased phone from them neither this offer; we purchased Microsoft phones from other retailers or Microsoft stores&nbsp;and Microsoft promoted this offer
 which is fulfilled by another 3'rd party called MobiKwik!
<p>
</p><p>Anyways I don't care what you think or&nbsp;say but please stop replying&nbsp;based on your assumptions unless you have some concrete thing or proof to provide; just replying to score points and badges is not good.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I cared about points or badges I would have stopped posting here years ago. Here's something concrete for you to chew on:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.mobikwik.com/termsandconditions/offers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mobikwik.com/termsandconditions/offers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"5. MobiKwik reserves the right to extend or terminate this Offer without prior notice. MobiKwik reserves the right at any time, without prior notice, to add/alter/modify/change or vary all of these Terms &amp; Conditions or to replace wholly, or in part, this
 Offer by other offer(s), whether similar to this Offer or not, or to withdraw it altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Any person taking the advantage of this offer shall be deemed to have read, understood and accepted these terms and conditions</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. MobiKwik Wallet Users are requested to be accustomed, satisfy and agree to with these and the terms and conditions of the Offer of MobiKwik before participating in or making any purchase in relation to this Offer. Participation in the Scheme is discretion
 of the MobiKwik Wallet User and it shall not, in any way, affect the performance of the product purchased under the Offer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your fight against Mobikwik, I sincerely wish you succeed, although in my opinion the chances are slim to none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing - I escalated this issue via internal channels on March 10th. On March 14th Microsoft India decides to acknowledge the problem and tweets about discussing the issue with Mobikwik. It must be pure coincidence, obviously.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to keep the outline of the box visible: 
<br />
<br />This is a legacy form field. If you protect the document for filling in forms (Restrict Editing) you will be able to simply click on the box to check it.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you could use, instead, the checkbox content control.
<br />
<br />Or, you could use the method suggested in this site:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/checkbox-disappears/0ef369bf-607a-4f57-b0a2-0fee9c362812">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>By the way, those answers don't solve the problem. I already went through those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Just curious but, did you actually try out what I said about the issue for yourself? Did you try the answer before you responded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, it requires further help. Can someone provide clearer instructions on what should go in the content control box so that the issue doesn't happen?</p>
