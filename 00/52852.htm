<h2>            Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 Evaluation Copy Problems with NIC</h2>
                    
<p>I was running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 registered version and received an evaluation copy from the college I currently attend. After installing the evaluation copy my PC does not pick up my NIC. Not sure if it is a driver problem or what. I
 now cannot connect to the Internet at all because it cannot find the NIC. Could someone please guide me in the right direction as to where I should go from here. Without being able to connect to the Internet on that computer it will be practically impossible
 to download the drivers if that is in fact the problem right??? Please help! As an online student the Internet is my livelihood!</p>

            That sounds like &nbsp;webcam or a video graphics card setting. Neither of these are controlled by Movie Maker, so I would check those devices and their settings for Autopan. Alternatively, I've seen this reported for screen record software like Camtasia studio,
 so maybe you have that active?

    <title>How can I set the proofing language to English-US when I have an input - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gbyrka  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I set the proofing language to English-US when I have an input in French&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>It's one of the most annoying thing in the Microsoft desktop software.. I have been struggling to be able to have my proofing language as English despite my French keyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>I only type in English, but I have a French keyboard.</li><li>I have set the primary language in my control panel language as English US.</li><li>I have set the Office language as English US and even deleted French from the languages so English US is the only remaining language.</li></ul>
<p>Despite these settings, whenever I create a Microsoft file, the proofing language is French..</p>
<p>And even if I set the proofing language for a document (e.g. ppt, onenote, etc..), when I reopen it and start a new tab/slide, again, French is the proofing language.</p>
<p>Isn't there a way to workaround this?</p>
<p>I guess I am not the only person in the world typing in another language than the one of my keyboard ;)</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have a clue!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Greg</p>

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are using French Keyboard and want to use English as your proofing language. You have set English as primary language still you are facing issue and cant get English as your proofing language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a chance that the keyboard layout settings get corrupted or might be missing some setting. So, try to follow the suggestion provided in the below mentioned article and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can customize your keyboard for a specific language or format by changing the keyboard layout. The layout controls which characters appear on the screen when you press the keys on your keyboard. Some input languages have several keyboard layouts; others
 have only one. For example, you can change your keyboard layout from the English QWERTY format to the English Dvorak format. After you change the layout, the characters on your screen might not correspond to the characters on your keyboard keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you can change the keyboard layout, you must add the input language and keyboard layout that you want to Windows.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the Region &amp; Language Windows 8.1 options, I already obviously have 2 languages as it is not possible to remove French because this is the keyboard input language, so I have set US English as primary as I mentionned above and all others settings
 are US English.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8a33825-d2d1-4372-8d98-bafd29ed6226" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding OSK, I guess you're joking lol By the way, this is a laptop, not a tablet..</li></ul>
<p>So when I create a new tab in OneNote and start typing in English, the proofing is in French as you can see below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8942d81-04a4-4b12-8196-a374ad5f2cf7" /></p>
<p>So I would say that this is status quo.. Do you have any other idea?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description it seems that there might be a chance that there is some user profile corruption. So, I would suggest you to create new user profile as an administrator and check the status in new user profile.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account
 we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, for now please try to create new user account as an administrator from the link provided below. Make sure you should follow the steps mentioned under

            <p>Done.</p>
<p>Now, when I boot, the default input keyboard is US english, and I have to also switch input..</p>
<p>So this is a failure..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: why can't I remove US english as input (greyed out) when my preferred input is French? It seems that from a Microsoft standpoint, you cannot set a different primary input &amp; proofing language. Do you confim?</p>
<p>If so, it means that there is no solution and that the language settings are badly designed for Win 8.1.</p>
<p>Please let me know.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that the option of <strong>remove </strong>in English language is greyed out. So, there might be a chance that during installation of Operating System the language selected is English. That is why the remove option for English language
 is greyed out.</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>I am not sure it addresses my issue..</p>
<p>Yes Win 8.1 is installed in English.</p>
<p>So your telling me that there is no solution to set the proofing language to US English with these 2 parameters:</p>
<p>1 - Win 8.1 installed in US English</p>
<p>2 - Keyboard input French</p>
<p>So by extension, it is impossible to set the default proofing language to the installed default language when you have a different input. Isn't it a bug? Or at least a wrong design?</p>
<p>I can't believe that you cannot set the proofing language to the language of your OS :S</p>
<p>Please confirm.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess you did not try to reproduce the issue..</p>
<p>I have already tried the above as I said in my very 1st post.</p>
<p>Both my office &amp; system settings are set to US English.</p>
<p>My ONLY French setting is the keyboard as I have NO choice to remove it: when you have a keyboard in a given language, you CANNOT remove the system settings for that language. So, I added US English and set it as primary... But I also already said this above..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please do not answer to this post unless you have tried to reproduce the issue with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Win 8.1</li><li>A different keyboard input that your system + office language default</li><li>Tried to create powerpoint &amp; OneNote files</li></ul>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the exact same problem in office 2016. The actual keyboard layout determines the proofing language of the text I enter,
<em>regardless </em>of the default setting in Office "Language" setup.</p>
<p>It is very annoying, if I want to update a document using my Hungarian keyboard layout then
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how the keyboard layout can be independent from the input language in Office 2016.</p>

            <p>The laptop that I received from my college is an HP, and it too is overly sensitive. Below is how I fixed the issue on mine:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Open Control Panel, and at the top right,&nbsp;set the&nbsp;<strong>View by</strong> drop down menu&nbsp;to
<strong>Large Icons</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/157e45c4-e135-4828-b084-6c4404c11da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/157e45c4-e135-4828-b084-6c4404c11da1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open <strong>Mouse</strong> from the list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Select the&nbsp;<strong>Clickpad Settings </strong>tab and&nbsp;click on the <strong>
Clickpad Settings </strong>button</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Uncheck <strong>Pinch Zoom</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Apply changes and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your hardware/software arrangement, your setup may be slightly different. Let me know if this helped.

<h2>            How do I disable the zoom in scrolling after backspace&#47;spacebar is pressed while typing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft community, I want to ask how to disable the automatic scroll after I press backspace/space while typing. If there's a scroll bar, pressing backspace/space will automatically drag the text section to the top or bottom of the text box... I am
 getting really annoyed by this, can someone please give me some tips on how to disable it? If I want to scroll during typing, I'll prefer using the mouse or arrow keys instead of being dragged to the top/bottom whenever I backspace/space.</p>
<p>

            Well I have the problem from sticky notes, microsoft word, and to just about any other text boxes that is long enough to have a scroll bar. Wouldn't it annoy anyone if spacing or backspacing drags the line of text section to the bottom or top of the box
 every single time? It kind of hurt my eyes if I have to scroll back to that part of the box and then another space making it go down or up again. Also sadly scroll lock didn't work.

<p>Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
We'd like to help you with your concern. To better isolate the issue, we'd like to ask the following questions below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried using other cables to check?<br />
</li><li>Is this the first time you're doing this kind of setup?<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>For further assistance, you may contact your device manufacturer for additional help.<br />
<br />
We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>I just brought new cables because the originals were lost when we moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to this type of setup, well I never had to configure a monitor because it would auto detect any new device (had a dell laptop). I have not done this type of setup on this Windows 10 HP Envy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be helpful.</p>
<p>

            There are many possible reasons why this issue is happening like if there is additional setup required using the new cable. We highly recommend contacting the manufacturer for both the monitor and laptop to verify the compatibility using the new cable.<br />

 my computer freezes, the system is acting as if A LOT OF DATA is being downloaded (and such can last for 3- 8 minutes before the freeze unfreezes). Is this the sign of one or more viruses? Spyware? Malware? All three? Please HELP!!!!</p>

<h2>            gfxui has stopped working</h2>
                    Hey i got this "gfxui has stopped working" And i have done this <br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution:</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel|Click 'Uninstall a Program' (Programs and Features)</p>
<p>2. Look for Microsoft .Net Framework in the list and Uninstall them all (restarting the computer each time it tells you to)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Once they are all gone, open the Uninstall a Program (Programs and Features) again and click Turn Windows features on or off on the bar on the left</p>
<p>4. You'd get another window on and you need to uncheck Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5.1 from the list and click OK</p>
<p>5. Proceed with it complete uninstall and restart the computer (when it tells you to)&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Open the&nbsp;'Uninstall a Program' (Programs and Features) again and now look for Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and uninstall all these as well.</p>
<p>7. Restart the computer and&nbsp;open the Uninstall a Program (Programs and Features) again and click Turn Windows features on or off on the bar on the left and place a check on Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5.1 (it would be a blue square and not a check) and install
 it again</p>
<p>8. Finally, download &amp; install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package from Microsoft's website<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>
<p>You won't see that error again, provided you have a proper security package (antivirus &amp; firewall) installed.&nbsp;I use
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;link removed&gt;</span> which, as per their website, are offering $10000 coverage if your system gets infected after you have installed it!
<br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>But it dit not work :(</p>
<p>What now ?<br />

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
Can you tell us a little more about what is happening right before the computer freezes?&nbsp; Does it do this when you are using your computer for browsing the Internet, or running a program such as a game or Office?&nbsp; Does it do it whenever it is just sitting idle?&nbsp;
 Is your computer a laptop or a desk top and what is the brand and model?<br />
<br />
When it freezes, bring up the Task Manager and click on the Processes tab to see what processes are using the most CPU time.&nbsp; That&nbsp;can tell you if a particular process or&nbsp;program is causing it to freeze.<br />
<br />
One main reason for this type of behavior is a virus, spyware, or malware.&nbsp; Run a full system scan on your computer using a good virus and spyware scanner such as Microsoft OneCare:
<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm?s_cid=sah/?s_cid=sah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm?s_cid=sah/?s_cid=sah</a>&nbsp; or Trend Micro Housecall:
<a href="http://housecall.trendmicro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://housecall.trendmicro.com/</a>.<br />
<br />
You can also run the System file checker to see if you have any corrupt system files:<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.<br />
<br />
Let us know this information so we can better assist you in resolving your issue.<br />
Thank you,<br />

            Hi Kevin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Several WIndows apps require access to your Google account or you can't use it in Windows because Google will block it.  
<br />
<br />For Windows 10 Mail Google also requires a Security Settings change they don't always tell you about here:  <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010...</a>.  This is mostly a scare to try to keep you from using WIndows 10 Mail's huge ad-free reading pane which deprives Google advertisers of your eyes on their ads in Gmail.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            &#34;...not a valid Win32 application&#34;</h2>
                    Every single thing I download I get the error that it's not a valid Win32 application. I've tried defragmenting, virus scan, everything.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 build 7100 <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance

                    I have been called by fake microsoft-helpers and typed ASSOC. Then a list appeared with ZFSendToTarget..etc. After she wants to use teamviewer I hung up the phone. My question is: did I do any damage to my pc by typing ASSOC ?&nbsp;

<p>This command informs you about a file's extension and the way Windows will deal with it, or it lets you modify this method. If you can open your files as usual then there is no damage.</p>

<p>no, typing ASSOC into a command prompt just displays a list of file extension associations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>no doubt they told you the list shows lots of issues - utter rubbish!</p>
