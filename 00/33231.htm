 that problem is caused due to disk error.</p>

    <title>Re-installed Windows, why are there logs from weeks ago&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric202  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-installed Windows, why are there logs from weeks ago&#63;</h2>
                    The dates on a recently installed system don't seem possible.<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some entries in Event Viewer date from before re-installing Windows, even after taking into account the system clock running behind.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it possible for something (malware?) to survive the format in some way and then cause this?</p>
<p>One of the logs is regarding Windows Defender.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Details:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Formatting the computer:-<br />
</p>
<p>Switched off at power<br />
</p>
<p>CMOS battery removed for a while<br />
</p>
<p>Held down the power button for 15 secs<br />
</p>
<p>Used diskpart 'clean all'<br />
</p>
<p>Re-installed Windows 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>System clock and log times:-<br />
</p>
<p>Clock wasn't set in the UEFI bios, and is about 190 days behind. <br />
</p>
<p>Adding 190 days to all other Event Viewer entries puts them at about the right time.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Except four entries. <br />
</p>
<p>These four log listings are within two seconds of each other.<br />
</p>
<p>Adding the 190 days to these 4 log times, still makes them weeks before the format.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Event logs dated before format:-<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WCMSVC: Complete Service Shutdown<br />
</p>
<p>Log name: Microsoft-windows-Wcmsvc/Operational<br />
</p>
<p>Event ID: 10004<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Defender state updated to 2.<br />
</p>
<p>Log name: Microsoft-windows-defender/WHC<br />
</p>
<p>Event ID: 101<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The kernel power manager has initiated a shutdown transition.<br />
</p>
<p>Log name: System<br />
</p>
<p>Event ID: 109<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The operating system is shutting down at system time (system time here)<br />
</p>
<p>Log name: System<br />
</p>
<p>Event ID: 13<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Why might these events be logged before windows was re-installed, after taking into account the system clock difference?<br />
</p>
<p>- Could a bug / malware have survived the way the format was done?<br />
</p>
<p>- Is it possible for Event logs to get the date from somewhere other than the system clock?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many Thanks<br />
</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the fast reply.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I am unable to post a screenshot, as the event viewer log is on a different computer to the one I am using to write this. The computer with the Event Viewer issue is not yet connected to the internet, after the format and re-installation of Windows 8.1.<br />
Also, there are so many screens needed to show the information. The events are in different parts of the event viewer. It is impossible to post screenshots, but if it was not impossible, it would need many screenshots.<br />
<br />
Instead, to provide the required information, I will type some information here, from the event logs on the other computer.
<br />
If the details or information you need to see is not shown here please let me know.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>- What are these Event logs regarding?<br />
- Why would they be dated from weeks before the system clock time?<br />
- Where else could they possibly get the time and date from?</p>
<p>- Could malware have survived the format?</p>
<p>The computer has not been connected to the internet since before it was formatted.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />
Event Viewer information:<br />
From events showing as dated weeks before Windows 8.1 was re-installed, all 4 events are within the same 2 seconds:<br />

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is make and model of the computer?</li></ul>
<p>There can be a possibility of installation source being corrupt. </p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to install any file?</li></ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I would suggest you to run Windows Defender Offline tool and check. Sometimes, malicious and other potentially unwanted software, including rootkits, try to install themselves on your PC. This can happen when you connect to the Internet
 or install some programs from a CD, DVD, or other media. Once on your PC, this software might run immediately, or it might run at unexpected times. Windows Defender Offline can help remove such hard to find malicious and potentially unwanted programs using
 definitions that recognize threats. Definitions are files that provide an encyclopedia of potential software threats. Because new threats appear daily, it's important to always have the most up-to-date definitions installed in Windows Defender Offline. Armed
 with definition files, Windows Defender Offline can detect malicious and potentially unwanted software, and then notify you of the risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=246442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Download the 32-bit version</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=246443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Download the 64-bit version</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To use Windows Defender Offline, you need to follow four basic steps:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download Windows Defender Offline and create a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart your PC using the Windows Defender Offline media.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scan your PC for malicious and other potentially unwanted software.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Remove any malware that is found from your PC.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Windows Defender Offline will walk you through the details of these four steps when you're using the tool. If you've been prompted in Microsoft Security Essentials or Windows Defender to download and run Windows Defender Offline, it's important that you
 do so, to make sure that your data and your PC isn't compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get started, find a blank CD, DVD, or USB flash drive with at least 250 MB of free space and then download and run the tool—the tool will help you create the removable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><em>We recommend that you download Windows Defender Offline and create the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive on a PC that isn't infected with malware—the malware can interfere with the media creation.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also request you to go through the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-defender-offline-beta-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Windows Defender Offline Beta Privacy Statement</strong></a>&nbsp;along with <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-defender-offline-beta-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Windows Defender Offline Beta: frequently asked questions</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> BIOS upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> <em>Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer.&nbsp;In order to&nbsp;update your BIOS, check the information that came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website.</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<div><em>Warning </em>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</em></p>
</li></ul>
<strong>Step 3: </strong>Create a new account using built-in admin account to verify if logs show up again.
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Start</strong> &gt; type <strong>Change PC settings </strong>and press
<strong>enter</strong>. In the opening page, on the left pane, navigate to <strong>
Users</strong> and click it. On the right pane, scroll below, where there is an option
<strong>Add new user</strong>. Click it. Select the appropriate account type and type the username. A new local user account will be created.</p>

    <title>Computer Crashes During Game Play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasasama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Crashes During Game Play</h2>
                    Whenever I attempt to play a game, after several minutes the system goes black and I am forced to power down as it does not shut down nor restart. This condition is the same for all of my games. I currently have a GForce GT 640 graphics card with a computer
 with &nbsp;32GB of RAM. I shouldn't have any problem playing these games. I have done a clean installation of the driver software however this problem persists. Any suggestions?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do you get any error message when the computer is booting up?<br />
2. Did you try to perform a system restore using pre-installed Windows Recovery options or by booting from Windows DVD?</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps listed below:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>: Try to boot the computer in </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>safe
 mode</span></strong></a></span><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>If you can successfully
 boot into safe mode, then try system restore from safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: Try using Last Known
 Good Configuration.</span></p>
<p><span>Last Known Good Configuration is a</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span>
 startup option that uses the most recent system settings that worked correctly.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 displays Windows8_OS for C&#58; drive after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 from 8.1 I noticed that my (c:) was still named Windows8_OS
<br />
<br />
(c:). I tried deleting the temporary files that allow you to revert back to the previous OS<br />
<br />
(Settings-&gt; System-&gt; Storage-&gt; This PC-&gt; Temporary Files-&gt; and deleted Windows 8.1) and my
<br />
<br />
(C:) is still named Windows8_OS. Does anyone know if this is due to installing through an
<br />
<br />
upgrade? Whether something didn't go right in the installation? Is there a fix? or is it
<br />
<br />
something as simple as just renaming it? I didn't just want to rename it if there is
<br />
<br />
something wrong with my PC though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated!</p>

    <title>Not able to open photos with Photo viewer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not able to open photos with Photo viewer</h2>
                    
<p>Problems with picture viewer</p>
<p>We are having the same problems as stated in this Forum of pictures just stopped opening after being opened by the same MS viewer before.&nbsp; Problems started sometime in November.&nbsp; They do not open in paint or Adobe once they are contaminated by. MS photo
 viewer.&nbsp; We have searched the internet and there are many postings of this problem.&nbsp; We have tried many suggested programs to view these files, but none work on contaminated files.&nbsp; Sent two to a company that said they could recover the files for free.&nbsp; They
 did tha as we saw the picture, but would charge me to send the file back.&nbsp; We keep MS current so that is not the problem.&nbsp;Win7-64 Professional and Ultra are being used. For now we are using a Mac as that edits and does not make the file corrupt.</p>

<p>I think you may be&nbsp;making assumptions about what is happening to your photos. The Photo viewer does apparently add LZH compression to Tiff files that have been rotated or otherwise edited but that doesn't prevent them from being opened by other programs.&nbsp;It
 doesn't&nbsp;alter picture files&nbsp;that are simply viewed. That's not to say something hasn't happened to&nbsp;your pictures,&nbsp;just the cause you're suggesting&nbsp;doesn't seem&nbsp;all that likely. I've had tif files corrupted by virus scanners before so many things are in the
 realm of possible. One program that I find is very good for opening problem files is Irfanview. I've seen it open very badly corrupted files... at least the parts that still formed an image.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.irfanview.com/</a>&nbsp;
 Sometimes fixing an apparently corrupt file is just a matter of opening the file and just&nbsp;re-saving it. Irfanview is good at that and can&nbsp;process whole batches of files automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Getting any photo viewer or editor to open a file type is a matter of setting the file associations. A lot of graphics programs take over file associations without notice at the time you install those programs. Sometimes it is done by mistake when someone
 chooses "open with" from Explorer and leaves the "set as default" option checked when they didn't intend to.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel -&gt;Default Programs and click on Set Default Programs. For each of the graphics programs listed here you can set which file types it will open by default. Not all programs will show up here however so you can also set file associations
 for individual file types. Back up one step to the Default Programs screen again and pick ":Associate a file type or protocol with a specific program". In this section is&nbsp;a huge ilst of file types from which&nbsp;you can select any graphics file type to be opened
 by whatever program you wish to use. Assuming it isn't already doing so after the first step above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Yes, this is what is happening.&nbsp; We rotate a picture in Windows photo viewer, then save it.&nbsp; When we try to open it again in photo viewer it says we have
 to update the version of Windows photo viewer.&nbsp; I have checked and double checked suggestions as to the problem.&nbsp; I went as far as set up a clean Win7 Professional and edited some pictures.&nbsp; Not all but 3 out of 5 could not be opened by Windows Photo Viewer
 once edited by WPV.&nbsp; That is a system without virus protection, taken off line and only the needed windows software loaded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Adobe cannot open the corrupt&nbsp;files and we have tried Irfanview before, as a suggestion.&nbsp; I will try to download it again when I can get a site that does
 not piggy back junk loads with the Irtanview load.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows photo viewer is the default viewer, as it has been for over a couple years.&nbsp;As stated before this problem just started consistently November&nbsp; 2010.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you check the internet, there are many people referencing this problem.</span></p>

<p>The link I posted for Irfanview was direct&nbsp;to the author's page. There's no other software piggy-backed with the viewer. Just click the Download current version link, which takes you to Cnet, then click the Download Now button (which is clearly labelled
 IrfanView). There is also an optional plug-ins download on the main page which adds extra functionality, if it's of any use.</p>
<p>Are you sure you are using Windows Photo Viewer, or are you using the Windows Live Gallery viewer? Photo Viewer is part of Windows 7 but Live Gallery is a separate&nbsp;add-on program. Reason I ask is because of your error message.&nbsp;I don't see any updates for
 the Photo&nbsp;viewer that came with Windows 7 but the Windows Live software did get updated relatively recently. Superficially the viewers&nbsp;look much the same&nbsp;but&nbsp; "live photo gallery" is in the title bar of one and it has&nbsp;different options&nbsp;in the toolbar. Live
 Photo Gallery takes over the file defaults if you install it.</p>
<p>Google isn't giving me enough Windows 7 related hits to qualify as "many" so could you post a sample link or two? It could be my choice of search strings.&nbsp;Mostly XP related problems(fixed) turn up&nbsp;or Vista&nbsp;with file transfers or video card related file corruption.&nbsp;The
 few threads that I read were&nbsp;mainly people trying to guess what was going on.&nbsp;I've got a few thousand pix myself and have done just about everything with them, including direct file transfers to other harddrives and computers, without ever having files corrupted.
 If there<strong><em> is</em></strong> a confirmed&nbsp;file corruption problem with Windows Picture Viewer or even Windows Live gallery it would certainly be worth knowing about.</p>

<p>Something nasty certainly happened to the photo. &nbsp;I found the following links which seem to be about the same problem, or something quite similar:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=e0d1bc62-9381-4f45-b466-57a216a4964f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=e0d1bc62-9381-4f45-b466-57a216a4964f</a></p>
<p><a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=218335e0-94e3-485f-88e2-e67381ef741d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=218335e0-94e3-485f-88e2-e67381ef741d</a></p>
<p>Can't quite pin down a common link though among the people who have picture corruption issues versus all the rest who are using&nbsp;the same software but&nbsp;don't have the problem. Corruption seems to be occurring when the file is written to disk, not before. &nbsp;BIOS
 issues, graphics card and harddrive issues were all implicated in various situations but nothing to pin down as a common cause. Of course there is also&nbsp;the possibility of virus infection.&nbsp;Some image file types can be infected to carry the virus so apart from
 corrupting&nbsp;pictures it continues to propagate itself through seemingly unaffected files.</p>
<p>Apart from running the system file checker to look for&nbsp;incorrect version, damaged or missing&nbsp;Windows files you could check for a virus infection using an external (online) antivirus scanner, like Panda, McAfee Scan or Trend Micro etc. If your computer were
 infected then&nbsp;whatever AV program you have installed cannot be trusted to find or fix&nbsp;it anymore.</p>
<p>To run the system file checker click Start and Run, type <span><strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</strong></span>in the run box. If it finds problem files it will automatically try to replace them.</p>
<p>The only Windows 7 picture related software&nbsp;that can be removed and reinstalled is the TIFF&nbsp;filter. That&nbsp;is in the "Turn Windows features on or off" link in Programs and Features. Windows Live Gallery isn't part of Windows 7. You'd download the latest version
 from: &nbsp;</p>

                    When I upload pictures and videos it is only showing gray in the preview side. &nbsp;I've added music and that plays fine. &nbsp;Still no pictures showing. &nbsp;I am not tech savy, so if it programming or software issues, I will be lost. &nbsp;I've had it work a long time
 ago when I used this program, just not able to now. &nbsp;I tried to do a system restore, but wasn't able to because my antivirus was working. &nbsp;Not sure what that means either. &nbsp;Any help?

            <p><span>Hi Lindsay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Let me assist you with your concern. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
There are several causes on why you encounter this issue, please check the following:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> <span>&nbsp;</span>Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker</span></a><span> &nbsp;The current Windows Movie Maker
 12 is included in Windows Essentials 2012. Windows Live Movie Maker is not supported on Windows XP&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Check that the files you are using are of a supported format. Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found here:&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</span></a><br />
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 3:</strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files. Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs:
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>-&nbsp;<strong>Media info</strong> will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</span></a><span>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Windows Live Movie Maker project.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 4:</strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):<br />
<br />
<strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>• Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
• Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
• If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
</span></p>
<p><span>Example:<br />
</span><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</span></a><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</span></a>
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this Microsoft article to install latest drivers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>Yes. I have the network adapter, but it goes out a lot because the walls and floor are thick that go to the basement. Is there anyother wya or do i ahve to figure out how to do it by seeing if there is any possible way to move it up form the basement upstairs?</p>

<p>How is the laptop connected? If you cannot connect in your room, can you take the console closer to the router/modem to see if it will connect at all. Try wired as well.

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response. I see here that you're having some problems with your speakers after opening Movie Maker. May I know if you're still encountering this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then kindly provide us the following information below to isolate this issue first:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you open a different Windows Essentials program such as Photo Gallery or Windows Live Mail, does it also affect your speakers?</li><li>What is the version of your Movie Maker?</li><li>When did this issue start to occur? Have you made any changes to Movie Maker or to your system prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we request you <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall
</a></strong>and <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reinstall
</a></strong>Movie Maker as an initial troubleshooting step then check if it would still make your speakers stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, kindly perform Windows update by clicking on this <strong><a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/thanks.aspx?ln=en&amp;&amp;thankspage=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

            Your suggestion did not help. When I start my video in Movie Maker my speaker "pops" then stops working for all programs. Why would Photo Gallery affect my sound...? My movie maker is the version from the website so unless someone is hiding the newest
 version I think I have it. This issue started occurring within the past month. It worked fine in January though.

            <span>Ever since I updated my laptop with the current Windows 8.1 updates yesterday, every time I open Movie Maker it disables the sound on my entire computer.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>When looking at all volumes they are turned up fine and do not show muted.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>The only solution is to restart the entire computer. Then sound works fine . . . until opening Movie Maker again.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>It does not matter what video I choose to open. It is not video related. It is the exact moment Movie Maker opens that the computer sound is disabled. (I
 know this because I was listening to a youtube music video in the background and when I opened Movie Maker, the sound abruptly came to a stop (similar to that popping sound described above) and would not work again until I restarted)&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>This program will do me zero good if 1. it doesn't work with my operating system 2. It doesn't let me hear the sound on my videos (because when I post the
 videos online, others can hear the sound just fine. It is JUST on my end) 3. It continues to disable my computer sound and I have to restart.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>I believe this is directly related to whatever updates are in the current Windows 8.1 updates because it was working just fine until I updated.&nbsp;</span>

            <p>Now that you mentioned it, back in January when it worked perfectly fine that was before I updated to 8.1! It worked great on Windows 8! I hope we actually get some real help with this stupid issue. It is a nuisance.</p>

            <p>so my current "solution" is to use my husband's windows 8 laptop that does not have the 8.1 update anytime I want to edit a video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really not a "solution" but since microsoft doesn't seem to know how to fix this yet, then it's my only option (aside from doing a system restore to get 8.1 off my computer, which I'm really not interested in messing with)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have known better than to download an update this soon!! Off the subject, but I really don't care for the new mail on the update either. . . . Hmmm, maybe I should do a system restore after all.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't write any description as it is exactly the same what guys wrote above. Moreover, you can see in log files that I use Windows 8.1 6.3.9600.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Movie Maker was working well but after updates it switches my speakers off in moment of uploading video what you can recognize with one single low sound. What helps then is rebooting or going to speakers options and testing them. What I did before writing
 to you was trying to do with my video what I want few times and to figure what exactly happens to speakers. I was also looking for codecs but it seems I have them all correct,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for solving my problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Kasia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for confirming that you have Windows 8.1. Please be informed that we are already aware of this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with Windows Essentials products working in Windows 8.1, please note that these products installed in the operating system can have certain compatibility issues. System requirements for the 2012 products can be found
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/windows-essentials-2012-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Unfortunately, there is no word yet as to whether the products' system requirements has been updated to support Windows 8.1. As with typical software functionality, there are cases wherein the product would work upon installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when problems start to manifest due to system requirement issues then there is no assurance that the problem can be fixed. The only way that this can be addressed is to either have an update to the product be released to address the concern or a
 new entire version of Windows Essentials (2014 or higher perhaps) be made available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Glenda</p>

            <p>Hi Lasse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Were you able to install the game successfully? </p>
<p>2. What happens when you launch the game? Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>3. Was it working before? </p>
<p>4. Are you using 32 or 64 bit type of computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the Windows compatibility center to check if the game is compatible with Windows 7. It looks like the game is not compatible with 64 bit of Windows 7 computer. If you are using 64 bit computer, you may have to install the game in Windows Vista
 compatible mode for the game to run. </p>

<p>It's because there are two sets for those 12 buttons on the top of keyboard. One set treats it as F1 to F12, while another set functions it as the graphic stands (e.g. push F3 will mute your volume).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to switch between these two sets, press Fn and Caps, and you should be able to switch between your tabs in Excel.</p>

                    Windows 10 install hangs at 99% . Trying to install upgrade from Windows 7 Starter on my Asus. I turned off antispyware but that changed nothing. The Upgrade Assistant offers no information or help at all. I've wasted too many hours trying to download
 this and will just forget it unless anyone else has a reliable tip that worked for them.

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

            <p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To disable the touch feature of your Surface Pro 3, we suggest following the steps listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong><em>device manager</em></strong> on <strong>Search/Cortana</strong>, then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the results.</li><li>On Device Manager, look for <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong> and expand it.</li><li>Under Human Interface Devices, right-click on <strong>HID-compliant touch screen</strong> and select
<strong>Disable</strong> from the list.<br />
There may be more than one HID-compliant touch screen, you'll need to disable them as well.</li><li>A pop-up stating <em><strong>Disabling this device will cause it to stop functioning. Do you really want to disable it?</strong>
</em>will appear, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>The device's touchscreen functionality will be disabled immediately.</li></ol>
<p>If at any point you'll want to enable the touch feature again, you can go back to the Device Manager, follow the same steps and choose Enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />

the photo in My Pictures in My documents Folder. I right clicked the photo, <br />
but there is no resizing option. The only way I can resize is if I were going <br />
to e-mail the file.</p>
<p>I use Windows XP/SP3</p>
<p>I appreciate any suggestions</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Right click / resize...will be an option if you<br />
download and install the following free powertoy.</span></p>
<p><span>OK, go to the following link and download and install: ImageResizer.exe<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2meyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://tinyurl.com/2meyw</span></a>

<p><span>Then you can open any folder that contains images and you will have an option to resize. Just right click the selected image
 files and choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You can select one image or a whole group.</span></p>
<p><span>The program will place the resized copies in the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)</span></p>

    <title>Multiple SndTAudio playback devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple SndTAudio playback devices</h2>
                    I run MS Vista Ultimate, 32 bit.&nbsp; There are 16 instances of SndTAudio listed as playback devices in Control Panel, Sound.&nbsp; All of them are disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Driver tab shows the Driver Provider is SndTAudio, 4\4\2008, V. 6.1.10102.333, signed by "private
 multimedia authority".&nbsp; Device Manager lists an entry for SndTAudio.&nbsp; Under Driver File Details, it lists the following drivers in windows\system32\drivers:&nbsp; drmk.sys, LVUSBSta.sys, portcls.sys and SndTAudio.sys.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use a Bose Companion 5 sound system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What is SndTAudio used for and why are there 16&nbsp;playback entries in Control Panel, Sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I delete these since they are all disabled, anyhow?&nbsp;<br />

Hi curt1943,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
The file SndTAudio.sys is not a system file. Those probably are disabled and disconnected device that are listed in Playback Devices.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To
 prevent those disabled/disconnected devices from showing, you can right click in the blank space in Playback Devices and uncheck Show Disabled/Disconnected Devices.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also, I will suggest you to run an online virus scan on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may run Full Service Scan from:
