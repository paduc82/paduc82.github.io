            Hi Carey,
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On that page under your info, check the status of your licence to Office 2016
<br />
<br />If that checks out, click this link and run through the Office activation troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation, including activation . . .

<h2>            Outlook 2016 calendar printing problem</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, with the latest update for Outlook, my weekly calendar prints so small I cannot read it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using MS Office 365, Version 1705 (Build 8201.2025 Click to Run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has worked every week and I have not changed any settings. Has there been an update? Is there a fix? I already tried changing the font size in the printer page set up tab and nothing happened.</p>

<p>I apologize but the fix got pushed to a later build.&nbsp; It is scheduled to release to production to Current Channel on June 15th.&nbsp; Insider Slow would get it before that but I am not sure yet the specific date.&nbsp; I just tested the next build and it is not in
 there either.&nbsp; The best I know right now is sometime between now and June 15th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is highly impacting you can&nbsp;optionally&nbsp;switch to the Current Channel build until we get the fix out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1:&nbsp; Click File, Office Account, click&nbsp;Update Options, and click Disable Updates.&nbsp; You&nbsp;should put an Appointment on your calendar for 6/15 or&nbsp;later to remember to&nbsp;re-enable&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:&nbsp; Open a Command Prompt (right click the Start Menu click Run and type CMD and press Enter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the following two commands in order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun </p>
<p>
</p><p>officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=16.0.8067.2115</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take a few minutes for the updates to install to revert to 8067 build.</p>

<h2>            E61 - Does it crash&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, A friend of mine is looking to buy the Nokia E61 with TomTom software.<br />
<br />
The questions i want to ask are.<br />
<br />
1) Does the phone crash or shut down or restart or anything like that?<br />
<br />
2) If i update to the latest firmware for my friend will the problems/bugs be fixed?<br />
<br />
3) Overall do you think it is a good or bad phone to use?<br />
<br />
Thanks, And i hope you answer all my questions if possible :)<br />
<br />
Btw i'm relying on you guys to tell me if this phone crashes or not ;)

            It does more than crash.<br />
<br />
This phone has the absolute worst stability of any phone I've had the (dis?)pleasure of using.<br />
<br />
The original, version 1 firmware saw bluetooth crashing weekly, if not multiple times a week. It would simply stop talking to my bluetooth earpiece, and manually forcing a disconnect rendered bluetooth unusable on the phone due to the phone refusing to connect
 to any bluetooth device until it was restarted.<br />
<br />
Messaging similarly crashes at random - open an email, and there's a good chance Messaging will simply die. I've seen cases where Messaging is in a half-dead state, where it'll show me a couple of folders, and will refuse to navigate anywhere or exit. Again,
 the only fix is (surprise!) a restart.<br />
<br />
Version 3 of the firmware (the latest at time of writing) has improved bluetooth stability somewhat - but it's absolutely destroyed voice recognition. 'No match found' is now what I hear 99% of the time when trying to use voice recognition to dial an entry
 in my phonebook - I've wasted countless minutes at a time trying to make a simple phone call via voice recognition, and eventually just give up in disgust with most calls. My voice is the same as it was when using the v1 firmware, and I'm using the same bluetooth
 earpiece (Motorola H300) - the voice recognition issue began to rear it's ugly head while making my first phone call after updating to v3, and it's been with me ever since.<br />
<br />
A device is only as good as the software running on it - and this phone is, simply put, a steaming pile of ****.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is simply a sad commentary on the state of software nowadays - I really do wonder if anyone really bothers doing quality control on the software they release. Then again, some companies appear to have a worse track record with this than others
 (are you listening, Nokia?).<br />
<br />
End result: I do not recommend buying this phone. I spent far too much on it, considering the endless frustration it provides me.

<br />
my only complaints are:<br />
very occasionally runs out of memory and requests that I close other apps - has happened to me 2 or 3 times in the few months I've owned it. I am a light user, though.<br />
<br />
for full functionality, you really do need to download 3rd party applications, but the default web browser and email apps are both pretty good. I deleted opera mini and went back to the nokia browser.<br />
<br />
sounds like the previous poster needs maybe even a warranty repair or exchange. I've had none of the issues pinkfreud described.

            I'm using an unlocked E61 in the US (AT&amp;T). The phone was obtained second-hand last year, and other than the annoying bluetooth + Messaging app crashes, worked well.<br />
<br />
The V3 update appeared to apply successfully, and the voice recognition problems started *immediately* afterwards. Also, Messaging continues to crash on occasion (I'm not the only one to notice this - see
<a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=349</a> for someone else who has faced the Messenger crashes on the E61).<br />
<br />
There doesn't appear to be anything *physically* wrong with the phone - the problems are in software.<br />
<br />
The software on the E61i could very well be more stable. If that's the case, though, I'm really wondering why Nokia is leaving us E61 users out in the cold with the broken software on the E61, rather than providing a fixed version for us.<br />
<br />
I specifically avoided the Windows Mobile platform to stay away from buggy software. So far, though, I've been underwhelmed by the S60's performance. I don't know what my next phone will be, but as of this moment, it doesn't look like it's going to be a Nokia,
 if the E61 is any indication of what I can expect from them.

<h2>            Windows 10 and Office 365 Installation&#47;Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clean installed Windows 10, had Windows 8.1 and Office Home &amp; Student 2013 installed and running. I have tried and failed to activate Windows, though I am certain Windows (8.1) and Office Home &amp; Student 2013 packages are/were genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use the product key to activate Windows 10, acquired through using the Magical Jelly Bean Key Finder program (and other programs recommended by Microsoft). But unfortunately this didn't work. As far as I have read and understand it should
 automatically activate after a couple days? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed Office 365 (free trial), assuming that Home &amp; Student 2013 will not allow a second installation. I tried to use the product key (on the box of the Home &amp; Student 2013)&nbsp;to activate Office 365, this obviously didn't work. Have I
 lost my Home &amp; Student 2013 package? Will I have to purchase Office 365?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

<h2>            Locked out of My Settings</h2>
                    I have had my omnia for two days now. I received an error message from my phone when I tried to open my settings, since then I cannot open my settings. I have rebooted the phone multiple times but still nothing. Any suggestions???

            Ok, so when you press START then Programs that menu appears but if you press START then SETTINGS, nothing appears?&nbsp; If that is correct, if it were mine, I would perform a Hard Reset to bring it back to factory condition.&nbsp; That WILL fix the issue.&nbsp; If it
 does not, then you have an issue with the device and I would return it.

<h2>            Underdeveloped Apps</h2>
                    <p>I use Clipboard Pro version 1.4(NETavenue) in my windows phone Nokia Lumia 930 on OS 8.1.W installed from the store.While I tap on my prepared text,I don't get the option to copy to the clipboard on-the-same-page and when I tap on my chosen blank
 space to paste,the clipboard doesn't arise on the screen to choose a copied text from several to paste.For every action,I have to come out of the page and go to the clipboard to choose one which is very disgusting.I have tried other clipboards from the store
 but in vain whereas NATIVE CLIPBOARD ON ANDROID HAS GIVEN ME FULL SATISFACTION.Secondly,I use facebook app by Microsoft Corporation updated where despite being admin of a group,when I go for a friend's post approval directly from notification,I read " you
 do not have permission to view this group and even when I go directly to my group,I don't find pending post shown for approval then I am compelled to go to my android phone and see in the facebook Inc app ,sevaral posts are waiting for my approval.Even there's
 no option in the windows app to share a post to a group or friend which is common in android app.While updating app in play store,download speed is shown on the same screen provided time needed and rest in percentage all this lacks in windows store.ARE U REALLY
 SERIOUS TO COMPETE WITH ANDROID IN MARKET SHARING.Could U ANSWER ME PLS WHY I FEEL HARASSED WITH SO LOW QUALITY APPS FAR BEYOND CUSTOMERS SATISFACTION COMPARING WITH ANDROID ON APP DEVELOPMENT When astonishingly I observe most popular facebook to use with
 backdated official fb app......</p>

    <title>Video Clips on Nokia 5310 XpressMusic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennii---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Clips on Nokia 5310 XpressMusic</h2>
                    Hi, I've tried to put video clips from my computer into my Nokia 5310 Xpress Music, and to do that, I have converted them to MPEG-4 with a program, but, at my Nokia device, I can only listen to the video clips I cannot see the video itself :S<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me or give me tips or a converting program that 100% works ? :)<br />
<br />
I need help please!<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Whatver video encoder you use must choose MP4 as container and MPEG4 as codec. Also check the frame rate and resolution.<br />
Super is all the way.<br />
Besides, any video converter, total video converter etc good **bleep** are available over the net.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Super is a freeware but a pain in **bleep** to download.

            Hey can you use proper linking so that this doesn't happen?<br />
<br />
I would say that you won't find an encoder or converter that works 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
But there are many options:<br />

            Hi i have the same problem with my nokia 5310. I can play any mp4/3gp video files on my phone with 176x144 (QCIF) but when i try to put the same file with same parameters but with 320x240 resolution the phone plays only the sound. In other hand any application
 (not video files) with that resolution are running w/o any problems(games, java programs).<br />
<br />
And my question is is there a software update or something so i can run video files with my display resolution ? or this nokia can play only video files with QCIF or lesser resolution? I am asking because i have seen phones w/o simbian that can play the same
 resolution. like SE W series

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Nokia 5310 only supports a resolution of 176x144 for video clips. It cannot be changed by any sort of software update.<br />
For further info go to nokia website and read the specifications.<br />
<br />

Normal protocol - Just download and install.<br />
<br />
Note: Don't update the Windows media player 9 runtime when prompted during the program installation.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

            <p>You might have tried Office 365 Home and the subscription has expired. Even though you subscription has expired you still have a grace period to reactivate it before it will be cancelled. Maybe you should contact the support and ask them to cancel the trial.
 They have the possibility to cancel immediately the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have tried the product from another portal as the one used to redeem Office 365 University with a different billing address (another country). This might also be the cause.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> max yin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Get a slim &#34;Viewer&#34; app for music, videos, photos, etc., and open media by default.</h2>
                    <p>Let's be clear. We need our music/video/photo collections, and we want to manage them in a powerful app. Here comes three core apps: Xbox Music, Xbox Video and Photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for most of the time, we double-click a media file just to check what it is, and then we would close the window. Then the three apps are too powerful to be necessary. Plus, the startup time for these three apps is rather slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For an upgrade for Windows Media Player (Playing mode) and Photo Viewer, I want to introduce a lightweight app called "Viewer" (There could be other names like "Previewer"). When a sound/music/video/photo/<strong>GIF</strong>/... is double-clicked, a little
 window just pop out and show us what this file is really is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A playlist in a sidebar is also needed. If I want to search for a particular sound file, or a picture, here is where it is. The sidebar should be shown when "Play all" or "View all" command in file explorer is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be 2 buttons. One is "Add to collections", and one is "Open&nbsp;by Music/Video/Photos".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What counts is the app should be responsive, because it should be lightweight! Or, just embed it into the explorer!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have updated from Office 2010 Pro Plus to Office 2016 Pro Plus.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also bought Project &amp; Visio Pro 2016 but when I go to install either Visio or Project I get the error saying that due to the setup change I can't install the other 2 softwares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way round this, as due to my course I use 2 or all of these during the year and saves me installing and then uninstalling each time?</p>

                    I am trying to block a sender via the Outlook Mobile App for Android. When I select the e-mail I wish to block (from my junk folder), it seems that I can only delete it, put it into another folder, mark as read, mark as unread, set flag, clear flag, or
 say not junk. Is this function not available for the mobile app?

 5 most liked comments, the 5 newest comments, the most active channels, etc. How do I get at that data? Do I have to go straight to the database, or is there an API that I can use to pull that information?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did an Add/Remove on the Internet Explorer patch Q916281 and now the computer freezes up at shutdown with a black screen and a flashing cursor in the center.&nbsp; I have not been able to find this file anywhere, not even the Microsoft Download Center!&nbsp;
 And yes, I am using Windows Millenium.&nbsp; It's the best this computer can handle.&nbsp; Thanks in advance to anyone who can point me to this file!</p>

<p>Support for Win4.x ended in July 2006 and Windows Update no longer supports Win4.x (and all Win4.x downloads have been pulled from the MS Download Center, too).</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Why have all Win4.x downloads have been pulled from the MS Download Center?? It's not like they occupy that much space and there are still many users of the older OS's out there! My computer, which my younger children use, will not support a higher version
 of Windows or Internet Explorer! At least release the files to a site like Download.com or FileHippo.com or OldApps.com so users can access them!</p>
<p>If I cannot get this patch for IE 6.0, can you tell me how to manually remove IE 6.0? The only options under "Start - Control Panel - Add/Remove" for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 with Internet Tools are "Add Component" and "Repair." Windows is unstable
 after removing the Internet Explorer Q916281 patch and, when shutting down, has a black screen and a blinking cursor in the left center of the screen. I've tried the "Repair" option, and it seemed to do something, but it didn't fix the problem. I also have
 something called "Internet Explorer patch Q903235" under "Add/Remove", and everytime I try to remove it, I get an error that says it cannot uninstall it. I would like to uninstall all Internet Explorer references from the computer and possibly leave it off
 or install an earlier version of Internet Explorer. Thank you.</p>
        </p>

<p><br />
Probably because MS no longer supports WinME (or Win98 or Win95, etc.).</p>

            There is a solution for removing IE, with this thing I believe was called 98lite. It is available as a free trial.

<p>&nbsp;I eventually worked it out myself. Excel was on my laptop when I bought this laptop.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office took over my spreadsheets etc and offered me a free trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this expired - I did not want this!! - my saved spreadsheets from before and would not work- this was mad - why did I have to&nbsp; suffer this and waist my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was eventually tried to uninstall Microsoft Office from my laptop - it was exteremely difficult to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent ages before I got this worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Microsoft Office for wasting so many hours on this - I am not happy at all with this</p>

<p>After detection, I remove quarantined file but again next time,when I open laptop,same is repeated. That means this malware can't be removed by Windows Defender. What can be done now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How To Upgrade Windows 10 Build 10074 to Build 10240 If You Get An Error When Attempting To Install &#40;Works 100&#37;, should work for other builds&#41;</h2>
                    <p>It's pretty simple. I figured this out when helping somebody. This also works</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the clock in the taskbar and click <strong>Adjust Date/Time</strong>.</li><li>Turn <em><strong>off</strong></em> internet synchronization.</li><li>Change the date to anywhere in the month September (or any time between April 29th and October 1st). The Windows Update error&nbsp;may change if you have gone far back enough, however, this will not matter.</li><li>Reactivate Windows by going into Settings, clicking the link that says <strong>
Activate Windows</strong>, and activate using the product key <strong>6P99N-YF42M-TPGBG-9VMJP-YKHCF</strong>.</li><li>Download the Windows 10 Media Creation tool.</li><li><strong>DO NOT</strong> upgrade directly with the tool. Instead, create a Windows 10 installation media or ISO.</li><li>Once the tool completes the creation, start the setup program. If it asks you to install updates,
<strong>DO NOT</strong> have them installed, because of the same reason as above.</li><li>Run the setup from the media/ISO. If it tries to install updates and it gets stuck, then things were not done correctly. Close the update window (using Task Manager if neccessary) and follow the directions more closely.</li></ol>
<div>It should now start installing.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Great old school method for tricking an install.</p>
<p>The latter part is a bit hard to understand I think while I sit here creating my USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Step 7, when you start the setup program, it is from the USB media or the ISO one created correct?</p>
<p>In Step 8, you say run the tool. You mean the Win10 Media creation tool? I thought the install was supposed to be from the media that was created by the &nbsp;tool whether USB drive or ISO.</p>

            <p>When you say you did a USB install already. Did you use the insider ISO. What did you roll the clock back too? Was your Insider preview active already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I didn't require the key at all since my Insider Preview was activated and continued to upgrade itself back in July. The upgrade to Windows 10 Pro seemed to run without the key. I downloaded from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected Windows 10 Pro. Then I created my ISO on a memory Stick.</p>
<p>Once I rolled back my clock on my main system, my VM of Windows Insider Preview worked again where it didn't work at all after September. I was able to run the installer and UPGRADE my existing install which was active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is imperative to Upgrade and not install. The system must be upgraded from the active Insider Preview you have for the Insider ISO to work correctly. After it is done installing. Your new Win 10 Pro will perform the rest of the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Link below might have some more information you can use. But Maybe not. From your post there isn't much information about what build you are migrating from or what you did in your attempt to install.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't really know what happens if one doesn't have an active Insider preview install.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>I had insider builds on both laptops, not sure which build number. They expired with the winload error and would not start. On one of them I managed to reset the bios date and get access, on the other the OS seemed to kept resetting the date on boot so couldn't
 get access.<br />
<br />
Upgrade on the one I got access to failed activation. On the other I did a fresh install using insider preview ISO, activation also failed.<br />
<br />
I thought the newest builds were going to accept 7/8 product keys so tried that on the fresh install. It wasn't accepted. I'm guessing I'll have to roll back to W7 and start again.<br />
<br />
The other machine was licenced W7 but the product key sticker on the bottom is too worn to read the product key. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both machines I notice appear under my Devices in my windows live account.,</p>

            <p>Sometimes you have to reset the clock and completely unhitch from any network so the OS can't phone home. That way there is no date to verify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On both machines your should only boot off of the USB media and select upgrade.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, the clock can be reset to the proper time and then upgrades can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you are erroring out, I'm not sure what you do. ... other than do a search on the particular error you are getting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah... you can't use win7/8 product keys to install. You would have to re-install 7 and then run the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your live account does it say both were activated?</p>
<p>Too bad about the one number on the laptop being rubbed off.</p>
<p>Sure there isn't a way to get the numbers from an impression?</p>
<p>Might try contacting Microsoft about it, but I don't know if that would get you anywhere.</p>

            <p>ends up the rubbed off serial was something else. Dell apparently hides them under the battery!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And guess what, the latest builds do accept windows 7/8 keys, though I had to revert back to "insider home" to match the keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So both are now working, thanks for the assistance!</p>

            <p>Thanks a bunch for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am grateful that your method allowed me to reclaim my broken Win 10 VM.</p>
<p>As always it wasn't absolutely vital, but then again, it would have cost me a lot of time to try and redo my entire install.</p>
<p>I had spent a year getting my system customized with all of the software I want running perfectly. It is always a hassle to start from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, with your method I didn't have to waste life energy redoing everything again.</p>

            <p>If your computer came with Windows 7 or 8 preinstalled all you have to do is clean install build 10565 and it will detect the OEM activation information and activate automatically. &nbsp;In such a case, click the link on the bottom of the product key page "I
 don't have a product key."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were running Windows 7 or 8 and have a retail product key you can use that during installation and it will activate.</p>

    <title>Browser crashes when I try to attach a file to an email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Browser crashes when I try to attach a file to an email</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I bought a Toshiba laptop last week and it came with Windows 8.&nbsp; Is there a way for me to downgrade to Windows 7 or anything else?&nbsp; I hate windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in case there isn't a way to downgrade, here is the problem I'm having the most trouble with at
 the moment...<br />
<br />
When I type an email and try to add an attachment, the window to browse for a file comes up and then I get "not responding" and the whole browser crashes.&nbsp; I have tried this using both Internet Explorer and Firefox.&nbsp; I have also tried it from various email
 clients - gmail, yahoo mail and aol mail.&nbsp; The exact same thing happens with every browser and every email client.<br />
<br />
I have tried resetting both browsers to no avail.&nbsp; I have tried rolling back my computer, but it didn't help.&nbsp; I think the problem existed from the time I first booted this new computer.&nbsp; I have disabled all of my add-ons.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and re-installed
 firefox.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I would simply take the computer back, but I've spent hours installing my software and my documents on this machine.&nbsp; Please, can you help me fix the problem, or better yet, tell me how to get rid of Windows 8?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
vineyard<br />

            <p><span>Hi nishan19,
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Thank you for posting your query in the
</span><span>Microsoft Community</span><span> Forums. Such issues can sometimes be frustrating for you, but rest assured, we
 are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with a few questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was the previous version of Windows pre-installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you purchase Windows 8 directly from the retailer or did you download it on to the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have the product key and a disk for the previous version of Windows?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method –</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you place the computer in a Clean Boot state. A Clean Boot state
 helps us identify conflicting applications (third party programs) interfering with functioning of the application.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps for the same-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ window type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck the ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then
 uncheck the box next to “Load startup items”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, check the box next to ‘Hide all Microsoft service’,
 and then select ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window
 under the “startup tab”, right click on each startup item that are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then check the box next to ‘Hide all Microsoft
 service’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Select half of the check boxes in the “Services” list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, uncheck half
 of the check boxes selected earlier.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, check the
 remaining boxes. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and the issue persists then,
 that service would be causing the issue. Go to step 6. Proceed to step 4 if, the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the services are causing the problem, then it is most likely that the
 startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The method of identifying a faulty startup item is similar to identifying a faulty
 service. The only difference being that the, “Hide all Microsoft Services” box should not be checked.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once the culprit has been identified then, you either contact the manufacturer
 of the service or try to resolve the issue on your own. If none of the two methods work then, you may uncheck the box next to the faulty service or the startup item.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished with the troubleshooting, follow these steps to
 boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Select the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do get back to us and let us know the status of the issue by your next post
 or in case you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My HTC Smartphone with WM6 has Acrobat Reader LE.</p>
<p>.pdf documents open fine if they are local files.</p>
<p>If while browsing (Internet Explorer)&nbsp;I reach a .pdf file it is not possible to see/download it... just get the&nbsp;message "Error - This file cannot be viewed on the device".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way to make .pdf's readable on browser?</p>
