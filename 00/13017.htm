<h2>            Search not working in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello....I found out a workaround to resolve this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had the same problem and there seems to be no definitive solution. But I found a workaround to get around the problem while waiting for Microsoft to fix it. I have scheduled a shell script that runs a reindex of the Outlook db once a day
 using the mdimport -g command "/ Applications / Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter" -d1 "/ Users / president / Library / Group Containers / UBF8T346G9.Office / Outlook / Outlook 15 Profiles / Main
 Profile ". Running this script only once solves the problem for a few days but then the problem reappears. If instead it is scheduled and executed in the background every day solves the problem definitively. Waiting for the intervention of Microsoft Francesco
 Girorro (Alpinestars IT Manager)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h3> wleong88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot view link to email attachments</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using windows mobile 6 and Exchange server 2007. When I connect WM Internet explorer to outlook web access, I am not able to see any link to attachments in the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use PC IE then I can see the attachment to download.</p>
<p>If I use Opera on the WM I can see and download the attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it I can download the attachment using 3rd party browser but not the built in IE on WM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This seems to be another PIE limitation. It does work with Opera. I hardly ever use PIE on my devices. In fact, I NEVER use it.

<h2>            Device Center won&#39;t connect to Mobile Device &#40;HTC Touch&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done a lot of reading through various forums on the internet but am still stumped as to why I cannot connect my mobile device with Windows Mobile Device Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my setup:</p>
<p>My mobile device is an HTC Touch -&gt; Advanced USB Support is turned ON</p>
<p>My PC is running Windows Vista Home Premium SP1</p>
<p>I have Windoes Mobile Device Center 6.1 installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I plug the phone into my PC, I get the audible USB chirp that something was connected and through Device Manager I see a network adapter installed and functioning properly called Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter.&nbsp; I do not see any
 'Mobile Device' listed in device manager and I suspect this could be my problem but do not understand how to get that to be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMDC does not start up automatically and when I launch it simply says 'Disconnected'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, I have all firewalls turned off, no parental control programs, no&nbsp;Live OneCare&nbsp;and to the best of my knowledge no VPN software installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can help me I'd REALLY appreciate the support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Thank you to all those who have offered advice concerning this issue, the problem is now solved.&nbsp; Fiat_lux got me going down the right path when he suggested I delete the original partnership off of the Touch.&nbsp; I
 was not really sure how to do this but it got me looking at my ActiveSync settings on my device.&nbsp; When I went into my ActiveSync settings on my device, I selected 'Connections...'.&nbsp; In here there is a check box for 'When Cradled synchronize all PCs using this
 connection'.&nbsp; On my device this was unchecked.&nbsp; When I checked it, a drop down choice became selectable.&nbsp; The only choice in the list is USB.&nbsp; When I then attached to my PC, voila Windows Mobile launched and connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for causing confusion on two fronts:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Not sharing immediatley that I had synched to this device previously (what might be an important detail to some was not to me).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My inexperience with WM6 as I did not know such a ActiveSync-&gt;Connections-&gt;'Sync when cradled' option even xisted.</p>

<h2>            Exploit&#58;HTML&#47;IframeRef.gen Problem</h2>
                    I been having an annoying problem with MSE. Everytime I run Internet explorer just today with one website that keeps getting the same virus detection everytime I browse to that website. I never had this problem before, I used this website for some time
 now and I never had this problem occur. All of a sudden I keep getting a virus popup just from getting to the home page of that site;<br />
<br />

This program is dangerous and exploits the computer on which it is run.<strong>

Remove this software immediately.

The problem is everytime I run "remove Virus" It keeps telling me to restart computer. First time I didnt mind, but Everytime I restart and get back to the site it keeps sending me that alert message with that virus and everytime I have to restart. Its getting
 really annoying to do this everytime for that one website. The website is perfectly fine, alot of people use it. I used it with MSE until just yesterday that it spammed this virus message everytime I get on that site.

<p>As you see it is HTML base, this threat might be inside website. From my experiance, I have seen website that have been hacked and the bad guys put Malware inside the website without admin aware of it. It is possible that website try to attack to your system
 or someone compromise their website and put this thing there. In order to know it is Malware or threat or not submit this sample to:
<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx</a><br />
<br />
And chose :<br />
<br />
<strong>This submission is being incorrectly detected as malware<br />
</strong><br />
tick that checkbox, it mean false positive and provide your email and explain that I think it is not Malware but I am not sure and you will know it is real threat&nbsp;or flase alarm.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, try to contact&nbsp;website admin of that website and inform them about the issue that when you visit&nbsp;a link, your Anti-Virus detect Malware.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Teams Class assignment data corruption&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Class assignment data corruption&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is following. I am using Microsoft Teams Class for my Online courses. The known feature is to download Assignment data (grades) to CSV-file. So far I have used that function, but now for some reason the data has corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look through all assignment and in Teams it is visible that Student A has completed several assignments and those are graded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I download CSV-file, but CSV-file is not containing those grades. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two possible explanations</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) There are several teachers in courses and all are allowed to do grading (Thanks for rubric grading). Is it possible that I only see gradings applied by me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There is severe data mishandling and corruption to data system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is severe problem, cause this CSV-file is used as foundation for some PowerApp applications to visualise progress for students. If the file is not what it should be, I have to find something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Riiko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thanks for contact us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Freom your description, I did a test on my side and from the test result, the .CSV file should include all grades include grade that other teacher made, see below picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1018370-6b02-4506-be71-11aaad29d922?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1018370-6b02-4506-be71-11aaad29d922?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6b6cb9-dd51-4fc0-aaf6-091773314e93?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6b6cb9-dd51-4fc0-aaf6-091773314e93?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9702fbba-a0a3-4d3c-b3a4-04dba80f665a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9702fbba-a0a3-4d3c-b3a4-04dba80f665a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to toubleshoot this issue, please make you are in the Assignments tab and then click the Review button, make sure all assignments with grade are been selected, then click "Export to Excel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please go to the Teams web app to export the &gt;CSV file to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, to narrow it, we need to confirm following questions:</p>
<p>1. Do other teachers have also encountered this issue?</p>
<p>2. Can you download all grades before? If so, have you made any changes before this issue happens?</p>
<p>3. A screenshoot of your Teams client version information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<p>Hi, to show data (I just removed student information). On the line where I have stundent This Row, has multiple grades, bot non is visible. Data is similar for all teachers. That was just the first idea i got and luckily it was false. Now the issue is in
 deeper level.</p>

<p>Hi Riiko vesajoona Salonen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed description in this problem. Based on my tests, I can export the points of students assignments. The results is shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f78fe65c-0693-4e9a-b7a1-ffdfe477cf07?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f78fe65c-0693-4e9a-b7a1-ffdfe477cf07?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If you cannot see the points after exporting the data. Iâ€™d like to confirm if you can see the point in the Teams app. See below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc7416be-239e-4569-a13a-6a4c9735717b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc7416be-239e-4569-a13a-6a4c9735717b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If so, I suggest you try to clear the cache of the Teams app and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete the caches, please go to File Explorer and type <strong>
%appdata%\Microsoft\teams</strong>. Then delete the following files. As a side note, you can move the files to another place to avoid the data loss.</p>
<p>a. In <strong>Application Cache</strong> &gt; Cache folder, delete all files in it.</p>
<p>b. In <strong>Blob_storage</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>c. In <strong>Cache</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>d. In <strong>databases</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>e. In <strong>GPUCache</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>f. In <strong>IndexedDB</strong> folder, delete the .db file.</p>
<p>g. In <strong>Local Storage</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>h. In <strong>tmp</strong> folder, delete all files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, please log into <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Teams web</a> version and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>Dear Huni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the way I try to collect grades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I go to assignment...</p>
<p>
</p><p>65</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I collect grades to Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55aaa864-56b9-44f5-8d72-5cafe832b1f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55aaa864-56b9-44f5-8d72-5cafe832b1f8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally the result is something like this</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba41e72-10fd-4bf2-891e-7f665b183a30?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dba41e72-10fd-4bf2-891e-7f665b183a30?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So day by day more and more grades are not transferring to datasheet. I tried to explore thing at it seem that students are dropping out one by one depending how long they have been in the course. They are dropping from the oldest. All the grades are visible
 in grade sheet in individual assignment excel exports.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b570b3-c470-4aae-9469-32f4d2345fae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71b570b3-c470-4aae-9469-32f4d2345fae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the grade is visible</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d32eff80-a056-4cfb-845b-fe02daaf81ae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d32eff80-a056-4cfb-845b-fe02daaf81ae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suspect that in the first whole grade sheet there is some timestamp which makes grades not to transfer. That is just a guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any connector in PowerApps directly to collect data from Teams? Now I have to export data and use that data table to express data in PowerApps. I would appreciate also if there would be some kind of automatic way to transfer
 this grading data to some file or excel (using excel automatic data function) and this would make my life easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>Hi Riiko vesajoona Salonen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed description on this issue. Based on my tests, if we export the data as the steps you mentioned above, we will export all the assignmentsâ€™ data in the assignments list:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e2a5a99-054a-4647-b914-6bade33f1ef1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e2a5a99-054a-4647-b914-6bade33f1ef1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I suggest you try to click one assignment in the assignments list:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4004352d-f737-4a4d-beec-9bd2cede89c6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4004352d-f737-4a4d-beec-9bd2cede89c6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then click Review:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b21434f-d5bf-479a-b770-0952114c386f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b21434f-d5bf-479a-b770-0952114c386f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure that youâ€™ve already graded this assignment and export the single assignment to check the result.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Huni</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and tested. The full data is corrupted and for some reason it show only the first assignment (the newest assignment) for some students. On single review data all is fine but it is useless data because I have to get data from all assignments. Single
 files are useless and not easy to handle when you have almost 50 assignments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this single assignment data possible to connect to PowerApps? That could be one solution to do hard work and connect PowerApp directly to Teams.</p>

<p>Hi Riiko vesajoona Salonen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please provide us some comparison screenshots about the single assignment data and all the assignments data? In addition, Iâ€™d like to confirm if the other teachers in your organization are also experiencing this issue. Does this
 issue occur both in Teams client and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">web app</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, since the current category of the forum focused on Teams issues, if you want to connect Teams assignments data to PowerAPPs, I suggest you post your question in the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=PowerApps&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;searchTerm=power+BI+" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Huni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment it is only one Teams Class course where I am facing this issue. We are in pilot to consider to make the Teams one possible learning platforms and there is currently 7 courses running. There is many issues and day by day it looks that we have
 to delay release until Microsoft is able to solve some issues as apply a decent gradebook, Ipad issues are huge and now if data or data output will be fraudulent this leads to situation that Teams Class is not stable learning environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Teams Class we have had issues with Apple products and I have discussed about it in an other thread. The issue is that Apple product corrupts assignment autocopy system and only solution is to remove corrupted assignment and re assign it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far on my other course there has not been these kind of issues, but I keep my fingers crossed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are data from single assingment and other is full data where is shown issues.</p>
<p>Datas are similar in web apps and desktop apps. </p>
<p>Our licence is </p>
<p><span>Office 365 Education E3 for faculty</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sincerely yours, Riiko Vesajoona Salonen</span></p>

<p>Here are some updates I have seen. The data which is not corrupted is for 21 students who have joined latest. next on row 2 has partly vanished data and older on the line has data vanished totally expect the first assignment in data. Soon on my other course
 will be over 20 students and let see if it happens there too. (This for all assignment data, not single assignment data)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wild guess is that this has something to do with idea having group of 22 students and it is unluckily remained in code after beta testing or something or data collection struggles with large number of assignments. But if new student comes to course the
 oldest on the line gets corrupted.</p>

<h2>            Removing Section Breaks in Word</h2>
                    I have a document that I inherited. It has sections in the document: Section 1, Section 4, Section 6, Section 8, etc. This is the order. There is no Section 2, no Section 3, Section 5, etc.
<p>
</p><p>There are no Section Breaks at all visible when I turn on Show Breaks.&nbsp; I have deleted all page breaks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I link my footer with the previous section, say from section four, it looks for a non-existent Section Three and the page number does not update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My alternatives are to either cut and paste text only and redo all the formatting, or go through and manually reset the pagination for each section. Then, God forbid, if I add another page, all the rest is out of order.</p>

    <title>Word 2016 printing double copy count - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil erickson rcdc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 printing double copy count</h2>
                    <p>This is a strange one I haven't seen or heard of before. One of our users is experiencing Word 2016 printing double the number of copies selected if more than 1 copy is selected. If 1 copy is selected then only 1 copy is printed, but if any other number
 of copies is selected then it will print twice that number of copies. This is only occurring in Word, none of the other MS Office applications or other non-Office applications are doing this and it is doing this for any user logged into this machine (it is
 not user profile specific). The version is MS Office Professional Plus 2016 running on Windows 10 Enterprise Ver 1607 OS Build 14393.447. I've already tried a repair re-installation of Office and when I get back to this I'll even try uninstalling and re-installing
 the printer which I haven't done yet. Any ideas?</p>

<p>this information is NOT helpful - the Samsung is <strong>not </strong>a supported device on the Windows 10 Mobile insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>here is the correct answer to the original question.</p>
<p>First, Microsoft needs to finish the operating system. then, Samsung needs to validate that it works on their devices (patching the software and drivers as needed), and then (if you have a carrier branded phone) they need to validate the update and provide
 Microsoft with&nbsp;their changes needed to generate the release package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... ask Samsung and/or your mobile carrier if they have plans to release W10 Mobile for your phone. Microsoft hasn't got much to do with it at all.</p>

            Hi Jeanette,
<br />
<br />That is how the branching works. If, you have branching on a question then only based on the answer selected, the next question will show up. so, in your case, for 'Yes' you have to branch it to quest 6 and 'No' is already showing quest 7...
<br />
<br />Create a small test form without branching and then add a branch at one middle question, you will see the difference.
<br />

                    <p>Yesterday I renewed my Office 365 Account (I went in store and purchased a new activation code), however now I cannot save any of my documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using MS Word, and I can get as far as Save As - I click on the folder where I want to save the document and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem trying to save email attachments (Word Docs, PDF's - all files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help me? &nbsp;I have run my troubleshooter to no avail.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What sort of subscription did you have to Office 365?&nbsp; Was it just a trial and now you have purchased a subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is not the case, I&nbsp;do not think that it is necessary to purchase a new activation code.&nbsp; Rather, extending the previous subscription

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;My subscription is a one-year Office 365 Home - 5 PC's/Macs + 5 tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It expired on the 28th Jan, and I renewed it on the 29th Jan using one of the suggested methods (re-purchase). &nbsp;I have followed all of the directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether Office is the problem, but it started at this time, and I cannot for the life of me figure out what has happened or where to start. &nbsp;And as always, the problem hit at the least convenient time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions as to what may be the cause? &nbsp;What would be preventing me from saving my documents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>No nothing happens, I go to the usual File - Save As - click on my chosen destination and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if I select "my documents", "dropbox", "desktop" etc..., once I select a destination folder it stops, and nothing happens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even get a chance to give the document a title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if I try and close out of the document a dialogue box appears saying "do you want to save your changes?" &nbsp;If I click Yes, I go through the above steps... &nbsp;I am completely clueless, this has never happened to me before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have not been able to save any type of document (wordpad, word, excel, pdf, photos... anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get as far as Save As, and then nothing happens, usually a browser window / dialogue box would appear for me to select the destination of where to save, and to give the document a name, but none of this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change that happened to my computer was that my Microsoft subscription expired and I renewed it using a new product key. &nbsp;I signed in with my original MS Office Account Username and Password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since uninstalled microsoft office, with the hope of reinstalling and solving the problem, now I cannot reinstall the software, I keep getting an error message 30174-4 something to do with my firewall? &nbsp;I have changed the settings to allow the changes,
 but the installation was really (really) slow, then my computer shut down. &nbsp;I have restarted the computer, and tried to reinstall again, but I got a message saying that it is currently trying to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had so many problems with a computer before, I have only had this P&amp;C for a year and a half, and I have had nothing but problems. &nbsp;I also bought a HP laptop at the same time also running windows 8. &nbsp;It too is having the same problem, and likewise,
 I have had nothing but problems since I bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any recommendations or suggestions please let me know, as now, other than internet I cannot use my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kat</p>

<h2>            Turning off messenger with outlook.com</h2>
                    Messenger starts automatically when I log on at outlook.com.&nbsp; I need to disable this feature permanently.&nbsp; Setting my status to invisible is not acceptable&nbsp; because it also changes my status in windows messenger.&nbsp; Also, it seems as though messenger has
 saved&nbsp;all previous chats that I've had even though I've specifically turned of history.&nbsp; This is a complete violation of privacy and needs to be fixed immediately! &nbsp;There has to be a way to disable&nbsp;both of these "features"&nbsp;and if there is not, this completely
 ruins outlook.com and makes it completely unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            does 20.0.058 solve call quality problems at least? I would rather have a B&amp;W nitemode then have loud noises clicking in my head during a phonecall. I currently have ver 11.<br />

Should I just wait?<br />
I would be happy if bluetooth working as well.

If B/W does not bother you then go for version 20.0.058. In the latest version menu opens quite fast and is relatively bugfree.<br />
<br />
However I found crackling &amp; muffling of our voice when we use N-93 supplied headset.<br />
<br />
By the NSU updator for N-93 works. I re-flashed firmware again yesterday

<p>E71 does not have this defect, but perhaps your phone does. My E71 works as expected. You may have a faulty light sensor. Contact a Nokia Customer Care centre.</p>

    <title>Can I block emails with certain words in the title&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I block emails with certain words in the title&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I apparently have a subscription to a mailing list that's long been dead and is only used by junk mail senders. I get a ridiculous amount from these mailing lists every day. I've tried to get myself off the mailing list, which was through Yahoo, but
 it turns out that it's been so long since I've logged on to Yahoo, that account doesn't even exist anymore. There must be some record somewhere, but I can't access it anymore. I recently tried restoring my account so I could shut it down, and the service person
 who helped me was able to access my old account enough to find my security questions with the correct answers, but when I went to actually log on, it said the account didn't exist...<br />
<br />
Anyways, all of these emails have a certain set of words in the title to let me know that they're from that mailing list, so is there a way I can block any email that contains those sets of words?<br />
<br />
Also, I hope I placed this in the right section. There wasn't any specific section for dealing with spam...<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<h2>            &#34;PowerPoint found a problem with content in...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have students who are submitting PowerPoint files to me to be graded. When I open some of them, I receive the message you see in the screenshot below. When I click on "Repair," I receive another message (see below). I've tried going into Options, Trust
 Center, Trust Center Settings and adding the file as a "Trusted Location," but this doesn't work. Does anyone have any other solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>JCW228</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the error message, I suggest you try the following steps to check the outcome:</p>
<p><span>1)Open PowerPoint and go to
</span><span>Trust Center Settings</span><span>&gt;Protected View&gt;Uncheck the Enable Protected View for ***".</span></p>
<p>2)Right click the PowerPoint &gt;Click presentation&gt;Click General tab&gt;Security&gt;Tick Unblock&gt;Apply and OK.</p>
<p>3)Quit all running desktop application and related reference.</p>
<p>4)Restart PowerPoint
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
with safe mode</a>, then try opening the PowerPoint presentation to see the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the issue persists, please provide the following information to troubleshooting:</p>
<p><span>1)Your Windows version and Office product name and version number refer to
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>What version of Office am I using?</span></a></p>
<p>2)Does the issue only occur on the presentation that your students submitted or all presentations on your PC?</p>
<p>3)May I know how you collect the PowerPoint files from your students to your PC? For example: You collect the files from OneDrive or from USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One way to do that is to "publish" the IndividualID so the query for the report can pick it up:</p>

<p>TempVars("IndividualID") = rs!IndividualID</p>

<h2>            Change default OneDrive attachment authorizations from Modify to read-only</h2>
                    <p>By default, using the new feature of Outlook 2016 to link to a OneDrive file instead of attaching the file in an email gives a modify authorization to the recipients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this default may be useful in some organizations, it is unacceptable in others where by default, attachments should be view/read-only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to change the authorization, but on a case by case, and it's way more complicated than it should be (e.g. it should be a one-click action.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is, this default makes the new feature a pain to use.</p>
<p>And I'm quite sure we'll soon hear of horror stories from people who assumed they granted a read-only access to a document and discover when it is too late that the document was changed, perhaps erroneously, by a recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we need (yesterday)&nbsp;is a new option in Outlook 2016, to choose whether the default authorization for a linked attachment is View only or modify.</p>

<h3> wellsie7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Words are Split in Cells in Table</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a rather large table created by someone else. As I enter text, in some spots the Auto-Fit seems to be working. In others (even though it appears that way when I check the settings) stray letters are being bumped to another line, e.g.
<span>
<span>
<em>Compliance with Order or Regulation</em>&nbsp;</span>comes out as follows:</p>
<p><em>Complian</em></p>
<p><em>ce with</em></p>
<p><em>Order or Regulatio</em></p>
<p><em>n</em></p>
<p>I can't figure out how to fix this? I have never seen this before. Please let me know what other info you need to help with this problem. Thanks!</p>

            <p>The AutoFit to Contents command clears any column and table widths that have been specified in the Table Properties dialog box, and it also selects "Automatically resize to fit contents" in the Table Options dialog box.</p>
<p>In other words, as long as there is room for the table to expand, that is what it should do, as you enter text in the cell(s).</p>
<p>If you try with a different font, does that prevent the word from breaking? In that case, the problem is likely to be font corruption.</p>

<h2>            outlook keeps sending my verification code to the email I am trying to access</h2>
                    I just got a new laptop so I made an outlook email account when starting it up and now i am trying to access that account for the first time and check my inbox but whenever I try to login it asks me to type in a verification code, now my issue is that
 they keep sending the code to the same email address I am trying to login to. How do I get the code to be sent somewhere else? What do I do?&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verifying your account before you can reset the password is one of the security feature of Microsoft account, we suggest following these steps below for a different way to regain access to your account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset your password page</a>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Choose the reason you need your password reset, then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span>Enter the Microsoft account email address you're trying to recover.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span>Enter the characters you see on the screen, then click<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Next</strong><span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>
I<span>f you have security info on your account, we'll send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave us. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.</span> Or if you don't have
 alternative means to receive your verification code, select <strong>I don't have any of these</strong> and click
<strong>Next</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a55eec2-0b54-4705-bf30-239677b5a07d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Enter an alternative email address that we can contact you and click <strong>Next</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Query to get last 1 or 2 digits from field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewdfrost  say:</h3>
<h2>            Query to get last 1 or 2 digits from field</h2>
                    I have some records that are in a linked table in Access 2007 in a field called Unique_Auth_ID. The data is 3 digits followed by a dash followed by 4-6 digits followed by a dash and ending in either 1 or 2 digits. Example: 656-45689-1 I am trying to write
 a query that will return to me all the digits after the second dash. I'm pretty sure this is possible with the built in functions in Access but I don't know much about how to use the text functions. Can anyone tell me how how I can use built in functions to
 return to me all the digits after the second dash? Thanks!<br />

<p>I went to 10130 from 10122 and seemed routine except my internet connection is toast.&nbsp; Keeps saying that my driver may be a problem.&nbsp; Have played around all night and no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also hooked up via the Ethernet cable and it also failed.&nbsp; Right now I am using a companion W8.1 notebook and as a test I am using the Ethenet connection so I know my systems are good.&nbsp; My W8.1&nbsp; fleet seems to be using the same driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is a Qualcomm Atheros 10.0.0.363 dated 8/15/2013, the same driver across my fleet.&nbsp; My nice running HP notebook is dead in the water right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another thread, I reported that I got 3 updates on May 29th before 10130 was offered.&nbsp; These updates seemed to make noticeable changes to my system at first but a shutdown seemed to clear them,&nbsp; I then went to 10130.&nbsp; Not sure how I could even go to Qualcomm
 and look for driver since my only route would be with a W8.1 notebook.</p>
