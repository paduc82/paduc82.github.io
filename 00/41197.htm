<h2>            &#38;gt&#59;&#38;gt&#59;&#38;gt&#59;Xbox LIVE TENURE miscalculation&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi there! </span></p>
<p><span>I am having the tenure issue that many others are facing. I just noticed it today (<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">February&nbsp;5th 2013</span>). I saw the post regarding the issue but my tenure is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">still</span> incorrect. <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
I am <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">supposed</span> to have a 3 year tenure (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">almost 4 years now</span>). But now i have&nbsp;a 2 year tenure which is<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> incorrect</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please resolve the issue ASAP. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S: I deleted and&nbsp;downloaded the profile again and even cleared the cache but to no avail.

<p><span>Tenure is based on the total years of Xbox LIVE Gold time completed. The clock stops when you go Silver/Free and Xbox LIVE Silver time does not add (or subtract) tenure. Tenure increases only when the year of Xbox
 LIVE Gold time ends. For your first year of Xbox LIVE Gold you see '0'; it ticks over to '1' &nbsp;year of tenure when that year completes. If you've had Xbox LIVE Gold for 3 years and 6 months, you'll see a tenure of '3' next to your Gamertag.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There was a bug where Free (Silver) time was counted; that was recently fixed, so many folks now have less tenure than before.</span></p>

<h2>            Printer prints in symbols</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I am trying to print to a Panasonic KX-P1123 dot-matrix printer connected to a Windows XP SP3 computer. &nbsp;The printer is set up as a shared printer among multiple computers. &nbsp;When I try to print anything from that printer from any computer, the printout
 appears as nothing but a jumble of symbols, with no apparent rhyme or reason. &nbsp;This even applies to Windows test pages. &nbsp;The computer the printer is directly connected to has antivirus software (AVG Free 9.0) and had antispyware software (AdAware Free and
 SUPERANTISPYWARE Free), but I've uninstalled the antispware software and rebooted the computer. &nbsp;The problem remains. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</strong></p>

<p>Note, if you don't have a manual for your KX-P1123, get one here: <a href="http://safemanuals.com/314159.php?k=80df3754c2c20dcbba291cb15f7a88ef&amp;ID=202796&amp;q=PANASONIC%20KX-P1123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

You didn't mention how the printer is actually connected to the computer.&nbsp; These ancient printers were intended to connect to a computer's parallel port, a device that is missing from more and more modern computers.&nbsp; If your computer uses a USB-to-parallel
 adapter (or USB-to-parallel cable), then I would suspect that device, or its driver, first.&nbsp; The following discussion assumes that the printer is connected to the parallel port of the computer.&nbsp; You can do the following steps (A-F) in any order.&nbsp;<br />
<p>A.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Assuming that all of your computers are using Windows XP</span> , the simplest issue would be that the print driver on the "print server" (the Windows XP computer to which the printer is physically connected) has
 become corrupt.&nbsp; Clean out the current driver and reinstall the printer on the print server as follows (if some of your computers are not using XP, they will use a different driver, and it seems unlikely that multiple drivers would become corrupt in the same
 way at the same time):</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Printers and Faxes </li><li>Right click on the icon for the KX-P1123 and select Delete </li><li>Click File &gt; Server Properties &gt; Drivers tab </li><li>Select each driver related to the KX-P1123 and click Remove </li><li>Reboot the computer </li><li>Go to Printers and Faxes </li><li>Click "Add a printer" </li><li>Click the radio button for "Local printer attached to this computer" and UNcheck the box to "Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer"</li><li>In the drop-down box for "Use the following port" select LPT1 (again assuming no USB to parallel adapter)</li><li>Select Panasonic KX-P1123 from the list </li><li>Give the printer a name </li><li>Click the radio button for "No" (assuming that you don't want this as the default printer)</li><li>Give it a share name (use the same share name it had before or you'll have to reconfigure all of the other computers)</li><li>Print a test page. </li><li>Finish the Wizard </li></ol>
<p>B.&nbsp; As an initial troubleshooting step, check that the printer prints properly apart from Windows.&nbsp; The printer's Self Test mode is described at page 2-16 of the manual:&nbsp; turn off the printer, then turn it on while pressing the LF (line feed) button.&nbsp; This
 should print all of the ASCII characters in draft mode followed by the 4 LQ (letter quality) fonts.&nbsp; The test will continue in draft mode for 20 minutes or until you turn the power off, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>Assuming that the printer self test prints normal characters, I can think of four possible causes of your problem (other than the USB issue above):</p>
<ol>
<li>there is something wrong with the parallel port on the computer to which the printer is connected (either the hardware or its configuration);</li><li>the parallel port hardware inside the printer has failed; </li><li>there is something wrong with the cable; or </li><li>some configuration change has been made to the printer (I used to have a KX-P1092, which is only slightly older than your 1123; the 1092 was configured using tiny "DIP" switches under the printer's cover -- but the 1123 made things easier to change -- and
 thus easier to mess up -- by using the front panel buttons). </li></ol>
<p>C.&nbsp; If you have another computer with a parallel port, connect the printer to that computer and install it (steps 6-15 above).&nbsp; If it works, then the problem is with the first computer, and most likely the first computer's parallel port.&nbsp; If it doesn't work,
 then the problem is either the cable, the printer's internal hardware; or the printer's configuration.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp; Logically, the next step would be to substitute a known-good cable, but you probably don't have one and don't want to go buy one at this point.</p>
<p>E.&nbsp; Checking the printer's configuration is a bit complicated.&nbsp; I suggest that you carefully read Sections 3.1 and 3.2 (pages 3-1 to 3-11) and especially Section 3.4 (pp 3-18 to 3-24) in the User Guide.&nbsp; You probably should print out the current settings
 as described on page 3-9 and the You may have to interpret the output using the matrix on page 3-3.&nbsp; The printer should be in "program" mode in order to allow your Windows applications to control the font setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that on page 3-20, one possible setting for the "Initial Setup" is to use one of 3 different graphic character sets.&nbsp; If your printer somehow got into this mode, that could be your problem.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; If at this point you still haven't found the problem, do the following (as a substitute for Section 4.4 of the manual -- I highly doubt you have Basic on your Win XP computer):</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a short test file in Notepad and save it in the root directory, e.g., C:\test.txt</li><li>Open a command prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK), type the following, and then press Enter</li><li>copy C:\test.txt &gt; LPT1 </li></ol>
<p>If you still get your all-symbol output, the problem probably is hardware, any you should take the printer to be serviced -- and ask them to check it out on their computer, with their parallel cable, first.</p>

    <title>Installation of XP hangs at 34 minutes to finish - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wagga 1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation of XP hangs at 34 minutes to finish</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am rebuilding a PC which stops installing XP Pro (SP 2 and 3), XP Home (SP1) and Vista at between 33 and 35 minutes to go just as it is installing Devices or I am putting in the product number - but installs Me (2000) fully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has a Ga-8IPE1000Pro2 motherboard with an F10 updated BIOS (the problem didnot change with the update). It is a 2.8GHz, 865PE chipset, 478 Socket Type, with 1Gb of DDR ram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have removed all unnecessary peripherals, exchanged all hardware with known working alternatives including HDD (IDE and SATA), Ram, Graphic Card (AGP8x to PCI), cables, Power supply,&nbsp;cleared the CMOS and&nbsp;flashed the BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC had been used by a gaming enthusiast and I have only replaced the HDD - not sure if it was working when last used by previous owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any BIOS settings that would not have been reset to standard by clearing CMOS or flashing the BIOS and selecting "Optimised Defaults"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Knowledge Base article kb828267 refers to this and I will try to attach the last page of the read out of the "setupapi.log" file after restarting the installation after it had stalled.</p>
<p>Can anyone see if the problem is a faulty motherboard or a software issue from the attached readout?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions are appretiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards Wagga</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, you cannot install Windows on a hdd on one computer then put the hdd in another computer and load Windows. It simply will not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offer for the Windows Xp Home image was for you to use as nothing more than a trial to see if perhaps there was an issue with your disc. Since Vista installs without issue I am wondering if it could be a driver issue. This is further evidenced by the
 fact that the repair install completes.&nbsp; I will do more research and post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for uploading the log file, uploads are not permitted on MS Answers. You would need to use a file host like Mediafire or similar. Please do so in the future if we need to see log files again. This prevents long threads.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 classic scheme doesn&#39;t scale properly with DPI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricky-11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 classic scheme doesn&#39;t scale properly with DPI</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with rescaling my display using the DPI option under "personalize/display".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has a 14 inches screen with native 1920x1080 resolution, way too small to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the scaling seems to work fine with the Windows 7 basic scheme, icons and fonts seems pretty off when scaling the classic scheme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the start button in the taskbar occupies only a fraction of it when switching to 125% dpi option (default value in my installation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some fonts looks also pretty ugly compared to the 100% dpi option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any experience with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc has an Intel HD graphics 520. The installed driver is the latest available from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the pc is brand new so no major changes prior to the issue.</p>

<p>I did check the suggested link already and didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is the Win 7 classic scheme not scaling properly with the DPI higher than 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I've mentioned in my original post, for example, the height of the taskbar is larger than the size of the start button and the rectangle showing the selected window when using the alt+tab command doesn't fit with the icon displayed.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#59; whea_uncorrectable_error</h2>
                    <p>Last night my Lenovo touchscreen started on a reboot loop. I've tried to repair it using the options it gave me (including rebooting the system) but it simply restarts over and over. I cannot access the control panel or other menus before it restarts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time this has happened but usually the loop stops after a few hours. I have the option to mail the computer to get repaired for free, but I'd liketo avoid that since I rely heavily on this desktop for classwork.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips will be much appreciated!</p>

<h3> aryaman_kumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do a clean Windows 10 install without product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an old laptop with a genuine(activated) Windows 10 which runs incredibly slow, somebody suggested me to do a clean install of Windows 10. I know that it means, installing windows again and removing all the personal and pre-installed files and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is, will I be able to do a clean install without buying the product key again? If not, is there something like factory reset which also removes OEM installed software?</p>

            Hi  Aryaman, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a product key, activation will be automatic, and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            Hi Aryaman, 
<br />
<br />You can do a reset, or a clean install. Either way, your machine will use a digital license to reactivate. 
<br />
<br />I’d go with a reset first, and see how your machine is running afterwards. 
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings
<br />
<br />Click on Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery 
<br />
<br />Once in that tab, click on “Get Started” under Reset this PC. 
<br />
<br />This should take a moment, and you’ll be prompted to “Keep my files” or “Remove everything” - The process will start once one is chosen, your pc will reboot and a clean install of windows will start.
<br />
<br />I’d back up your data and make note of your apps first, but then give it a go!
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

<p>See your other replies, and let me add the following:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span>Why do you want to do a clean reinstallation In my view, it's usually a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span>With a modicum of care, it should never be necessary to reinstall Windows (any version). &nbsp;</span>I've
 run Windows 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.11, WFWG 3.11, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and now Windows 10<span>, each for the period of time before the next version came out, and
 each on two or more machines here. I never reinstalled any of them (with a single exception--a problem that I worked on for weeks unsuccessfully), and I have never had anything more than an occasional minor problem.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>It's my belief that this mistaken notion stems from the technical support people at many of the larger OEMs. Their solution to almost any problem they don't quickly know the answer to is "reformat and reinstall." That's the
 perfect solution for them. It gets you off the phone quickly, it almost always works, and it doesn't require them to do any real troubleshooting (a skill that most of them obviously don't possess in any great degree).</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>But it leaves you with all the work and all the problems. You have to restore all your data backups, you have to reinstall all your programs, you have to reinstall all the Windows and application updates, you have to locate
 and install all the needed drivers for your system, you have to recustomize Windows and all your apps to work the way you're comfortable with.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Besides all those things being time-consuming and troublesome, you may have trouble with some of them: do you have or can you find all the drivers you need? can you find all your application CDs? Can you find all the needed
 installation codes? Do you have data backups to restore? Do you even remember all the customizations and tweaks you may have installed to make everything work the way you like? Occasionally there are problems that are so difficult to solve that Windows should
 be reinstalled cleanly. But they are few and far between; reinstallation should not be a substitute for troubleshooting; it should be a last resort, to be done only after all other attempts at troubleshooting by a qualified person have failed.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><span>And perhaps most important: if you reformat and reinstall without finding out what caused your problem, you will very likely repeat the behavior that caused it, and quickly find yourself back in exactly the same situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><span>If you have problems, post the details of them here; it's likely that someone can help you and a reinstallation won't be required.</span></div>

<h2>            unable to access c drive in win 10........please help</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I am completely stuck and don't know what to do. &nbsp;I've recently upgraded to windows 10 and was doing a disk cleanup of c drive to free up some space when suddenly i lose all access to c drive. &nbsp;This means i cannot view it/amend it or anything.
 &nbsp;Everytime i click on the control panel it tells me i do not have the access required which means i cannot do anything. &nbsp;On top of that my nvidia card is conflicting with win 10 and the screen flickers every few seconds which means i can only boot in safe
 mode. &nbsp;I have tried numerous fixes from net searches but nothing. &nbsp;I have now backed up all my files and tried a complete reinstall but even that fails because of no access to c drive. &nbsp;my desktop came with win 8 so i do not have the recovery disks to try
 and install from there. &nbsp;Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
                </div>

            Hi I have tried this several times. &nbsp;I cannot change the permission on c drive. &nbsp;when you click the button it takes a while but then comes up with an error "can't open access control editor. access is denied". &nbsp;I have tried all 3 of your suggestions but
 they don't work. &nbsp;I have even tried to take control in command prompt but still it says access is denied.

            ...this seems to be a fatal flaw in W10 ... it seems once the C: drive becomes denied to the Administrator ( from a permissions view point ) there is no way to recover it as none of the tools work because "duh" permission is denied. You cant click on anything
 ( as administrator ), or use a command line .. apart from this my W10 is working OK ... I can run programs etc ... but not as Administrator, cant do updates, cant install / remove programs, cant set securities, cant manage computer, cant create user accounts,
 cant regedit etc etc etc. I cant even do a reset / reinstall windows from scratch because ..yes insufficient permissions. Only solution seems to be putting the disk in another machine and formatting it .. but since I dont have install media for windows ..
 how to reinstall ?? why should I have to even do this ????

    <title>Surface Pro 3 - Battery Not Detected - Out of Warranty - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Battery Not Detected - Out of Warranty</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a surface Pro 3 that is getting the infamous "battery not detected" error in Windows. &nbsp;I've tried pretty much every troubleshooting technique I can find online - the various restarts, booting to BIOS, updating firmware, windows, etc. &nbsp;I've uninstalled
 the battery in device manager, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly certain it's a hardware issue at this point. &nbsp;Unfortunately my product isn't under warranty any longer. &nbsp;Just to talk to me, Microsoft wants $99. &nbsp;If I pay the $99 to open a support call - will they do anything to help me if it is indeed a hardware
 problem? &nbsp;I don't think they do any repairs to SP3's so I'm assuming they would offer me a refurb, maybe, but at what price??? &nbsp;I looked and I can get a used replacement on eBay for $400ish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very frustrating to invest $1500+ in a product and have it die just outside the factory warranty period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback would be very appreciated.</p>

    <title>Daily tasks slowing computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmacrae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Daily tasks slowing computer</h2>
                    <p>Most of the time, my computer runs fine. But every day around 1 pm, everything slows way down for about an hour, to the point where browser windows are slow to load and microsoft word--which I'm almost always in at that time of day--gets very janky and slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my task manager, I see several dozen Service Host processes running and taking up a lot of memory. The biggest energy suck seems to be Superfetch. Eventually they stop, but during that hour (which is prime work time for me) it's extremely frustrating
 to write a line of text and then have to wait a good five seconds for it to show up on screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Since these tasks show up about the same time every day, I'm assuming they're updating or loading or something on a schedule. How can I see which ones are useless so I can turn them off. At the very least, can I change the time so that this happens in late
 evening when I'm not doing anything important?</p>

    <title>Domination Idea - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick l3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Domination Idea</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I was playing domination yesterday and had, what I thought, was a good idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there are plenty of times when I will be capturing a flag only to get blown up by a grenade just before I capture. &nbsp;I know it happens to everyone else as well. &nbsp;So, what I was thinking is that I would like to get points while capturing the flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, I believe you get 150 pts for a full flag capture. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be nice to get 25 pts when the capture bar is 25% full, 50 for half, and so on until you get the flag and it all adds up to 150?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this would help those solo players with teammates that hate going for the flags (therefore have a hard time capturing it by themselves) and I think it would give people a bigger reason to go for the flag. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? &nbsp;I would love to see this change, being a flag rusher, but I know it won't happen.</p>

<p>@uneasy - you get points for "almost" killing someone don't you? Assist. Isn't this basically the same thing?</p>
<p>Or does he want points even if the flag isn't capped? That's a horrible idea.</p>
<p>Either way, I think it's fine the way it is.</p>
<p>Then again it might entice players to get to the flag earlier, instead of just getting there at the last second to get the whole 150 pts. Get 60 pts for capping the flag and an additional X amount of points for however long you were capping the flag for.</p>

<p>A good idea would be to add contracts that reward you for x amount of captures in a 40 min time period rather than kills... Make it a point and xp reward, and watch as teams play the game the way it should.</p>

<p>There are so many little things that would improve this gametype. &nbsp;I would like "Crazy King" added. &nbsp;Also change the flag locations and spawn points. &nbsp;This game is so stale right now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All maps of Domination are the same.....Spawn, run to grenade launch point,get cheap First Bood, run to Flashbang launch point, get cheap second kill, scan all the known enemy sniper spots and noob tube them to death......etc. &nbsp;I cannot justify new maps
 on a franchise that puts out the same stuff everytime.</p>

<p>You get points for grabs in ctf .......... they dont go on the scoreboard, but you get xp, so yeah ... why not.</p>
<p>I had like 18 grabs one match ......... I couldnt get back to ours but kept dropping a tac insert in a room right next to the enemy flag and nobody caught on. ( I think I did get 2 caps that match) but I got a buttload of xp out of it.</p>
<p>But as someone else posted ......... fj pro / tac mask pro and you shouldnt have to worry so much about almosts.</p>

<p>I'm not so much worried about the points, I'll get them either way. &nbsp;The way I see it, everyone would be entitled to get points equally, so long as they go for the flag. &nbsp;I just hate being in games where I have 7 caps and 4 defends, and everyone else has
 one of each. &nbsp;Just trying to find a way to entice other players to actually try and cap the flags. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Im not to keen on the points for "almost". &nbsp;Evryone on the flag gets the reward for being there when it's capped. &nbsp;A bonus for being first on the flag and then the cap would be cool. &nbsp;A perk that decreases that time necessary to cap would be an interesting
 addition and would get me to play more more HQ and DOM again. &nbsp;Tough modes to play when everyone else is playing TDM.</p>

<h2>            Skype number not receiving calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently set up a US Skype number, it worked fine for about a week and now my friend in the United States can't call me anymore. When I myself call the number it works fine, but when my friend tries to call it only rings once and then cuts off saying "this
 number can't be reached".&nbsp; Even though I have my privacy settings on 'Anyone' and when I ring the number it works fine. Nothing has changed, we have been able to talk on the phone before, but now it doesn't work anymore. Could anyone help me?</p>

    <title>Xbox Elite Controller Fell Apart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller Fell Apart</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, first post here in the forums. I’ve been meaning to address this problem I have with my Elite controller. When I purchased my Xbox One, I went ahead and got the package with the Elite controller. A few months later, one of my rubber grip
 pads began to peel off. Before long, It fell off. Along with this, one of the analog sticks isn’t magnetic at all and has flown off many times during gameplay. The controller has never been thrown, dropped, or abused in any other way. I went to the warranty
 center but am unable to replace the entire controller, only the parts, due to my system being out of warranty. I read a couple of posts online where Xbox was replacing them even out of warranty due to them falling apart. My question is this; has anyone had
 their out of warranty Elite controller replaced because if it falling apart due to normal use? If so, how do I go about getting it replaced? Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Sorry for the long post!&nbsp;</p>

            The same thing happened but I bought the Elite controller day one.I would say next time buy your xbox controller at best buy and get a warranty on it.

    <title>Why did Photo Gallery create a duplicate Pictures folder under Music. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minnesota slim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did Photo Gallery create a duplicate Pictures folder under Music.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an Dell Inspiron 531s with Vista. I imported some photos from my camera, as I have done for years, and the file didn't appear in the photo gallery.&nbsp; I found that a Pictures folder had been created under Music.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I copied the new Pictures folder and pasted it into the original Pictures folder (the one at the same level as Music).&nbsp; Then I made a mistake. Thinking that I didn't want two duplicate folders of pictures, I deleted the folder that was under Music.&nbsp; That
 deleted all of my photos, and they are not in the recycle bin.&nbsp; (At least I backed them up last May.)&nbsp; The photos went away, but the folder didn't.&nbsp; When I import from the camera, the photos go to both Pictures folders.</p>
<p>I am planning on reinstalling Photo Gallery, but is this problem likely to return? What caused it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and internet &#40;WiFi&#41; problem</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 my internet is very slow to load pages.</p>
<p>The home-page comes immediately but then the next pages just take forever or mostly I just get a connection error saying the webpage is not available.</p>
<p>I tried it on my other computers (Laptop) and also from different locations (different routers) and also there I have this problem.</p>
<p>If I make a google search I get the result page but then when I click an item it says on the status bar (tab) the correct network address and Waiting. Then I get the NO Network screen even so I do have the net connected. (switched from WiFi to Ethernet because
 of the WiFi disconnecting problems)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help???</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>A wireless network router has a limited broadcast range. The further the computer is from the router, the weaker the broadcast signal. Solid objects, such as walls, metal furniture, and electrical appliances might interfere

<p>
</p><p><span>For testing purposes, move the computer closer to the router and minimize interference from electrical devices. If testing the connection with the computer near to the router proves that the wireless connection does not disconnect at a significant
 interval, you can move the computer to determine the range of the connection.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Logi Tech Headset stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Logi Tech Headset stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi AM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, was a very happy Windows 8.1 user looking for solution to LogiTech USB Headset that has been working well for one month stops suddenly during a conversation with my wife. &nbsp;MS offers me an upgrade to Windows 10 [I paid for my Windows 8.1]
 so I figured 2 birds with one stone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very worried initially as nothing was working properly but suddenly everything fell into place and WOW people this is looking good. &nbsp;I am not sure what the New Look Explorer Browser is about but it is early days yet. &nbsp;I was grossly disappointed when I read
 that the Windows Icon only works when you right mouse click = the same result as Windows Icon Key + X - anyhow that person is not correct. &nbsp;Hit the Windows button and we have our app windows back [similar to Windows 8.1 - phew I thought we had lost that].</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK with all that out the way, I have deleted all the USB Drivers in Device Manager and rebooted to no avail. &nbsp;I have RMC and shown deactivated devices and restored them and I have RMC and fixed all my old Drivers but my USB Headset "Is not plugged in " but
 it most definitely is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure would appreciate some direction on this one MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>BaliSteve</p>
