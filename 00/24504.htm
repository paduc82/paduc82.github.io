            <p>Hi Retoohs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have difficulties managing your email on your Windows Phone device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Linley is asking is very valid.<br />
From the screenshot you have posted we can see that the issue you're describing occurs when you're using outlook.com web site via your phones Web Browser (Internet Explorer)<br />
<br />
What Linley is suggesting is to configure your phone so allow you to use your email on it, by adding it to your phone's Settings &gt; Email + Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about that please check :</p>

    <title>Outlook alias can&#39;t receive or send email - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook alias can&#39;t receive or send email</h2>
                    <p>I set up a new Outlook.com email alias, but it's not working as I'm unable to send or receive email from it.&nbsp; When I look at my account details (inbox &gt; options &gt; account details) it has my newly created alias listed.&nbsp; However, when I look at "Your email
 accounts" (inbox &gt; options &gt; your email accounts) it says I have no Outlook aliases.&nbsp; If I try and create the same alias again without removing it, I get an error message saying that I already have this alias created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried deleting it and recreating, but still get the same results.&nbsp; Also tried setting up a specific folder to receive email for the alias, as well as deleting that and using my main account inbox - still no luck.</p>

            Thanks for the assist.&nbsp; I've been trying for the past couple of days by creating, removing, re-creating the same email alias - nothing worked.&nbsp; Then, last night I received 7 emails in a row saying that my alias has now been created, each email referring
 to the same alias.&nbsp; Not sure what the delay was and why I suddenly received a flood of confirmations - a 48-hour backlog in the system, maybe?<br />
<br />
Verified that the alias is now able to send &amp; receive, as normal.&nbsp; Everything looks fine, though I haven't tried to create yet another alias to see if the same process happens again.&nbsp; I'll give it a try and post back here - hope this helps others out.<br />

<h2>            OneDrive on public computer - Access even though I logged out</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used a public computer where I've signed into OneDrive and OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after being done I signed out of everything and closed all the notebooks.</p>
<p>I observed that under "Open" -&gt; "Recent" in Onenote it listed all of my notebooks. I tried to click on one of them and it opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I don't think it's a backup of the notebook because when I right-clicked the notebook under "Recent" and copied the file location and pasted it in File Explorer. I went back a few steps and noticed that I was accessing my complete OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file location was something like d.docs.live//xxxxxxx (I think the x's are the CID)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this such that nothing can be accessed after I log out? I've tried everything, including changing my password to Onedrive. The same link still works when I paste it in the file explorer</p>

<h2>            Acticesync 4.5 stops browsing Mogul6800</h2>
                    
<p>I have activesync 4.5 installed on my desptop (windows xp).&nbsp; It works fine and synchs with my Mogul 6800 PPC (wm6) no problem.&nbsp; I can also "explore" the PDA on the intial few connections.&nbsp; For some reason after a few connections, it will no longer explore
 the PDA.&nbsp; When I click "explore" in the activesync screen, it opens an explorer window of C:\ (my desktop) not of the PDA and the PDA is nowhere to be found. but it still synchs fine.</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting both machines, no help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only fix I have found is to re-install activesync.. and it works again for a short time....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help?</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you have a Windows Mobile 5 device, rather than 6.x.&nbsp; (WM5 required the domain field to be filled.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, there's no way to sync a WM5 phone to the m.hotmail.com server, since anything entered into the domain will cause the sync
 to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that device, I'd suggest using Google instead.&nbsp; Create a Gmail address if you don't already have one, and go into your Gmail Calendar at least once on a computer (Unless you do, Google won't have created your Calendar and attempts to sync will fail.)&nbsp;
 Follow the steps above, but Instead of "m.hotmail.com" use "m.google.com," and enter your full Gmail address (with the "@gmail.com") and password as username and password.&nbsp; Enter "google" (without the quotes) as the domain, and select what you want to sync
 (do not select "tasks"- Google doesn't support them, and the sync will fail.)</p>
<p>Now your Contacts and Calendar will be in Gmail/Google Calendar and you can then export them to whatever program or device you want.</p>

<h2>            N97 mini&#58; Can&#39;t change Internet Acess Point &#38;amp&#59; can&#39;t deleate Acess points from Destinations</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to access the wireless internet connection to use the Ovi Store. But instead whenever i enter to it, my phone connect to phone operator's internet access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can i set my phone to use wireless internet whenever it available rather than my phone provider's internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: under settings, Connectivity, Destinations, i had set Priority 1 for wireless and Priority 2 for phone provider's internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>I even tried to change the Web settings by entering to the Access Point on the Internet settings, but it doesn't open me a selection to chose from... the only access is the one that appears selected (My mobile provider's Internet) and another thing is that
 in Destinations I have a 13 Uncategorized Acess points and when I try to delete them, it doesn't let me... can anyone help me please to fix this as I don't have yet a Mobile Internet plan and OVI store only enters through it and If I want to download any application
 I have to do it paying to my Mobile operator for every 1Mb I download ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hope can some one helps me because almost all applications do this by default , while the Skype and Whatsup applications for example don't, they can connect through my Wi-FI without any problems, but any application that needs browsing only connects trough
 Mobile Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks and hope that someone can help me <i>😃</i></p>

<h2>            outlook 2007 assigned tasks being sent as emails with attachments vs tasks to be accepted</h2>
                    I recently got a new computer with Windows 7, and now all the tasks I assign through Outlook 2007 are received as emails with an attachment instead of tasks to be accepted and marked as complete. I've been doing this for the past year and a half on my
 old XP system. Don't know if it is because of windows 7 or an outlook 2007 setting. Any help is appreciated - thanks.

this indicates the TNEF data is getting removed. It could be antivirus scanners, the mail server or outlook is forcing all internet mail to use html or plain text rather than letting outlook decide.</p>

            I am having the same issue, but only when receiving tasks from a user on our exchange server.&nbsp;He can accept/decline tasks I assign him, but I cannot accept/decline tasks he assigns me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am on a different server that does not use exchange.&nbsp;The user's
 initial mail format setting was HTML for both mail format and internet mail format.&nbsp;I changed the user's settings to RTF for both fields, but that didn't resolve the problem.
<div><br />
<div>Following the above instructions did not solve the issue for me. Any other ideas? Thanks for the suggestion.</div>

<h2>            editing the header differently for each page of a document</h2>
                    <p>I have edited an existing document and need to amend the page numbers by editing the header on each page (so that it links correctly to the index).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However every time I edit the header on 1 page it automatically updates every other page, making my index meaningless! How do I override this so I</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can edit the header on every page so something different is displayed ie the index page reference)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I m hoping someone understands this rambling?!! Thank you, Kat</p>

            <p>It sounds as if you're just typing numbers into the header instead of inserting a PAGE field.&nbsp;How you do this will depend on your Word version:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word 2003 and earlier:</strong> On the Header and Footer toolbar, click the button for Insert Page Number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word 2007 and later:</strong> On the Header &amp; Footer Tools | Design tab, in the Header &amp; Footer group, click Page Number, select Current Position, and click on Plain Page Number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any version, you can also insert a PAGE field by pressing Alt+Shift+P. When you insert the page number field, it updates automatically on each page. But Word applies numbers to pages regardless of what page&nbsp;number you have displayed in the header, and
 the numbering should be correct in your TOC and index. If you want to change the way the pages are numbered (for example, if you want to restart numbering after front matter), then you need to use the Format Page Number dialog to set the starting number in
 a given section (you must have a section break to restart numbering). Access this via the Format Page Number button on the Header and Footer toolbar in Word 2003 and earlier, or via Header &amp; Footer | Page Number | Format Pages Numbers in Word 2007 and later.</p>

<h2>            office 365 University - programs freeze when trying to open on Win. 7</h2>
                    I downloaded office 365, and, from all indications, it installed correctly. But when I try to open some of the programs (Excel, Word, etc.), they freeze and become non-responsive. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still have the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does
 anyone have a solution?

            <p>i have the exact same problem. i had to start my&nbsp;PC in safe mode&nbsp;(press ESC when booting) and open the Control&nbsp;Panel and&nbsp;restore my PC to the status it had before my installation of Office 365.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I got fed up trying to have Office 365 installing properly and tried to cancel my subscription. Microsoft technical support called me back and advised me to uninstall my office 2007 before installing Office 365 (why didn't the installation automatically
 detect my installed Office version and advise to un-install?? isn't what most software installation normally do when they have a conflict with previous versions??).
</p>
<p>Anyway, i uninstalled my perfectly good Office 2007 and tried again installing office 365. It says it cannot install because something else is running etc....!!!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave up. i wasted 5 days&nbsp;having all sorts of technical problems and all I wanted is to be a new Outlook/Office 365 customer. &nbsp;I mean seriously Microsoft. The internet is full of threads with people suffering from the same problems and you offer no serious

I think you have the right idea. After finally getting all remnants of Office 365 off of my computer&nbsp;and going through the hassle of returning the download, I realized that it is worth the money to just make the jump to Apple.

<p>Hi Tania,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may follow the steps mentioned below and then try downloading/installing Outlook 2013:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Stop and start or restart
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Service</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> following below mentioned instructions and verify the result:</span></font></p>
<p>(Since you are unable to click
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">
Apply</span></font> option, you may choose manual option from the drop down instead of Automatic, click apply and then switch back to Automatic and then try to start it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Hold
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> key +<span style="font-weight: bold">R</span></font>.</p>
<p>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>services.msc</font></span></p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>2. In the <font>
Microsoft Office Service</span></font>.</p>
<p>3. In the <font>
Startup</span></font> type list.</p>
<p>4. Click <font>
Apply</span>, and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span></font>.</p>
<p>5. Start the software installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help, then remove all traces of Office 2013 installation by running the fixit from the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now download and install Outlook 2013 and then Office Home and Student 2013 by logging into
<a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a> with the registered email address respectively and click Install Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion provided is helpful.</p>

<p>I have the same issue. At first, I thought it had to do with the software, but the C5 doesn't turn on again even after taking out the battery, so it's obviously a matter of hardware. It happens very often and it's very annoying.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to change the prefix of photos taken with the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> visionaryse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to change the prefix of photos taken with the phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here's my situation: We have four Nokia Lumia 520 Windows phones that we use for business. We send the phones with our crews and have them take photos of completed installations, deliveries, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those photos are automatically uploaded to OneDrive, and then later we download the photos for permanent storage on our server. The photos are stored by date (one folder per day).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem we are encountering is that each phone uses the same naming scheme for the photos. Every photo taken today (August 1) has the following filename: WP_20140801_001.jpg (with the last number changing to 002, 003, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we download the photos onto our server, we end up being asked to overwrite the photos we've already put in the directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is it possible to change the prefix on the photos for each phone?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We rename each photo later (to correspond with the appropriate order), but previously we were using digital cameras and this was never an issue. Right now, my best solution is to make sub-directories for each day for each truck we send out. That has it's
 benefits (specifically, knowing exactly which crew completed each job at a glance), but it does add to the time we spend sorting photos each day. It would be really great if we can change the prefix on each phone instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately this is not possible to change on the phone, using the Microsoft camera. Other camera applications may offer this functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the prefix is easily done on multiple photos via explorer - select the photos you want to rename, right click on the first one and select 'rename'. add a prefix to the file name and this will get added on to all of the files selected (as will a
 number in brackets at the end) so you end up with "PREFIX WP_20140801_001 (1), PREFIX WP_20140801_002 (2)" etc. From what you describe, I would have thought a structure of DAY\TEAM\JOB\photos.jpg would be sensible enough, but then I don't know the rest of
 your business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that this is a rather manual process, but I can't see 4 teams, completing a few jobs each day taking more than 10 minutes to rename and file these photos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 'gold plated' solution for you would be to write your own app, that asked for the job details, then captured photos (named by the job details), and uploads them direct to your server file structure.&nbsp;If you can be clear of exactly how you want this to work,
 then many developers should be able to make this for you, for not too much expense - depends on the scale of your company as to the value in this, but it sounds like what you need</p>

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
When you close the Outlook app from your computer, it should also end its process under the Task Manager. In your case, it seems that you're unable to terminate the process of Outlook.exe that's why you're unable to access your emails. We suggest that you run
 your Outlook in safe mode to check if you will be able to access it. If that works, we advise that you disable the add-ins from the Outlook Options. You may also refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2591170/why-does-outlook-not-appear-on-the-desktop-while-its-process-is-runnin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> that relates with your concern.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that works for you.

            <p>Others have reported problems with third-party fonts in 2016. Just to get some background, did you use software to install the fonts, or was the process manual? If manual, did you put them in Your User Folder/Library/Fonts, or in the system Library/Fonts?
 If the fonts are in the public domain, please post their names and I'll try downloading and testing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running the <strong>Font Book</strong> application, selecting all fonts with
<strong>Edit&gt;Select All</strong> and running <strong>File&gt;Validate Fonts</strong>.</p>

    <title>Problems Using VBA within a Coauthored Excel Workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lpankiw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Using VBA within a Coauthored Excel Workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an Excel spreadsheet that is intended to be used for data entry by multiple users simultaneously (ideally utilizing the co-authoring feature). Upon opening the file users are greeted by a "Home" sheet where they select their name from a drop-down
 list and hit a button which unhides their worksheet and takes them to it. On each worksheet there are buttons that allow them to add and delete rows from a table that collects their data. Upon completing their entries, they hit a button that applies a timestamp
 and then rehides their worksheet, returning them to the "Home" sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these buttons have macros assigned to them (using form controls as opposed to ActiveX controls). Macros are used within the workbook to perform the following functions:<br />
- Protect/unprotect workbook<br />
- Protect/unprotect worksheets</p>
<p>- Hide/unhide worksheets</p>
<p>- Add/delete rows<br />
- Select a range</p>
<p>- Write a value to a range</p>
<p>- Copy data from one column of table and paste it into another</p>
<p>- Delete the contents of cells<br />
- Open a UserForm that can add a row to a table and write to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem that I am having is the frequent appearance of a message saying:&nbsp;<br />
"UPLOAD FAILED&nbsp; &nbsp;Your file wasn't uploaded because your changes can't be merged with changes made by someone else."</p>
<p>This message happens essentially any time I hit a button that runs a macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following questions:</p>
<p>- Is there any sort of documentation about what types of VBA statements/actions can or can't be used with co-authoring?</p>
<p>- Is there some way that I can incorporate saving before/after macro execution, or disabling/enabling Auto-Save that will prevent macros from causing this error and still allow the workbook to be co-authored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus Version 1808 (Build 10730.20102 Click-to-Run). The spreadsheet is placed in an Office 365 OneDrive folder. My operating system is Windows 7 Enterprise. The spreadsheet's file extension is .xlsm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is any other information that help solve this query, any help is appreciated!<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Louis</p>

<p>
</p><p>First of all, you are not using the latest version of Office. To get the best feature and safety of your document, please click File&gt;Account&gt;Update option to update your Office to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I need some more time test about this kind of issue. I will update this thread once I get some update. Please also share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. Do do you edit your workbook(Excel client or Excel online)?</p>
<p>2. Screenshot of the error message you encountered.</p>
<p>3. Does this issue happen to all workbooks or only related ones?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Neo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work at a large company so unfortunately I don't have the admin privileges to do manual updates - I will inquire about when I can get the latest version though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your questions:</p>
<p>1. The workbook is only being edited in the Excel client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Here is a screenshot of the error message displayed when a macro is run:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d07f309-2176-4e8f-982b-3689a031497d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d07f309-2176-4e8f-982b-3689a031497d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3. We have tested other co-authored workbooks with very simple macro buttons and they worked fine. The macros in this particular workbook are much more complex however, so it is harder to pinpoint what is causing this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi LPankiw,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps about my test, please have a look:</p>
<p>1. Create a workbook with simple macro and save it as the .xlsm format.</p>
<p>2. Upload it into OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Share it with a user.</p>
<p>4. Use two accounts in two different computers and open that file via Excel client from OneDrive online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also run macro normally. That means the issue you encountered may be&nbsp;related to macros within your workbook. To check which one caused this issue, could you please share with me a copy of your workbook? If you can, to protect your privacy, you can
 share it with me via <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a></strong></span>.</p>

<p>Hi LPankiw,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that some of your Macros are not&nbsp;fully supported in Excel co-authoring yet. That's the reason why you meet the "Upload Failed" error message.

<p>Hi Neo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to tell me which macros are not fully supported? There doesn't seem to be any documentation about what is or is not supported anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi LPankiw,&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right. The article didn't mention which macro is not supported by co-authoring. And it is not feasible to find which macro is not supported by co-authoring. To give you a further support, I will move this thread into Excel Programming category.
 I appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
