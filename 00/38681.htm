    <title>Black screen after Windows 10 login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gotthewindowsblues  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after Windows 10 login</h2>
                    <p>My pc ran a windows update, and after restarting I get a black screen after logging in. &nbsp;Curiously, my Comodo security software still works. &nbsp;It's launcher app is up in the screen corner as usual, and I can use it to open the main app and run a scan and
 otherwise use it as usual, but no other icons or menus appear on the screen. &nbsp;I have the cursor icon and can move it about the screen, but it will not right-click-drop any menus. &nbsp;Also, the screen saver starts up as usual. &nbsp;I can open the task manager using
 ctrl+alt+del, but otherwise the pc is stuck showing a black screen with no functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all my connections, unplugged all peripherals, and updated my graphics card driver, as recommended by MS. &nbsp;None of these steps has solved the problem. &nbsp;Sadly, creation of restore points was not enabled on my pc (I thought it was, but I was
 wrong), so I cannot roll back the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened Windows in safe mode, and this does work. &nbsp;But of course functionality is dramatically reduced and this is not a long term solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read others report that they had the same issue, and that Windows would come on after 5-20 minutes. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that is not happening for me. &nbsp;I have waited over an hour (keeping the screen saver from kicking on, just in case this reset the clock)
 and still only have the black screen. &nbsp;So waiting for Windows to eventually come on is not an option for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I can think of to fix this issue short of completely reinstalling Windows. &nbsp;I hope someone here can help me get things going again without having to resort to that. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues with the graphics driver and a connection problem with your display are some of the reasons why black screen occurs. Since you were able to boot your PC in safe mode, we suggest that you reinstall your graphics card driver while in safe mode. Then,
 restart your PC and check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also possible that your antivirus software might be causing the issue. You mentioned that the black screen occurred after running a Windows update and restarting your PC. Were you able to install the update prior to restarting the PC? It is possible
 that the antivirus software is blocking the update from being installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you have to temporarily disable it to install an update, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for your response!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already installed the latest version of the graphics driver before posting (noted in my original post). Just to confirm, I did this in safe mode (really, it was the only option since regular Windows is not working).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the anti-virus software as a possible problem, as far as I could tell, the update seemed to install normally. When I closed the pc down the night before, I gave me the notification that it was installing the update. When I turned the pc on
 again in the morning, it said it was continuing to install the update, and eventually it finished and I got to my login screen. After logging in, that was where my screen went blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did look into removing the anti-virus as a possible source of the problem, but I cannot figure out how to do this in safe mode. If you have any ideas in this regard, I would be happy to try whatever you suggest. Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Since reinstalling or updating the driver did not resolve the issue, we may try to simply roll it back to the last good configuration while in safe mode. To do that, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your graphics card driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try to install the driver in compatibility mode. You may refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install, and then check the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Thank you, but I'm afraid that neither of the two options worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The roll back driver option was not available (grayed out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there was no Compatibility tab in Properties. &nbsp;The only tabs available in Properties were General, Driver, Details, Events and Resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm still stuck. &nbsp;Any other ideas? &nbsp;I appreciate your taking the time to help!</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. A problem with your user account can also be the reason why your computer is experiencing a black screen. User account can become corrupted because of a lot of things. One of which is when an upgrade took place. The good thing is
 you can always create a new user account and transfer the files from your old user account to the new one. To create a new user account in safe mode, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Search for <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the result and select <strong>Run as an Administrator</strong>.</li><li>
<p>Type the following command to create a new account and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>net user tempuser /add</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replace <strong>tempuser</strong> with the name of the account you want.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type the following command to change the account type to <strong>Administrator
</strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>net localgroup administrators admin /add</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Replace <strong>admin </strong>with the name of the account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart your computer to complete the task.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you restart your computer, sign in with the newly created account to check if the issue persists. If your computer is no longer experiencing a black screen, you need to transfer your data from the old user account to the new one. Then, you may delete
 the corrupted user account.</p>

            Many have reported that&nbsp;<span>Windows Update KB4038788 is to blame for the black screen at startup due to the app readiness tool, when in safe mode you could try uninstalling this update to see if it to blame.<br />
If it is the update then MS have released an update:<br />
</span><span>This update is available as a Critical download from Windows Update. To get the stand-alone package for this update, go to the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4043292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update

<p>I tried your suggestion. &nbsp;For anyone else reading this string, to get to the command prompt you need to open "safe mode with command prompt" (option 6 when going into safe mode choices). &nbsp;You will not find the command prompt (CP) in safe mode with networking,
 which is where most people go so they will have internet access in safe mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that said, this suggestion did not work, so I guess a fault in the user account was not the issue. &nbsp;Once I figured out how to get to the CP, I was able to create the account, but it suffers from the same black screen problem as the original account.
 &nbsp;The Comodo launcher is, once again, the only thing that displays on the screen or works, other than the task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm still stuck! :(</p>

<p>How do I uninstall the update? &nbsp;The Windows Installer Service is not operational in safe mode. &nbsp;I cannot figure out how to find and remove the update manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run the update you provided a link for (Update&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1); font-weight: bold">KB4043292)</span>. &nbsp;It linked to the following two files:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please, any suggestions have to work in safe mode. &nbsp;I suspect this is the most likely culprit, and hope you know of a way of implementing your suggestion in safe mode. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>I bought the WaW Map Pack 3 the other day before all the hacks started to pick up, and it's probably the worst money I've ever spent. The hacks started, and then the game just got um-playable. I find it funny that how on PS3 there's barley any hackers at
 all on WaW, maybe every 1/30 matches will have one. But even then, it seems a helluva lot better than the 360, which seems impossible to find a legit game.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">This is the mentality that got the community in trouble in the first place. People somehow don't think it is their responsibility to file a complaint against the modders/cheaters.
 They think that it is up to MS to find them and take care of them. Well, just like with real life law enforcement officers the XBL PET can not be everywhere all the time. That is why they gave us the tools to report these types of players. If you aren't reporting
 them when you encounter them then you are not a part of the solution but a part of the problem.

 all on WaW, maybe every 1/30 matches will have one. But even then, it seems a helluva lot better than the 360, which seems impossible to find a legit game.

<p>My suggestion is to stop buying call of duty games, when mw3 comes out are they going to stop supporting cod4 and mw2? Probably, so the cycle continues. I report every booster and every hacker my team comes across, there are just too many of them. *** to
 see you in a good honest game.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro - Intel Drivers Auto-Rollback</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro. &nbsp;It works well when the Intel HD Graphics 4000 Version: 9.18.10.3071 [3/19/2013] is installed. &nbsp;It doesn't work well when the Intel HD Graphics 4000 Version 9.17.10.3062 [3/8/2013] is installed. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can install the 9.18 version through these steps:</div>
<div>Computer Management -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Display Adapters -&gt; Intel -&gt; Update Driver -&gt; Browse My Computer -&gt; Let Me Pick. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, the driver is rolled back to the 9.17 version randomly, outside of scheduled maintenance periods, often several times a day. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I force the manually selected driver to stick? &nbsp;</div>

            In Control Panel / Windows Update, first set Auto Update to 'Let me choose', then you need to set the video driver/firmware update that keeps re-occurring, to 'Hide/Ignore'. Not sure which one (name/numbers) it is, but it will show up shortly after you
 rollback the driver once again.

</p><p>Then double click to launch the SURT and it will sit there for a long time while it runs (do not interrupts it) and checks your system for errors and may fix them if it finds any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the SURT is finished navigate to this folder:</p>

    <title>Is netr28ux.sys really the cause of my Windows 10 upgrade failure&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jds101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is netr28ux.sys really the cause of my Windows 10 upgrade failure&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Have attempted mulitple times to upgrade Win 7 pro to Win 10 over several days. The download runs OK and I get circa 98% thru the install process before it crashes. I get the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 could not be installed, error 0xC1900101-0x4000D, installation failed in the Second_boot phase with an error during Migrate_data operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the "blue screen" prior to recovery, the error<br />
<br />
PAGEFAULT IN A NONPAGED AREA, with the file NETR28UX.SYS being highlighted as the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Answer Techs have remotely logged in and checked the PC, deleted anti-virus etc, downloaded the Media Tool and tried again. Still no success. I've repeated this process multiple times myself and with the assistance of different agents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MAT&nbsp;then recommended making a DVD and trying a clean install. This I tried but again met with a problem. Windows 10 appears not to be able to install to a MBR disk and requires GBT. I guess I could reformat the disk to GBT but would then lose my Windows
 key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Microsoft Agent has remotely accessed my PC today and started the upgrade install process yet again using the Media Tool. Another failure at upgrade 98% complete and configuration of settings at 68% .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution that I can see is to format my disk to GPT, load Windows 7 bring it up to the latest patch and then attempt to install Windows 10. But I really don't want to do that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any other ideas on how I can move forward ?</p>
<p>The system is an i7 processor, 16GB RAM and plenty of Disk space</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bug check 0x50 can occur after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM). Another possible cause is the installation of a faulty
 system service or faulty driver code. Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to the file NETR28UX.SYS, I guess it is related to wireless driver. Corrupted or malfunctioning driver might be causing this issue. I suggest you to try uninstall and reinstalling the latest wireless driver from device Manufacturer website to see
 if it makes any difference. You can do that through Control Panel. Right-click on
<strong>Start</strong> button and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>. From there you can able to uninstall the driver. Once you do that, try to initiate the installation again to see if it makes any difference. You can search the drivers using device
 model number.</p>

<p>It was the Linksys WiFi dongle. I uninstalled the hardware, ran a 30ft cable to my router and reran the Windows update.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p>I request you to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</li><li>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video. </p>
<ol>
<li>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video </li><li>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters
<ul>
<li>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable the integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</li><li>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope this helps you. If you have any further query in future, feel free to contact us. We will be happy to help you.</span></span></p>

            <p>I'm having this same issue and I've tried just about every help tip I could find to fix it. Nothing appears to have worked. I have noticed that a lot of the time when it happens I'll have some sort of media playing: music or video either from my own computer
 or streaming and sometimes games. Most of my crashes had occurred while I was browsing WHILE listening to music. The computer freezes for a second or two (music and other noises still playing in the background) and after a moment the display goes black and
 the monitor acts as if the computer is off when it is clearly still on. Music and such will continue to play in the background. Only way to get the display back is to do a full restart so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a clean install of windows 10, I've updated the display driver to the most recent and even downgraded the driver in hopes of fixing it. As far as I can tell all my other drivers are fully updated. Windows 10 on my machine for the most part works
 wonderfully but for this one very aggravating problem. It's a bit of a russian roulette situation when trying to do anything with it since there's a rather large chance of the display driver spontaneously ceasing. So any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
For what its worth, my display adapter is an nvidia geforce 660, no integrated graphics. I've tried nvidia's most recent drivers down to the first driver that had windows 10 support. Issue has persisted.</p>

    <title>how to&#58; view cctv on laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyaveril  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to&#58; view cctv on laptop</h2>
                    I have purchased a DVR CCTV recorder with an integral hard disk (500gb). I want to use my laptop as a monitor. I have connected the DVR to a television and it works fine, however, I optimistically connected the DVR to the Laptop using a VGA cable and expected
 a result. Nothing happened at all. I'm not completely computer illiterate, but having spent quite a few hours trying to stumble on how to get a result, I have failed. Can anyone help please, hopefully with a nice simple answer.
<div>Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Access BIOS settings &#40;System Date&#41; for VM in Hyper-V&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install a trial mode software on a Windows NT 4 (yeah, I know!) VM running under Hyper-V.&nbsp; In order for the software (a point-of-sale demo from the late '90s) to work, the system date must be set to before 12/31/1999.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked all over the Hyper-v settings running on my Surface Pro3 on Win 8.1 and cannot find where to set the virtual machine date. I did google and found some obscure reference to a power shell.&nbsp; Not sure what that is (sounds like a semi-version of Linux
 bash) but couldn't find direct instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>Thank you for answering. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow, I'm somewhat shocked this feature was neglected. I know now why my developers prefer buying VMWare instead of using Hyper-V. We often need to set the date on our application (12/31/xx, for example) to test what happens over a given time frame, especially
 as we develop point-of-sale applications which have time-based rules and we must test these in our VM's.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, well I guess I'll buy VMWare and give another bit of money to EMC instead of using a MS product.</p>

<h3> tptpete  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken links between drives</h2>
                    I have a SSD for my Windows 7 OS and some programs and a mechanical HDD for data and other programs. My HDD died a few days ago and I purchased a new one, installed it, but now my problem is that there are broken links for what used to be on my old drive.
 This is keeping me free re-installing some of the licensed programs and from deleting dead shortcuts. How do I go about running something to remove the broken links so that I can re-install the software? I have a backup without some of the programs that I
 can use to replace data. I have attempted to uninstall any of the programs that were on my old drive so that I start over and that has worked fine, but other links just won't go away and keep me from installing a clean copy. Is there a utility I can run to
 remove the dead links?

<p>Don't ask me what I did but now the computer is working okay.&nbsp; This is my fourth restart where &nbsp;the computer is working fine.&nbsp; I did set the computer into debugging mode.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to happen on either that restart or the restart after that.&nbsp; Maybe
 the next restart or the one after that the computer started working correctly.&nbsp; It start when I tried to play chess titans.&nbsp; I tried to make a move as quickly as possible and the computer took the command.&nbsp; I played two games then tried hearts.&nbsp; That worked
 fine, I went on the Internet with no problem.&nbsp; I could minimize the internet screen and have it pop back up from the bottom toolbar.&nbsp; I opened the control panel with no problem.&nbsp; The serial port still shows an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another symptom of the problem was that when I started the media player, it would flicker too.&nbsp; I put in two different DVDs and tried to play them.&nbsp; One the stick on the menu screen.&nbsp; The other had two movies on it.&nbsp; I could pick eihter movie from the menu
 screen but then the computer would only play the last five to ten minutes of the movie.&nbsp; I have seen tried both DVDs and they are working fine.&nbsp; You can go on the time line and jump the movie forward that way with no problem.&nbsp; I can jump forward and reverse
 in the movie using the chapter forward or back key (fast forward / fast backward).</p>
<p>I&nbsp;recently ihstalled a dynex keyboard with the 19 hotkeys.&nbsp; Could I have had one of the keys stick on?&nbsp; I also was trying to play Birth of the Federation which is an older game that has a tendency to lock up.&nbsp; Could that be the source of the problem.&nbsp; I
 did remove that game early on in my attempts to fix the computer but nothing happened.&nbsp; Do you think I have some type of virus.&nbsp; I have virus scanned alot and nothing comes up.&nbsp; Any ideals on what caused the problem?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I can see the SD cards in the settings menu in the management context, but I cannot find any place where I can open them. They do not show up under devices, are not found by adding a device, and are not found under the computer or this pc menu options. How
 do I get at them? Is there a workaround? It can't be this hard for something so basic, can it?</p>

<h2>            Cannon MP Navigator 2.2 for PIXMA MP 830 won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I just bought a new HP Pavillion laptop running Windows 7 Professional and Norton 360 security software.&nbsp; My previous computer was an HP Pavillion desktop running Windows 7 Home and Norton 360 software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the new computer MP Navigator doesn't even try to scan and immediately says "scan failed".&nbsp; I can, however, scan if I go into Devices and Printers and double click the Cannon printer and then click "Scanner Management".&nbsp; However, that way only allows
 me to save the document in .tif file.&nbsp; MP Navigator allows me to save the document as PDF - if it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else from Cannon works fine on the new computer except the MP Navigator software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything including MP Navigator worked fine on the old computer.&nbsp; The only differences between the two is that this is a laptop instead of a PC&nbsp;and running Windows&nbsp;7
 Professional not Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on the phone with Cannon support for almost an hour going through different "fixes".&nbsp; They finally told me that they believe that it is either an Operating System problem or a problem with Norton.&nbsp; So, I called Norton and they went through all the
 fixes including uninstalling Norton and it still didn't work.&nbsp; I also contacted HP customer service who said that they are unable to assist with Cannon products.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my last resort!&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is any setting in Windows 7 Professional that would cause MP Navigator to not even try to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed MP Navigator from Canon PIXMA&nbsp;MP830 setup CD on a Windows 7 workstation. First error indicates I need a driver. Go out to Canon’s site and download and install the driver. Now the good one… Launch MP Nav to Scan and get scan failed error. Simple
 fix</p>
<p>Identify&nbsp;the twain_32 folder on your system.&nbsp;Example C:\Windows\twain_32.</p>
<p>Find the subfolder for the device that isn’t working.&nbsp;Mine is c:\windows\twain_32\mp830.</p>
<p>Edit your Environment Variables and Add a New System Variable named Path.<br />
(You can add your new Path to&nbsp;an existing Path with a semicolon)</p>
<p>No reboot required.</p>

<h2>            Send To not working</h2>
                    My send to menu (activated by right-clicking a file) is not working now - seems to have changed with latest Windows update to version 1511. All I now get is bluetooth device. I checked the send to folder and all the old choices are there, but they don't
 show up with a right click. How do I fix this?

            <p>I got the solution from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/send-to-menu-context-showing-send-to-bluetooth/a5c7535f-de16-4faf-8aae-7497000bdf95">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/send-to-menu-context-showing-send-to-bluetooth/a5c7535f-de16-4faf-8aae-7497000bdf95</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In short, the solution is:<br />
</p>
Press Windows + r – this brings up the Run dialog<br />
In the open box, enter shell:sendto and press OK<br />
This opens an explorer window where you will see a list of the items that should appear on your Send<br />
To destinations list<br />
If there is a 0 bytes entry second in the list called Bluetooth, delete it. This is a bad ረle that stops the<br />
list from displaying<br />
That’s it! You should have all your Send To destinations back

<h2>            Not receiving promotional emails from &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I don't remember the last time I got an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. It's been quite a few years and it's doing my head in, I've lost count on how many times I have contacted Xbox Chat Live&nbsp;Support and they always tell me the same thing. They
 tell me that&nbsp;they opened up a case file and I should start receiving promotional emails again but I never do.</p>
<p>It's weird because I receive emails from Xbox Live Rewards, Billing info and even other Microsoft products but nothing from Xbox&nbsp;Engage. I really don't want to miss out on new promotions and updates.</p>
<p>I have done everything I can regarding my email, I have gone into contact preferences and have ticked both boxes for Microsoft to contact me, I have made sure my correct email address is listed correctly. I have also made sure the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;email is&nbsp;not on my
 blocked list, I have checked my spam inbox and everything else that I possibly can.&nbsp;As a long time Xbox Live Member this is quite discouraging that a simple issue like this cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me? This has gone on long enough and no one has resolved my problem.</p>

            Hi Susan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Just to isolate the problem, could you check if this also happens in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: iexplore
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try browsing the web site. 
<br />
<br />I would also try clearing your Firefox Cache:
<br />
<br />How to clear the Firefox cache | Firefox Help - Mozilla Support
<br /><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-...</a>
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />ipconfig /flushdns
<br />ipconfig /registerdns
<br />ipconfig /release
<br />ipconfig /renew
<br />NETSH winsock reset catalog
<br />NETSH int ipv4 reset reset.log
<br />NETSH int ipv6 reset reset.log

            OK you have to bear with me b/c I am not that familiar with this computer and Windows 10. Have it for 3 weeks. OK now it just took me 15 minutes and a Youtube video to find Internet Explorer on this computer. But now that I found it I cannot tell if it
 would work on IE b/c it comes to me as an email in my account on firefox/mozilla. So how to I get that email over to IE to check if it will open there? I am not clearing my cache again as I did that a week ago and it did nothing but erase so much of my stuff.
 Thanks.

            Thanks but I have no problem at all loading my centurylink web mail account. It's just that newsletter that I keep sending to you. I don't understand why it won't load. That is all I am having a problem with. Won't load in IE or Firefox and I keep sending
 you the entire message. That is my only problem. What is app.getresponse.com?? That is what is coming up as the address for the newsletter that is blocking it from opening. Are you with me? It keeps saying this but this is not the address of the website!
<strong>Make sure the web address <span>https://app.getresponse.com </span>is correct</strong>. What is that??? It is not Warhistoryonline.com. It keeps changing to the app.getresponse.com. WHY??? That is my problem. Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>Unable to connect<br />

Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at app.getresponse.com.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My son bought me this computer about 3 weeks ago...never had these problems with my HP loaded with Windows 7 and the computer was built for me about 10 years ago. So I don't have a clue what's going on. I am retired and just don't want all these stupid problems
 with this. Which email service do you use that it opened on? Thanks for all your help.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please verify if you're encountering the issue when you're accessing your accoung using Mail client installed on your computer or via Hotmail web browser. In addition, did you made any changes on your account or computer recently?</p>
<p>Lasty, what is the detailed steps you've take that led you to this error condition. Please be informed that we need this information for us to rule out the possible cause of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The problem is on my computer (local).&nbsp; The e-mails are all there when I go to Hotmail web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I did fiddle about recently, trying to export my CONTACTS and most likely clicked on the wrong things in the process.&nbsp; I did this via the EXPORT MAIL menu selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the e-mails are being exported to a dark hole somewhere, but I am fairly hopeless with such things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My temporary work-around is to drag incoming e-mails from the UNREAD folder into a temporary storage folder I created.&nbsp; if I don't do this, the e-mails disappear completely as soon as I go out of the UNREAD VIEW.&nbsp; Ordinarily the e-mails are transfered to
 my Inbox, but this is no longer happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you need specific information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks... Andre</p>

            <p>Upon reflection, one of my other (rarely used) e-mail accounts started playing up quite a few weeks ago, i.e. I stopped receiving e-mails full stop (not even going to the UNREAD FOLDER.&nbsp; I can still send from it though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the three e-mail accounts I have set up on my puter, only the hotmail one downloads correctly.&nbsp; Is this maybe starting to sound like a virus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not had virus protection on my puters for eight years and not had any noticeable problems with viruses.</p>

            <p>All of these replies and no one has mentioned the first thing that you should be checking.</p>
<p>Open WLMail, click on&nbsp;your Inbox folder,&nbsp;View tab, Filter messages, is Show all messages checked?</p>
<p>Each folder has it's own Filter messages setting.</p>
<p>Quick views folders do not contain any messages.&nbsp; Messages from other folders show in the Quick views folders.&nbsp; If your messages are not being moved to another folder, the messages will be in the Inbox.</p>
<p>You do not say that you have looked at the Inbox before looking at Quick views.</p>

            <p>I checked the VIEW / FILTER tab, and SHOW ALL MESSAGES is checked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a message first appears, it shows only in the QUICK VIEW / UNREAD E-MAIL&nbsp;- I know that there is new e-mail because their is a number in partenthesis e.g.&nbsp;(3) that shows the number of unread e-mails.&nbsp; I can then click on&nbsp;UNREAD EMAIL and&nbsp;open the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is when I go to another folder and return that the e-mail is gone, ie gone from QUICK VIEW / UNREAD E-MAIL as it should be, but I cannot find it in the appropriate accounts&nbsp;INBOX (or anywhere else).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, I created a new STORAGE&nbsp;FOLDER to which I drag and drop new e-mail from the QUICK VIEW / UNREAD E-MAIL&nbsp;location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last e-mails that went to the INBOX in the regular way was on&nbsp;27/04.&nbsp; Then suddenly two&nbsp;more e-mails&nbsp;did same on 15/04, but then the problem reverted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get upwards of a dozen e-mails daily.</p>

<p><br />
Make sure that you check the Filter messages setting while viewing each folder.</p>
<p>Do not open Quick views if you have (3) unread messages.<br />
Look through the accounts folders and look the 3 unread messages.<br />
Open a folder with an unread message.&nbsp; Can you see read messages in that folder?</p>

                    So I upgraded to Windows 7 on this PC and added myself as a user on this PC (Mydomain\Me). I am a member of the Domain Admins group.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Windows 7, both Mydomain\Me and Mydomain\Domain Admins are part of the local Administrators groups. However:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) I cannot directly create files (ie. right click &gt; new &gt; text file</div>
<div>2) I cannot modify and save files on the C:\ drive</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong? The same steps worked on another Windows 7 PC in my house.</div>

            Windows 7 won't let you create files in the root of C: (unless you do so under explicitly elevated privileges). However, it lets you create folders in the root of C: and create files in these folders.<br />

<p>This morning, I turned on my computer (Running Windows 7 RC Build 7100). It all loaded fine untill I logged on. I got an error saying
<strong>"This application failed to start because shell32.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."
