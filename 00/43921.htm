<h2>            Printing photos in draft mode &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Epson printer, to which I have always been able to print photos in draft and black &amp; white.&nbsp; Once I have downloaded Windows 10, I no longer have these options. I can only select "standard" and "high" with photo paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print anywhere from 5-50 photos each day (thumbnails), and if I do not use draft with b&amp;w, I will continue to waste (precious) ink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to change this setting?&nbsp; I cannot find it anywhere.</p>

    <title>Activation after boot &#34;Repair&#34; not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t_shred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation after boot &#34;Repair&#34; not working</h2>
                    Working on my friend's computer:<br />
<br />
Replaced PSU, motherboard, CPU, and RAM...hooked up existing HD and DVD.<br />
Would boot only to Welcome screen and then it would auto-restart.<br />
Didn't have his OEM genuine XP disc with me so popped in mine instead.<br />
Booted to disc.<br />
Ran a repair mode.<br />
It installed and asked it for Key so I used mine.<br />
It loaded and I was relieved that his info and files were still intact.<br />
It performed a lot of updates.<br />
<br />
Problem is now the activation window won't come up. The webpage telling me it is not a valid copy does but no activation ability.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
First off...should I have NOT used my copy due to the fact I an running it also on my computer?<br />
Should I get his copy and re- run "Repair" again so that I can put in his Key when promted?<br />
Why is the Activation window not coming up when I go to Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Activate Windows?<br />
<br />
thanks

<blockquote>Hello. If the CD you used for the first repair is not the actual original one then you might run into problems like this with the activation. If you do find the original CD then try doing a repair with that and see if it works, then try activating
 the product.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Otherwise, I would suggest backing up all the data and doing a clean install with the original CD.

Thanks.<br />
No it is not the original CD.<br />
<br />
He was 30 miles away when I tried this last night.<br />
I will get the original CD from him. His product key is on a sticker on his case so that will be easy enough.<br />
<br />
UPDATE:<br />
Ran a little freeware called: XPPID.exe <br />
Got it over at Softpedia.<br />
This allowed me to change the product key code to the correct one.<br />
All is well.<br />

    <title>After use of pnputil &#40;RAPR.exe&#41; to delete &#62;10Gb of old - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxkri  say:</h3>
<h2>            After use of pnputil &#40;RAPR.exe&#41; to delete &#62;10Gb of old nvidia drivers no free disk space appeared &#40;disk capacity reduced&#63;&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Dear support,</p>
<p>I am a Windows 10 1803 user.</p>
<p>I was trying to free some space on my SSD, and one of the largest folders occupying space was&nbsp;<span>C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was using WinDirStat to identify largest folders and noticed that in DriverStore I had &gt;30 folders with approximately same size and content (occupying ~15 Gb). These are folders with old Nvidia drivers, which were
 not cleaned up by the system (they all have kind of "nv*wu.inf_amd64_*" names). I think the reason why they were still there, even though all the files in the folders are very similar, could be that drivers had the same version and the same date! So, cleaning
 up the old drivers didn't help.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to be a well-known issue, but I didn't see if there was any solution.&nbsp;</span><span>Should I write to Nvidia as well?&nbsp;</span><span>(Model is
 Nvidia GeForce GT 650M).</span></p>
<p>Through Device manager I was able to figure out which folder contains the real currently used driver. It was nvamwu.inf_* . After that I used&nbsp;DriverStoreExplorer.v0.9.10 (RAPR) to remove drivers that I thought
 were old and unused. This software is supposed to use pnputil to remove drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After removing ~10 Gb of files I decided to check if I got expected +10 Gb of free space back on disk C. However, the value of available space was the same as before deleting the files. I checked with WinDirStat if those folders in&nbsp;<span>FileRepository</span>
 were deleted or just moved somewhere, but they vanished.</p>
<p>Other people also experienced the same problem with RAPR and with pnputil. Please, check at least this RAPR github thread:&nbsp;https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer/issues/11</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disk is SSD that is partitioned in C (should be 110 Gb), D (111 Gb), Recovery (1 Gb) and RESTORE (20 Gb) (plus other 4 small sections &lt;1 Gb which I have no idea about...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now in My Computer and also in disk management I see that C has only 87 Gb capacity. To be honest, I didn't notice if this change happened right after using RAPR or not, but fact is that after files are deleted I don't get any free disk space.</p>
<p>However, in windows menu Storage (I am not sure if this name is correct, in russian it is called "Память устройства") I see 110 Gb capacity (But still the same amount of free disk space). And 42 Gb are labeled as "system files" (this does not even include
 pagefile.sys and hyberfil.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use recovery options. I followed the advices around the internet and tried to clean up the disk using windows, to reboot, to delete shadow copies, disk check and nothing helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To conclude:</p>
<p>1) What is wrong with Nvidia drivers? Please fix it, they should not have the same date/version.</p>
<p>2) Where did the deleted 10-15 Gb go? Why capacity changed even more? </p>
<p>3) How can I get my disk space back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Now I tried to delete a couple more ~400Mb drivers the same way to see if the numbers will change, but I didn't see any change...&nbsp;</p>

            Hi MaxKri , Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .
<br />

<p>Dear Dave,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply, I tried Treesize and it didn't show anything new from what I got from WinDirStat - files are gone, but TOTAL disk size is less than it should be. (at the moment I don't want to remove anything else, I want to figure out, why my
 disk volume shrinked).</p>
<p>However, there are some differences in numbers. One is that Treesize shows occupied space as ~92 Gb (probably due to difference in allocated memory and filesize? I didn't get how is it possible that in some cases it shows allocated&gt;size and in other cases
 size&gt;allocated).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11524570-9ca4-4c4c-8595-1e56ee78da29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11524570-9ca4-4c4c-8595-1e56ee78da29?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>For comparison, what Windows Storage shows me:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48312b71-2fba-41f9-bc3c-49445b5b287c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48312b71-2fba-41f9-bc3c-49445b5b287c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It is more than 100Gb if you add up the numbers.P.S. Regarding your suggestion: Treesize works faster, but I liked the visualization in WinDirStat more and you can navigate in the table-view by clicking boxes in the tree-view. I don't know now why the numbers
 of files and sizes are different, but they show similar general trend.</p>

<h2>            multiple skype accounts, would like to consolidate</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a gmail&nbsp;email account that has two skype accounts henryxxx and henryxxx_1 then I have a Microsoft&nbsp;hotmail account with one skype account henryxxx_3. I recently signed up for onedrive and I get 60mins free each month on my hotmail&nbsp;login henryxxx_3.
 But I don't use this account. Is it possible to make the henryxxx, with all contact ect, over to the hotmail login.&nbsp;Then close the henryxxx_1 and henryxxx_3 accounts?</p>
<p>Or just come up with a solution to keep using the henryxxx account, get the subscription but without having to fluff around each month to get the credits.</p>

<h2>            Change the bass boost level when Windows 10 has just been updated.</h2>
                    My laptop has just updated to a newer version of Windows 10. Before this, it was easy to change the bass boost when I clicked 'Sound", then "Properties" to change the bass boost level in "Enhancements". Now I do not see "Enhancements". Does anyone know
 how to change the bass boost level now? The sound from my computer when the earphones are plugged in is not as good as that before the update. Thank you so much.&nbsp;

    <title>How do I opt out of Windows Insider Builds&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rednax35  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I opt out of Windows Insider Builds&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yeah so earlier I decided to opt into Windows Insider Builds as they interested me, so once I opted in, it started to install a build</p>
<p>However, when it was installing I got a message saying</p>
<p>"This PC can't be upgraded to Windows 10 (and by that it means it won't install the update, I'm already running Windows 10 Home)</p>
<p>Although you are enrolled in the Windows Insider Program this device isn't eligible for this build."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after that letdown, I went to the settings to opt out, I clicked the stopped receiving updates button, and then restarted my computer.</p>
<p>Only problem, it keeps thinking I'm in the program and keeps trying to install the build even though I clicked "Stop Receiving Updates" and restarted my PC numerous times.</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 virtual keyboard won&#39;t appear automatically</h2>
                    <p>Finally got Windows 8.1 update successfully on my Sony VAIO Duo 13 after updated the BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found that the virtual keyboard won't appear automatically when you trying to type in Modern UI. Everytime I have to access the keyboard from Charm. Does it behave the same on other convertible or MS Surface?</p>

            Thanks Holiday. You are right. When slide down the screen, the virtual keyboard will popup automatically. However, before the update, the virtual keyboard used to popup even then the screen was up. By the way, I also have updated all the windows updates
 and VAIO updates. I wish the touch keyboard appear always like before. Thanks.

            <p>I have the same issue on my tablet since upgrading from windows 8 to windows 8.1. Everything is up to date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way to even login without using a physical keyboard - neither the touch keyboard or on-screen keyboard appear automatically when you touch the text field for the password and you cannot run either of them&nbsp;manually from the login screen. Once
 logged in, the use of a physical keyboard or the manual activation of the touch keyboard or on-screen keyboard for every text field is a really poor work flow for a tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if someone has found a solution to this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

Sorry I have no solution - I only wish to add my complaint to yours. I first posted the issue on here last October, no sensible replies. 



Typically, MS tried the usual "it's your fault, go and update everything and reboot" response. When I told MS that their suggestion hadn't worked, they lost interest. 



Basically, Microsoft don't give a ****. Windows has been going downhill since XP, and I see no signs of improvement. MacWorld beckons.....

            <p>I've had the same problem. For logging in&nbsp;I use the Ease of Access button found at the left of the login screen. Among other options there, you can pull up an onscreen keyboard, for logging in. Once I've logged in the regular touch screen keyboard comes
 up as usual.</p>

            <p>Seems like this problem is all over the place. I just lost my on screen (virtual)keyboard at the same time as an update was installed,although it has been working fine since I installed 8.1 upgrade (about a week). Since then I have rebooted and while I get
 the on screen keyboard for the log-in, I can't access it for any other use eg, Google, Search etc.</p>
<p>as I have retinopathy,and have problems seeing a physical keyboard, the virtual keyboard on a 23" screen has been a god send,</p>
<p>i've tried all the above to no avail. Let's hope Microsoft comes up with a fix pronto.</p>
<p>thank heavens for my ipad</p>

<h2>            Headphone jack issues with pavilion 15 laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP pavilion 15 sleekbook (15b142dx is the model number) and it has an Audio/mic jack on the left side that seems to be malfunctioning. Plugging a pair of Bose headphones into the jack does not make the audio from the laptop speakers mute, so If
 I were to listen to music, I would be getting audio from my headphones and my laptop speakers (not to mention it also sounds very crummy).&nbsp;<br />
is there some repair that I need to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has windows 8 installed. (not 8.1) and I've been using this laptop for over a year.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Sleep Mode Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had my MSI GE72 VR for about 2 years now. The computer and Windows 10 has done everything I've asked with no real issues until recently. The computer starts up fine and runs great but now when i try to wake up the computer from sleep mode I get a multi-colored
 screen which will flash black upon trying to press buttons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then must power down the laptop and restart it and it will run great until i put it into sleep mode again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching for sleep mode fixes but none of them seem to match my specific issue and my "display adapter" drivers are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display adapter may have a new driver depending on the recent updates or changes applied on the computer. It would help us verify the reason why this is happening if you can provide us the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes, recent updates, and newly installed applications on your device that may have affected your computer's performance?<br />
</li><li>To avoid repetition, can you provide us with all the troubleshooting steps that you've done so far?<br />
</li><li>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>to open the <strong>Run </strong>window. Type
<strong>winver </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</li><li>What are the make and model of your graphics cards?</li><li>Can you provide us the driver dates and versions of the graphics cards? To know, type

<p>Dã pra conectar na Live, mas jogar mesmo eu acho que vai ser bem difĩcil, devido a qualidade da conexão 3g que pode variar muito de um local pra outro.</p>
<p>E também você vai precisar de uma ponte entre o modem 3G e o xbox. Pode ser um PC ou um roteador 3g ou mesmo um smart phone.</p>

<p>Eu jogo com claro 3G, mais tem um esquema que você adiquiri a internet, e quando estorar o limite de downloads só cai a taxa de traferencia e nao vem execedente, exemplo adiquire a vivo 3G de 1mb e de 1 GB de download, apos o termino dos 1 gb a taxa de transferencia
 cai pra uns 10 kbs a 20 kbs por segundo, eu jogo normal sem lags, pois o servidor da live é mto bom, só ira travar se você estiver jogando e fazendo algum download no pc, caso contrario oque pode acontecer é só demorar um pouco a conectar na sala de alguns
 jogos, mais quando conecta NÃO TRAVA, e para utilizala basta comprar um cabo de rede, conectar no seu pc e no seu xbox, apos isso compartilhje sua internet e o xbox ira conceguir fazer a conecção via cabo.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Error Code 0xc004f014</h2>
                    After buying a fresh (unused key as well as disk) copy of windows 10 and attempting to use my installation key I'm greeted with the before mentioned error code of 0xc004f014 as well as the activation page stating that they can not activate windows. This
 computer has no prior versions or windows and has not been updated from an older version. I'm wondering if anyone knows how to fix this error. Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about
 safe mode, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Install Windows Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to install all the windows updates including the optional one’s as a lot of fixes are released through the updates. In addition
 to that, a few driver updates are offered in optional updates which help in updating drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>To install the updates, you may follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777982</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install the latest drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<h2>            Please help&#33; Windows 10 just went all hell on me after update&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so long story short, Windows 10 is broken, and I am really frustrated with the desktop support/troubleshooting it has. I had windows 7 and saw the notification for the FREE windows 10 update on the notifications, told it to not do anything so I
 can do it at a more convenient time... it upgraded itself when I turned it on again! Strike 1. THEN I proceed yet without prejudice and used it... Nvidia happened, no driver support, at least working, whatsoever and went around researching. I installed, reinstalled,
 re-reinstalled the new COMPATIBLE drivers from nvidia with windows 10, apparently windows 10 compatible certified, and did not work. Went ahead to try to uninstall the drivers and the software, Geforce Experience, to try again and see if a clean install would
 help... crashes my system, after the loading screen, which the windows logo doesn't even load, it stays in a black lit screen forever doing who-the-hell-knows what. Strike 2. Then I go ahead and go into safe mode trying to fix it, nothing, finally proceeding
 to RESET/Factory Restore the computer, did not work asking to use an installation media instead, so I did. Got the installation media, saw troubleshooting/repairing options so I try them, nothing. Again going to reset the system through the installation media
 as asked, DID NOT WORK. STRIKE 3. Alright what in the name of ... is not working, you are replacing EVERYTHING in the current system with WHATEVER is there thus FACTORY RESET! How can you fail a factory reset unless it's bricked really?! Windows 10, I had
 high hopes but it came out like a broken toy, as if it was never debugged or reviewed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the long prologue/introduction, but here's my issue... what can I do from here? I don't want to format everything and redo everything, mostly because I'm concerned with my serial key not being able to be used again. Not to mention that the
 roll-back feature doesn't work either, same response as the reset.</p>

            <p>This describes my upgrade from windows 8.1. &nbsp;Only I actually had windows 10 up and running for 2 days. I woke up this morning to a rebooted machine (auto update??) and a bad_system_config_info error that started my non-productive day. &nbsp;I have now logged
 in close to 11 hours and cannot get Win 10 up and running (safe mode, restore point or other), nor can I restore back to win 8 or access my files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall win 10 (a few times now) as recommended above using the media creation tool. &nbsp;Upon running that and prompting me for product key that was not suppose to (which I skipped), then accepting license terms and selecting Upgrade option
 (to save my files) &nbsp;I was prompted to remove media before proceeding and reboot... back to square 1 - Win 10 won't load!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that every reboot takes an unbelievable amount of time makes it even more frustrating (most of my day has literally been waiting for windows to load (up to 1/2hr each time!) only to get the same errors. &nbsp;I too had high hopes after the "successful
 upgrade" then bang! &nbsp;What a horrible upgrade experience. &nbsp;It would appear that I have to format my drive to even install windows 8 or 10 now. &nbsp;Any other ideas???</p>

<p>I would not worry about Page Faults - just because it has the word "Fault" in it does not mean there is something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describe your antivirus/antimalware environment.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before making any adjustments create a manual System Restore point so you can undo any adjustments if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only make one adjustment at a time and test so if things suddenly get better you will know which adjustment did the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel, Windows Update, Change settings and set WU to "Never check for updates", save the adjustment, reboot and test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the same issues if you boot into Safe Mode with networking?</p>
<p>Do you have the same issues if you perform a clean Boot?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My standard copy/paste when somebody thinks PFs is/are part of their performance problem (but it's probably not...):<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you see this in Task Manager or Prioess Explorer and you have chosen to display the Page Faults column?<br />
<br />
If that is the case, since the Page Faults column is not usually displayed, if you enabled it, perhaps you are looking for some performance issue.<br />
<br />
A Page Fault does not mean there is a problem.&nbsp; Just because the name has the word "fault" in it does not mean something bad is happening.<br />
<br />
A Page Fault generally means the application needs some data that is not in the physical memory (RAM) at the time.&nbsp; When the application needs some data that is not in the local memory&nbsp;and has to retrieve it from the Paging File on the hard disk that is one
 way you will see a Page Fault generated.<br />
<br />
It sounds sort of bad since it has the word "Fault" in it, but it is really normal.&nbsp; If you invoke your Task Manager after a reboot (don't use any browser), all the applications are likely&nbsp;to have at least some page Faults even though you just rebooted and
 haven't "done" anything yet.<br />
<br />
Some applications might generate a few hundred or few thousand Page Faults on a restart and then not change.&nbsp; The only thing in Task Manager that will have zero Page Faults is the&nbsp;System Idle Process, but that is a special case:<br />
<br />
Knowing what a Page Fault is, you can understand that if your system might not have enough RAM for your operations, then Windows is going to need to go out to the Paging File more&nbsp;often to get the stuff it needs because the stuff it needs might not be in RAM
 when it needs it.&nbsp; Every time it does that, you will have a Page Fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The less RAM you have, the more your applications will have to hit the Paging File to get their data, but you may be able to control some of that, and you may not even "notice" the&nbsp;Page Faults at all - they are happening all the time.<br />
<br />
You might then think that if you turned off your Paging File and ran with no Paging File, you would see zero Page Faults in Task Manager.&nbsp; That sounds good, but that is not the way&nbsp;things work.&nbsp; Windows works best when you have a Paging File set to System Managed
 Size (usually) so you would probably not want to run without a Paging File.<br />
<br />
The reason you would still see Page Faults in Task Manager is because there are hard Page Faults and soft Page Faults, and with no Paging File you would then be seeing only soft Page Faults.<br />
<br />
A hard Page fault would be an access to the Paging File on the hard disk.&nbsp; A soft Page Fault would just be a shuffling or rearranging of things that are in already in memory.&nbsp; &nbsp;Task Manager just lumps them all into the Page Fault column and you can't tell the
 difference between the two.<br />
<br />
Since Task Manager lumps both kinds of page Faults into one column you will need other performance monitoring tools with more granularity (like Perfmon) that allow you to separate&nbsp;Page Faults into so ft Page Faults and hard Page Faults.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you turn off your
 Paging File and use Perfmon to split the Page Faults up into the different types and track them separately, and have no Paging File, you will see zero hard Page Faults, but still see soft Page Faults as a separate counter.</p>
<p><br />
The more your system and those applications run, the more Page Faults will accumulate for that application until the application ends and restarts, then the Page Fault counters starts&nbsp;over again and will keep going up, up, up and up - it does not necessarily
 mean you have a problem and PFs are unlikely to be the cause of your performance issues.<br />
<br />
I don't think you will see them going down but you can start them over by restarting the application.<br />
<br />
For example, your WWW browser might just keep accumulating Page Faults as you browse the Wide Wide World of Web or until you restart it but that does not mean your browser is broken.<br />
<br />
If you are using Firefox or Chrome it doesn't take much browsing for it to generate tens of millions of Page Faults but it is working fine.&nbsp; Close Firefox and restart it and the Page Fault&nbsp;counter will start again from zero (but you will never see it at zero).<br />

            Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I scanned everything with MalwareBytes and found zero threats.&nbsp; I ran&nbsp; sfc /scannow, and it repaired/replaced several files.&nbsp; The HD activity light is still on continuously, so I think the problem is still there.<br />

<p>Plainly, you need to find out why "the HD activity light is still on continuously."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can start by clicking Start, typing Resource Monitor into the Search box, and pressing Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the top section ("Processes with Disk Activity") you can see which processes are using the disk.&nbsp; For more detailed information, check the box(es) of the processes that are using the disk and in the second section ("Disk Activity") you can see what files
 that process is reading or writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Process Explorer or Process Monitor (also from Sysinternals), but both of those powerful utilities require taking some time to learn how to use them.</p>

    <title>Semaphore timeout when accessing network resources over Wi-Fi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tareq hijazi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Semaphore timeout when accessing network resources over Wi-Fi</h2>
                    I have a home network comprising of a Netgear wi-fi router connecting a number of PCs with Cat5. All the PCs are setup with Vista SP1. When I try to access my desktop PC from my notebook PC using Wi-Fi I cannot do so and I get a "Semaphore Timeout" error.
 To get access I need to connect my notebook via Cat5 to the router.<br />
<br />
All other network resources are accessible via wi-fi (Printer, etc.) so I know that the wi-fi network works fine.<br />
<br />
What can I do to troubleshoot this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Tareq.

<h3> mogulman1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety - Block Child from removing themselves</h2>
                    <p>Thought I'd follow up on this, since MS hasn't really been responding in the other threads with anything useful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, when a child signs in, there is a family safety pop-up that comes up in the lower right corner of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they click this, it bring the child to the family safety web-site.&nbsp; At this point, they can easily remove themselves from the
 family and family safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to block this?&nbsp; This is a huge loophole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've switched to a 3rd party family safety product, but might switch back to Windows 10 if MS fixes this.&nbsp; Also, this isn't an issue with me, or my pc.&nbsp; This is an issue with the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a search on "child remove family safety, brings up a bunch of people with the same issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp; I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the child account used to be an adult account. You may remove it from the family and make&nbsp;it a&nbsp;standard user on the laptop. Then re-add it to the family as a child. When you log in as the child, you shall no longer get&nbsp;the option
 to remove yourself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also noticed that the profile birth date cannot be changed. Under "Your Info" tab -&gt; "Edit Personal info" link please ensure that the birth date is configured correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;an Xbox or a Skype account associated with the child account, ensure that it is not given admin privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

<h2>            Kindle for PC App crashed on Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10&#59; now won&#39;t work after download</h2>
                    I have used the Kindle App for PC on my Surface Pro 4 for about a year or so.&nbsp; Yesterday, it just crashed on me and wouldn't re-open.&nbsp; I uninstalled the app, deleted the shortcuts and downloaded the app again from the Amazon website.&nbsp; It downloads, runs
 the installer, shows the Kindle opening insignia and indicates initializing for a spit second then disappears without opening the app.&nbsp; When I look for it, I find the shortcuts but they say the program has moved or changed and suggests deleting them.&nbsp; I've
 removed all kindle apps, exe., and content from the Surface, restarted, then downloaded again from Amazon - same results.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas what's going on here?

            Thank you for those helpful update, Shannow.<br />

It seems that you're successfully launching the app but not syncing it with your account. That being said, are there other apps that has the same account as with your Kindle app? If yes, did the same issue occur on them?<br />
<br />
How about syncing your Kindle app from a different PC or laptop with the same account? Did it sync successfully?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, let's see if doing this from a new administrator account will make a difference. If yes, then your current account might be corrupted.
