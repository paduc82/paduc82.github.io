            Can't find the Format Painter or can't find the Standard Toolbar?<br />
<br />
If the Standard Toolbar is displyed the Format Painter should be near the left end where it has traditionally been grouped with the Cut/Copy/Paste buttons.<br />
<br />
If the Standard Toolbar <span style="font-style: italic">isn't</span> displayed go to View&gt; Toolbars then select it to turn it on. If it still doesn't appear or doesn't remain displayed continuously, click the capsular button at the right end of the Title Bar
 to turn off Apple's 'Minimize Toolbar Area' feature.<br />

<h2>            Moving from Bluehost to microsoft hosted email</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really hoping someone can get me out of this jam I'm in. Our company wants to leave our current email provider bluehost and get microsoft hosted email. I am so confused (and frustrated) at Microsoft's marketing. I have no idea where to even start. we
 don't need any of the office products, we just want email. We don't use outlook application on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>question 1) What plan do we choose to get microsoft hosted email?</p>
<p>question 2) We have our own domain hosted by godaddy, will we be able to get our microsoft hosted email to be @ourdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>question 3) We have 5 email addresses but technically only 1 user, meaning 1 person signs into all 5 emails MOST of the time. I say MOST of the time because from time to time some of the email addresses are delegated to other employees so each email needs
 to have it's own sign on. Through bluehost we were able to create as many email accounts as we wanted each with it's own sign on and didn't have to pay per sign on. Does Microsoft have something like this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>question 4) Can the email migration be done without having to sign into bluehost?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Trunolimit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for choosing Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers:</p>
<p><em>Q: 1) What plan do we choose to get Microsoft hosted email?</em></p>
<p>A: Based on your requirement, it’s recommend that you get a standalone Exchange Online Plan. For details, please check this article:
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/exchange/compare-microsoft-exchange-online-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://products.office.com/en-sg/exchange/compare-microsoft-exchange-online-plans</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Q: 2) We have our own domain hosted by Godaddy, will we be able to get our Microsoft hosted email to be @ourdomain.</em></p>
<p>A: Yes. You can add custom domain to the Office 365 subscription. After that, you can use user@ourdomain as your email address. Check this:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-email-address-to-use-your-custom-domain-f4d8cae9-6d06-4c4b-b4e5-6581fd05ea82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-email-address-to-use-your-custom-domain-f4d8cae9-6d06-4c4b-b4e5-6581fd05ea82</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Q: 3) We have 5 email addresses but technically only 1 user, meaning 1 person signs into all 5 emails MOST of the time. I say MOST of the time because from time to time some of the email addresses are delegated to other employees so each email needs
 to have it's own sign on. Through bluehost we were able to create as many email accounts as we wanted each with it's own sign on and didn't have to pay per sign on. Does Microsoft have something like this?</em></p>
<p>A: In Office 365, if you want to give a user account multiple email addresses, you can
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-another-email-alias-for-a-user-0b0bd900-68b1-4bf5-808b-5d240a7739f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
add email aliases for a user</a>. After the user sign in, he can get emails which sent to multiple email aliases. If you want to give a user access permission to multiple email accounts and manage them, you can check this article and give them delegate permissions:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-9684b670-7588-4eea-8717-9e5799047540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Allow someone else to manage your mail and calendar</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Q: 4) Can the email migration be done without having to sign into bluehost?</em></p>
<p>A: If your previous email provider supports IMAP, a suggested way is to use IMAP migration to migrate email accounts to Office 365. The step 2 of the IMAP migration need you to prepare your IMAP source email system and get the information you need to migrate.
 Here are the detailed steps to do it:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-you-need-to-know-about-migrating-your-IMAP-mailboxes-to-Office-365-3fe19996-29bc-4879-aab9-5a622b2f1481?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-you-need-to-know-about-migrating-your-IMAP-mailboxes-to-Office-365-3fe19996-29bc-4879-aab9-5a622b2f1481?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can use the Outlook client (for Windows) to migrate the emails to Office 365. Here are the steps for your reference:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-Outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Export emails to a PST file</a>.</p>

<p>

<p>Barry</p>

<h2>            Known issue with VBA forms in September feature update &#40;FIXED&#41;</h2>
                    <p><em>Last updated: November 10, 2016</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>On October 4th, 2016, we released an Office 2016 Click-to-Run update that included accessibility improvements to Office Form Controls. Unfortunately, these improvements introduced an issue that&nbsp;affects the way VBA form controls look or work under certain
 conditions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you use VBA to develop custom forms, you may notice that transparent label controls are opaque when they should be transparent, or that Office stops responding when you set the Cycle property for MultiPage controls to 2-fmCycleCurrentForm.</li><li>If you use custom forms as part of your day-to-day work, you may notice that these forms no longer appear or work correctly. For example, buttons or other controls may be misaligned or overlapping in a worksheet, making it hard or impossible to use the
 form. In some cases, your Office app may stop responding when you attempt to open a macro-enabled file containing form controls.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>This issue may affect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 2016 users who have the&nbsp;Click-to-Run version of the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_win10/announcing-september-feature-update-for-office/07985faa-be8e-46a2-bfc6-c8f1a2264a4f">
September feature update</a> installed. Office 365 subscribers will see Version 1609 (Build 7369.xxxx) in File &gt; Account and Office 2016 perpetual customers will see&nbsp;16.0.7369.xxxx.</li><li>Office Insiders on recent Slow builds, including Version 1609 (Build 7369.xxxx) and Version 1610 (Build 7466.xxxx)</li><li>Office Insiders on Fast builds 16.0.7512.1000 or 16.0.7416.1000</li><li>Earlier versions of Office, such as Office 2013, if those versions are installed on the same PC as the offending versions of Office 2016.</li></ul>
<p>This issue does will not affect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who receive updates through Deferred Channel </li><li>Those using volume license editions of Office 2016, such as Microsoft Office Professional Plus, who receive updates through Windows Installer technology (MSI)</li><li>Those who use Office on other platforms, including Office Online </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Status: Fixed </strong></p>
<p>A fix for the VBA form issue is now available in the following builds:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Version 1609 (Build 7369.2054) </li><li>Version 1610 (Build 7466.2038) </li></ul>

    <title>Cannot open hyperlinks in Outlook 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barbaravachon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open hyperlinks in Outlook 2003</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 7, Office 2010 but Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>I recently signed into Peters New Jobs for job email alerts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their instructions had me add a filter on my Yahoo account to ensure that I would receive the alerts.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did that.</p>
<p>As soon as I did that, everytime I clicked a hyperlink in any email it would ask me to LOCATE LINK BROWSER.</p>
<p>I can't remember what I did next but I did confirm IE8 as my browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I go into default programs and look under htm or html, IE is set.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, evertime I click a hyperlink in Outlook it just brings me to my Yahoo web home page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I experimented by creating and opening hyperlinks in Word 2010 and it works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it seems I've got some disconnect between Outlook 2003 and web
 links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is really annoying!</p>

<h2>            data transfer Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I moved the contacts from the iPhone 5 in the Nokia Lumia 950. For this I used&nbsp; „transfer application data“ via bluetooth. After that contact appear when someone calls, but contacts data are not in contact box, so that they can not be used. &nbsp;When the phone
 is via Bluetooth &nbsp;&nbsp;switched on the car device , all the contacts are available and visible on it. So contact information are somewhere in the phone, I can't find where. Does anyone know how to make the contact information visible in Lumia contakts box.</p>

            <p>Hi Ivo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your concern, contacts are saved in People app that is connected and sync with a Microsoft account. To easily transfer contacts without creating them manually, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in with your Microsoft account on the other phone.</li><li>Sync your contacts with your Microsoft account.</li><li>On your Lumia 950, if you haven't signed in your Microsoft account you need to go to
<strong>Apps</strong> <strong>list</strong> &gt; <strong>People</strong> &gt; <strong>More</strong>
<strong>(...</strong><strong>)</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Add</strong>
<strong>an account</strong>.</li><li>Your contacts will automatically sync once you're logged in.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;Microsoft 2016 Word document is shutting down when I am attempting to save the paper.&nbsp;<br />
The document is unable to recover. &nbsp;This happened once and awhile in July. &nbsp;But now is happening with every paper I write I have to take a picture and re-type about 2-3 times per paper. When I am writing 3-5 pages per day this is becoming an&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Heather,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the followings to check if there is any improvement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above can't help, I would like to confirm some information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.What is the file size of your paper? If you create a new document with few pages, can you save it?</p>
<p>2.Your Mac OS version from Apple menu&gt;About this Mac and your Word version from Word menu&gt;About Word.</p>
<p>3.Before attempting to save a document, what actions do you perform in the document?</p>
<p>4.Will it exhibit same behavior if you try to save the document as a different one by click File menu&gt;Save as?</p>
<p>5.After Word shuts down, is there any error message or crash report? Please share some screenshots to help us understand the symptom.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cuong M Tran,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To move a user from Office 365 to Exchange on-premises or vice versa, you need to have an Exchange-based hybrid deployment. So, are all users in your organization hosted in the Exchange Online? If yes, it’s not recommended you migrate Office 365 user
 back to Exchange on-premises because </span>we only support <strong>Full Access</strong> cross-premises mailbox permission, we don't support the use of the Send-As, Receive-As, or Send on behalf of mailbox permissions in hybrid deployments between on-premises
 Exchange and Office 365.<span> After the migration is complete, you can still access the emails from the on-premises Exchange server, not from Office 365.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,<br />
Mouran</span></p>

            Not all users are hosted on Exchange Online. Only the users that we plan on assigning the Office 365 license will be on Exchange. For those users who will not be assigned the Office 365 license, is it okay to migrate them to Exchange online?

    <title>Access Thinks it&#39;s runtime only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access Thinks it&#39;s runtime only</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Access 2016 on Windows 7. When I try open Access I get error 502554, "Can't find the database you specified, or you didn't specify a database at all. Specify a valid database name in the command line, and include a path if necessary."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this is expected if I had the Access runtime only, I know I have the full version (I've used it in the past to create databases). I can't find any information on if there's a fix for this; how do I get the software to think it's the full version again?
 I've tried opening Access from the desktop icon and from C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Office/Office16/msaccess.exe with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil</p>

<p>I agree with Scott.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to the point of reinstalling it, be sure to first uninstall it using Option 2 from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</a>&nbsp;as
 other uninstalls can leave "crap" behind that can still cause issues when you reinstall the software.&nbsp; Options 2 clean ask that out so you new installation should be pristine.</p>

    <title>Work Order Template - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troothteller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Work Order Template</h2>
                    In 2012 I downloaded a Work Order template from the Microsoft site.&nbsp; By hitting Save instead of Save As, I ruined the template and want to download it again.&nbsp; It has green lines and greyish gradient.&nbsp; I am running Word 2010.&nbsp; Is this template available.

            <p>If you have the template still open (a long shot), you could Undo all the changes you made before the Save, then save again. But if it is truly a template (.dotx or .dotm), then you should have been working with a new document based on the template, not
 the template itself. The default action for true templates is to create a new document (<strong>New</strong>) rather than to open the file (<strong>Open</strong> or
<strong>Edit</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, if I use <strong>File | New</strong> in Word 2010 and search Office Online for "work order," I get quite a few results, including one called "Green Gradient design."</p>

            I tried googling "template The following number must appear on all related correspondence, shipping papers, and invoices" and came up with a hit that gave me a work order template that seems to meet your description. It's a .doc file (Open or Save), so
 I can't provide a URL except the <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;ved=0CDsQFjAG&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2F1%2Ff%2F4%2F1f43ef8c-e6a9-4635-acf5-93fb7fe1a339%2FFY06%2520SB%2520SM%2520BV%2520ADDITIONAL%2520RESOURCES%2FOPERATIONS_HR_FINANCE%2FTEMPLATES%2FWorkOrder.dot&amp;ei=fAttVIuwJoSjNqaLhLgO&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtkiazhwwTf1LgZFODXfi-atAR7g&amp;sig2=OJ7t0JhDzeNj2cGRbu_s0Q&amp;bvm=bv.80120444,d.eXY&amp;cad=rjt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google
 link</a></strong>, but here's how the Google link appears:
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eae65632-533c-424c-bc7a-716855d24483" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular template appears poorly designed (width of the text doesn't match margin width), but easy to use, and maybe it's the one you were looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Note that this file is provided as a template (WorkOrder.dot), but if you choose
<strong>Open </strong>(in the Open or Save dialog), you'll get a Word document (Document2 in my case). Instead choose
<strong>Save As</strong> and save the template in your templates folder.</p>

                    every time I try to enter my Hotmail account I must sign in even though I check "keep me signed in".&nbsp; This is annoying.

    <title>Office - Word. Data in table disappearing instead of continuing onto - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahmrussell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office - Word. Data in table disappearing instead of continuing onto next page.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a table with different cells but generally 6 columns and around 7 rows. as I enter information into a column which should automatically continue onto the next page, it sort of disappears. So example, I'm on page one typing in a column and I've
 reached the end of the page, if I keep typing, rather than it continue onto page 2 it just continues into no space. I can retrieve it if I press delete, i'll be able to see it start coming back. I tried merging the whole column, cutting through the rows, so
 the column I was writting in is now one cell, instead of 7. This worked better but its still glitchy. &nbsp;So if I press enter sometimes it will move to the next page, sometimes it doesn't. Doing my head in. Its a big table with lots of data, I can't retain all
 of it to know that its showing everything I've typed instead of hiding it in nothingness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a modification I can make to the table to enable the data to follow onto the next page?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this issue before and I'm pretty sure I end up starting a new table. Surely there's a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Lim, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are probable reasons why you are experiencing the said issue. One of the possible cause can be due to your web browser's incompatibility with Outlook. First, we suggest that you clear your web browser's cache/cookies and you can also try to use a different
 web browser to check if the same issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your update. </p>

<p>I thought it might be helpful to note that your link for account related issues points to a page that requires one to sign in to their Microsoft account. If the account is blocked and the only way get significant assistance is to log in then it's sort of
 a catch-22 isn't it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm guessing that reason that the user is on the forums is because they are trying to find answers to questions because they were being run in circles by the so-called help. My mother-in-law has been experiencing the same issues for a week now. Her
 backup email address is no longer functional and the phone number in her account is a landline not a cell phone so they do not work for security codes. I helped her create a new email address for the purposes of security codes as well as to replace her inaccessible
 msn account. However, when she enters the security code she gets an error saying that the service is down. When she tries to use the help features to initiate email contact she of course is routed to a login page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely frustrating.</p>

            I had already repaired the pst file.
<div><br />
<div>I created a new pst file as suggested but didn't know how to get Outlook to use the new one as default, with an Inbox, Sent Items, etc., so back to square one. However I noticed on the Mailbox Cleanup dialogue box there is a button to tell you the size
 of your pst file. According to this it was 1.99GB or so (whereas the pst is reported as only 1.85GB in Explorer). As 2GB seems to be the limit, this was another indicator that the size of the pst was the problem. So I moved a number of large folders into the
 Archive data file and then compacted the offending personal data file. Problem solved! Items can now be moved between folders once again. The next step is to set up auto archiving so this won't happen again in a year's time when I've forgotten how I resolved

    <title>Vsio 2010 &#38; Network Discovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rimmella  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vsio 2010 &#38; Network Discovery</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Visio 2010 Premium, but am new to it and just learning.&nbsp; My goal is to create a network topology of my environment and was looking for a way to have Visio auto-discovery the devices on my LAN.&nbsp; After some research, I see that auto-discover
 was discontinued back in Visio 2002 (Visio Enterprise Network Tools).&nbsp; </p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone knows if this has been redeveloped in Visio 2010 and if so how I can access it.&nbsp; If it hasn't, does anyone know a free util that will integrate with Visio to allow me to do this.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rob</p>

            <p>By the way, it wasn't free in 2002. It (the Visio Enterprise Network Tools) cost almost as much as the product itself ($500usd).</p>

            <p>It was a pretty big disappointment when it was dropped (network discovery). I'm unaware of any "free" tools in this area. You might check out Solar Winds. They've got a range of products.</p>

    <title>Onenote ate my notebook page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmyii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote ate my notebook page</h2>
                    <p>On Tuesday I created a Onenote page called "Day in Office 2018 02 20"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use four versions of OneNote:</p>
<p>1) The Office 2016 version mostly</p>
<p>2) The "modern" or whatever it's called nowadays version when the Office 2016 version hangs/crashes</p>
<p>3) Occasional notes on my Android phone (though not usually for the same notebook as the "Day in Office 2018 02 20" page</p>
<p>4) The web version via OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>One Tuesday I created this page, and now I can't see it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Modern" app lists a page called "Day in Office 2018 02 20" with a little cloud beside it.&nbsp; When I open it, it says "Loading..." with no animation.</p>
<p>The Office 2016 app list an "Untitled page" at the same place in the list of pages and says "Loading ... Please wait" with no animation when I try to open the page</p>
<p>The web version says "Content not yet available"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really important that OneNote not lose pages.&nbsp; I have all of my graduate school notes in here and the prospect of printing hundreds of pages to PDF just to make sure they don't disappear is a little daunting.&nbsp; I've been a big fan and heavy recommender,
 and that's getting hard to do if my pages disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>

                    How do I move the workbook to another computer to share it?&nbsp; We leave a couple of the other computers on all of the time.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to&nbsp;move it"?&nbsp; We would be moving the workbook from Windows 7 to XP.....also the&nbsp;excel versions are different
 (2003 and 2007)&nbsp; The original workbook was set up on a laptop which isn't always on......the laptop uses excel 2007 and the other&nbsp;computers are on excel 2003.....thanks for the quick response.
