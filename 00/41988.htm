<h2>            KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    I have upgraded my newer win 7 dell laptop to win 10. After upgrade, my system boots up, loads desktop, appears to be loading background apps, then crashes with BSOD K mode exception not handled error. I went into safe mode, disabled driver that seemed
 to have a conflict and rebooted. Crashed again. I cannot get access to my wireless network in safe mode, so I cannot update driver in safe mode. Little help???<br />

            <div>Please confirm you used a 16GB USB stick, formatted it FAT32 and extracted the</div>
<div>recovery zip file contents to the USB stick and followed this process:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in.</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose either Just remove my files or Fully clean the drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The option to clean the drive is more secure but takes much longer. For</div>
<div>example, if you are recycling your Surface, you should clean the drive. If you</div>
<div>are keeping your Surface, you just need to remove your files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>

<h2>            The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection stopped launching</h2>
                    <p>I was able to play yesterday but today when I double click the shortcut nothing happens. I've tried right clicking and selecting open, pressing play in origin, and even opening from the program folder. I have run the compatibility troubleshooter and tried
 every compatibility setting. But still nothing happens. So then I did a system reset to yesterday (since I could play it then) but still it won't run. I don't know what to do.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t change region in DVD player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ð ð¾ð¼ð°ð½51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change region in DVD player</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I've come across a problem playing region-locked DVDs on my laptop ACER ASPIRE. It runs on Windows 7 x64. All updates have been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to encounter the same issue with the DVDs I bought from online stores but at that time the system was operating on an original ISO image of Windows 7 for USA. Well, I just tried using it and then realized that I should use my own that I've had for
 years. That's not the point but after reinstalling to the native package all DVDs
<strong>worked perfect</strong>. It's been a few weeks since I re-installed my Windows. I don't know
<strong>why I can't access ANY region at all</strong>. I am <strong>not allowed to check</strong> any of the countries listed (coloured in gray).
<strong>The region is set to 5</strong>, while earlier (a few years ago when I used my native licensed version of Windows 7 in Russian) everything was all right, that is the region was flagged as "<strong>Not selected</strong>". So, there was no problem with
 that, and I could play any DVD I'd bought a while ago. I even asked a shop assistant at one of the local computer stores to check one of those DVDs I carried to find that it worked fine. The region was set to "Not selected".</p>
<p>Now, I am confused. I don't know what might've happened. I've checked the system and found no major errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My DVD is labelled <strong>Matshita&nbsp;uj892as</strong>. The system says it requires no drivers, and everything looks okay. But why has Media Player Classic as my default player stopped opening my DVDs, then?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Roman</p>

            It might say no software/drivers needed to run the hardware,but it's missing the total picture.Most newer pcs run disk/hardware controller software,Intel would be Matrix storage manager,it does function all storage hardware with the Win 7 OS..Otherwise,youre
 running WHQL drivers from Microsoft only..Look at the driver dates..Also,95% of all DVD/CDrom/RW hardware have firmware updates,get that from its mfg..As far as region goes,after the above listed,look for the post today with "Parental" do the same to remove
 user account parental software,once done,youre Administrative editing should be&nbsp;ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Andrew, thank you for your ideas, but it seems to me that something is blocking my drive. As I noted above, I can't even access the list of countries. It never happened before. Surprisingly, after I re-set the formats in Media Player Classic running as
 admin, another DVD at hand started to play, though a few minutes before it woudn't. Do you suggest that I should remove parental control? Is it possible that Windows updates are responsible for this issue?&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Just now I checked the DVD-ROM in my sister's HP laptop running on Windows 10. It says:
<strong>Not selected</strong>. All countries are available to choose from. Region set to 5. Everything works all right. Well, at least her system plays DVDs I can't except for an error
<strong>0x80030309</strong>. I still have a hard time understanding the cause of error in my system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just an hour ago I downloaded DVD X Player, and it played one of my DVDs. Windows 7 is acting really weird. After installing that player, I was able to copy the disk to my laptop drive, though only one. Other DVDs continue to hang up every time I put them
 in the drive and try playing. What's the matter?</p>

<h2>            Version 8.26.0.70 setting window occludes conversation window</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to have a settings window and the conversation window open at the same time? &nbsp;This used to be an available feature, but appears to have gone away. &nbsp;For various reasons, including the need to mid-call/mid-chat reconfigure the volume just for
 Skype (or make other equipment changes), it can be convenient / much more efficent &amp; user friendly to have both windows concurrently visible. &nbsp; &nbsp;The removal of this ability is unfortunate.</p>

            Unfortunately, that option is not available. 
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />In Skype for Mac, click Help &gt; Report a problem
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

            Hi Maureen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer modelâ€™s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features that need to be returned to Windows Explorer:</span></strong></p>
<p>1) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The option to disable Auto Arrange.</span><br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with.<br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the window/pane the mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that window/pane is not selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong></p>
<p>Since many people seem to agree that some or all the changes made to Windows Explorer have actually made it less user friendly, you can go to the Windows 7 Feedback page and (politely) let them know your suggestions for improving it:<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows Boot Configuration Data file is missing required information-- - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Boot Configuration Data file is missing required information-- Need Windows 7 Install CD</h2>
                    Hello, I'm running an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/N55SF-DH71-15-6-Inch-Versatile-Entertainment-Laptop/dp/B005PAK26C/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325775175&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ASUS N55SF-DH71</a>&nbsp;laptop running Windows 7 Professional. Acronis
 True Image Home 2012 failed and munged my boot drive--which was not even the source or destination of the operation I was performing. Anyway, long story short, after a reboot, I've now got the Windows Boot Manager Error 0x34 Windows Boot Configuration Data
 file is missing required information, like other posters here.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read the related support questions and&nbsp;I found the detailed solution on the Microsoft Support pages -&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2004518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2004518</a>&nbsp;. That looks like a good solution
 and I would love to implement it, but I need the media that I never received. That is the heart of my question here.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The laptop came with Windows 7 Home Premium (no media) and I later bought the "Windows Anytime Upgrade - Windows 7 Home Premium to Professional" license directly from Microsoft (for&nbsp;$96.94 USD on 04/30/12). I did not receive any media with this upgrade,
 either. If the laptop's system restore partition was used, I figure I would likely wind up with a brand new, empty Windows 7 Home Premium installation. That is not acceptable to me.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As far as I'm concerned, my "vendor" at this point is Microsoft, but whether or not anyone agrees with this, I do not know. I have a product key, but I do not know if I can get media to support it or what. What are my options?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I guess I could run out to Best Buy and purchase the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade (for $200) but will that work? Or will the $300 full version? Or will my "anytime upgrade" work with some media download direct from Microsoft? How can I resolve this issue
 in as timely a manner as possible?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Obviously, cost is a concern, but I'd like to know what my options are--what Windows 7 Professional media would even work for me and what the best way to get it would be? I have a separate computer running Windows 7 Professional (from Digital Storm), but...
 it did not come with the installation media. If I were able to build the recovery disc from that computer, would it help me with my laptop? (They are both 64-bit Windows 7 Pro).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Joseph Maddison</div>

<h2>            Windows media player 12 - wmplayer.exe wrong version</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I usually never use WMP to read my media but I recently wanted to try to stream a Bluray to another machine in the homegroup. When tried opening my WMP 12 (Windows 7 Ultimate 64) I got this error message:</p>
<p>The file wmplayer.exe has a version number of 12.0.7600.16385 where 12.07600.76415 was expected</p>
<p>Windows Media player is not installed properly and must be reinstalled</p>
<p>Do you want to install the player from the Microsoft Web Site</p>
<p>I download the file 'Windows6.1-KB968211-x64.msu' from Microsoft to reinstall WMP 12, it says that 'the update is not applicable to your computer'.</p>
<p>I then googled the problem, it seems that there has been quite a few problems with the version, but usually it is with a dll file not the executable. I followed the steps anyway: &nbsp;<span>c:\windows\inf\unregmp2.exe /UpdateWMP it didn't help.</span></p>
<p><span>Nothing is working. Please help, I would really like to stream HD videos from my computer as the other computers in the homegroup (including my HTPC) can't read those files, their CPU can't handle it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<p><span>Hello yannickhk,</span></p>
<p><span>Give a try with the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close all Windows Media
 Player instances.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 cmd.exe as an administrator by selecting Start/All Programs/Accessories.&nbsp; Right click on Command Prompt and choose Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Execute the following
 commands:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>UNREGMP2.EXE /UPDATEWMPVERSION</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Or<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>UNREGMP2.EXE /UPDATEWMP<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Thatâ€™s it, now you can
 re-launch Windows Media Player and you wonâ€™t get error message anymore.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox stereo headset mic doesn&#39;t work in game chat for Rainbow Six Siege&#63;&#63; </h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the stereo headset for my&nbsp;xbox one. Everything works fine, except for game chat. In party chat&nbsp;I can talk and hear other people, but when I play Rainbow Six Siege I cant hear game chat, nor does the mic work. I don't see any settings that would explain this. I tried game chat on other games and it works. But when I play R6S nothing in game chat works. Is this somehow a problem with my mic? Or the game? The mic works fine everywhere else.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I went through all the steps to reset the xbox and test the mic. Everything in party chat works, but I cant hear or talk to anyone in game chat. I checked the Privacy and Online safety setting and communication is set to everyone, so thats not the problem. This is such a strange issue&nbsp;because other games work in game chat, but for some reason Rainbow Six Siege doesn't. Could this be a problem with Ubisoft?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Creating custom websites with MCEWebView plugin for Windows Media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keylonta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating custom websites with MCEWebView plugin for Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I've been using this awesome MCE plugin called MCEWebView.<br />
<br />
http://headsoft.com.au/index.php?category=mce<br />
<br />
It lets you surf websites with your remote control within MCE. By default it has all the Australian catch up TV websites.<br />
<br />
It works great but now I want to add some more websites, like YouTube etc.<br />
<br />
It comes with the readme document below that explains how to create custom websites but I can not understand how to perform one of the steps.<br />
<br />
In step 3. it says to make the following changes:<br />
<br />
<i>- Open Google.mcl and change "iView" to "Google"</i><br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to change "iView" to "Google" because when I open the mcl file, it opens a full screen browser with no input fields or address bar to change it from the iView website to Google or YouTube.<br />
<br />
I havn't been able to get a response from the author of the software.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone on here understands what the step requires, maybe I am interpreting it wrong.<br />
<br />
This is an awesome plugin, it would be great to be able to work out how to create custom websites.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>MCEWebView Installation<br />
=======================<br />
<br />
1. Create a shortcut to iView.mcl, PLUS7.mcl, TEN.mcl, FIXPLAY.mcl and SBS.mcl in:<br />
<br />
* XP<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\Media Center\Media Center Programs<br />
<br />
* Vista / Windows 7<br />
<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Media Center\Media Center Programs<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you get an error "windows cannot create a shortcut here" create it on the desktop then move it to the new location<br />
<br />
<i>2. To create a custom website link (Eg. Google)<br />
<br />
Copy iView.mcl, iView.ini, iView.png and iView.exe and rename them<br />
<br />
- Google.mcl<br />
- Google.ini<br />
- Google.png<br />
- Google.exe<br />
<br />
3. Make the following changes:<br />
<br />
<u>- Open Google.mcl and change "iView" to "Google"</u><br />
- Open Google.ini and set the Url to http://www.google.com<br />
- Edit Google.png in a graphics program to make an appropriate icon<br />
<br />
4. Create a link to Google.mcl as in step 1</i></b><br />

            <p>Hi <strong>Keylonta,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. As you are using a third party software you may try using the favorite search engine to know more about the MceWebView,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so open&nbsp;your favorite search engine and add the string as <strong>"add websites to MCEWebView</strong>&nbsp;" and check if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software

            I've tried searching but there is nothing about how exactly to create custom websites.<br />
<br />
I've been using MCEWebView for a while and have had no problems. It's not a normal program where you go through an installation process, you just basically create shortcuts to some of the files in the MCEWebView folder, and place them in the start menu.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping someone will be able to explain how exactly I &nbsp;<i>- Open Google.mcl and change "iView" to "Google"</i>

            <p>Hi, I'm sorry you got the stupid 'robot response' here.</p>
<p>To edit these files you need to open them in a text editor like Notepad.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is open a blank document in Notepad, and drag the file you want into it.</p>

 hybred sleep is off; 4) hibernate after - 300 minutes and 5) turn off display after 180 minutes.&nbsp; Again all of these setting are for when the computer is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen saver is set to start after 20 minutes of inactivity.</p>

<h2>            External hard drive problems - Can&#39;t assign a drive letter</h2>
                    I am unable to access my Buffalo external hard drive. It is showing in Device MGR &amp; Disc Management. However when I access Computer it is not showing. When in Disc Management it is there but with no drive letter. Right click reveals drop down box but everything
 is Greyed out besides 'Help' and 'Delete Partition'. I have tried the hard drive in 3 different USB ports. I have checked the drivers and they are up to date. When I first plugged the hard drive into my computer it said "Your device is ready to use" but I
 cannot see it in Computer or save any file to it. I am running Windows 7 64-bit. Any help would be much appreciated.

            <p>Hi NeilGnR,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you try connecting the external hard drive on a different computer and check?</p>
<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Since the external hard drive getting detected in device manger and disk management then I would suggest you to assign a drive letter and see if
 that does the trick. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be log on as administrator to perform these steps.</p>
