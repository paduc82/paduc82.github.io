<h2>            Need to GROUP BY after sorting by SENDER. In outlook.live.com Messages</h2>
                    I want to be able to delete all particular messages from a Sender. The fastest way is to Sort the selected (e.g. Unread) messages and Group By Sender (NOT Conversation) -- what should be displayed is a line showing the Group (i.e. Sender) name with how
 many items are in the Group. Then I can delete the Group. (Or not). &nbsp;But GROUP BY does not seem to be an option. I have thousands of unread emails from many many senders. It is not efficient to create a rule for each. &nbsp;Strangely, I seem to recall that Delete
 by Group used to work, back in the day.....

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: </p>
<p>1. Are you using a mail client such as Office Outlook or web browser to access your email account?
</p>
<p>2. When you login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a> through the web browser, do you see
<strong>Outlook.com</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>Outlook Mail </strong>on the upper left corner?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a web browser, then when you login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.live.com/</a> through the web browser. </p>
<p>If you see <strong>Outlook Mail </strong>on the upper left corner, then follow the steps below.
</p>
<p>1. Click on the dropdown menu next to <strong>All</strong> on the right side of "<strong>Inbox</strong>".</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Unread</strong> under <strong>Filter, </strong>then again click on the drop down menu and&nbsp;select
<strong>From</strong> under <strong>Sort By</strong>. Check if the display is how you expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting your response. </p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your instructive reply!</p>
<p>Yes, I do see "Outlook Mail" in upper left.</p>
<p>I went to "Newsletters" folder; followed your instructions and clicked "Unread" and "From".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What came back was a group header with the name of the sender! &nbsp;-- </p>
<p>But not number of items in the group, and no way to delete the group at the Group level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Group name were displayed all the individual messages in that group.</p>
<p>And <strong>wonderful</strong>!--the results were not paginated, so I could see them all by scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So working with those individual messages:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could delete items, even across groups, by clicking the first one and Shift+Clicking the last one and deleting -- as long as there were not too many!</p>
<p>But if there were "too many" -- don't know the threshold number; 100? 200? Then Shift+Click did not do
<em>anything </em>outside of putting a check mark in that box..</p>
<p>The top <em>still </em>showed, "1 Item Selected" even though I could see <em>both
</em>checkmarks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sum: I am no longer concerned about being able to delete at the Group level, as long as the limitation on how many items I can delete at a time is...fixed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the sweep option to delete emails from a particular sender. Follow the steps below and check if it helps. You may&nbsp;first test the setting&nbsp;for a sender who&nbsp;has sent you few emails and see if it fulfills the purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use the filter settings I mentioned above and then select an email by clicking on the checkbox next to the email.
</p>
<p>2. Now, click on <strong>Sweep</strong> and select the relevant option. You may choose
<strong>Delete all messages from Inbox</strong> (The first option out of the remaining four you can see.)
</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Sweep</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <p>No need to apologize for any delay. I suspect these are bugs--pardon me, undocumented features-- and they require thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit a snag getting ready to carry out your latest instructions.</p>
<p>I wanted to be sure that if I did a sweep to delete Unread for Sender "Aruba Tourism", that it would not also delete Read items for that Sender.</p>
<p>So I read the first 2 emails from them (out of 18 total).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they continued to &nbsp;show as UNREAD!</p>
<p>So I read them again. Same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reloaded the page. Redid the selection of Unread and Sender sort; same result! They still showed as Unread!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Inbox, did a search on "Aruba Tourism", and those 2 read emails continued to show as UNread in Search results!</p>
<p>Then I read them from the Search results, and they then showed correctly as "Read".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exit Search, back to Newsletters, Select Unread, Sort Sender, and the 2 Read emails correctly did NOT appear any more.</p>
<p>Clicked "Sweep", Selected "Delete all from Newsletters:" and it really DID delete them all like it said--even the Read ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So</p>
<p>1. Sweep won't help my problem</p>
<p>2. Appears there is a bug if a Read Newsletter continues to appear as "Unread"</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information &nbsp;about my original problem description:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not limited to trying to delete across groups; </p>
<p>Even within a single Sender group, if the number of items exceeds some threshold, Shift+Click does not extend the selection.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 2016 not getting activated</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a brand new Dell laptop along with MS office 2016. i was supplied with a 25 character product key for office.</p>
<p>When i set up my PC and started to use it i came to know that my office installed was only a trial version which is valid for 30 days.</p>
<p>i had been trying to activate office for the past 2 weeks with no luck.</p>
<p>I had contacted both Dell and microsoft on the issue but their support was pathetic. they blame each other and have not resolved my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) select "activate option"</p>
<p>3) I enter Product key, it is accepted and I then get redirected to my Microsoft online account, where it says account not coupled with an office Product. I get option activate now.
</p>
<p>4) I click activate now I get redirected to"thank you for purchasing ..." click "get started" - when I click I get redirected back to my account page with the activate option</p>

            <p><em>Please don't rely on this forum's official Support Engineers as they've never had their hands physically on Office 2016 installation procedures and just copy/paste predefined sets of steps which obviously don't lead anywhere and which
 obviously don't admit that MS has screwed up everything on Click To Run installer and activation process.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>By my experience, know this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you purchased OEM Office 2016 along with new hardware, especially from DELL and try to activate it using your MS Account, you'll most likely run into "<span>The page is taking longer to load than expected." or "</span>The account isn't
 associated with this office product.<span>" and it never adds to your account.</span></p>
<p>I've experienced this with DELL supplies a few times and it's resolved by taking these steps (in case you've bought your Office 2016 from them along with new HW), they're aware of this situation and will help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contact DELL (or your OEM manufacturer) and let them know
<ul>
<li>your HW Service Tag,</li><li>your Office 2016 product key (which is actually not a product key, but redeem code),</li><li>your MS Account ID (in form of login e-mail address)</li></ul>
</li><li>DELL will verify this and will forward your request to Microsoft</li><li>Microsoft will send you an URL with super long hash which leads you to login into your MS Account and will add your MS Office 2016 to it.</li></ol>
<p>Unfortunatelly, at this moment Microsoft refuses to issue activation hash URLs for more products for the same MS Account. They are trying to force users to perform activations in 1:1 scenarios (one product key per one MS Account), although it's
 nonsense: if automatic activations of retail codes run smoothly, your MS account can take many many many products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way: Office 365 must be genuinelly bound in 1:1 scenario to MS Accounts. This means that if you activate Office 365 using your MS Account, you won't be able to activate any other Office 365 product there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something's really gone bad between MS and OEM manufacturers and they're trying to resolve but in the meantime, MS Support Engineers are advising "Use IE 11" to gain some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really disappointed what mess comes with each new generation of MS products. For me, as an IT support, this means just nightmare. And what's more: unpaid nightmare.</p>

<h2>            problem sending and receiving e-mail</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I received a notification on my laptop action box that I needed to fix Microsoft account for app and to do this needed to go to</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account live. com. I tried this and finally all that I did was removed the e-mail access to my I phone(samsung3) and I pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then called Microsoft virtual tech service and they ask me to go to setting, account and e-mail and removed and install</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my e-mail. I removed my e-mail account Then could not get to add my account again.&nbsp;Now by some MAGIC&nbsp;my account&nbsp;shows up on the account&nbsp;and e-mail&nbsp; tap&nbsp;in the setting.&nbsp;However I cannot send or received any e-mail&nbsp;ANYMORE. I had this e-mail address since
 Bill gates was a kid, so would like to keep it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me what to do.&nbsp; !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>alternate e-mail is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your attention</p>

<h2>            Install Office 365 on New Computer</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 365 Business and it is downloaded/installed on one computer. &nbsp;I purchased a second computer. &nbsp; I want to download / install Office 365 Business on this second computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive a message that I must clear the new install with the network administrator because I am not authorized to download / install anything. &nbsp; I am the network administrator. &nbsp;I also clean toilets, pick-up and vacuum the floor, etc. &nbsp;Can anyone tell
 me what I should do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm simultaneously uploading files from the first computer to OneFile so that I can send that computer for service. &nbsp;Is the fact that I'm uploading at the same time that I want to install Office 365 creating problems for me?</p>

    <title>Problems with text overlay over video in PP 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sande woodson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with text overlay over video in PP 2010</h2>
                    <p>One of the main reasons I upgraded to PP2010 is the new ability to insert text box overlays over video backgrounds. I have watched the tutorials and have gone through the steps repeatedly (with inserting bookmarks and then triggers linked to the bookmarks),
 yet when I play the animation it does not show the text at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone else having issues with this?&nbsp; Any ideas of how to troubleshoot the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am quite familiar with PP and use it frequently for presentations, so following the tutorials was very easy for me, but I cannot get this feature to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll&nbsp;be very&nbsp;thankful for any help or suggestions.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help. I finally got it working.&nbsp; When I did the triggers, the text box automatically stayed on "On Click". When I tried changing every setting to see if anything worked, I discovered that if I set the text box animations to "With Previous"
 then it worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In going back and looking at the tutorials I think they're set on "With Previous" in the animation also, but they don't say so. I'm not sure if my program just isn't doing it automatically or if they skipped that step in the tutorials. In ancy case, I got
 it to work like it should once I made that change...</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have excel file uploaded to office 365 sharepoint page and changed its settings as explained here: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-a-shared-workbook-to-collaborate-49b833c0-873b-48d8-8bf2-c1c59a628534?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that several users should be able to edit the document at the same time, however only the first one that opens it can edit, and for the others it shows its locked by the first person.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be the issue here?</p>

    <title>Cannot log into email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huey254  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot log into email</h2>
                    <p>I have not been able to log into my email for over a month on my desktop computer. Everytime I try to log in, it comes up with "Server not found. Firefox can't find the server at snt146.mail.live.com." I have tried using Internet Explorer, but instead it
 comes up with "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage". I have also tried clearing the browser cache and cookies, but still no change.<br />
<br />
I have tried logging into my email via my laptop and it is working fine. So I decided to reinstall Windows on my computer hoping for a solution. However, the problem somehow still persists.<br />
<br />
Please, if anyone has a solution, I will be more than happy to hear it. <br />

</p><p>That is strange indeed. Thank you for sharing the steps you already took to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you are able to log onto your email via Outlook.com on your laptop, it must be that the issue is coming from your desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, are these two computers on the same network (e.g. your home network)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask you to try to clear all cache and cookies again (use the following instructions) and disable browser add-ons?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply Alex. I have just tried clearing all my cookies and cache as well as disabling all of my addons. Unfortunately, the same problem still persists.<br />
<br />
Both computers connect to the same network through the same modem, so I believe the problem is with my desktop computer. My desktop computer is running Windows 7 Professional and my laptop is running Windows XP Home Edition. I have tried updating my desktop
 computer with Windows Update, but it comes up with the error code 8024402F. Could this be related to my current problem?<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Save as PDF&#34; in Word creates a weird second document</h2>
                    <p>Hi All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Word for Mac &nbsp;('11) on my new MacBook with Yosemite. When I save a Word doc using "Save as PDF" I end up with two PDFs -- NOT&nbsp;the problem that I've read about where the same document splits in two. In my case, I get the original document, PLUS
 a weird second doc -- named (NAMEOFDOCUMENT)2 -- that has the original document's stats, such as author name, word count and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like this is a preference or something that I changed somehow, but for the life of me I can't find it. When I Google or search here, I only find references to that other split-in-two bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one is just irritating and unnecessary. I have no need for the other document, but I find myself uploading/attaching it instead of the actual file sometimes before I've had a chance to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA!</p>

</p>

<p>It'd be nice to be able to use my finger to both write text with one note 2010 &nbsp;that is automatically converted to typed text and do freestyle drawings with my finger.&nbsp;

    <title>N82 volume increment too high - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N82 volume increment too high</h2>
                    Hi to all N82 users,<br />
<br />
I find that the volume increment for N82 from 60% to 80% is too high. Is it due to the firmware?<br />
<br />
The volume on 60% is too soft but when increased to 70% or higher, it became too loud instead. This causes discomfort to my ears.

Have tried adjusting other settings like disabling loudness or creating a custom equalizer setting?

            You must have sensitive ears. All I can suggest is experiment with a custom setting.<br />
<br />
After you have edited your sig you need to click the save button at the bottom of the page, not the save button above the sig box.

            Hi Psychomania,<br />
sorry for the late reply. I have noticed that the volume increment when initiated from the mobile device (the up and down buttons on the right side of N82) is different to the increment using the hands-free ear piece that come in bundle with the sales package.<br />
<br />
While each button pressed on mobile device increase the volume by 10%, the increment via hands-free earpiece is 20%! That could be the reason why i am experiencing high volume increment when using the ear piece.<br />
<br />
Any idea how to over come this? Is this an accessory hardware problem? or ti can be corrected via software fix?

            There is no setting that can change that.<br />
<br />
Will it be fixed in future firmware? Your guess is as good as mine. It's a case of wait and see.

<h2>            SmartSource Coupon Printer Problems with Windows 8</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 and I cannot get any coupons to print from Smart Source. I understand that coupons.com has Active X installed and Windows has to be in desktop mode to print from coupons.com. This is not the problem. SmartSource coupons will not print.
 I have uninstalled and reinstalled Java, tried opening in different browsers, everything. I am connected to a network printer but did not have any problems with SmartSource on an older version of Windows. Please help! :) Thanks!

            <p>First off, thank you for your assistance. I have just discovered a few new things.</p>
<p>-The issue only applies to Smartsource.com (Here is an example coupon: <a href="http://coupons2.smartsource.com/smartsource/index.jsp?Link=QOE25WEEMSI22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://coupons2.smartsource.com/smartsource/index.jsp?Link=QOE25WEEMSI22</a>) </p>
<p>-The issue is not a part of the Active X where you have to run Windows 8 in desktop mode - this only applies to coupons.com a different website than I am having problems with</p>
<p>-I do not face any issues with any other normal printing (I can print from different coupon websites, print documents, etc - only printing problem is with this particular website)</p>
<p>-I am running Windows 8 and Internet Explorer and connected to a network printer</p>
<p>-The steps I follow are selecting the coupons, hitting print, then I am brought to a screen that says "your coupons are printing", then I get an error message "Sorry the current default printer is not supported"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -this message also says you have to be connected to a physical print device</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way I can print to this network printer is to be physically connected to it - I have to plug the cord into my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Is there any way around this (to be able to print from the network printer without being physically connected)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I used an older version Windows on another laptop with this same printer and same website and had no issues printing to a network printer (I have a Brother MFC7340)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I tried "Run as administrator" but had no success)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again thank you so much for your assistance, I look forward to learning more from you.</p>

<p>Looks like this is "by design" on both counts.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they do at least say that they might consider some cases that are being excluded by that policy.</p>

<p><font>We do not allow printing to certain types of printers, primarily those that can capture an image of the coupon.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font>Our latest software is more rigorous in defining what printers are allowed and some users that previously were allowed to print are now seeing this error.</font><br />

            <p>I was getting the same issue with my network printer and windows 8 / java / smartsource.&nbsp; If you change the compatibility mode for java.exe to windows 7 everything will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Explorer to :"C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\" or "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\" on a 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>2. Find java.exe right click and select properties</p>
<p>3. Select the compatibility tab and select run this program in compatibility mode for windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close out of IE or your current browser and try again.</p>

    <title>Formatting Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waffel113  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting Issue</h2>
                    Since a recent update, I've been unable to format text with special emphasis (bold, italic, etc.). I've been looking through the settings for anything to fix this (maybe I had turned off formatting), but I couldn't find anything relating to this problem;
 the closest thing I could find for IMs or SMS were notification settings. Is there anything I can do to resolve this?

<p>
</p><p>then i hit enter and type the same exact thing, and now Word recognizes it is spelled wrong.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community. We are sorry about all the inconvenience caused by this issue.</p>
<p>Per my understanding on your issue description, to enable the automatic language proofing, you have to press F7 every time you create a new document?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you check under Review tab &gt; Language &gt; Set Proofing language, has the option<span style="font-weight: bold"> Do not check spelling and grammar</span> been selected?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a real weird issue. To help us further narrow down on this issue, we would like to confirm the following information with you:</p>

<p>not every time i create a new document - just every time i open word. And i usually open and close word every time i open a document - not like i keep word open all the time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the list of active add-ins shown in your screen shot, only Autotask SmartBadge and Nitro Pro are from sources other than Microsoft, so I would start by disabling one of those two (using Method 7 of the troubleshooting article). Then restart Word (not
 in Safe mode) to see whether the spell-checking works. If the problem is still there, re-enable the one add-in and disable the other, then restart again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process should help you to determine which add-in is responsible (if either is). At that point, check the website of the add-in's publisher for an update, or look for information on their support page.</p>

<h2>            SkyDrive Pro Critical Error on opening</h2>
                    <p>
Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I have SkyDrive Pro installed (part of an E3 package) on my laptop and when I try to lunch it (automatically on startup or manually) I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
"SkyDrive Pro needs to close because of a hardware or configuration problem</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Error Description: The file is not a valid GOS database</p>
<p>
HRESULT: 0x80040201</p>
<p>
AssetTag: 0x0013x0d0"</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Windows 7 x64 OS</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I have tried to uninstall &amp; re install the application as well as a few registry edits but nothing changes.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Any ideas? I would prefer not to reinstall Office 2013 as that takes ages!</p>
<p>
<br />

<p>I also suggest you to run the Microsoft Fix it to reset the IE settings to default, to do this, open the following link and run fix it:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></p>

            Thank you for your assistance. To answer your questions.<br />
<br />
a). File size appears not to matter. It can be a small Excel 48kbit or a larger 1meg data file. I will follow your suggestions above.<br />
b) . The problem occurs after windows ask" Open or Save". The next&nbsp;screen asking&nbsp;&nbsp;"save to" never comes up. Instead EI shuts down.<br />

            I have a smilar problem on my developing application:<br />
<br />
1) I click a download button. <br />
2) A popout window opens and begin download a file. <br />
3) There is the usual IE security prompt that says "To help protect your security, IE blocked this site from downloading files to your computer. Click here for options.<br />
4) I click "Download File" on that prompt.<br />
5) No file is downloaded, and a blank page appears on that popout window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The content of the blank page is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br />
6) I have checked with other browsers (firefox, IE6) and the file download can work.
<br />
<br />
Enable "Automatic Prompting for File Download" on "Internet Zone Security Settings" under "Internet Options" will work. But this is not accepted as a company security practice by our security team.
<br />
<br />
I notice the popout window has "<strong>Unknown Zone</strong> " although it is retrieving pages from the same domain name under "Internet Zone".
<br />
<br />

    <title>Unwanted Page Breaks When Inserting Line Numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chou43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted Page Breaks When Inserting Line Numbers</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to use only continuous section breaks as I insert line numbers to a portion of text, however Word introduces page breaks. &nbsp;This process was *not* rectified by following the protocol detailed in a related post (John Korchok's reply to A Zemel
 from Jan. 2017 - it was not rectified for A Zemel, either). &nbsp;I am posting screen shots of the steps I took. &nbsp;Many thanks in advance for your replies. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, I type five lines of test text.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83816349-e728-4a3f-a546-cb640075e9b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83816349-e728-4a3f-a546-cb640075e9b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, at Line B, I insert a Continuous Section Break</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87360e0e-2145-4e0d-9f0c-6f2cfe21ee88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87360e0e-2145-4e0d-9f0c-6f2cfe21ee88" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the result (so far so good):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcf6215f-6fd2-4f69-b57c-537754d4ece3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcf6215f-6fd2-4f69-b57c-537754d4ece3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat the process with the cursor at the beginning of Line D (so far, still good):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03a2c0e8-681f-4843-aa77-bd8223ddf73c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03a2c0e8-681f-4843-aa77-bd8223ddf73c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I place the cursor back at Line B and insert continuous Line Numbers:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c45d8f49-5164-46cd-9e3a-9b6f994081e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c45d8f49-5164-46cd-9e3a-9b6f994081e4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, as has been reported, problems happen: Next Page Breaks are generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13615b9d-5eed-48d8-8438-71ee7cccf88a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13615b9d-5eed-48d8-8438-71ee7cccf88a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I place the cursor at Line D (3rd page) and follow the protocol to switch break types (Format - Document - Layout - Continuous) - yes, New page is checked in this screenshot, but I am clicking on Continuous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e0efcd-2638-4a64-bb7a-6d95a9c11195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e0efcd-2638-4a64-bb7a-6d95a9c11195" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat this back on p. 2, Line B. &nbsp;But nothing happens. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/352fbee0-43b5-4d4c-9b33-0838d075b61b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/352fbee0-43b5-4d4c-9b33-0838d075b61b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The sections remain as they were. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have installed ActiveSynce 4.5 on my laptop.&nbsp;It works fine until I reboot the machine.</p>
<p>After the machine restarts ActiveSync no longer starts.&nbsp; It will not start when I connect the phone through the USB or if I just try to start it from the start menu.&nbsp; I have installed and uninstalled 4 times.&nbsp; I have used the cd provided by
 verizonwireless and have downloaded it from the microsoft website.</p>
<p>I am using windows xp media center edition on the laptop.&nbsp; I don't think it is a phone or USB issue since it works fine until the laptop is shut down and restarted.&nbsp;

<p>Any help???</p>

            You need to make sure that the handheld device is not connected to the PC when you reboot or shutdown - this can sometimes cause problems.

<p>So based on what you said, you completed the following:l</p>
<p>You&nbsp;obtained the MAC addresses of your device (I assume you got it from the Wireless LAN setting on your device).
</p>
<p>Then you&nbsp;entered that address into a configuratin screen of your router.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, after doing that did you remember to switch on the filtering option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, have you tried NOT enabling MAC Address Filtering just to see if you can connect?</p>

    <title>Cannot find Windows 10 Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find Windows 10 Skype</h2>
                    <p>It was somehow replaced by the desktop version (8.x) today, which I cannot stand using. The one that came with Windows 10 was much better, but the Store only offers the Desktop version, too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the end?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Remembered my 20 years old ICQ account, which I last used before MSN Messenger. ICQ is still alive and it is a perfect mix of Skype and Viber. The UI is almost a shameless copy but much cleaner. Skype devs should take a look.</p>

            Hi Gabest,
<br />
<br />I noticed the same thing too. My Windows 10 Skype is no more and Skype 8 is the only one available on my computer.
<br />
<br />It looks like Microsoft is consolidating to one app, which is better overall than several different versions.

<h2>            Text Form Field Options</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
I am trying to set the options to:<br />
<br />
Type : Date<br />
Date Format : MM-dd-yy<br />
<br />
When I apply the protection, I type in the field 072611 and upon pressing TAB to jump to the next field a warning comes up stating it needs a valid format.<br />
<br />
Also it is happening on a filed in which a have a phone number. I set the filed to:<br />
<br />
Type: Number<br />
<br />
Maximum length: 10<br />
Number format 000-000-0000<br />
<br />
I enter 1111111111 and it print 1111111111-0000-<br />
<br />
?!<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong? Is there a solution?<br />

I am using Word 2003 in a computer with the compatibility Pack.<br />

            <p>So long as you have set your date field to Date format and entered the code MM-dd-yy it should work (you have to enter the date in your standard local format still e.g. 07/26/11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the telephone number, set the field type to Number and the length to 12.&nbsp; Enter the format ###-###-#### and you should find that works.</p>
