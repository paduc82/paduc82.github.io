<p>Yammer is more of a social network. The best practice would be for the user to post his question in the respective interests groups so it gets to the group of people with best answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a platform specifically for Q&amp;A</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, Yammer recently upgraded its features to include Best Answers so this helps a bit.</p>

<h2>            Unable to get back to Insider preview</h2>
                    After getting along with insider preview since 9xxx build, I had faced error Windows working in Build 14342. So I had clean installed the Build and verify my computer. It works well except Wacom tablet in Photoshop but that is not my most concern. The
 issue is I cannot get back to update the newer build. I had try many means as several post in many website such as : http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10240-not-appearing-on-windows-update/. Any advice for me.

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0bf5c39d-3dd8-4f9d-b1a1-53793a94f3fb" title="HirunSrichintai">

<p>
</p><p>The fix the Win 10 teams did yesterday Lawrence referred to may well solve your problem.&nbsp; I also noticed a change that is basic but might impact you.&nbsp; I don't know which build ushered it in but in 14332, I saw that instead of the slider to choose Fast/Slow
 ring being located in Settings&gt;Advanced, it is now a pull down available by clicking a link at Settings &gt;Windows Update&gt;<strong>Windows Insider Program</strong> located at the bottom of the list on the left of settings.&nbsp; Go there and<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8ff074-ea57-43c8-afe2-31a7627c3c49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8ff074-ea57-43c8-afe2-31a7627c3c49" /></a>
 make sure you have it set to one of the rings (I assume you want Fast).&nbsp; It may take a little while (it took me about 8 hours) and after I did that I was able to see the latest build offered.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it can't hurt to do the two regedits from that link you posted--I've found they offer a lot of good info and are tracking MSFT's Insider Program pretty accurately. Make sure that when you&nbsp; do the regedits of course that you import the two registry keys
 (backing them up and saving them just in case) first. That's easily done by selecting the reg key or subkey&gt;File&gt;Import.&nbsp; Then if you ever want to replace it you just go to File&gt;export.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Hello -&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had my new&nbsp;notebook&nbsp;since May (5 months) and have never successfully synched.&nbsp; Windows Mobile Device Centre displays "Not connected".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>I have Window Vista Home Premium on a 32-bit laptop </div>
</li><li>
<div>It is not connected to a network since I am at home.</div>
</li><li>
<div>I downloaded drvupdate-x86.exe and the install seemed to work - no error messages and it is listed in my Control Panel software list.</div>
</li><li>
<div>My mobile device uses&nbsp;Windows Mobile 5.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>When placed in the USB cradle, it&nbsp;displays in Vista's Windows Device Manager under "Mobile Devices"</div>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<div>WMDC never launches when I place the device in the cradle.&nbsp; So I load it up and it is very consistent "Not connected"</div>
</li><li>
<div>I have tried changing the settings - no luck</div>
</li><li>
<div>I have read many groups and most of them seemed to work at some point</div>
</li><li>It was a long time ago, but when I first used WMDC I&nbsp;<em>may have </em>clicked cancel when it tried to establish a connection.&nbsp; If I did, then is it possible this messed up something.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past I posted to various groups .</p>
<p>Today I tried uninstalling WMDC and re-downloading.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>I also have deleted the device from device manager, disconnected and reconnected to the cradle.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>A couple of questions first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What device do you have?</p>
<p>Do you have Outlook installed on your PC?</p>
<p>Were you ever able to establish a partnership?</p>
<p>When you connect, do you hear a "beep" from the computer indicating that a device was connected?&nbsp; Do you then hear a second beep a few seconds later?</p>
<p>If you go into Device Manager while your device is connected, how many times do you see it listed?&nbsp; It should appear twice (listed under Portable Devices and Network adapters).</p>

I am running Windows 7. I recently bought a HTC HD2 running Windows Mocile 6.5. The first time I connected through USB, everything went like a breeze for synchronisation.</p>
<p>Ever since, whenever I try to connect through USB, WMDC shows the device as "Not Connected"</p>

<p>PC is running Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit).</p>
<p>I have re-installed Windows Mobile Device Manager, but still no connectivity.</p>
<p>The problem seems to have appeared after installing SP1 for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should a Service Pack break&nbsp;things that used to work?</p>

            <p>AutoRecover only works when PPT is able to recognize that it's about to crash.&nbsp; When it does that, it'll offer to restart itself and try to recover your work. If it doesn't do that, it means that it hasn't detected a crash (which I suspect would be the case
 when it just freezes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say, that likely means that John's right ... the presentation's gone. You'll need to revert to the older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a good idea to save often and to periodically save under a new file name (ie, MyProject-001, MyProject-002 and so on).&nbsp; I used to do a ton of work in PPT back when it was far less reliable than it is now.&nbsp; Every so often I'd ask myself whether I'd done
 more work than I was willing to have to repeat if it crashed in the next few seconds.&nbsp; If so, it was time to save under a new name.</p>

<h2>            How best to create a database for visitors and the date they visited our office&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created a student course relationship style database and am looking to create a visitor table to go along with it. The main information I would need would be the date they visited and maybe a small note for the visit. How would I go about best designing
 a table/relationship like this that is easy to query?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>.....my "student" list contains all contacts, including those who have not taken any courses.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
In that case you simply need a table for Visits which references the Contacts table:<br />
<br />
Visits<br />
....VisitID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
....ContactID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....VisitDate<br />
....VisitReason<br />
<br />
though you might want to think about omitting the VisitReason column and having a separate Reasons table, and a table to model its many-to-many relationship type with Visits:<br />
<br />
Reasons<br />
....ReasonID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
....Reason<br />
<br />
and to model the relationship type:<br />
<br />
VisitReasons<br />
....VisitID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....ReasonID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
the primary key of this last table would be composite one made up of both columns.<br />
<br />
By defining reasons with defined Reason values this aids analysis of the data.&nbsp; By virtue of the many-to-many relationship type between Visits and Reasons each visit can be categorised by one or more reasons.<br />

            There is no autosave in Access. Access is not a document centric application like Word or Excel. So there is nothing to Autosave,.
<div><br />
<div>When you are entering data in a form (or table), as soon as you move focus from the current record, the records is saved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are making design changes to an object, when you close the object, you should be prompted to save it.</div>

<h2>            PowerPoint and Hibernate or Sleep Incompatible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Enterprise 64 bit, Powerpoint as part of Office 10 Professional, both fully patched.&nbsp; For years now I've had no problems at all on this machine with SLEEP or HIBERNATE when WORD or EXCEL documents are open -- I can come back after a good night's
 sleep, SPOTLIGHT screen asks me for my login (PIN or password), and I'm off to the races working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT... last three weeks I've been doing a lot of PPTX creation, and if I leave a PPTX or two open and the system goes to sleep or hibernates, the return to life doesn't work.&nbsp; SPOTLIGHT asks for my credentials, with (as usual) its background one solid color
 on the primary monitor, the other monitor blank. Login complete, and the screens stay that way. Mouse pointer visible on both. POWER options circle visible. Nothing else. ALT-TAB doesn't rotate through active windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried three-finger-salute (CTRL-ALT-DEL), and the normal options appear. Select Task Manager, and the desktops appear behind the USER control panel ("do you want to allow..." prompt); when I say YES, back to solid color and blank. Task Manager never
 gets a chance to show me anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart is the only way out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>(Today, btw, is a day of <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></em> letting PowerPoint stay open all day. I've got work to do.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>A computer's sleep mode is a function of it's hardware design, not the OS or programs installed. A poorly designed sleep mode can lose data. Many years ago, I had a Toshiba laptop that would lose data and crash programs when it when into sleep mode. So I
 just stopped using sleep mode with that computer, problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, you can turn off sleep mode by searching from the Start button for
<em>sleep mode</em>, then clicking on <strong>Change when the computer sleeps</strong>. Click on
<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>. Expand the <strong>Sleep</strong> category and set
<em>Hibernate</em> after to <strong>Never</strong>.</p>

<p>John, you're not addressing the question. Every other app on my machine sleeps and hibernates just fine. Not PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off sleep or not hibernating denies me a lot of functionality and security, facilitates travel with a laptop, and does good for heat, electricity and hardware life.&nbsp; If all I have to do is close PowerPoint to avoid the problem that's a lot less impact
 than not hibernating at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even that, as a workaround, does not answer the question. Has anyone else had this problem specifically with PowerPoint Professional, not O365?</p>

    <title>Copy project calendar to all tasks in MS Project 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rproenza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy project calendar to all tasks in MS Project 2007</h2>
                    <p>I created a project calendar, but for some reason, the project calendar is not showing up for all of the tasks under task information, or the indicators column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to copy/include the project calendar to all tasks without having to individually select the project calendar for each task under task information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The calendar you set in Project &gt; Project information is by default, the calendar used to schedule all tasks.&nbsp; When you assign a resource, the resource's calendar (non-working time) drives the schedule.&nbsp; I'm guessing what you are seeing is
<b>None </b>in the calendar field in Task Information - that is exactly what it should say.&nbsp;
<u>Do not </u>set anything other than None, unless you wish to explicitly assign a task calendar that is different than either the Project calendar or the resource's calendar.<br />

<h2>            MSXML6.xmlhttp component and bug KB895954 &#40;missing body of message during a repost or message&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know if the bug <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/895954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB895954</a>&nbsp;(When you use Internet Explorer or another program to perform a re-POST operation, only the header data is posted) only applies to microsoft.XMLHTTP COM Object or does this also apply to the later com objects, such as MSXML2.XMLHTTP, &nbsp;MSXML3.XMLHTTP
 and &nbsp;MSXML6.XMLHTTP?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We are currently getting a lot of body-less messges, which cause a lot of issues to the legacy application that my team is supporting. If this issue was fixed in the later versions of the xmlhttp component, then my team can make a business case for making
 use of the upgraded component within the application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help on this would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>

    <title>Band 2 Comfort Suggestions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no idlady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Band 2 Comfort Suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know how far up on the wrist (towards the forearm) the Band 2 can be worn without messing with the sensors' (particularly heart rate) accuracy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to the Band 2 -- I just finished my first week and am mostly loving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm not loving is that my wrist bone (the bump on the top outside of my wrist specifically) is now chronically sore from the Band 2 constantly bumping into it just about whenever I move my hand or wrist.&nbsp; I thought it might just take some getting used
 to, but it's a week later and that little ulnar bump is still pretty darn tender.&nbsp; I can't be the only person to have this experience --my wrist bone isn't huge or anything --&nbsp;and am wondering what others have done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Band 2 is the correct size (small) and is snug and (otherwise) comfortable without moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking about wearing it maybe 1.5" higher on my forearm to see if that would be a solution, but I don't want to decrease the accuracy of the sensors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any info/suggestions.</p>
<p>

                    This is happening on a brand new surface pro I7 256 device. I am very frustrated as this is my first experience with the insider program and want out!! Please remove me from the program and give me instructions on rolling back to my preinstalled version
 of windows.

            that's wonderful. I was instructed by Microsoft to bring my issue here to contact a developer and have my account removed from the insider program so I can roll back... seems that is a fail as well.

When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.</p>

<p>If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet to
 download the programs again.</p>

            Reading back to your initial post on this thread you said that when you clicked on shut down it just went to the log on screen.&nbsp; Could it be that the mouse pointer size is too large and you are getting the Restart also?<br />
Or maybe you clicked on the sign out which takes you back to the Lock screen also.

<p>Hi Dematri,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to directly connect Access Database in SharePoint Online, and SharePoint Online does not support to access files in an external directories.</p>

 contacts or to click on the picture to change yet neither of these options are available. Is there a way to actually speak to someone from skype?</p>

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. irst try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />1. Open Excel
<br />2. ALT+F11
<br />3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window
<br />4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter
<br />5. You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />5. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps. Start your computer in Safe mode with networking and see whether the problem is solved. If yes, then some program is causing the problem.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not getting an error code but my tablet won't get past the screen saying there was an installation problem with the fix issues button. When I tap the button, I get the circling dots for a couple of seconds but that's it . Can't go further. Tried restarting,
 running the windows troubleshooter but no luck.</p>

<h2>            MS Word shortcut on taskbar acting strangely</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>I’m going to ask a few questions in one post because they are all related. I'm not sure if I should post this with different subtopics. So here goes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Problem and Question #1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Recently I had to reinstall Windows 10, because of an “<em>Inaccessible <span>
&nbsp;</span>Boot Device</em>”. So of course I had to reinstall all my old Apps/Pgms. <span>
&nbsp;</span>Now I have this strange abnormality that goes like this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>My Word shortcut on the Task bar now lists “<em>Word(Desktop)</em>” when I RIGHT click on it, not Word(2013).</span></li><li><span>If I LEFT click on a recent file (after right clicking on the taskbar shortcut) I get something saying that the file is unavailable…it may have been moved.</span></li><li><span>However; if it RIGHT click on it and then click OPEN, it opens the file</span><span>. Yep the
</span><span>same file!</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Since this started I cleared out the recent files, opened some files, and then attempted to open them again in the recent group. This problem repeats itself.
</span></p>
<p><span>Anybody have any ideas? Oh I have Office 2013.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Question #2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>What is the difference between the latest MS Office (2016 I think) and Office 365.?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Question #3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I use EXCEL, Outlook,<span>&nbsp; </span>Publisher, Word and Streets and Trips, on two local PCs. I DO NOT want to store my file on the cloud, and want to be able to run my Office pgms when not connected to the cloud. Any suggestion on what version of MS
 Office would be a fit for me?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the help.</span></p>
<p><span>Phil</span></p>
<p>

<p>1. Try repairing your installation from Control Panel. See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Office (desktop)" simply means a locally installed version on your computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Office 365 is a subscription which means that you get the most recent versions of software, for as long as your subscription is active. Office 2016 is currently the most recent version, but it won't be forever, of course. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In contrast, if you have a one-time purchase version (perpetual license)&nbsp;such as Office 2016 Home and Student, you won't get any future versions (unless you purchase them again). The advantage, of course, is that you don't have to continue paying for Office
 every month (or every year). A one-time purchase version is usually cheaper, especially if you don't feel the need to get the most recent updated versions as soon as they are released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No matter which version you are running, you can always choose not to store your files in the "cloud." In Word, click File&nbsp;| Options | Save and
<strong>select</strong> "Save to Computer by default." Also, <strong>clear</strong> the option "Show additional places for saving, even if sign-in may be required."</p>

<p>Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. that was really good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one FEAR I have about reinstalling&nbsp; all the Office apps (Again) is having to re-personalize Outlook. I have 7 email accounts (don't ask) and have rules that tweak/move the incoming emails around. Having to go through that again can be stressful. Even
 exporting a lot of parameters and importing them to the new install can be problematic..... I'll save that for last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to reinstall the whole Office suite just to rectify the Word shortcut abnormalities. I'm hoping for another small fix........maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Again</p>
<p>Phil</p>

            Especially if the current installation is damaged, repairing Office may result in a reinstallation; that is correct. There may be no way around that, I'm afraid.

<p>Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have the product key for 2013. It's just that if I'm going to put in some more effort, I might as well go forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However; with every update I feel that I have lost some knowledge. Yep the new releases have lots more flexibility. It just knowing/learning where they moved some of the old functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some years back I worked tech support for MS doing Office and specializing in EXCEL. In those days I considered myself very proficient. Today I sometimes feel overwhelmed, but I keep at it. Have to keep the gray matter energized.</p>
<p>
