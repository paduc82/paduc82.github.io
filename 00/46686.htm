<h2>            My Laptop Keeps Randomly Locking Itself Up</h2>
                    <p>My laptop keeps locking itself up randomly even when i am writing this, everytime i press the windows button or the spacebar or shift or anyhting (i don't know anymore) it will lock itself up even after i and i have read online that it may be because my
 os is not updated and i have tried updating the windows but it keeps failing. Everytime it lock itself up there are certain keys that are being unable to be used in the lock screen like enter and spacebar and everytime i press u it always pop up and says make
 your windows easier to use which is SOOO ANNOYING and i press windows+t to be able to press u again, pressing spacebar will pop up keyboard options. I don't know man, this is driving me insane</p>
<p>Everytime it always asks me to restart and the updates are not even installed, it always fails to install the update but it keeps always asking to restart because the updates is listed on windows updates but it always fails over and over again. I tried to
 download the install myself and do it manually but when i did that it said that the update is not compatible with my machine, so what's wrong here?</p>
<p>I totally am clueless and desperate. I want to do Fresh Start but I am in the middle of a college task and i can't afford to do it now. Keep in mind that this problem has been going for months since early this year but I ignored up until now, I am done out
 of options. Here are my specifications:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lenovo Ideapad 310 14-IKB Intel Core i5-7200U</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Windows 10 Home Single Language Version 1709 Build 16299.192</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update which always fails to be installed automatically is 2018-06 Windows Cumulative Update For Version 1709 (KB4074588)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the creators update last year but i don't think that i got the creators update this year i think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have anything to help me please let me know, this is driving me crazy</p>
<p>
</p><p>*note: as i am wrting this down seems like more keys being jacked up because i didn't have anything wrong with my keyboard when logged in but it suddenly pops out of nowhere especially everytime i press shift. please help me fix this annoying ****</p>

            Hi HieronimusIvan, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>If running Microsoft Security Essentials do I need to run Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathyg_nc  say:</h3>
<h2>            If running Microsoft Security Essentials do I need to run Windows Defender&#63; Is Essentials the reason I can&#39;t start Defender&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I am running Microsoft Security Essentials on Vista x32. &nbsp;Security center tells me to start Windows Defender. &nbsp;I click to start it but it tells me that I need to restart my computer or manually start Defender myself. &nbsp;I go to services and it won't start
 Defender. &nbsp;It tells me basically that my system doesn't currently need the program or there is some other reason it won't start. &nbsp;Answers tells me that for the error code I encountered later Error Code 0x800106ba of course it tells me to attempt to start it
 manually and if that doesn't work that I should uninstall Defender and reinstall it. &nbsp;Yet when I go to uninstall programs, Defender isn't listed. &nbsp;I tried to install it again since it wasn't listed I thought I could. &nbsp;When I went to install it, it errors out
 telling me that I already have it as it came pre-installed with Vista. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, my question. &nbsp;Do I really need Defender since I am running Microsoft Security Essentials? &nbsp;Is Defender actually an older quasi version of Essentials? &nbsp;Why does it tell me to start it if it's not needed? And if it's needed, why won't it start</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure to check in the MSE Forums.<br />

<br />
Windows Defender's functions are included in MSE so loading Defender would be redundant.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;antispyware<br />
<br />
MSE =&nbsp; antivirus + antispyware.<br />
<br />
So think of MSE as Windows Defender with more added (which it is).<br />
<br />
<strong>Check this :<br />
<br />
</strong>Start - type in Search box -&gt; MSCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Startup tab - Uncheck Windows Defender (if listed) and APPLY / OK&nbsp; - REBOOT<br />
<br />
That should stop Defender from loading.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
If needed after the above :<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

Maybe something here&nbsp;if needed :<br />
<br />
What is showing/causing the error message? Some security/anitvirus/antispyware products can<br />
cause this error. Which of those do you use INCLUDING any that your ever had even those<br />
uninstalled (the remnants can cause issues). McAfee is just an example of what many can do.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box - Services - find at top of list - Right Click - Run as Admin<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - set to STARTED and AUTOMATIC<br />

or set to STOPPED and MANUAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if needed<br />

<h2>            random black screen &#47; crash &#47; lock up</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm facing a strange issue on my laptop. Randomly my display turns off while doing something. If I'm listening to music or watching a video, I still get the sound, even though the keyboard isn't responsive. I've tried doing hibernate, shut down using my power
 buttons/laptop hotkeys as well as alt+f4 to close the current window, but nothing works. Just before the display went off, the sound broke down for a second but then became normal after the screen blacked out.<br />
<br />
<br />
At first I thought it was because of the game I was running, but then the second and third incidents happened when I was just randomly checking my facebook and watching youtube. There was no background activity, even updates weren't running. The event log had
 nothing in it either. I've checked the event log, and I see no critical errors or warnings, except the one saying that windows was shut down unexpectedly. I've copied the individual event logs for application and system from the time I was using the laptop
 till the reboot after the lock up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recently clean formatted my laptop and it hardly has much software or data on it. Moreover it's just a year old, and has a WMI of 5.9 for RAM and HDD while over 7 for the rest. It's an Alienware M17x. Core 2 Quad Q9000 with 4 GB RAM, 2x Nvidia 260M and Nvidia
 9400 GPUs and a 500 GB HDD. My Windows as well as my drivers are up to date as well.<br />

Can someone please suggest a solution, as it's pretty upsetting to see a freshly installed laptop having such issues. Thanks in advance.<br />

            I uninstalled my existing video drivers and used the default Windows 7 drivers. It has replaced Nvidia drivers from 260.99 with the 179.85 drivers. Now the issues aren't occurring, though a few Nvidia features seem to have been disabled because the drivers
 are outdated. This is just a workaround, what could be a solution. So that I can use the latest drivers without having any problems.

<h2>            Skype on Lumia phone</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have Skype on my Lumia 520 phone (Windows 8.1) and I could use it in the past. Some days ago I have been signed out from Skype when I tried to use it. Since that date I cannot sign in again on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype is working on my computer, but I cannot use it on my Lumia phone. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, but the problem is the same: When I try to sign in, I get a message: "Could not log in. Now you cannot sign in. Please check the Network settings
 and try again."</p>

<p>This is a slap in the face to longstanding Windows Phone and Skype users. &nbsp;Now that Microsoft owns Skype one would hope that they would at least support their own operating systems and phones, not just drop them like a hot potato.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Nokia Lumia 521 has been a good phone and still works well. &nbsp;Microsoft recalled the Windows 10 update for it though, so it's left running 8.1, and now they have dropped Skype support for 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to unplug your Ethernet cable and plug it back to make sure that there's no loose connection?</li><li>If your desktop is wireless capable, can you connect to the internet using wireless connection?</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Erson</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>I have checked the Ethernet cable and there is no loose connection. I lost the Internet connection right after the Anniversary update was installed and computer had restarted - so the problem should be related with the update.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my desktop computer has no wireless networking capability.</p>
<p>In the Network Connections window I can see that Ethernet3 is enabled but in Windows taskbar it says "Connection status - unknown".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any instructions would be appreciated</p>

<p>
</p><p>Tried it but no success. Troubleshooter results: Hardware changes might not have been detected - Issue not present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried clean booting following the guide:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135 but that did'nt help either. Disabled all the startup programs that I could (except Avast antivirus - had to disable it inside the Avast itself), restarted my computer
 but still no Internet.</p>

<p>All I had to do was to <strong>uninstall Zonealarm</strong> - during this process I could see Internet coming back alive. I also tried clean boot (disabled Zonealarm) but that did'nt work, uninstallation was the solution. Then I reinstalled Zonealarm.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeffrey,</p>
<p>
</p><div>I&nbsp;recommend you&nbsp;to select a different File History drive and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also&nbsp;I&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you to Change how long File History keeps files.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the below steps</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press Windows key + X from the Keyboard and click on Control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Control panel Window will be open, change the View by: Category to Large icons to&nbsp;Small icons.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on File history and click on Advanced settings.</span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Next&nbsp;to Save copies of files, tap or click the list, and choose a time interval.<br />
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Next to Keep saved versions, tap or click the list, and choose a time interval.</p>
<p>6.Click on Save changes</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>File History doesn't automatically delete versions of files older than the time interval you choose unless your drive is getting full and space is needed to back up more recent versions</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I suggest&nbsp;to Reconnect the drive and Reselect your File History drive </p>

            I've tried all that and no change. &nbsp;I set up File History about three moths ago and found it very buggy. &nbsp;I had hoped the bugs would have been dealt with by now, but obviously they haven't. &nbsp;I'll keep my third party system going as the only viable one.&nbsp;

            You can downgrade to Windows 10 1511 using the following method, but I would rather you choose a more recent release.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to roll back my X99 machine to an earlier update, re-installed the previous AMD GPU drivers and all seems well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instruction for the H110 machine and again re-installed an earlier release of the AMD GPU drivers... Everything has ran stable for the last 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming the problem lies somewhere between Microsoft an AMD, I just wish they would get around the table before such a major update and bottom out all of the issues before launching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the prompt response.</p>

            Glad to know you are back up and running Les. Yes, it seems there is some disconnect between Microsoft and AMD on the driver front.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; GPUs switching on and off</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; GPU in primary PCI (x16) slot hanging, tried moving GPU via riser to slot 1 (closest to CPU) and it hangs after a few seconds to a minute.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue too!! For about a month I am trying to resolve this issue without any result!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system composed of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asrock H110 PRO BTC+ motherboard,</p>
<p>2 x 4GB (8GB) HyperX HX424C15FBK2/8 DDR4 2400MHz RAM,</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-7700K CPU,</p>
<p>Kingston SUV400S37/120G UV400 120GB SSD,</p>
<p>8 x Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX580 8GB VGA cards,</p>
<p>2 x Corsair HX1000 PSUs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine with Windows 10 1709 (64bit) edition for me. But before about a month that the version 1803 being released, the system became momentarily stalling and the mouse pointer became to stutter, exactly as&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c41165a9-f3db-49e1-a88a-0411b5acc9af" title="Les T W">Les
 T W</a> said!! Also, the audio failed to start giving me an "x" in the tray icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation happens if I have all the 8 cards connected. If I disconnect the 5 cards and only leave the 3 cards connected, then the system runs smoothly. If I connect one more card (4 cards total) then the system becomes to stall and to have the previously
 described behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a clean format and installed Windows 10 1709 (64bit) edition with the latest drivers from AMD and everything worked fine (plus the sound). But some days later the system AUTO UPDATED to 1803!! There is not an option to stop Windows 10 updates forever
 (or I am wrong?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e5564792-9930-4912-828b-e206924b132a" title="Andre Da Costa">
Andre Da Costa</a><span> you said to downgrade Windows but what about the auto update mechanism of Windows 10? Is there a way to disable it?</span></p>
<p><span>Also, is it safe to leave my system un-updated forever?</span></p>

<h2>            My Xbox One is completely unusable</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I started up my console this morning I've been having constant major problems with my Xbox One. Every time I try to run a game it freezes the Xbox One forcing me to turn it off... But when I try to turn it off the power button flashes for hours
 without actually powering the system down forcing me to hold the button completely rebooting the system. Once I do finally get the console back on it doesn't let me open up any apps at all... Besides the games which then end up crashing my console again...
 At this point I have no idea what to do. My Xbox One is unusable and I don't think I can get a refund or exchange because I've had it for over 30 days.</p>
<p>Can anybody suggest anything that may fix the problem?</p>

<p>Hello KoaVan,</p>
<p>This issue used to happen quite frequently for me. The following may resolve your issue. It might take a while, but I assure you, if you give it the patience, it most likely will do you wonders.</p>
<p>Go to Settings &gt; Network Settings &gt; MAC Address &gt; Alternate MAC Address &gt; Clear &gt; Restart. Once your system has restarted, go to Disc &amp; Blu Ray &gt; Persistent Storage &gt; Clear Persistent Storage. This should resolve your issue. Sometimes it also helps if you
 disable BD Live. Please let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 taskbar color </h2>
                    My color of my Windows 7 taskbar at the bottom of the screen randomly changed on me and I didn't even change anything in my personalization. I've tried to change it back several times but nothing changes every time i try. I'm not sure what to do here so
 any sort of help would be appreciated.

<p>If you aren't using an Aero theme, or if a program that is incompatible with Aero (the clear glass effects) opens, your taskbar will turn back to the default pale blue color until you either choose an Aero theme, or close the incompatible program. &nbsp;You'll
 also notice that the clear glass effects are gone and previews are no longer shown for the running programs in the Taskbar (text will be shown instead).</p>
<p>If you don't know what incompatible program is running, you may be able to resolve it by rebooting your computer.</p>

I am having the same issue. I have Windows 8 and I am trying to play FreeCell in the Microsoft Solitaire collection. I am on the Daily Challenges and when I try to move stacks that should be able to move, for instance, moving a stack with a 6 of diamonds, 5
 of clubs, 4 of hearts, and 3 of clubs, onto a 7 of spades, it will not move. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app from the Windows Store and I am still having the same issue. This does seem to be a bug in the game.

            Exactly the problem I'm facing too. I often cannot move a stack of cards to a spot where it should be possible to land.

            Not only am I having this problem most of the time on Freecell (for example, the October 1 &amp; 3 challenges), it's also popped up on Spider Solitaire a couple times. My edition is up-to-date (&amp; I confirmed it by uninstalling &amp; reinstalling it 2 days ago),
 I have DirectX 11 (current), and Windows Update says I'm not missing any drivers or updates. Translation: both method 1 &amp; method 2 failed, &amp; I agree that it's probably a bug on Microsoft's end.<br />

            To clear things up FreeCell allows you to only move 1 card at a time
<div>Only reason you are able to move stacks is if you have empty spaces in backup or whole empty stacks</div>

            Blue Microwave, I'm not sure we're on the same page. As I understand it, in Freecell part of the strategy is to make tableaux of cards in alternating colors. As long as cards are in complete or partial tableaux, every game of Freecell I've ever played
 lets me move the tableau as if it were a single card. Microsoft Solitaire Collection seems designed to let me move tableaux; it recognizes these stacks as acceptable to move, but sometimes it has trouble actually moving the tableau. I can pick up the tableau,
 but sometimes (and only sometimes), if the tableau has more than 2 cards in it, the game does not like to move the tableau at all (e.g. I can't move a tableau who's highest card is a 6 of diamonds onto either black 7 or either of two empty spaces available.
 Sometimes I can get around this by moving half of the tableau onto another card, an empty space, or into the backup &amp; then moving the other half of the tableau, but this prevents me from completing some difficult games or challenges with limited moves like
 the October 3 challenge.<br />

            <p>Blue Microwave was right. The problem lies in the 'help' that freecell offers when there are enough empty cells to make a manual stack movement 1 card at the time. In those cases you are allowed to move complete stacks. For a decent explanation look at
<a href="http://www.solitairecity.com/Help/FreeCell.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.solitairecity.com/Help/FreeCell.shtml</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freecell could have given me a bit more insight in this. For example by animating the card movements for me when moving a stack.</p>

            I've tried the suggestion of Blue Microwave and ftamminga. &nbsp;It might answer some of the problems some of the time but not always. The game is broken.

            Thank you for this forum. Increasingly, FreeCell will not allow me to move single or stacks of cards even to create correct alternating suit sequence columns. &nbsp;The only remedy I have found it to move the card to and upper storage space first then move
 the card to the desired location at the end of a column. The bug is getting worse not better. It first infected the leftmost column. &nbsp;Now it infects the leftmost and the right most. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software several times.

            <p>You're most likely specifying the drive and/or partition numbers incorrectly. For
<em>-rawdisk</em> use <strong>\\.\PhysicalDrive#</strong> where <strong>#</strong> can be found via Disk Management in Windows. For
<em>-partitions</em> <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
section 9.9.1.2 of the manual</a> states:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">The numbers for the list of partitions can be taken from the output of<br />
<br />
<em>VBoxManage internalcommands listpartitions -rawdisk /dev/sda</em><br />
<br />
The output lists the partition types and sizes to give the user enough information to identify the partitions necessary for the guest.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Of course you'll need to use <strong>\\.\PhysicalDrive#</strong> instead of <strong>
/dev/sda</strong> in the command above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If it were me I'd have posted this type of question on VirtualBox's own forum instead.</p>

                    <p>I'm hoping someone can help me with this..&nbsp;Yesterday out of the blue, my party chat stopped working properly. I can hear everyone crystal clear, but they can't hear me.
<br />
<br />
At first I assumed that my headset had broken, so tried connecting via the Xbox App on my phone. I had exactly the same problem. No one can hear me. I tried with both 4G and Wi-Fi to see if something was wrong with my internet,&nbsp;despite everything working perfectly
 and no change. I'm not muted &amp; I'm 99% sure I'm not chat banned... Not done anything to warrant it + received no messages etc</p>
<p><br />
PLEASE can someone help me with this. The Xbox support is appallingly bad and it seems utterly impossible to connect to an agent&nbsp;due to a ridiculous feedback loop.<br />

    <title>startup hangs on disk.sys after win upt reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> survivor999  say:</h3>
<h2>            startup hangs on disk.sys after win upt reinstall</h2>
                    <p>*****<br />
About the below described issue, after talking to Microsoft's chat person the <br />
registry was mentioned as the probable culprit. So, I replaced the registry on the "down" drive with the one from it's mirror backup and got past the hangups and on to an infinite "your desktop is being rebuilt" , the screen message also of "non-genuine Windows
 7 ...." so , at least I know the "down" machine's registry(and registry backup on that machine) are corrupt.<br />
Now, I wonder if it is possible to "uncorrupt them" so it will start my machine ? Again, I don't<br />
use system restore.<br />
I wonder, would upgrading to Windows 8 solve the issue ?<br />
I need something to scan and repair the registry while in Recovery Mode.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer suddenly hangs in safe mode on disk.sys, this is after I played around with reinstalling the missing windows update service and windows defender. I can't remember if a crash occurred during any updates, because I did get the windows update service
 working for a bit. Had been having random crashes, not regular enough to be a virus I don't think, probably some other conflict, which, after now working on this issue I may now know what was causing those random crashes. Well, I've tried all the online suggested
 remedies, new MBR, turn off/on services drivers, restore sys files with the sys file checker, chkdsk, etc, I have no restore points, I turned it off. Must be something I can do. I've got DaRT, tried all it has to offer, I think.</p>
<p>It was hanging up on other .sys drivers however, after I experimented with turning on / off the services, and left the windows update service</p>
<p>and defender services permanently&nbsp;off, the other .sys driver's did not hang up anymore in safe mode booting. Now, it's just stuck on the drive.sys and</p>
<p>it just gives the 4 segement memory address contents or something or other on the BSOD.</p>
<p>I am running my laptop from a "mirror" backup of the "down" drive&nbsp;and attempting repair to the "down" drive from a usb connection, occasionally reinstalling the "down" drive back into the laptop to see if it will boot. Also, trying to boot the "down" drive
 from the usb, where it hangs onthe "disk.sys" driver the same as when it is installed into the laptop.</p>
<p>I run Spyware Dr, Malwarebytes,&nbsp; Spybot, and clean off anything regularly. Been using Norton to cleanup system things regularly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A new rememdy I located this morning said to reinstall the pcmcia.sys which I did to no avail.</p>
<p>Possibly a deep-dark rooted hang-up lurking somewhere in my system.</p>
<p>Tried nearly everything on the DaRT tool, including remvoving all hot fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Couldn't figure a way to roll back any windows updates though. Hmmm</p>
<p>Just tried using a known "good" backup of registry files, and when I boot, now instead of hanging up&nbsp;on disk.sys, it hangs right after it on classpnp.sys .</p>
