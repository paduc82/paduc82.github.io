    <title>outlook jpg attachments cannot be saved - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            outlook jpg attachments cannot be saved</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
i saw a couple of fourms on this one but i decided to create a new one anyway.<br />
<br />
here is the issue, i cannot save a jpg attachement on my computer. I'm using 10.6.8 and outlook 14.1.4.<br />
<br />
i did some test and this are the info i gathered and found out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The attachments downloaded by outlook is saved in ~/Library/Cache/TemporaryItems/Outlook Temp/ .JPG's and Office files like word, excel and powerpoint are locked but not PNG's. if i open a .doc attachment, MS word can do Save As with no issues. Same thing with
 powerpoint and excel files. PNG attachment opened via preview can be do a Save As with no issues as well.<br />
<br />
I did another test, i have a jpg file saved on my desktop directly from a camera. Locked it via the Get Info window, do as save as, same permission issue.<br />
<br />
I think the problem here is with Mac's preview unable to save jpgs if they are locked.<br />
<br />
there is a work arounds, save the file as PNG. but not all users will be happy with this.<br />
<br />
why post it here? well, i'm thinking if there is a way that Outlook can download and save the files in the Outlook Temp folder without locking them.
<br />
<br />

            <p>The above guys are somehow mixing two different things, which makes solving the problem even more difficult. Let me clarify first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an email w a JPG attachment arrives, you can do <strong>TWO</strong> things with it:
</p>
<p>1) you can open it in Preview by double clicking on it. If you (edit and then) try to save such file, you will get an error message as per the picture below. If you locate the file in the Outlook Temp directory in /var and check the permission for the file,
 even if the permissions are "read&amp;write", it is locked, and when you try to unlock, AGAIN, you get the Permissions problem and you still cannot work with this file.</p>
<p>2) There is one way how to use the files though: to right-click on the attachment (without opening it
 in Preview) and directly SAVE (ALL of) it. You have a copy of your attachment saved in your computer, e.g. you can further work with it, but it is VERY counter-intuitive and bothering - most of time, what you want to do is to open any attachement, work on
 it and then save it, fwd it etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is still here in mid-2016, El Capitan, Outlook 15.23 build. It is very annoying and no matter if it is problem on Apple side, or on MS side, it should have already been fixed.</p>

            You cannot save an attachment. Stay out of the Temp folder. In your message select the file and "save". Open the file and make any edit you want and it will save as.<br />
<br />
Outlook Mac does not have the same save as Outlook Windows.<br />

            <p>I'm guessing that you may have gone to 10.11.x directly from 10.6.8, in which case you may not be familiar with Apple's 'protect them from themselves' decision to make User Library folders Hidden. That brainstorm occurred with the release of 10.7 &amp; has persisted
 ever since. As a result you're getting into the Library folder on your Mac HD where you can do some real damage system wide :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a finder window, hold the <strong>Option</strong> key when you open the <strong>
Go</strong> menu. You'll see <em>Library</em> listed directly below your <em>Home</em> listing. [Note: You can press the Option key
<em>while</em> you open the menu or you can press it <em>after</em> opening the menu.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have other options, such as removing the Hidden property from the folder or adding the Library folder to the Finder Sidebar.</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 &#39;Sorry we cannot open this doc as there is a problem with its contents</h2>
                    <p>I would appreciate some help - I have a word 2013 document that will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The error message I am getting is as follows: &nbsp;We are sorry. We can't open this document because we found a problem with its contents.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When I click on the error details - it displays 'No error details'</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can get this doc to open is by selecting to open it 'wordpad' - this is only half the solution as it removes all the pasted in excel graphs from the document which then have to be done over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed I can open the doc in 'word online' and the full document contents and excel graphs are displayed without any issues, but as soon as I select open with word - I get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with different users and on different machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p>

            Hi Greta,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to recover a deleted page. If you are using OneNote for Mac, I would like to share with you the information that OneNote 2016 for Mac lets you recover single pages or entire sections of notes that you have recently
 deleted. While viewing recently deleted notes, you can restore their pages or sections by moving them back to their original notebook or to another location you want. OneNote keeps deleted notes for a period of 60 days, after which they are permanently erased.
 You can view and restore recently deleted notes via <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-notes-in-OneNote-2016-for-Mac-57a5aab4-09ba-4c4e-a6ce-91b56169d5a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            compatibility report - font subscription occurred - unicode characters error -</h2>
                    <p>hi, I am having trouble working on a .docx sent to me that i need to amend and add photos into. this document has tables inserted. i have already posted another questions regarding the problems I'm having making amendments but while trying to sort the issues
 i found that there are compatibility issues when i try to save the .docx to either the same format or .doc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have office 2008 and i am starting to think this could be the root of my problem. any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the report says the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: font substitution has occurred: A font used in this document is not installed. word is substituting text formatted in the font Albertus with Cambria. To change your font substitution settings open the font substitution dialog box</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: The document contains unicode characters that might not display correctly in earlier versions of office: Office X and earlier versions do not support the unicode character set. for more information click the help button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3:&nbsp;font substitution has occurred: A font used in this document is not installed. word is substituting text formatted in the font Verdana Ref with Tahoma. To change your font substitution settings open the font substitution dialog box</p>
<p>
</p><p>support online chat with microsoft have advised me to go onto here as they do not offer any advice on office 2008 anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Jennifer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;You would normally "ignore" font substitution. The substitution will occur only when you display the document. &nbsp;It will go back to normal when someone who has that font installed displays it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;However, in your case, Word is using an old non-Unicode font to perform the substitution. &nbsp;And hence, you have the wrong characters showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest way to resolve this would be to ask the originator for a copy of the fonts they used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not worry about Cambria: that is a Unicode font and always has been. &nbsp;I suspect the issue is an old version of Tahoma. &nbsp;You could make a "permanent" substitution of Verdana Ref to simply "Verdana".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The copy of Verdana supplied with recent versions of Microsoft Office is a Unicode OpenType font that should resolve the issue. Go into your Font folder, select Verdana.ttf and do GetInfo. &nbsp;If it says "TrueType OpenType" in the description, you are good
 to go. &nbsp;Follow the instructions in the Font Substitution dialog to correct the substitution to Verdana and make it permanent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a modern copy of Verdana, ask the originator to send you the font, drag it into your Font folder, then re-start your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>No Ringtone Folder in the Internal Storage - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Ringtone Folder in the Internal Storage</h2>
                    My Microsoft Limia 540, Windows 10, build 14393.51, has no folder allocated for ringtones and hence making or setting custom ringtones is impossible. Also, the Windows app, Ringtone Maker, also fails to do the same. Consequently, I cannot set up any custome
 ringtones. Please suggest

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your post here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand your description correctly than you face an issue when trying to sign in to Xbox Music or videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What device you are using for this signing in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the settings for region, language, date and time on this device. </p>
<p>Try to compare them with the &nbsp;Xbox 360 settings.</p>
<p>And make sure you use the same Microsoft account on all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me a feedback to my question.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Leigh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think when you created your Northwind database you saved it to some place other than the folder you specified.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps just copy it to your desktop and see if you get the same results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If not, you could try creating a new database file and then import all of your objects from this file into that one.</p>

</p><p>We have looked further into this case and found out that the feature to sort the search results by date order is not an option yet. In this case, we highly recommend that you&nbsp;share all of your suggestions through this

<p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure the search results used to be ordered by date as default didn't they?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems absolutely bizarre that the default sort would be anything but date.</p>
<p>It's not as if Microsoft is a start up with an MVP approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add it to the link you send but this seems pretty odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sam.</p>

            The default search should be by Date. But then I had this problem too, and after days of pulling my hair out, discovered what my problem was. Hopefully it solves someone else's issue too.<br />
<br />
I noticed that I accidentally chose to "group by subject." look in the top left corner of your inbox - you might see a little box with the word "from." Right click that and choose "do not group by this field"

            Is it necessary to delete the app? You can just delete your WhatsApp account and it won't connect anymore?<br />
If you talk about deleting the app, its just not possible to do that as this phone can't even be connected to a PC to do some hacking operations :)

    <title>Config365.exe using domain.local instead of domain.org for account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhallford7077  say:</h3>
<h2>            Config365.exe using domain.local instead of domain.org for account</h2>
                    
<p>We use Active Directory locally and recently demoted our Exchange server and moved to Office 365. We originally setup DirSync but have since abandoned its use and moved to the cloud. Prior to demoting the Exchange server when users
 ran Config365.exe everything worked as expected. Now when Config365.exe is run the initial configuration shows successful, but when starting Outlook it fails to start saying the profile is missing some information.</p>
<p>Further investigation reveals that the user's account is using, for example, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (where "ABCDomain" is the name of our AD domain) instead of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (which is the actual email address and O365 account).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Successfully ran the Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365. All green checks.
</li><li>In the local DNS I added a CNAME entry for autodiscover to point to autodiscover.outlook.com to both ABCDomain.local and ABC.org forward lookup zones.
</li><li>Added an ExcludeScpLookup REG_DWORD registry key on the local computer and rebooted the computer.
</li><li>Manually added a profile in Control Panel | Mail, and this is where I discovered it was using the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for the account instead of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. As soon as I correct the account information on this screen the account
 setup completes, and Outlook works correctly and as expected. </li></ol>
<p>So what needs to be done in order to get Config365.exe to plug in the correct account information? While the workaround works, I need a permanent solution. As you can imagine, the fewer steps you give to new users the better, so
 being able to run Config365.exe cleanly is important. Thank you for any help that you can provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update. Since it's a 3rd party tool, we are not able to troubleshoot the issue related to it. The factor that you can manually add a profile indicates that the configuration of the AD and Office 365 are correct.</p>
<p>For this situation, I suggest contact the manufactory of the tool to get the dedicated assistance. Your understanding is appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

    <title>when i type a word it changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arexniba  say:</h3>
<h2>            when i type a word it changes</h2>
                    I have been having this problem for months. 2 of my co-workers thought it would be funny to change some settings on my computer / Word. Whenever I type specific words, then I press space, the word changes.
<br />
For example, if I type "you," then it will change to "I." <br />
<br />
It's very frustrating. I've already tried searching for an answer on Google and playing around with the settings, but I can't figure it out. Help.<br />

    <title>Black Screen After Months of Win10 Use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hillaryclaburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen After Months of Win10 Use</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned my PC on today and it starts up to the regular log-in screen. After I enter my password, it goes to the black screen. I have read on a lot of different fixes for this and have turned to Windows Tech Support as well, with no resolve.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. System restore (tried 3 different dates)</p>
<p>2. Windows Reset</p>
<p>3. Windows Start Up Repair</p>
<p>4. Changed chipset from PCI Express to Onboard in the BIOS menu</p>
<p>5. Looked for the "RunOnce" and "RunOnce32" in the task manager processes and services</p>
<p>6. Looked for "Explorer" and "LocalAppHost" in the task manager processes and services</p>
<p>7. Went into the task manager under details, checked "Hide All Microsoft Services" (was left with an AMD service which led me to believe I may have a graphics issue), restarted</p>
<p>8. Tried to go back to the previous build of Windows</p>
<p>9. Booted into Safe Mode with Networking and had the same issue there</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this has worked. I need to get the data off my PC before I re-install Windows. I have a linux boot USB but it's at work and I won't be there until tomorrow, so I thought I'd check here to see if anyone has gone through all of this and resolved the
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is custom built, ASUS hard drive, Intel i5 3.50GHz processor and an AMD graphics card. 16GB RAM, 128GB SSD for the OS and a 1TB HDD for everything else.

            Are you on a Preview build or the RTM as it shows you just joined the Insiders program? You have me a little confused as you say it goes to a black screen, how do you get to the other things that you have tried if you have a black screen???&nbsp; If you suspect
 GPU try removing the card and using the onboard GPU if it has it.

            I'm not sure what build I am on since I can't look but I have been on Win10 for a few months now and downloaded it as part of the preview program. I am able to CTRL+Shift+Esc into the task manager when I have the black screen. And if you hold shift and
 click restart before signing in, it gives lots of boot and repair options.&nbsp;

<p>That means that explorer.exe is running.&nbsp; So you should also be able to use Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp; See if doing that causes a screen refresh.&nbsp; If it makes it worse you can try something else,&nbsp; e.g. either another application of the same sequence (so another
 screen configuration and possibly a different resolution) or just reverse the first try with Win-P, CursorDown, Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW you could also try using Narrator to get it to tell you what you are not seeing.&nbsp; Win-Enter starts it.&nbsp; Caps Lock Enter&nbsp; shows what it sees in the current context.&nbsp; And if that is "black" too then you will just have to experiment with Narrator the same
 way that someone who is blind would.</p>

            <p>Hello Eduardo</p>
<p>Not sure what you are referring to about the order status not found. I'd suggest use the "Contact Us" link for whichever website you are on when trying to download. When you bought Office 2011, I assume you bought it through EDS participating in the Microsoft
 HUP?</p>
<p>If so, you may want to contact the HUP support here: <a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/contactus.aspx?culture=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/contactus.aspx?culture=en-US</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So are you only having an issue with Outlook not opening? Does Word or Excel open properly? Are you getting any error messages?</p>
<p>Here is a good troubleshooting page for Outlook:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2010/11/outlook-crashes-hangs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeformachelp.com/2010/11/outlook-crashes-hangs/</a></p>

            What is EDS? Is the the academic edition? If yes, it cannot be re-installed.<br />
<br />
The Home &amp; Student is different than Academic and can be re-installed. Academic contains Outlook where H&amp;S does not.<br />
<br />
Please provide more details. What initialization list? I've never heard of this.<br />

<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Do Not Rebuild Identities with Exchange and IMAP accounts. Delete the accounts (this deletes the cache files in Outlook). Do the rebuild then add back accounts. Better yet start over in a new Identity. If the rebuild does not work then you could sync unwanted
 changes or deletions to your server and lose data.</li><li>Make sure you have plenty of free space on your drive. Make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity PLUS 10% free for virtual memory.</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results. This copy will be named like this: Main Identity [Backed up 1-21-2012 13.35]&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<br />
Tip: If your Identity will open, before you rebuild, check "On My Computer"Inbox and Sent folders to be sure they are under the 2GB limit. Generally this is less than 10,000 messages but with large attachments could be less. Make subfolders e.g. Inbox 2011,
 Inbox 2010, Sent 2011, Sent 2010 etc to help reduce the number of messages in a folder. (Check for any large archive folders you might have in addition to Inbox and Sent).<br />

 to download Office 2010 which had bought in 2011.&nbsp; However I have not been able to find out how to download Publisher 2010, which I bought on the same order with Office.&nbsp; I have the Product Key, but that does not help since I can't find where to download the
 program.&nbsp; Can someone help?</p>

<h2>            Environ&#40;&#34;username&#34;&#41; in Access 2010 not working with Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I use Environ("username") as the default value in all of the tables I create in databases as an audit tool to capture who is creating records. All records are created using forms, so the user isn't in the datasheet view of the table, and using the Environ
 command in the default value of a field is a very easy way to capture the user ID. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been doing this for years and it has always worked fine up until a couple weeks ago. I have a user who received a new computer with Office 2010 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit. The only difference between her computer and everyone else's is the 64-bit
 Windows 7. Everyone else has 32-bit Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Environ("username") command still works in a VBA module, but it no longer works in the Default Value property in a table or in the Control Source property on forms. It returns "#Name".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need to figure out how to make this work again. She is only the first user, but pretty soon there will be 40 more, and I will have databases crashing all over the place.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<p><br />
I would guess that this is caused by Access operating in sandbox mode on the new computer.&nbsp; Sandbox mode is controlled by a registry key, and the registry key is different on 64-bit Windows, because 32-bit applications have to go through the Wow6432Node node
 in the registry.&nbsp; If I'm right, either (a) the new computer simply doesn't have the sandbox mode key set to turn it off for Access at all, or (b) the 32-bit registry key was set instead of the 64-bit one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 32-bit Access 2010 running under 64-bit Windows, the key that must be set is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines]<br />
"SandBoxMode"=dword:00000002</p>

</blockquote>
<br />
It's also a very unsafe one as it is extremely easy for a user to change the value of the environmental variable and masquerade as another user.&nbsp; And don't believe anyone who says that this is not the case in later versions of Access.&nbsp; It's been demonstrated
 that it is.<br />
<br />
Use the Windows API call as Scott recommends.&nbsp; It's very easily done.&nbsp; You'll find an example as ChangedRecordDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

            PS:&nbsp; You can call the GetUser() function or similar as the DefaultValue property of a bound control in a form, but not as the DefaultValue property of a column in a table.

            Just to be clear, I agree with Scott and Ken that calling the Windows API to get the user is more reliable than using the Environ() function. You can make up your own mind about whether you should protect against user-spoofing. Regardless of that consideration,
 though, whenever something suddenly stops working I like to know why.

            I already asked our I/S dept to check her Sandbox mode setting and make sure it was set to 2, but I will send them the location to the key in 64-bit Windows you posted above just to be sure. Thanks!

<p>Well if you did not have the problem before and only have it after hardreset I think you should do another one. Do this just to be sure: hard reset, then get on Nokia software update and install the FW and then do another hard reset. That should fix your
 problem.</p>
