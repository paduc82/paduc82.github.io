    <title>iPhone iTunes sync via Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frustrated geoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone iTunes sync via Windows 10</h2>
                    In trying this sync, Windows 10 seems not to have the correct driver to recognise the iPhone. Strangely, I can download photos from the iPhone - so Windows recognises the device outside of iTunes, but the iPhone icon does not appear in iTunes. I understand
 that Windows is 'clever' and uses a widely effective usb mobiles driver - but it doesn't work here. I could sync iTunes on this machine before i did the free W10 upgrade from Windows 8. Any thoughts? I thought about installing the Apple mobile driver but i
 can't see this in a site that seems to be secure ie MS or Apple. Frustrated! Help please!&nbsp;

<div>Thnx for the quick response. I had tried re-installing iTunes a few times - to no avail. I have now tried your suggestion of installing from the exe. file in comparability mode for Windows 8 via a new download of iTunes. Thnx for the suggestion. &nbsp;</div>
<div>No joy.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Still no recognition of the device and no iPhone icon in the top left main screen for iTunes or under the devices drop down. &nbsp;iTunes version is v12.3.1.23 x64.</div>
<div>I used to get a trust? message on my iPhone when connecting and also the device driver would auto instal. Neither happens now.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wondered whether Kaspersky was blocking recognition but it didn't before and I can download photos to the laptop so I think not.</div>
<div>Any ideas?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>iTunes setup on Windows 10 is a relatively common problem, not that that is of much help to you, because I haven't yet seen a common solution, and neither Microsoft or Apple seems to know what the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is clearly some conflict that is blocking the iPhone from connecting to ITunes. &nbsp;As I only use OS X connection for Apple devices, I can only make some general suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure your security software isn't blocking the connection. Try temporarily disabling any 3rd Party security software to test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The iPhone normally has to be instructed to accept any PC it tries to link to as a "trusted device" before it will allow communication via iTunes. So, if that hasn't been set up, the iPhone won't allow communication to take place.</p>

            <p>Happiness. Resolved largely due to Andre at Apple Support. The problem was that the mobile device driver included in Windows 10 did not work with the iPhone. I tried to download a version of the Apple driver but couldn't find a 'trusted' version &nbsp;on Apple's
 website; also Apples guidance has not been updated for W10. Anyway, just go to the Apple folder under programs, right click and select update driver and there's an auto installation of the correct driver and the sync works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx to the Community and Apple Support.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>try as below. You should only have to do this once and syncing should work thereafter. If you still have problems, call Apple support but you'll probably need to speak with a senior tech support person. You are right though, the key is to find the Apple
 Device folder under 'Device Manager' from within control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it works for you.</p>

            If you go under Settings, Device, Device Manager and then look for Portable, you should see your apple iphone and can click update driver.&nbsp; It worked immediately for me.&nbsp; Good luck.

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death &#40;BSOD&#41; while using Robocopy</h2>
                    I was using Robocopy to copy all files in my user directory less than a month old to a USB backup drive. I have never had any problems with this drive before, have never gotten the blue screen on this computer before, and have never used Robocopy before.
 I was using it from a command prompt, not a batch file. <br />
<br />
Machine: HP Pavilion dv6, with 8G ram (notebook) <br />
CPU: Core i7-2670 QM <br />
B/U drive is 2T Western Digital Elements. <br />
OS is Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium with SP1. <br />
<br />
I would be happy to upload the dump files if I knew where to find them. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Avast or AVG? I don't think I have AVG. I got mad at them a couple of years ago and switched to Avast. If I have AVG I would like to uninstall it.
<br />
<br />
I've been running Avast on my computers for a couple of years and have never gotten a BSOD. Why should it all of a sudden happen now, the first time I used Robocopy? I'm no scientist but I'd say the problem appears to be Robocopy, not Avast.<br />

<p>Question:&nbsp; I have mp3 and other media located in files<u> not in the 'Library'.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A main folder was set up previously in WMP with a sub-folder (I have misplaced how I did this action)</p>
<p>Since then I have added sub-folders to this main folder in the C drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Currently the added sub-folders&nbsp;under the main folder do not show up in WMP,&nbsp;only the first&nbsp;sub-folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Search only searches in the Library and these media items are not in the Library. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I need to do to show all the sub-folders under the main folder in WMP?</p>

<p>There is no list of contacts as well. It is only history of chats/calls.<br />
I had in many contacts multiple phone numbers per contacts. Seems all gone and now only way to make call on phone number is by taping it on key pad.<br />
<br />
Audio codes seems has been changed and during phone calls when my phone is on loud speaker and when I'm fiddling on my screen some noses are passed over microphone.</p>
<p>Whole interface has been completely changed with ringtone as well.</p>
<p>This is complete disaster !!! :(</p>

            I'll try my best to be civil.... The abomination that is the version of Skype for iOS&nbsp;released on June 27, 2017 must be completely wiped off from the face of the Earth, all copies of the source code destroyed, screenshots used as a teaching tool on how
 not&nbsp;to design a&nbsp;user interface. This is my considerate opinion as a&nbsp;professional software architect and developer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Niemriku, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Windows appstore won&#39;t let me dowload apps or games.</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if it's because I set up my windows 10 pc with a gmail account but the windows app store will not let me download any apps or games. It won't even give me the option of installing all it does is show it's loading. Also it won't let me update
 any apps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone has any tips or can help me then that would be awesome!</p>

<p>You're connected to Xbox Live, right? Can you play online? Do you have enough storage on your hard drive? You're clearly not connecting to the cloud for some unknown reason. If you know your account details, I recommend that you delete and re-download your
 account before a factory reset. However, if that doesn't work a factory reset might be your only option.</p>

            <p>There is no such page because user access controls and permissions is a very complicated topic. You should not have attempted to alter access permissions without first doing substantial research on the web to be sure you understand what you are changing
 and how that will affect your computer in future. And even then, you should make an image backup of your hard disk before you start, so that if things don't go well you can always go back to the way they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to do that research now. Be thorough and be very sure you understand what you are about to do.</p>

<h2>            pro vs. ultimate&#58; Is the ONLY difference between Win7Pro and Win7Ult the Bitlocker and Multi language support&#63;</h2>
                    I have Vista Ultimate and want to upgrade. It looks like to me that Vista Ultimate shold be upgraded to Win7Pro if your not using or nededing Bitlocker or Multi-language support. I can only find the simplified feature compairison and it makes me worried
 that I could be making a mistake. Ultimate in Vista has features like support for animated wallpapers. Will that be a feature included in the Pro version of Windows 7 or do I have to keep on the path of Ultimate.<br />

            Its a combination of things. BitLocker data provides protection on internal and external drives, DirectAccess provides seamless connectivity to your corporate network.&nbsp; (requires Windows Server 2008 R2), Decrease time branch office workers wait to open
 file across the network with BranchCache. (requires Windows Server 2008 R2), Prevent unauthorized software from running with AppLocker. Also, features that were once available Windows Vista Ultimate such as Dreamscene and Ultimate Extras are not longer a part
 of Windows 7. Also, you can not preserve these features when upgrading from Windows Vista Ultimate to Windows 7, they will be removed.

<h2>            Can&#39;t see otf fonts</h2>
                    Good evening:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just purchase a new computer with Windows 8 pre installed. The thing is when I open my corel draw 12 any OTF fonts appear. I had had these problem before, in a previous machine, on december last year, with the windows XP and the famous KB2753842.
 I solved this trouble very fast with the windows patch of december 20th. However, in spite of adding this patch (KB2753842) for windows 8 the trouble stills there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have a clue of what could be wrong?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot</div>

    <title>Support for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 RAW photos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Support for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 RAW photos</h2>
                    <p>Hi - even the newest update to the Camera Codec Pack hasn't added support for possibly the most popular Panasonic Lumix camera supporting RAW file format, and this camera has been on the market for 1 year now. When is support for this model expected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing that the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ150 is already supported, which is practically the same camera but with a different lens, it shouldn't be hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>That's an interesting plugin with a lot of good features, and does support the DMC-FZ200 camera. Make want to look more at that for other functionality, including&nbsp; autorotate of JPGs on Win7 platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, really I was looking for a codec update that Works for both Windows 8 and Windows RT, perhaps I should have posted the question in the RT section instead then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, Panasonic has an old Lumix RAW plugin also, designed for Windows XP/7 and not updated since end of 2010, but testing it on a Win8 machine, it still allows preview and opening of RAW Photos from the built-in desktop apps, but obviously not from
 the modern UI apps (e.g. Photo Viewer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long term what I'm looking for is the ability to edit these RAW Photos from both WinRT and Win8 using the same Photo editor across both platforms, e.g. an app like Fotor - which does have ability to open RAW files, but clearly can't make out the DMC-FZ200
 files correctly. Other modern UI apps using any built in codecs should be able to do this though I suppose?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Allan</p>

            <p>Allan,</p>
<p>I don't know of any Windows Store Apps that currently support what you need - so RT is out at this point. The folks at FOTOR might be quicker to add support than Microsoft. You could try writing their support folks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I find the Surface RT too slow for any serious photo editing.. YMMV</p>

                    When I opened skype today, it asked me if I wanted to try the newest version of skype, tuned to windows 10.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anybody knew if it were the windows 10 app skype, or an updated version of the installed skype?

<p>Ah, okay, then I assume it is the windows 10 app.<br />
<br />
I have tried it before, but I don't think it is very user friendly, as it does not have the same menu system that windows has been using for the last 22 years.</p>
<p>Maybe it is generelly for the windows 10 apps, or just part of the skype app.<br />
Anyway, if I have to spend 20 minuttes trying to find the settings menu, and even googling the issue doesn't give the right answer, then I really don't think I will be using the app before the standard / real skype program is removed.</p>
<p>

<p>Running the Windows Update troubleshooter from the article you linked, it first prompted me to run as Administrator, then checked for pending updates, then said:&nbsp; "An unexpected error has occurred. The troubleshooting wizard can't continue."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the specific KB4090914 patch from the catalog, which also failed as I specified above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the most recent KB4093107 and it failed with: "The update is not applicable to your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the fix for windows file corruption, and that seems to have fixed it - I can run Windows Updates now. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Dragons World connection issue</h2>
                    Ever since Tuesday's update I have been having connection errors with Dragons World popping up Server error 1002 Stable connection error. Problem is I have a stable connection to the internet, and I don't know how to rest Dragons World without losing all
 my game accomplishments including the tokens I purchased yesterday before the Server error. Has this happened to anyone else, and if so, how did you fix it??

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Which updates you have installed prior to this issue?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you get any error message when Netlogon service unable to start?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
 Next. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click Finish.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>When you perform System Restore to restore
 the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>System Restore: frequently
 asked questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may configure the machine in clean boot state, download &amp; install the updates manually from the Microsoft Download Center.<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Clean boot will start Windows7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please ensure that the computer is set
 to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>

<p>Whilst video card drivers seem to be common culprits for hibernation problems, in this case&nbsp;you might not find any problems when you check Control Panel, Device manager to check &amp; update your video card driver.&nbsp; Do look at the other entries as other drivers
 can also have strange effects.</p>
<p>As it is only happening on battery I'd say you need to check your BIOS first to make sure it is not a setting there that disables hibernation from battery power and then check the settings in your Control panel, Power options, {active Power plan settings},
 Advanced settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the Advanced settings dialog, there is a button for&nbsp;Show setttings that are not shown - click on this first to make sure that you can see &amp; check all the settings or you can't be sure of what you might have missed.</p>

<h2>            Activity feed not updating and other Dashboard problems &#40;region specific&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox Support is already on this case (ticket number 1277732238), but I was instructed to create a forum topic for this for better understanding and keeping track of the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that when the Xbox One console's location is set to Hungary, a number of Xbox Live features don't work on the Dashboard. Please note that setting the console to another region (UK or USA for example) makes them work perfectly but it's not
 a permanent solution since I live in Hungary.</p>
<p><strong>The problems are the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Activity Feed doesn't display Friends' Achievements, shared clips and screenshots. Only status updates.
</li><li>If a Friend is playing an Xbox 360 game, the game title only shows "??? (Xbox 360)" instead of the title of the game.
</li><li>"Popular with Friends" section is empty on both the Dashboard and in the Friends app.
</li><li>Profile Showcase doesn't display, and nothing can be shared onto the Showcase (neither Achievements nor clips and screenshots).
</li><li>I cannot share Achievements, clips or screenshots anywhere. Can't post them to the Activity Feed, to Twitter, OneDrive etc. The only error message I get is "Something went wrong".
</li></ul>
<p><strong>There are a number of things I have already tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Restarting the console </li><li>Deleting and re-downloading my profile </li><li>Restoring the console to the default settings </li><li>Connecting the console to various networks with various ISPs, both wired and wireless
</li><li>Creating a brand new profile with a new Microsoft account to see if the problems persist with that as well
</li></ul>
<p>None of the above has solved the problem that's why I contacted Xbox Support several times. Also, many players in Hungary report the same things (most of them actually), I'll try to get them write here to confirm the errors. Also please note that all of
 the above features work flawlessly in the Xbox One SmartGlass app, both on Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 which makes the whole problem even more mysterious.</p>
<p>My profile has been created in 2004 in another region and was migrated to Hungary in 2010, when Xbox Live became officially available here. It is possible that it might cause problems, however, as stated above, creating a brand new profile with a brand new
 Microsoft account didn't solve the problem as well.</p>
<p>I have submitted photos to Support via email but if it is necessary I can post them here as well.</p>

<p>I have same problems with a migrated profile, also I would like to copy my problems.</p>
<p>"Hey there,</p>
<p>Got some annoying issue on Hungarian dashboard, and I think these are unacceptable on this "next generation".</p>
<p>These bugs or issues are the following:</p>
<p>Party chat: not working, there is no circle near my gamertag, cant do anything, unplug, plug doesnt working. Only restart. Turn off xbox, turn on, just to be able to party chat with my friends. I have to do this once, twice every day.</p>
<p>Friends: "Sorry we are unable to show your friendlist" I get this message every day, only reloading helps, sometimes even 2nd or 3rd try I get similar result.
</p>
<p>Also system thinks and showing who is coming online, "XY is online" disappear, its like forgot to announce that. Sometimes works, sometimes not. I didnt edit anything at settings. Showing friends / favourites are enabled, all my friends are favourites.</p>
<p>Achievements: I want to check my achievements and I get error message, cant read that. 2-3 reloading needed to be able to see my achievements and sometimes loading time sooooo long, even worse than x360.</p>
<p>At the "Friends" section there are popular with friends, I dont see anything there. Got 100++ friends.</p>
<p>Checking my friendlist, those users, who are playing 360 games only showing they are playing with "??? (Xbox 360)"</p>
<p>I hope I was enough clear to state my problems with dashboard. If there are mistakes in my post, please ignore it, english is not my native language.</p>
<p>Looking forward for some replies.</p>
<p>Best regards,"</p>

<h2>            My account won&#39;t connect to xbox live</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem in the past few weeks : when I turned on my xbox one, my account didn't connect to xbox live, so I couldn't play the games I bought online.&nbsp;It did that about half of the time.&nbsp;Then it started to do it more often and I checked on the internet, someone said it could be solved by removing my account from the console, turning it off and then add my account again.&nbsp;I tried that and it didn't work.&nbsp;Now I can't play any games or go on youtube or explorer.&nbsp;Everytime I try to start a game it says "synchronization..." and it never ends, even for the games of which I&nbsp;have CDs. I basically can't do anything right now...&nbsp;When I&nbsp;click on "connect to the xbox live" it does nothing. What can I do please?</p>

<h2>            no UPnP or NAT options in router</h2>
                    
<p>Hello dear reader and helper<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so yeah.... my xboxlive connections disconnects often for no aparent reason<br />
in many games, when searching for lobbys or "games in progress", seldom, if at all, games show up that i can join.<br />
<br />
i cant join xboxlive partys...... but sometimes i can....<br />
i can chat along with my friends until i get only thrown out of the party..... not from xbox live<br />
(nobody kicks me)<br />
<br />
so i did some research..... awesome thorough support here<br />
<br />
so i do the "test connection" thing on my "xbox dashboard",<br />
and it tells me "you CAN connect, but changing your NAT settings will help"<br />
<br />
so i goto my router..... no NAT settings OR UpnP settings.<br />
i DID though, foreward the needed ports for xbox.<br />
<br />
i didnt help though.....<br />
<br />
<br />
so uhm.... am i going to be limited until i buy a new better router ?<br />
or has anyone have a clue as to what my next step should be ?<br />
<br />
