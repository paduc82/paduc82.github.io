                    <p>Where can I find the definition of the various file attributes? I've seen these:&nbsp;HSDRNl(ell? or eye?). Perhaps there are others.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t let me enter a password</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mom has Windows Vista, and today when she went to turn on the computer, at the Vista welcome screen, when it prompted her for a password, it wouldn't let her enter anything.&nbsp; If she goes into Repair mode during the bootup, it will let her enter it then,
 and will accept it.&nbsp; She hasn't changed it recently nor has anyone else.&nbsp; She's tried booting up in Safe Mode and has also checked the keyboard for stuck keys and dirt.&nbsp; She's elderly, doesn't know the product # and does not have a recovery disc of any kind.&nbsp;
 For some reason Vista simply will not let her enter anything in the box for the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anything be done? </p>

    <title>windows 10 not connected to a network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterhorrobin  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 not connected to a network</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am currently living in a temp abode where the wireless router is not quite able to provide enough signal to connect directly to the Desktop pc. Recently upgraded to windows 10 with no apparent issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problem I thought I will simply connect to the router with my cell phone &amp; usb tether to the pc. Connection was successful, internet connection via edge, chrome and other programs no problem.
</p>
<p>Also tried connecting to a cellphone WiFi hotspot. Connection was successful, internet connection via edge, chrome and other programs no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is the kicker with either of the above I cannot login using the microsoft account error returned is "not currently connected to a network"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot update windows as "not connected to a network"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet I am obviously connected to the internet so why will it not update? is this a Android compatibility issue? Do I need to connect directly the wireless router or install a WiFi expander to enable connection to said router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to create a home network group of some sort? Rather than a bunch of individual users some Admin and some not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now also seem to be blocked from making some basic changes such as changing the default audio device, can select any of the available options but no changes occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried all of the fixes &amp; diagnostics that I could find posted on line, short of rolling back to win7 or a full reinstall of win10, no difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IT team at my work have not been able to resolve this either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an update being worked on to resolve this? and where on microsoft can I download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

            Hi Kathy
<br />
<br />That app can be used to take photos and videos using the buil- in webcam on a laptop or a webcam connected to a PC
<br />
<br />For example, you can take a photo of yourself to use as a profile Pic on a forum, or take a photo of a document you need to send off for ID purposes, there are lots of uses for that App . . .

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to get camera app: 
<br />
<br />Search for Windows camera app in Windows store
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-camera/9wzdncrfjbbg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-camer...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you need to show your desktop as viewing in camera video: 
<br />- Use Windows 10's built-in Game Bar. 
<br />- Windows 10 has its own built-in screen recorder, intended for recording games. ... - - Click 'Start recording' or tap [Windows]+[Alt]+[R] to start, 
<br />- Use the same shortcut when you've finished.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved. 
<br />

<p>Can't disagree more ChimpZealot, in mine and many others experience powerlines are very good and far superior to wireless. JayJager Powerlines are plug and play so it must be something basic really. can you put a PC on the powerline adapter instead of the
 Xbox, does that connect ok?</p>
<p>Remember that if you plug them into a power strip that has a surge protector it can block the powerline signal, do all of the LED's on the powerlines indicate a connection?</p>

<p>I have no issues plugging it in to my laptop or desktop.All the LED's are green and it's not plugged in to a power strip. As far as the Xbox, I'm getting a "Can't get IP address" error, but when I go to enter one manually there is already one there.</p>

<p>I'll be honest I've seen some of the bigger named powerline adapters have issues with Xbox, certainly Belkins, maybe Netgears as well then, your better off with other brands, in the UK I recommend VeseNet or Solwise , Devlo are also good.</p>
<p>Ok so the powerlines are fine and it doesn't like the Xbox then I've seen things like this fixed in firmware, are you using the latest?

<p>I've got the same power line adapter and have had the same problems. Netgear's tech support was awful. Did you end up getting another adapter that worked?</p>

<h2>            WIN10 search not returning results from indexed drive</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 taskbar (Cortana) search is not returning results from an indexed drive.&nbsp; Both the C and D drives are indexed (specific Locations) and task bar search returns results from everywhere but the D drive.&nbsp; However, if I search via file manager search
 returns all the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried</p>
<ul>
<li>rebuilding the index</li><li>stating and stopping the service</li><li>running the troubleshooter (find a permissions problem)</li></ul>
<p>The machine is fully patched with the latest release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps and check if the issue can be fixed.

<strong>Indexing Options</strong> and reset the index locations identically to the clean installed state and rebuilt the index. Hopefully I will be able to edit locations later. This is just to get it working first. Waited a bit to get the index rebuilt completely.
<br />
<br />
2. Disable Windows Search service from services.msc (not just stop, you have to disable it and then stop it)<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search </strong>and move the Data folder to somewhere else. Move it to the desktop. The search database is stored there.
<br />
<br />
4. Reboot PC.<br />
5. Re-enabled the Windows Search service<br />
6. Go to <strong>Indexing Options</strong> from the control panel and it will already start indexing the drive. It recreated the Data folder inside
<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search directory</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hope this post is helpful. Do&nbsp;get back to us with the results and we'll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; But, no joy in Mudville (poetic reference)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did all the items you suggested and the search results are still the same.&nbsp; Nothing from Cortanta (taskbar search) and full results from file manager search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I called the answer desk and one of your brethren spent 30 or 40 minutes trying to make it work and ended up reinstalling the latest windows release and still no joy.&nbsp; We did loose the phone connection so we never finished but I was following
 what she was doing pretty carefully and it took care of the file she was looking to replace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the search worked correctly when the machine was running Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one peculiarity in the situation is that the second drive is an SD storage card which is formatted exFAT.&nbsp; Its difficult to imagine this being the issue since Cortanta uses the same search engine as the file manager but I report it for what its worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what next?</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard paired but no input received on Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a windows update on May 2, 2016 my bluetooth devices (keyboards) so far stop working after a certain amount of Idle time. I know its not the keyboards because i used multiple bluetooth keyboards and the same thing happens to them. I've already
 did an online chat session and a remote access with Microsoft but the only solution they could come up with is reset my computer (typical). That will not resolve the issue because after windows updates my computer after the reset I know it would cause the
 same issue. I cannot revert my computer to a system restore point because for some reason once I stated with this computer the system restore was disabled so no points were created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 (or at least THIS specific computer) does not have the power management tab under properties of a device so I can not access the "allow computer to turn off this device to save power" check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I KNOW there is alternative solutions to solving this bluetooth issue without resting my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information would be much obliged. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience caused. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know the make and mode of the computer. Also, the model of the Bluetooth keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, the passcode of the Bluetooth keyboard could be found in the manual that came along with it. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer or refer to the manual on how to locate the passcode. Also, the devices will not accept the code if you
 do not enter the code within a specific time frame, requiring you to start again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ensure to install any pending updates on the system to keep the computer up to date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to these articles.</span></p>

            <p>Hi carolcox43,</p>
<p>
</p><p>are you not able to sign in to your device using your live account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>try to confirm if your account is still active by visiting the support website
<a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com/</a> </p>
<p>if you are able to sign in using your password means no issue with the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>lets go back to the issue if its an issue signing in to the device in the welcome page of windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>try to use the on screen keyboard - just look for this logo in the welcome page
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3f8a7a6-9cfc-426f-84dc-fa0b50c7f764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3f8a7a6-9cfc-426f-84dc-fa0b50c7f764" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and if you are successful in logging in meaning the problem is your keyboard that you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps</p>

            The account has not been hacked and according to Microsoft they haven't solved the problem but they are looking into it, but they can't give me a time scale so it could be for ever.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the Windows Defender settings is blocking the printer access. To properly isolate this issue, you can
<strong>temporarily&nbsp; deactivate the Windows Defender</strong>, and test the printer.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have provided an article below to troubleshoot printer issues in Windows 10:<br />

<br />
If the issue persists, kindly verify the exact error message that you encountered.<br />
<br />
Kindly post back if you have further concerns.

<h2>            People app and messagging are not syncing with Facebook</h2>
                    [Splitting into it's own thread]<br />
<br />
Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have the same problem that the people app and messaging app are not syncing with Facebook properly. I have removed and re-added the connection and re-installed the apps as well. Re-installing solved my connection problem until the next reboot. Then my people
 app showed all contacts offline and the messaging app states" we can't send a message at the moment". My online status in the messaging app is set to "not connected" but I am unable to change it since the options are all greyed out.<br />
<br />
I would be happy to receive assistance that enables full functionality for the social networking through windows 8 apps.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            <div>Hi buuky,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities. From your problem description I understand that you’re unable to sync Facebook with People and Messaging app and receive ”we can't send a message at the moment”. Please correct me I have misunderstood.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Which antivirus application are you using?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s try these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>I would recommend you to download and run the app troubleshooter in the link.<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
It also seems that it is a known issue that we’re unable to connect Facebook account through People and Messaging App. You may refer the post of Joe-C .Forum Moderator replied on July 11 2012 from the link below.<br />
I can’t see Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr content when viewing from my apps<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/i-cant-see-facebook-twitter-or-flickr-content-when/5621e57d-49d3-4efc-ac93-340fcb5c0833">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/i-cant-see-facebook-twitter-or-flickr-content-when/5621e57d-49d3-4efc-ac93-340fcb5c0833</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Follow the steps mentioned in the following Microsoft help article.<br />
What to do if you have problems with an app<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform System File to fix the corrupted system file and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Key + C” to open Charms Bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type ‘<b>sfc /scannow</b>’ without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>

            <p>Hey Ganesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;for your response!</p>
<p>Maybe I should add to the problem description that&nbsp;the People app is actually listing notifications from Facebook. The "What's new" section also lists the latest news from my friend list/subscriptions.
</p>
<p>So it looks like the problem revolves entirely around&nbsp;Facebook's messaging/chat&nbsp;function where I am unable to connect to&nbsp; Facebook from my Windows 8 apps. Re-installing the Windows 8 social networking apps fixes the problem temporarily every time until the
 next reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my answers to your questions:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;I am currently running Windows Defender - the default Windows 8 AV application.</p>
<p>- Method 1: The app troubleshooter found one issue where&nbsp;my "display driver might be out of date". Continuing with a scan for hardware changes the troubleshooter concludes" Hardware changes might not&nbsp;have been detected"&nbsp;Considering that everything listed
 in the device manager&nbsp;checks out and that my Windows 8 is a clean install, I am inclined to think this is not related. Also running the troubleshooter did not affect the problem.</p>
<p>- Method 2: I checked the post you mentioned and confirmed that Facebook is properly connected to my live account and all the checkboxes are ticked.</p>
<p>- Method 3: There are no updates available for the Messaging and People apps. All app licenses are synced as well.</p>
<p>- Method 4: System File Checker completed without any errors or "integrity violations"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally I double-checked and verified that I have given Microsoft apps all permissions in my Facebook account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform the followings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure all Windows updates are current. If not, install all current updates.</span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Change from Microsoft account to local account. Then change back to Microsoft account.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Create a user account. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to un-install the “peole” application from&nbsp;New User Interface. Then re-install it from “Store” and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
a.&nbsp;Press “Windows key” from keyboard.<br />
b.&nbsp;Right click on the “Mail” application and select “Uninstall” option.<br />
c.&nbsp;Once the “Mail” application is un-installed restart the computer.<br />
d.&nbsp;Press “Windows key + W” and select “Store” option.<br />
e.&nbsp;Then type “Mail” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
f.&nbsp;Select “People” application and install.<br />
g.&nbsp;Check if this fixes the issue once the “peoplel” application is installed.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform the followings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure all Windows updates are current. If not, install all current updates.</span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Change from Microsoft account to local account. Then change back to Microsoft account.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to un-install the “peole” application from&nbsp;New User Interface. Then re-install it from “Store” and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
a.&nbsp;Press “Windows key” from keyboard.<br />
b.&nbsp;Right click on the “Mail” application and select “Uninstall” option.<br />
c.&nbsp;Once the “Mail” application is un-installed restart the computer.<br />
d.&nbsp;Press “Windows key + W” and select “Store” option.<br />
e.&nbsp;Then type “Mail” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
f.&nbsp;Select “People” application and install.<br />
g.&nbsp;Check if this fixes the issue once the “peoplel” application is installed.<br />

Sorry, but this is just another lame attempt to try and cover up the fact that there seems to be a deeper bug in the people/mail/messaging/calendar app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was asked to send in my log files, still no answer to that.</p>
<p>People who post their questions here regarding the mentioned problems are fully aware of the possible steps to solve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any of those 3 methods (actually it is 3 steps and not 3 individual methods) would work, we wouldnt be here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try again.</p>

            <p>For what it's worth, method 2 worked for me (permanently, for about a week now). I previously tried all other suggestions, to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first removed all connected accounts via live.com, then switched user to local account, logged off and on, added accounts via the People app, switched user to Microsoft account, logged off and on.</p>

            I may have found a new twist.&nbsp; I wasn't sure why my people and messaging started working correctly, but it had.&nbsp; It worked correctly for about a week, but then I used Skype for a video call.&nbsp; The people/messaging has ceased to operate correctly since then.&nbsp;
 Rebooted, etc., but since the Skype call People shows "Your contacts are offline."&nbsp; I will try the uninstall/reinstall option again as a temporary fix.&nbsp; I didn't check the "What's new" feed to see if it was updating.

            <p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry for my delayed reply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- All the latest Windows Updates are installed</p>
<p>- changing to local account and back to Microsoft account did not change anything</p>
<p>- I reinstalled the people app once again from the store and in conjunction with the entry from CannonLewis at the link you posted did the trick for me for maybe 5 days - today I noticed that I'm once again unavailable to us the messaging app as it is offline
 with all options greyed out nor am I able to see the online status of my facebook contacts in the people app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else we can do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have this exact issue.</p>
<p>I've been looking around the internet and I've noticed that a LOT of other people are experiencing this.</p>
<p>My Messaging and People apps won't work with Facebook or Twitter. At all.</p>
<p>I can see the live tile on my People app showing the faces of my contacts, but when I click it, it is empty and tells me to sync my accounts.</p>
<p>When I do, I get a confirmation saying that it may take a few minutes to get everything set up, but it never gets "set up"...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't use Messenger, either. It never shows any of my contacts as online even though I check on the actual Facebook website and notice at least 30 online friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's extremely disappointing--this is one of the main reasons I shelled out $40 to upgrade on my laptop. For the social integration (that I love on my Windows Phone and couldn't wait to get on PC)</p>
<p>But here I am--and there it is. Not working.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are any surefire fixes to this issue.</p>
<p>I have rebooted, switched to a local account and back, uninstalled and reinstalled the apps...</p>
<p>I have even refreshed my PC.</p>
<p>At one point in time, I got the apps to work until I restart my computer and they just went back to their original next-to-useless ways.</p>

<h2>            error code 8C15000C</h2>
                    when i go to the game store to look at games with xbox live gold and i find a game and click on it it gives me this error code. I went to xbox error help and the solution it gave me was that the billing address or postal code is incorrect. I checked the
 billing address and postal code and everything was fine.

 with a persistent message on your desktop. You’ll also get periodic notifications that Windows isn’t genuine. That means your PC may no longer be able to obtain optional updates or downloads requiring genuine Windows validation.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do I go from here? Is My hard drive going to be wiped?<br />
<br />
Most of all, Will i have to wipe my hard drive to Install a Store-bought version of Windows 7? If I CAN upgrade it, will it wipe my registry, So most of my programs won't work?

            Sorry, Microsoft does not support an upgrade from Windows 7 RC to the final version. You can backup your files and settings with Windows Easy Transfer (http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer) before reinstalling XP or Vista, and then move to
 the final release version of Windows 7 if you wish.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Windows 7 Upgrade software requires XP or Vista to be installed first, if you have a qualifying version of Windows (XP or Vista) you can install it on your computer and buy an Upgrade version.&nbsp; The Upgrade software doesn't allow an upgrade version of Windows
 7 on a blank hard drive to be activated.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to insert a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the Upgrade disk software requires the actual qualifying operating system to be installed.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system with a genuine license, then you cannot use the Upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "Full version" Windows 7 license.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In summary: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. The Upgrade software needs a qualifying Windows operating system (XP/Vista)to be installed.
<br />
2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated.
<br />
3. To upgrade, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.
<br />
4. When the setup menu appears, select Custom (advanced) to initiate a clean install procedure, or Upgrade if you are upgrading.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Following Message From Microsoft Was On The Download Page For The Release Candidate:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please note: All users of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (including Windows Vista users who have upgraded to the Release Candidate) must do a clean installation of Windows 7 RTM. Please keep this is mind as you consider downloading the Release Candidate as
 opposed to waiting for the general availability release. <br />
Thanks again for your help in reaching this important milestone. We hope that you will join us in testing the RC and finishing Windows 7!

                    <p>Can you first answer the question why Pavan_N. stopt helping me with my other post:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/62986095-6591-4a30-9537-91da06fbfe9e">Windows 10 could not be installed because this PC has an unsupported disk layout for UEFI
 Firmware 1511 build</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done via access advanced startup a system restore with a image backup made within w10. That did not resolve the windows update problem to install 1511 build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to change the UEFI system reserved partition. It was 350 mb and I changed it to 1000 mb, because I found on the internet that 100 mb was not enouph for to update windows 10 1511 build. 1511 build needs 400 mb. It did not resolve my problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dism and sfc /scannow working again after system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to find the solution why the system does not want to install the next 1511 build?</p>

</p><p>I know now why os did not update to the next windows update 1511 built.</p>
<p>It was because my bios section boot was UEFI. </p>
<p>I did not know that UEFI has a conflict with Windows Update. </p>
<p>I changed it to old boot (UEFI is the new boot), I selected at section boot in bios ''Device control'':
</p>
<p>UEFI and Legacy and OpRom. </p>
<p>Also: ''Boot from storage devices'' changed to both UEFI first</p>
<p>
After this windows updated into 1511 built.

                    <p>Up until yesterday where nothing else has changed (internet, same laptop, etc) I was able to message someone. Now I can from my iPhone skype account but one contact won't go through with any messages and only says "sending".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted, reinstalled, everything! Still same problem. Network and security protocols have not changed.&nbsp;</p>

            I've signed out of the macOS desktop app and signed in with a different Skype account. &nbsp;Now I can send messages from this account. &nbsp;When I log back in using the original account, it still doesn't work. &nbsp;Could there be somethign screwed up locally with
 the profile associated with this account, or a problem on the server side?

            I am having the exact same problem, my messages do not send to a few contacts. It is really aggravating you would think they would have an update by now to fix this bug. I am sure it is happening to a lot of people but they probably don't come here to
 complain.

            I am also having this issue between myself and a Kindle user.&nbsp; I have Skype on both my iPhone6 and desktop, neither is receiving the messages sent from the Kindle user.&nbsp; He is also not receiving my messages.&nbsp; He says I appear to be offline to him.&nbsp; We
 call do voice calls, but no messaging.&nbsp; The problem was fixed yesterday (Feb 13th) for just one day, and now as of this morning, is back to not working again.

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently there was a known issue with sending messages, however this has been fixed already. If signing out and signing in does not resolve the issue, please proceed with uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Make sure to restart the device before reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on what will happen.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Try doing a hard reset on the console. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the front of the console for 10 seconds or until it shuts down completely. &nbsp;Let it sit for a couple of minutes then power it back on. &nbsp;If that doesn't work next try deleting your profile and
 re-downloading it. &nbsp;Let us know how it goes. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

                    ok, for those still having issues with the store not opening / giving the server error.. I found out that if the account associated with the store isn't verified it will block you from using it.. goto charm , settings , account, and click on the little
 link to the right to verify your account .. then close the store in the background, reopen it and BAM store will work as it should

That's so sad for that file.&nbsp; Was the actual situation any more descriptive than that or did you just walk in and your computer despondently said (over and over) that the ogg.dll file was missing?</p>
