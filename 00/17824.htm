<h2>            Account Closed because Payment Dec.lined</h2>
                    I had to cancel a credit card because of possible fraud.&nbsp; This card was attached to my Skype account, and when the payment was refused, I did not realize it until after the account was closed.&nbsp; How can I change my credit card and renew my account with
 all my contacts and correspondence?

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I solved this problem by stopping the processes for <br />
1) Google Desktop<br />
2) Start Menu X<br />
3) ClipX<br />
I am not sure which was causing the error but I think it may have been my old faithful Google Desktop.<br />
<br />
I am getting this same error on attempted installation of Office 2013. <br />
I have office 2007 installed. <br />
<br />
The first suggestion is to remove Office 2007, but what happens if </p>
<p>I still can't install Office 2013? I will have no office installation! I would</p>
<p>really rather not uninstall my Office until the new one is working,</p>
<p>especially since it is clearly not working now. <br />
<br />
There is at least one responses in this thread which reports that</p>
<p>removing previous versions does not solve the problem, so I would</p>
<p>not want to remove the previous version (2007). <br />
<br />
I tried a "clean boot" by turning off many non-microsoft services to <br />
no avail. </p>

<p>In order to be able to try Office 2013 Click-to-Run I would need to have <br />
installed Office 2013.<br />
<br />
However, my problem is that I *can not install Office 2013*. <br />
<br />
How does one get to become a "<span>Community Moderator";-)?
<br />
<br />
I note that there is another thread where one "community moderator" <br />
asks the same question as I - how do I install Office 2013 - and another <br />
"community moderator" responds with a link to how to *uninstall</span>* <span>
<br />
office 2013! <br />
<br />
There appear to be so many people with this problem, having paid a lot of <br />
money to a blue chip company to get zilch, or worse - a lot of aggravation -<br />
that it might be worthwhile for a</span><span> tort lawyer to start a class action suit.
<br />
<br />
I feel especially aggrevied since I did not want to purchase the software<br />
in the first place but was forced to due to the continuous "upgrade" path<br />
of this company. How do its employees sleep at night?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes you can have multiple versions of Office installed on your computer.&nbsp; I currently have 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 all running on my machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly which 'Office 2013' bundle are you trying to install?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is one of the 365 bundles, then there is nothing special to do. Office 365 runs inside of a "click to run" virtual computer which isolates the program code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying one of the "Office 2013" bundles, then I can provide you with the instructions you need.</p>

            <p>Dear Rohn<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help. <br />
<br />
I am trying to install Office 2013 Academic. It does not say 365, <br />
and I am not exactly "trying" it because I have purchased it.<br />
I went to office.com/setup/ downloaded an executable, but<br />
when I click on it, it stops at 46% with that error code:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/30175-4-error-when-installing/290a8ad9-d5c6-4ffe-9a30-ee3d0f0a1d4d?page=2"> 30175-4</a><br />
<br />
(When I posted my question above, it was to a thread about<br />
error code 30175-4 but someone has moved my question<br />
to a thread of its own which means the nature of my problem <br />
had become obscured.)<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/30175-4-error-when-installing/290a8ad9-d5c6-4ffe-9a30-ee3d0f0a1d4d?page=2"><br />
<br />
30175-4</a> is a problem with system services, apparently. <br />
<br />
I have turned off all non-microsoft system services with a clean boot<br />
to no avail. <br />
<br />
Perhaps if I could turn off Microsoft Office 2007 related services<br />
I would have more luck.<br />
<br />

            <p>Dear Smittychat<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
<br />
&gt; If none of the solutions worked, it is best to create your own thread.<br />
I'd prefer to keep related information together on the same thread so that (as is the case presently) one does not have to waste a lot of time searching through many different threads - which say variations on the same thing - as I have already done. However
 that Microsoft encourages this <br />
upsetting and time-consuming dispersal of information by 'rewarding' kind volunteers such as yourself with "Mark as Answer," points, which requires that endless new threads be created.
<br />
<br />
&gt; Obviously the replies in the other thread did not work for you or did you try any of them?<br />
I tried the clean boot (with no non-Microsoft services). <br />
The only other thing suggested was that I uninstall Office 2007.<br />
<br />
Thank you for two new suggestions. <br />
1) I attempted to remove all traces of Office 2013 using the Fix it software at the link
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us<br />
But I received another unsolved error message "Microsoft Click-to-Run Suite"<br />
is installed. But I ran it again and I was able to uninstall "Microsoft Click-to-Run Suite."<br />
<br />
I will now attempt to install Microsoft Office 2013 again.<br />
But (this time at the 50% point) the installation stops with the same 30175-4 error code.<br />
<br />
2) Smittychat wrote<br />
&gt; Error Code 30175-4 : <br />
&gt; http://www.****.com/blog/tag/30175-4/<br />
Which appears to refer to (with the 0 s replaced by o s)<br />

This blog suggests repairing Microsoft Office. I am repairing my <br />
MS Office 2007. This takes quite a while and a reboot. <br />
MS Office 2007 was successfully repaired. <br />
I also uninstall Microsoft 2013 "Click to Run Suite" again using<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us</a></p>
<p>But again, the installation of MS Office Professional Academic stopped at the<br />
50% point with the same 30175-4 error message. <br />
<br />
(Incidentally I have an old version of Java (Java 6 31 as well as the newest, Java 7 30)
<br />
on my computer that I can not uninstall. Both Java's uninstaller and the control <br />
panel can not uninstall it so I attempted to uninstall it with microsoft's troubleshooter,<br />
Which said it had uninstalled the old version of Java but Java.com says it is still there.<br />
I guess that it is some tiny fragment of an old installation. I doubt it is related to<br />
my office problem. )<br />
<br />
<strong>Okay, I am going to remove Office 2007. I don't want to but I have wasted too</strong></p>
<br />
<strong>I uninstalled MS Office 2007, and used the Fix it to remove previous attempts to</strong>
<strong>install Office 2013 completely, then reattempted to install 2013 and found that
</strong><strong>the same error message was displayed! Now I have no office products on my work computer! I am going to reinstall 2007 now. I am scared that I will have lost my email inbox since outlook was part of 2007.</strong><br />
<br />
On the Japanese version of these forums it is also suggested that </p>
<p>1) It could be a network problem. Use a different network or get a disk.<strong><br />
</strong>(It would be time consuming to do so, so I have not tried)<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>2) If there is a intergratedoffice.exe process, stop it. <br />
(There is not)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) if DisplayLinkGraphics or DisplayLinkCoreSoftware are installed, then update them or remove them.
<br />
They are not installed. </p>
<p><br />
This software, which I did not want, was expensive, does not work, and requires that I remove the software that does work. I fear that the future does not bode well for Microsoft. You can't make people this unhappy and keep making money forever.
<br />
<br />
I decided to use MS Fixit to remove previous versions of Office and take the risk with all my email.

Now having removed both all my Office 2007 software, and the Office 2013 I will try again, on a "clean boot"<br />
<br />
<strong>And even having removed all the Office Software, both 2013 and 2007, using the Fix it's to do so,</strong>
<strong>and having applied a clean boot, I am still unable to install office 2013, being supplied only the same frustratingly uninformative error message.

<p>I would not dream to assume such a thing. Thank you for your continued help with this murky problem. The dialog is as below</p>

The error message is in Japanese. It says the same as the image uploaded to the forum here:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/office-some-thing-went-wrong-error-code-30175-4/99345ed7-cb6b-4b21-ae1b-3adc4bb271ec</p>
<p>"Something went wrong...."<br />
On other threads this error message is linked with inappropriate services running.
<br />
<br />
I had a look at your wiki and came up with a possible reason. In respect of <strong>
12007-4<br />
<br />
</strong>"Guys, I have found the Fix/solution for this error.<br />
If your using corporate LAN connection and connected to the <br />
internet via proxy, your proxy server or appliance is blocking your MS <br />
Office downloading process.</p>
Use alternative internet connection like Wi-Fi that has direct internet connection (No proxy), will solved the problem."
<p>My institution has a site license of some sort that makes Office purchases considerably cheaper (about half price). Both I and the purchase officer to whom I submitted my requirement for a new Office suite were unaware of this site license, so we purchased
 Office independently about 6 months ago. <br />
<br />
I am not using proxy server according to<br />
http://whatismyipaddress.com/proxy-check<br />
http://www.lagado.com/proxy-test<br />
but perhaps my institution, or MS on my institution's behalf, is blocking downloads of the software to my IP. This is possible but, why MS would not tell me is a complete mystery. I will check up with our IT department in due course. Perhaps I can get my phone
 to act as an Internet connection for my PC because I don't think I am going to get my money back on this beaten up package. Perhaps I can install some IP hiding software such as<br />
http://download.cnet.com/Hide-My-IP/3000-2144_4-75185020.html<br />
<br />
No, alas, my IP address does not appear to be the problem. I have installed the 14 day trial of "Hide my IP" and apparently I am now accessing the web now VIA an IP in Maidenhead, UK, as confirmed by Google
<br />
https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=what+is+my+IP&amp;gws_rd=ssl<br />
<br />
But the Office 2013 installation stopped at exactly the same place as it did when I was not hiding my IP address,
<strong>with exactly the same error message</strong>. I think it unlikely that I would see the same error message if a block on my IP address were the cause especially since
<strong>12007-4 </strong>is an error message for a blocked IP. That IP Maidenhead would need to be blocked in the same way as my IP in Japan.<br />
<br />
I am looking at all the other error message documentation too. <br />

I could try the 64 bit since I am using 64 bit windows but it seems like a LONG shot.
<br />
I tried this after I had reinstalled 2007 and apparently I can't install 64 bit with 2007 installed.

<p>I also tried starting IE11 to see if I were required to set anything up (as suggested at the end of your wiki) but I was not.
<br />
<br />
After reinstalling Office 2007 I ran Office Diagnostics (I had not noticed its existence before) but it found not problems.
<br />

<p>Dear Smitty Chat<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continuing help. CCleaner does not list the old version of Java as installed only Java.com does.&nbsp; I don't think that Java is causing my problem. The latest Java is installed and functions fine. As for my personal data, I will take the risk.
<br />
<br />
Since I have Windows on a smallish Solid State Drive, I am glad of the ability to delete various temporary files especially all these ones from NVidia. Thanks for recommending CCleaner.
<br />
<br />
The System file checker said that my system files are okay. <br />
<br />
I need to reinstall 2007 to be able to get some work done. I don't even have any email software. I have reinstalled 2007. Fortunately both my email folders and my quick link bars or whatever they are called bellow the Ribbon (grr) is still there.
<br />
<br />
Tim<br />
PS<br />
One other thing that occurred to me was that I may have installed MS Office 2000 on this computer in the past before I installed 2007. There is no entry for Office 2000 in control panel, and I can see no "Fix it" to remove Office 2000 from Win7.&nbsp; But perhaps
 vestiges of Office 2000 are still on this machine. <br />

<h2>            FYI Speeds</h2>
                    Maybe, some will find this interesting.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 10 on a 2 processor, 4GB RAM, VM<br />
<br />
Host is i7 w/ 8GB RAM.<br />
<br />
Boot after entering P/W is basically instant.<br />
General operation speed is mostly a matter of can I click&nbsp;fast&nbsp;enough to keep pace w/ it, as in WHOOOOSH!<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's the&nbsp;interesting tidbit...<br />
Run an Internet connection speed test &amp; the results are, slightly,&nbsp;higher for both Download &amp; Upload spds&nbsp;on the Win 10 VM than for the 8.1 Host machine.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>As Zorvec has told correctly, there is no help for appearing coded characters in some other cell immediately while inputting them.</span></p>
<p><span>As Zorvec has told correctly, too, VBA user defined function is practically indispensable. A simple example follows. Directory linking numerals and letters must be set. This is done in the procedure by means of two Arrays, written according to obvious
 rules. If any input numeral is absent in the Array I, the place in the cipher is held by an underline.</span></p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business asking for Credentials even though it has them</h2>
                    
<p>Installed OneDrive For Business on a new PC, synced the library but it tells me I need to enter the credentials.</p>
<p>When I click on 'Credentials needed' it takes me to the web portal for OneDrive for Business, automatically logs me in and lets me view my files.<br />
<br />
I've repaired OneDrive for Business, done an online and normal repair of Office 365, I've deleted Cached files through Upload Center, resynced the library, I've removed the office account and readded it.<br />
<br />
This is happening on 2 different accounts on 2 different PCs ones windows 8 and the other is windows 10</p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>You may have a look at the incident SP31654 in Service Health Dashboard (SHD) starting at Thursday, October 15, 2015, at 3:00 PM UTC. The user experience of this incident is: Affected users are unable to sync files with OneDrive for Business. Users may see
 repeated prompts to enter their credentials, but entering them will not result in a successful sync.</p>
<p>Tenant administrators can view current information and updates on SHD at the link here:</p>

<p>We will update to the primary thread below once the issue is resolved or you can obtain the most recent information from SHD.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I create an email using Firefox by adding addresses from Firefox Address Book using BCC for each address/recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to ensure that recipients cannot see each others email addresses. This is for security and privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click send in Firefox. Emails go to the Outlook server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When recipients receive the email from Outlook ALL of the email addresses are visible. The BCC flag has been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a security issue than needs to be fixed by Microsoft (or Firefox).</p>

            <p>Okay</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Firefox to manage all of my emails. I have several Hotmail and Outlook addresses, and two Gmail addresses. These are for societies / clubs that have large email lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have a problem with BCC when I send emails from Firefox using an Outlook / Hotmail identity.&nbsp; I do not have the problem when using a GMAIL identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This proves that Outlook / Hotmail deletes the BCC flag that I use for outgoing emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">whichever way I add recipients addresses to an email</span>: I can add addresses by typing, or by drag and drop from the Firefox address books; and I mark them as BCC- BUT Outlook / Hotmail
<p>
</p><p>The result is that emal addresses cannot be kept private using Outloo / Hotmail:
<p>
</p><p>I have done the same actions - sending an email to a mailing list - using Firefox as the GMAIL client: the BCC flag is retained and the recipients do not see everyone elses' addresses.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem&nbsp;as PeterW on my Hotmail account.co.uk and this will cause me problems going forward with sending information out confidentially.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This problem also coincided with my also getting the following message 'There was an error when attempting to connect to the Windows Live Calendar service. If the error persists, check to see if there's an upgrade of Windows Live Mail available or contact
 a service representative.'&nbsp; - I have a workaround on this through signing out of Windows Live Mail.</p>

            <p>Despite the best efforts of Microsoft to duck this issue and pretend that there is no problem . . . . .&nbsp; I found a solution based on an earlier cryptic response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The (possible) solution is to make sure that the first recipient's email address in your list is marked as "<strong>To</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That can be <em>your own address</em> (usually the best option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other email addresses can then be marked as "<strong>BCC</strong>". &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/daa63ea4-14f1-49c6-8bb3-cd76e43b733c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/daa63ea4-14f1-49c6-8bb3-cd76e43b733c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work, <em>BUT it is possible</em> that when you (later) look at the email in your 'Sent' folder you may not be able to see any of the BCC email addresses.

            <p>OK. The kludge I suggested earlier works using Thunderbird, but I can't offer any other solution if emails are sent from another client or Outlook, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS need to get this sorted because inadvertent or unintended disclosure of email addresses that occurs if BCC doesn't work may result in security issues. It is hardly a trivial issue.</p>

            C'mon Microsoft, enough people have experienced and complained about this problem that someone with the levers of authority should fix this.&nbsp; Sorry, RFBurns, it's screwed up in Thunderbird, too.&nbsp; All of us are Outlook.com email users who send our emails
 through various email clients to multiple recipients who we put on the Bcc: line.&nbsp; We expect that our emails will be delivered to each recipient privately, without the recipients seeing each others addresses.&nbsp; It's called "Netiquette."&nbsp; But things have changed.&nbsp;
 Now, when we send messages to our <strong>Bcc:</strong> recipients, everyone's addresses are
<strong><em>switched</em></strong> to the <strong>To:</strong> line and now visible to ALL to see!&nbsp; Fer cryin' out loud, what does it take for MS to put this back to the way it was before the "update?"

<h2>            Jacquie Lawson Webpage does no longer display</h2>
                    
<p>Problem with IE8 running on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Hi, I have a subscription for the Jaqauie Lawson webpage, allowing me to send select greeting cards to friends. Now, out of the blue, I cannot access their webpage anymore. I get an error response as if they&nbsp;were out&nbsp;of business.&nbsp;But they are in business
 all right. When complaining, they say, that it is my internet provider that must do something about it. My I.P. in turn puts the blame on Jacquie Lawson. Now J.L. tells me to use Firefox instead of I.E. but that did not solve the problem either....</p>
<p>As I miss the technical knowledge,&nbsp;I feel rather dumb&nbsp;.&nbsp;Still, I have a feeling that the issue has nothing to do with the browser. But&nbsp;would some bright person please have the goodness telling me what the real issue is, and may be an idea how it could be
 solved. Many thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;To end it all, there is just one thing I am noticing for some time (a few days) namely that often, when I start Internet Explorer, I have to try sometimes twice, sometimes more times, before I get to my home page (nzz.ch). Some other web sites also do
 not start on first trial On all of them I get a time out "Internet cannot display.... " but the timeout occurs most of the time after a much shorter time than e. g. when I try to reach Jacquiue Lawson. (Other websites always start without difficulties). Could
 it be, that during all these procedues, I have done something which changed something permanently in my computer? Should I e.g. deactivate Telnet?
</blockquote>
<div><br />
This generalizes your symptom, e.g.,&nbsp;away from a problem with a specific site.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'd still suspect something about your connectivity, such as the IPv6 factor I mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing the telnet client wouldn't have done anything to affect that.</div>

<p>Dear Robert, dear Cody,</p>
<p>The&nbsp;problem is solved! I do not know which of the two following actions did it but here is the story:</p>
<p>1) When my ISP noticed, that you could do nothing anymore they told me, that the problem is pending since last December and the actual reason for the website not to show up was, that the Hoster of Jacquie Lawson had blocked various IP - ranges of my ISP
 (Cablecom) for no aparent reason. He now found a support engineer at J.L. who promised to deblock at least some of the ranges</p>
<p>2)You remember, that in my last e-mail, i stated that my internet access wass becoming patchy. Today, I was not able to get to any website anymore. When I called, I was very fortunate to get to a real comm. expert. He found out, that&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;was violating
 my ISP's request to attribute the DNS server address themselves and not have a fixed&nbsp;address in my settings. (so I went to START, entered "NCPA.CPL", doubleclicked on "Local Area Connection",Clicked on "Properties", highlighted "Internet Protocol Version4
 (TCP/IPv4)", clicked on "Properties" and marked both, "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS Server address automatically" which effectively deleted a DNS Server address that was present.</p>
<p>Now, while the second action definitely solved problem Nr. 2), the verious serious question remains, what cured the Jacquie Lawson problem, because the two actions took place almost simultaneously.... But may be I am happy enough&nbsp;without ever knowing!</p>
<p>Once again: Many thanks for your assistance! Leo98</p>

<p>Hi Tpsingleton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this is correct PDF printout and highlights move independently and there’s no way to have them on same layer. In this case, we have two options either we highlight after moving the page or move the highlighter based on page location. This behavior is

                    Realizando pruebas de Redes externa con configuración de que los administradores autorizarian la inscripción, cometí el error de eliminar a todos los usuarios y tambien al administrador y he quedado con usuario cero. Nadie puede validar los nuevos participantes
 ya que no hay usuarios administradores, Quien puede eliminar el grupo que no tiene administrador.

<h2>            Not receiving&#47;sending emails on outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>I manage 14 email accs of a little bussines that are hosted in my domain. Since a month ago one of the mailboxes started having issues, it didnt send/recieve mail at all, it didnt show error, i tried different things, changing ports, reconfig outlook. Then
 all mailboxes started having same issues .I contacted domain support and they gave me new pop/smtp configs and lowered spam filter settings on sending...Now the issue is unclear: some emails recieve, some not, some dont deliever some deliever. Then I noticed
 that every worker had configured a ready-singnature in the message when they send msgs. I tested sending without the signature and, it slightly worked some times,( i tested sending by using my yahoo mail as reciever). But workers said that their clients still
 dont recieve their emails. And now i dont know what could it be? Network Virus? outdated software?</p>

<h2>            &#34;There was an error while sending your message&#34; while reply to all in outlook mobile.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Recently we launched Microsoft Intune as Mobile device management (MDM) for corporate phone. After launching Intune, one of our user having problem while using outlook mobile (Nokia lumia 930 and windows mobile 10). The user cannot reply to all with the
 error "There was an error while sending your message"(The device is compliant with intune policy and other users do not encounter this issue)</p>
<p>we tried re-format the phone but it did not help. There is no problem with outlook for PC or web-mail. We changed the phone but the prob still remained. currently I am also confused that it is an Intune or Outlook mobile issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope that someone can help.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,<br />

            Hi Ryan_1234,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description, one of your users is unable to send email message when he use Outlook for Windows Phone. As it works well in Outlook for other devices and client and other users don’t meet this problem, it might be related
 to his account configuration in Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In this case, we suggest this user double-check if his account is <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b#PickTab=Mobile_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
configured</a> correctly in Outlook. In addition, we suggest you check if these two mobile devices configured with this user’s account match your related policies (For reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/compliance-policy-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Monitor Intune Device compliance policies</a>). Besides, it’s recommended to check if the Outlook and system on the related Windows Phone need to be updated. Meanwhile, please try to switch to another type of network connection or change a network environment
 to see if it will work well.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to further look into it, could you please provide us the detailed version information of Outlook and the Windows system on these Windows Phone? And we need to confirm if this issue occurs to other email delivering operation, such as Reply,
 Send or Forward.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to arrange first the email addresses on excel in single column. Then, try to select all the email address in that column and copy it. Paste the email address on the BCC field of the compose page of Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: To open BCC field, please click on <strong>Cc &amp; Bcc </strong>located at the upper left of the compose page.</p>

<p>You could try to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hard reset</strong>. Switch the phone off. Press and hold three keys together, the green key, the * key and the number '3'. While you are holding these keys, swith the phone on. Don't release these three keys before you see the Nokia hands logo.<br />
For 5800 XM hard reset need different keys. The green key, the red key and the camera button. The process is the same.<u>Warning!Hard reset deletes all your phone's data!</u><br />
And, for N97 go to

            There's no need to wait 10 mins. The phone emptys itself within matter of seconds. 1 minute should be more than enough.<br />

                    I've tried everything, from deleting the Facebook account from my Live account and phone then re-adding, removing the battery from the phone for 5 seconds then re-booting and trying to sync again, and even completely resetting the phone, but nothing works.
 I keep getting the error message, and Facebook Chat won't work.

            <p>When you configured Facebook chat on the the phone, it prompted you to login to Windows Live and connect Facebook to your Windows Live account.
</p>
<p>During this sign in process, did you use your phone's primary Windows Live ID? If not, you will need to do so.
</p>
<p>Facebook chat is the only Facebook-functionality on the phone that requires Windows Live, so it would make sense that all other functions (what's new feed, contacts, contact photos, etc.) all work.</p>
<p>If that does not help then reset the device (turn off so the goodbye message appears then turn back on) then, go to Settings &gt; Email+accounts, tap-and-hold Facebook and tap Sync.

    <title>Where is the chain link icon in conversation view&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the chain link icon in conversation view&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In Outlook 2013, when viewing threads in conversation view, there was a chain icon to the left of all of the mails which provided a visual representation for all of the mails in the thread that were direct replies of one another (see the image shown on
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-or-off-Conversations-arrangement-in-the-message-list-96b6b5ea-def6-4a85-be5a-6fce272fe569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> for an example).</p>
<p>In Outlook 2016, I don't see this chain icon anymore. &nbsp;I have the threads displaying in indented mode, which seems to be working properly, but is there a way to get this chain to appear again? &nbsp;It was pretty helpful to me personally when I had threads that
 had been broken repeatedly.</p>

<p>hi derekrakos,</p>
<p>based on your description, by saying ‘chain icon’, do you mean the <b>vertical line</b> shown in this picture?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=67f6834a-eaa7-44f1-9bf5-2e70eda473a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d67f6834a-eaa7-44f1-9bf5-2e70eda473a2" /></a></p>
<p>if yes, after my test, i couldn’t find it in outlook 2016 client indeed. and conversation view of emails appears in this format. please feel free to correct me if i misunderstood anything.</p>

<p>I've opened a second *.pst file in Outlook 2010, and now I want to close it. However, when I right-click the *.pst file, I see that the "Close" command has changed to "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">R</span>emove". Why did it change? Will 'removing'
 a *.pst just close it, or delete it as well?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Shane.</p>

<p>that is because you have an email account associated with the PST file.</p>

            <p>I'd like to revive this conversation. The same issue can be found all over the Microsoft forums, but I have not seen a response yet that addresses it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: </p>
<p>In my case, for one page in particular, the page title shows normally&nbsp;at the top of the page itself but the page tab on the left says "Untitled". No efforts to edit the page title on the right (including the rename option with right click on the tab) actually
 propagates the new title to the tab. The tab just always says "Untitled". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Affected software: One Note Win 10 app (the latest download from the Windows Store as of 10/27/16)</p>
<p>Using Win 10, same issue regardless of recent updates, on Surface Book</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the same notebook opended in One Note 2016 desktop version shows the correct page title on the tab, as does the online One Note version. Changing the page title in either of these apps does not propagate the change to One Note Win 10 app after
 synchronization. </p>

            <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had this problem, and I actually found a solution. It's not the best one, and at this point is up to Microsoft to make it really work, but I brought the issue to the attention of my teachers, and they pointed out the OneNote APP,
 not synced notebooks or pages into the software, but after that, I have experienced no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, this was a really frustrating thing to have to deal with.</p>
