<h2>            Microsoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Advanced Exchange Service&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, so I sent my new xbox one to microsoft &nbsp;due to loud noise and they sent me back another xbox one but when I opened it... It was a *** refurbished one!!! I was expecting a brand new one also but I have to get this refurbished one. There's another
 problem that it won't even boot up and right away gives me an error. So much for my time being wasted. Sent me a refurbished console that doesn't even work. I'd like to know if anyone had ever done the advanced exchange service with microsoft. My question
 if they would actually send you a new console or another refurbished one. Also they asked for my (debit card) and would hold my $400 back until they receive the defective console which I was talking about that was refurbished. Anyways please tell me your experience.</p>

<p>Yup..... &nbsp;I got a brand new console (checked the date on the console sticker). I was told referbs were just starting to come out in the system at that time (February/14)... &nbsp; They put a $400 hold on my CC until they received my dud console. Advance exchange
 worked 100% for me.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight. </p>
<p>They placed a $400.00 hold on your Credit Card for an "advanced exchange" (AE) Thus you sent them your problem riddled console, in exchange for some other 2nd, 3rd, 4th Who knows - &nbsp;2nd hand problem riddled console?
</p>
<p>This is where "early adapters" actually won. When the early adapters did an AE, there wasn't any 2nd hand consoles for M to send them, so like kv^ they got New replacements, while their old junk consoles were piled on high at the refurb center until Newer
 customers sent in their AE consoles, and now M looks to unload their mountains of junk onto their newest customers.
</p>
<p>When we (consumers) purchase electronics with a warranty. We come to expect either to have our original items fully repaired, or completely replaced with a New item. Refurb's should be less than half the cost of New, sold as such, and not unloaded onto customers
 through advanced exchange. &nbsp;</p>
<p>M this, and other reasons is why, even though we love Halo. We will not be buying your latest console any time soon.
</p>
<p>Thanks OP for posting! </p>

<p>Bird ^ Yelp. I see what ya mean now. </p>
<p>This happened to me back in 02 which makes it very credible. I remember thinking I got my DDE fixed, opened the box, plugged in the console, and ????
</p>
<p>What I got back was someone's Xbox, and not mine, and now on top of DDE's I got a console that sparked pretty lights out the back every time you nudged it.

<p>UPDATE: 23/10/2014</p>
<p>I just received my console today and as I was expecting a refurbished console NOT a brand new one. The good thing is they got it right this time and it actually works!</p>
<p>Recap: Sent my brand new xbox one for fan noise issues... Got sent back a replacement (refurbished) doesn't even work (shows somekind of error that asks contact xbox support) contacted xbox support and they "advanced exchange repair" me. After a day got
 my new (refurbished) xbox one that works.</p>
<p>thank you xbox! I love your refurbished xbox one's even though I sent you a new one you gave me back a refurbished one.</p>

<h2>            Shared folder not sharing to all computers, &#34;might not have permission to use this network resource&#34;.</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp; I have set up a computer running Windows 7 home premium to act as a file sharing server for the scanner on our copy machine.&nbsp; The scanner puts the files into a shared folder on the "server" and we can connect to this shared folder from our individual
 workstations to work with the scans.&nbsp; We have 8 PCs that need to connect to this shared folder, 5 running Windows 7 and 3 running Windows XP.&nbsp; 3 Windows 7 machines and 2 XP machines were able to map to the folder just fine, but the other machines are giving
 a similar error:<br />
---<br />
(pc name) is not accessible.&nbsp; You might not have permission to use this network resource.&nbsp; Contact the server administrator to find out if you have access permissions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Logon failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.<br />
---<br />
From My Computer I am selecting map network drive, then selecting the "Server" from the group.&nbsp; I have to enter a username and password to connect, but the machines that are giving me the error are not giving me a chance to enter the username and password.<br />
<br />
When the shared folder was set up, the everyone group was selected.&nbsp; Technical support from the manufacturer of the copier walked me through the setup of the folder, sharing, tweaking the registry so that the different versions could access the folder, and
 successfully connecting the first XP and 7 machine.&nbsp; Can someone help me figure out why the final three machines will not connect with this folder?&nbsp; The copier tech said it was something they did not get involved in, it seemed like a networking issue and that
 would fall to our IT person.&nbsp; We are a very small business and do not have an IT person, so any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!<br />

            An update:<br />
After much online searching and hours of reading I have made progress with one Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; I toggled off the guest account on the "server" pc and that allowed one computer to be able to map to the drive.&nbsp; However, with the guest account still off the
 other Windows 7 pc and the XP machine say account currently disabled.&nbsp; If I toggle the guest account back to on with the "Server" pc, the original error message displays when I attempt to map to the drive.<br />
<br />
I followed another tip and downloaded Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools on the "server" pc, but when I attempted to enter the first line of command "net user guest /active:yes" I received a message that said "System error 5 has occurred, access is denied."<br />
<br />
I am still at a loss here.&nbsp; Can someone help?<br />

            Another update, I fixed the issue myself and learned something in the process.<br />
<br />
The fix: had to run the Server 2003 tools as an administrator, which allowed me to make the changes needed.<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 Black Screen after boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjp002  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Black Screen after boot</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so mostly every time I boot Windows 8.1, I get a black screen immediately where I can't do anything, or I get a black screen where only the network icon is visible, or it shows my account logging in, flashes black a few times, and then goes completely
 blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS REALLY GETTING ANNOYING, lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a custom built PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other things to note is that this happened on the same set-up with a different hard drive. Now with a clean install on a new hard drive for about only 3-4 days, same thing is happening. So it has to be Windows, or some core driver I'm installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue may lie within AMD's AIO driver or nVidia's driver. However, I don't want to uninstall the AIO driver since my CPU and Mobo are AMD based. Secondly, many versions of nVidia drivers still cause this, so I'm not too sure nVidia's drivers
 are to blame. Windows Updates may be to blame since this happened after Windows 8 updated a bunch of stuff within the first few hours of install. I unchecked nVidia drivers since I wanted to install them myself, but Windows of course graciously allowed itself
 to do so anyway. Maybe that could be the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not really wanting to do ANOTHER clean install since the same thing will happen and would really like to troubleshoot and solve the issue, so please don't suggest a clean install - it'll just get me back to here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things I've done so far include disabling fast boot from power menu, uninstalling nVidia 3D drivers, uninstalling/reinstalling nVidia graphics drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that if I restart 3 times to get windows to go into it's boot settings mode menu, I don't have to do ANYTHING but go to 'see advanced options' and then 'exit and continue to Windows 8, and it boots PERFECTLY. I find this rather odd.
 After doing this, my computer is in the future by normally 2 weeks and a couple days (but it has the right time!).</p>

            <p>The graphics card model is in my original post. My original post also provides that I have had this issue since installation and first round of updates. Also, it is a blank screen which means no error screen.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Throughout the threads of support I have received, many told me to update my BIOS. Having recently checked for a BIOS update, I did not think a new one had been released and that this issue was not BIOS related since ASRock had no word on the issue. I figured
 one more look wouldn't hurt the other day and to my surprise they had a new BIOS uploaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The solution was, indeed, to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">update my BIOS</span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASRock uploaded a new BIOS on 4/20/2014. Although the BIOS is listed as v1.00, it is an updated BIOS and corrected the issue.</p>

<h2>            Clean Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse</h2>
                    Hi, I just wanted to know if it is possible to clean the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. The scroll wheel and the left button aren't working perfectly anymore, they don't always detect clicks and scrolls, so I'd like to open the mouse to clean the interior but
 I can't find any screws or anything to open it. Is it possible to open it?

<p><span>Hi Kicha123,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may try resetting the sidebar to default settings and check if it helps.</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong><span>
 By resetting to the default settings, you’ll have to add your gadgets back to the sidebar.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>First make sure that the sidebar process is completely closed
<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>i.&nbsp;Right-click on the Sidebar icon in the system tray, and then choose Exit.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>ii.&nbsp;Check in Task Manager to make sure that there are no sidebar.exe processes running . If there are, just right-click and use End Process on each of them.<br />
b)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>Open up a windows explorer window and then paste the following into the location bar: %localappdata%\microsoft\Windows Sidebar<br />
c)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>This will open up the Sidebar gadgets folder,.<br />
d)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>Rename Settings.ini folder. This file contains your current sidebar configuration.<br />
e)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>Click start and open windows sidebar, you’ll notice that a new Settings.ini is created in the above mentioned folder immediately.<br />
f)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows side bar now should work with minimum gadgets.<br />
g)&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span>You may add the gadgets manually and check if its working.<br />
<br />
Refer to the link “<strong><span>Windows Sidebar and gadgets”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Desktop-gadgets-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Desktop-gadgets-overview</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>you may check if it works as expected on a new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a new user account, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;</span>Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control
 Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Manage another account. Administrator permission required. If you are prompted for an
 administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Create a new account.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;</span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create
 Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it works fine in the new user account, you may access the link and follow the steps to Fix corrupt user profile:<br />

            This may not be the thread of the person who wanted to share a file with a home network connected PC.&nbsp; If it was I still think OneDrive is the best way to get the file to the other person.&nbsp; That person may not always be on the Homegroup (which is now deprecated).

<h2>            Blue screen of Death or &#58;&#40; Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We&#39;re just collecting some error info, and then we&#39;ll restart for you. Error on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have read my threads where people are facing this blue screen of death error on Windows 8, the cases are different but this error message is same , I am sharing picture of the error message, it looks like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e15d54b7-686c-4c9c-bd89-32ec1d54c0dc" height="418" width="723" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Case</strong></p>
<p>In my case when I turn on laptop for first time it crashes, shows this error message and restarts normally. On home screen it shows me a message to send this problem to Microsoft. Laptop works fine later with no any issue, even if&nbsp;I restart later it loads
 fine, but if I shut it down and starts the next moment it shows same&nbsp;error screen.&nbsp;When I peek into details it show me these details. attracting the picture.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done following things to figure out the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought it is some software problem so I format my windows drive and reinstall Windows8 -&nbsp;the issue wasn't resolved.</li><li>A friend of mine suggested me for a complete format, I moved my data to external HDD, formatted my whole drive, deleted partitions , made new partitions, and installed Windows 8 -&nbsp;the issue wasn't resolved.</li><li>Someone suggested&nbsp;hardware issue with my HDD so for checking it out, I used another HDD, formatted it, deleted partitions, made new partitions, and installed Windows 8 -&nbsp;the problem persist.</li><li>Restored all BIOS settings to default -&nbsp;the problem persist.</li><li>I connected my friend's HDD having Windows 7 to check&nbsp;my machine and it worked fine.</li></ul>
<p>With my research I can't figure out what actually is causing this crash, it would not be any software setting or virus as on formatting windows every such issue would have been resolved. It is not the HDD for sure as I have done everything I know to figure
 out if it is HDD which is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dear community members and Microsoft experts, this is the very first time I am participating over this forum and think I have explained everything about the problem I am facing and research&nbsp;I have done to solve this issue,&nbsp;which I eventually failed, please
 guide me how can I resolve it. My laptop is out of warranty and I don't want to pay for something that I do not know exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for your expert advice.</p>

    <title>Experiencing daily froze-ups - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merryweather1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Experiencing daily froze-ups</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
My computer under Win8 Pro freezes several times a day, and I'm not sure about the reason. By freezing, I mean the mouse and keyboard controls stop functioning, the screen freezes, I cannot toggle Task Manager and I have to unplug the computer and reboot it.
 It happens mostly after the computer comes out of Sleep mode (there's a definite trend there) but it can also occur at a random moment.<br />
<br />
I have unplugged all my unnecessary devices, run DriverBoost, Windows Troubleshooter, all to no avail. The Event Viewer has proved the most useful tool so far as it logs the same errors each time these freezes happen. Here there are below.<br />
<br />
This is my last attempt before sending the bloody machine to repair. Hope u guys can help.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 Cannot login</h2>
                    
<p>initially after upgrading to 2016, skype for business worked. after a restart or so, skype for business 2016 doesn't allow me to login with the same credentials that works anymore.</p>
<p>i can login with the same exact credentials from another pc with skype for business 2013 and it works just fine. with skype for business 2016, i get the following error repeatedly -&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bd9be59-3185-4d27-9c3c-16456e4af860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bd9be59-3185-4d27-9c3c-16456e4af860" /></a></p>
<p>i have verified the email address and the login information (domain credentials) are correct. it matches skype for business 2013 information but fails to login.</p>

<p>any help to get this resolved would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I ended up uninstalling Office 2016 and reinstalled. That seemed to have helped Skype for Business 2016 from having login issues. It is surprising to see Office 2016 installer does not have any kind of customizing options anymore. It is all or nothing when
 it comes to installing the Office suite.</p>

<p>Have you checked the manufacturers website for updated driver?</p>
<p>If its a USB plug and play camera, then all you need to do is plug it in, use a program such as Windows Live Photo Gallery to import your pictures.</p>

<p>Get the Windows 7 driver and software from the camera manufacture's web site. Also most cameras will work with Windows 7 if you normally use a USB port on the camera, just plug it in and tranfer the files using Windows Live. Which is what I did untill the
 manufacture finally released a set of Windows 7 drivers and software.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That was a SCAM call and warnings and even error messages are common and to be expected<br />
in event viewer. That is why they try to use it as part of their scam.<br />
<br />
Also remember your computer came with a warranty and the OEM/Maker is responsible for<br />
both the hardware and Windows. So if you do have system issues they will need to help you<br />
resolve them. Of course we will try to help.<br />
<br />
<p>===========<br />
<br />
Yes it is a SCAM!<br />

In USA you can contact FBI, State Attorney General, local law enforcement and <br />

<br />
No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless 5000 mouse not recognized by Windows 7, after update from Vista</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>2 days ago, I upgraded my Dell Dimension e521 from Vista to Windows 7 - it was the upgrade, not the full clean install.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everything went seemingly very smoothly, except the mouse I had been using during the entire process, was now unresponsive. The mouse is a Microsoft Wireless 5000, part of the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 Keyboard-BlueTrack Mouse, USB package.
 The keyboard, which shares the same wireless USB&nbsp;receiver is fully responsive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried the following to resolve the problem, with no success;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;- Uninstalling, then reinstalling the software for the keyboard and mouse</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;- Purchasing a new Desktop set (indicated on the box as "compatible with Windows 7"), and going through the full install.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;- Going in to the Device Manager and checking/updating EVERY driver. They are all now current.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;- I&nbsp;have&nbsp;followed all of the suggestions in Microsofts "Troubleshoot a wireless mouse that doesn't function correctly" page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +I have changes the batteries on both devoces</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +I have tried different ports</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +I have tested the device on a different computer</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +I have tried using the mousinfo tool</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +I have tried to use the appwiz.cpl application, to find conflicting software, but &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but no program comes up when I type appwiz.cpl in to the start search box.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +Rebooting after each time I have changed something.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>None of these steps resulted in any changes - the keyboard is still responsive, but the mouse is dead. I do not&nbsp;receive&nbsp;any error messages, the cursor just sits dead center in the middle of the screen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Needless to say, I'm becoming increasingly frustrated. As I'm not particularly computer knowledgeable - I don't know one USB Root Hub from another - I'm out of options...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help!!!!!!</strong></p>

<p>Hi,<br />

<br />
however best to do).<br />

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2. Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

sfc /scannow<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3. In Device Manager Right Click on EVERYTHING that is a mouse and Uninstall.</p>
<p>The Right Click on EVERYTHING that is under USB Controllers - after that REBOOT.</p>
<p>That will refresh the driver stacks and help clear corruption.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            cortana says not enough bandwidth&#47;internet when using</h2>
                    
<p>so i start the xbox to play games on it and when i use cortana if i say/use anything that uses the internet or if cortana misunderstands me it says there is not enough bandwidth or that the internet is not cooperating and tells me to try again later this
 has occurred since the day cortana was installed onto my xbox i can launch/play thing like launching games or launching apps and setting i can also snap things but i can not use things like defining a word or say looking up things pretty much if it misunderstands
 me or if i use anything that uses the internet it says there is not enough internet or bandwidth yet i have unlimited bandwidth/broadband there is not a internet cable connected to the back of it and i am using an extra terabyte of storage plugged into the
 back via a usb ( i doubt that would affect it but i am giving all the information i can to try to resolve this issue) it also for some reason turns up the volume by like 10 levels when it says there is not internet (the volume turn back down afterwards it
 also seems to not turn the tv volume up but just turns cortanas voice up only instead) but pretty much i cannot use anything that uses the internet and cannot even mispronounce something without it saying there is not internet and turning its voice up for
 some reason while saying there is not internet i have also tryed to use kinect but the kinect doesn't have commands such as launching games or recording clips up to 10 minutes like cortana can although i will say cortana seems much more responsive than the
 normal kinect voice commands apart from the not enough bandwidth problem i am having i have no idea if anyone else is having this problem since i cannot seem to find anyone else talking about anything similar to the problem i am having&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 x64 Spacebar Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjg79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 x64 Spacebar Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that since the December 2018 Microsoft updates, my keyboard space-bar stops working intermittently. It's the only key on the keyboard that appears to stop working. I'm able to resolve the issue by performing a disk clean-up with Temp File Cleaner,
 and CCleaner, and then rebooting. However, after a period of time when more temp internet files are accumulated, the issue returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit on my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly suspect the issue is related to Windows Updates, because this issue just became a problem in December 2018 for me. Apparently, some recent Microsoft updates have "bugs" with some undesirable side effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to look into this problem. A web search reveals that others are experiencing this problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any know if Microsoft is aware of this problem and if they are working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>You're probably jumping to conclusions. The most likely cause of your problem is a defective keyboard, maybe a crumb that is lodged under the space bar. Try an external USB keyboard and/or the on-screen keyboard osk.exe.</p>

<p>I don't think I'm jumping to conclusions. I've analyzed the issue carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using wired usb keyboards and I swapped out the keyboard. Also, I use a clear keyboard cover to protect the keyboard from dust and crumbs. Because of the cover, my keyboards are in like new condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also very careful with Windows updates. I don't allow them to load automatically. Also, I run the system file checker after each update and I never add the optional "Preview" updates since those types of updates have caused problems in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft changed something with their recent updates that is causing this issue. The recent updates along with the normal internet junk and tracking cookies seems to be the cause. If I let my computer accumulate more than a couple of days of internet junk,
 without performing a complete system clean-up, my space-bar stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when my space-bar stops working, I know I need to perform a system/disk clean-up. This problem just started recently. The only thing that's changed on my system. since this problem began, are Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm mentioned, Windows Updates have caused problems in the past, and these problems were well documented and acknowledged by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the only one to report this problem. I'm sure there's a way to confirm my observations, but that requires someone with more knowledge of the OS than me. I'm sure there are some logging actions that could confirm this issue.</p>

            Do a search for "Win 7 spacebar not working." You should see a number of posts, some old and some new. I've noticed that all of the old posts in the Microsoft Community are locked, but it appears that others have visited these posts and clicked Yes or
 No to the question about the information being useful. I see that there appears to be recent dates, Dec 2018 and Jan 2019, where others are searching this topic. That indicates to me that others are experiencing the issue that I'm having with my space-bar.

<p>What you recommend is equivalent to me suggesting for you to go to a hospital in order to count the number of sick people in there, then to conclude that we have a sick society. Of course there are plenty of sick people in a hospital, that's what hospitals
 are here for! Same with forums: It's here where people with problems come! The vast majority whose keyboard work properly are not seen here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get a solid impression about the magnitude of a Windows problem you either need to do a survey (which is hard) or you need to talk to experienced forum respondents (who are the "doctors"). They know pretty quickly when an automatic update goes haywire
 (which does happen). Looking at your forum profile one might say that you are a casual user rather than an expert respondent.</p>

</p><p>If you have your Windows Update set to automatically download/install updates (the riskiest possible setting) perhaps you picked up a hardware driver update which if you ever see those offered they should not be installed but instead should be hidden and

    <title>Can&#39;t delete discontinued work email account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karlkrasnowsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t delete discontinued work email account.</h2>
                    <p>This is an ongoing issue that I can't resolve and is very annoying.</p>
<p>I changed jobs last month. The prior job email I had added to my Microsoft account group.</p>
<p>This email address was shut off (rightfully so) so now when my system starts up I get a message that tells me I need to "fix" this problem.</p>
<p>I can't find any path the delete/manage an account that is no longer valid. Since I can't log in (it's no longer valid!) the management system simply won't provide a method for just deleting it (it would appear) without my ability to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, very annoying. Please advice.</p>

<br />Best to create a new local admin account login in with that account and use that.
<br />Once logged in go to c:\Users\yourolderfolder and copy all the contents and paste in c:\user\yournewuserfolder.
<br />Then right click start and go to computer management.
<br />Expand Local Users and Groups.
<br />Go to Users.
<br />Click your old user account and select to delete it.

            <p>Hey there, thanks for the response. </p>
<p>Windows 8 pro was working fine, it wasnt until days later when I got this error.</p>
<p>unfortunately none of these methods worked. </p>
<p>For the command promt method, is there another command after bootrec/rebuildbcd?</p>
<p>I try to "Reset your PC" option, but i get a message saying "A required driver partion is missing".</p>
<p>I try to "install now",&nbsp; reinstalling windows 8 pro again but it asked me to restart which did nothing.<br />
Any other ideas? <br />
thanks</p>

    <title>Extract option missing when I right click on files&#47;folders&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Extract option missing when I right click on files&#47;folders&#63; Help&#63;</h2>
                    <div>The option to Extract is missing when I right click on folders. My guess is because I deleted RAR Extract Frog. I think something happened after I did that. I deleted it because I didn't understand it. (I know... how that sounds) Whenever I would open
 up a folder it would automatically extract them. I honestly have no idea what it was doing, but it was really annoying and I thought it was dangerous (because it appeared out of nowhere. I don't remember downloading it) so I deleted it. I don't understand
 a lot about computers, but i'm not completely ignorant to them.&nbsp;</div>
I have tried everything that I could find on Google.&nbsp;
<div>I looked up in the control panel to see if the option was checked as hidden, but it's not. It says the option to Extract is still there.</div>
<div>I tried running the command prompt as admin and enter the correct coding to fix them but that didn't help either.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to use the Windows fix file link thing I need to EXTRACT the file..... I'm in a viscous circle and it looks like theres no way out. I really need to extract for what i'm doing. Any suggestions would be great.&nbsp;</div>
