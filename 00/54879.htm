    <title>Windows 7 Lifecycle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryancroughn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Lifecycle</h2>
                    <p>Why is Microsoft ending support for Windows? Do we really know why? Do we want this to keep happening to our favorite Windows Operating Systems? Well, I say NO!!! I had to sacrifice my perfect Windows XP Machine because Microsoft has "ended support"!!! Well,
 I am done with this end of support nonsense!!! Right Now I have a fast and high performing Windows 7 PC and Microsoft expects me to just give it up in 2 years because they can just end support for the OS.
<strong>How about halting updates for newer chipsets on Windows 7 and 8.1. Microsoft is violating there LIFECYCLE POLICY by partially halting updates. Microsoft said end of support was on January 14th, 2020!! A Little too early.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It's all about the
 money,&nbsp;<strong>SERIOUSLY</strong>, they just want us to keep buying a new operating system every time they end support so they can make more and more and more $$$$$. &nbsp;I'M DONE!!! 75% of the world at one point was using Windows XP and when support ended, it
 was just anarchy!!! Most businesses and cooperation still used Windows XP. &nbsp;I'm also sick of all this crap about Microsoft trying to persuade us to upgrade to Windows 10. We don't need all of your nonsense advertisements. If you are sick and tired of end of
 support, then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SPEAK UP!!! VOICE YOURSELF!!! DON'T WAIT, SPEAK UP NOW!!!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>How exactly are MS forcing you to stop using the PC? No support doesn't mean it stops working, just that you get to look after it yourself.</p>

<p>I totally agree with Ryan, I was using windows XP as well along time ago, then Microsoft bought out Vista. I'm sorry for swearing! but like millions of others out in the world, hated vista, after years of working on computer Systems, I began to think, Windows
 vista was an operating system that was to heavy. Microsoft is just after a way of making more money. a new operating system come on the market, current support, updates &amp; other device drivers are stopped for that OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes windows Vista, the Windows 7, windows 8, which to my knowledge was more foccused on Touch screen systems</p>
<p>Ryan, maybe you can try an operating system that is not from Microsoft, for your business. like Linux, which is free &amp; does have support for older devices, (Printers etc)</p>
<p>

Linux is a good choice. There are a variety of Linux versions and it is true that they always give support to older versions.

</p><p>Yes, Drivers can still be downloaded on Windows XP for most devices, but think about how out of date the Windows XP platform is. Its last update was April 2014, 3 years without a security update and platform update. &nbsp;No web browsers are supported on XP anymore.
 You cant get the latest versions of web browsers. If your with a business, How about office 2013 and 2016, you cant get those. The last supported office for Windows XP was 2007, and support for that is ending in October of 2017. The latest Adobe is not supported
 on windows XP anymore. Most modern or latest versions of programs are not support anymore, and all because of END OF SUPPORT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of that stops you continuing to use Windows XP. Not Supported does not mean Doesn't Work. If you are continuing use it's on the same PC so you don't need new drivers. If you want to buy a new PC and load XP that's a completely &nbsp;different thing to continuing
 to use.</p>

<p><b>My problem with microsoft windows started 2 years ago when i was locked out of my acct. Since then i have been thru 2 computers and still no answers. How do you get files from a computer that locked itself down on a new computer that was never connected
 to the old one? NETWORKING thats how someone took control of my old computers hard drive and now has all my information. So if they wanted into this one, it uses the same internet connection as the old one did. My ISP told me his only job is to supply the
 connection, but what if something bad is going on on his end? I just wish someone could give me some answers. Until then i cannot find any installed updates on this computer and it is linked into my microsoft acct.<br />

            <p>Dear Manasa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope I can answer all your questions as best as I can:</p>
<p>Well if the suspicious e-mails showing up everyday are not enough then I had to close my banking accts. for fraduelant charges being made. Adult websites e-mails coming with my cred. I have received automated phone calls from the FBI. That was funny! They
 don't call they just come get you. Also have been receiving a lot of phone calls on my landline that sound like fax machines.</p>
<p>#2 is tricky. In 2011 I downloaded a version of PCCleaner Pro. On the download came an attachment that my AV picked up and removed it. Ever since that day my old cpu ran slow and lost internet connectivity. The very last thing that came across my old HP
 desktop screen was "execute:COVERMYTRACKS.DLL" then my cpu shut down never to return.</p>
<p>#3 Evey time I would try to login to my Microsoft acct. it would let me enter my information then return me to the same login screen. When I did manage to get in it said: Your Microsoft Profile is temporarily unavailable. It did this until recently.</p>
<p>#4 R.A.A. Services in Lisbon,Ohio 1-330-271-9693</p>
<p>#5 I cannot find ANY currently installed updates on this machine. Also cannot add/remove any windows features.
</p>

                    <p>I have a 32gb flash drive only showing 150MB and when I try to format it only shows that much space too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to disk management, I can see the unallocated space, but at the same time right clicking the only partition of 150 MB doesnt give me the option to delete the partition. It's just grayed out.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
There could be various reasons like the space on the pen drive gets corrupted. <span>
&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to open the command prompt as administrator. To open the command prompt as administrator follow the steps in the link:<br />
<br />
Command Prompt: frequently asked questions (How do I run a command with elevated privileges?)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/command-prompt-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/command-prompt-faq#1TC=windows-7</a><br />
Once you open the command prompt, then Try the following steps.<br />

Now type: format "Pendrive Letter, example C:, D:," /FS:NTFS /q <br />
Full example: format G: /FS:NTFS /q <br />
/q stands for Quick <br />
G: is the letter drive of your flash drive. <br />

<h2>            Surface Book USBs underpowered</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>My Surface Book has problems using both USB ports at once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Logitech Performance MX wireless mouse; the USB for it takes up one port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug in my Bose speaker system to the other port, I get an error message saying that I've exceeded USB resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug in the Surface Ethernet adaptor, the mouse is suddenly only detected within 4 inches of the port--making it useless for right-handed use. (And when I unplug the Ethernet adaptor, the mouse is detected from many feet away, as normal.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For both problems, it doesn't matter which devices are plugged into which ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's 2016. Why do I have to choose between using my mouse and using the internet?</p>

            <p>I've never used ethernet adapter with my SB but I used external ssd and mouse at the same time and had no problems, recently I switched to Bluetooth mouse and I find it &nbsp;very handy. For something more like two external drives and license dongle for instance
 I use surface dock, it has 4 USBs &nbsp;and &nbsp;they are powered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lots of bold statements.&nbsp; Pretty Snarky too....</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.&nbsp; You should read the USB spec.&nbsp; For a "tablet" and yes it is still a tablet at the core. Not a laptop the USB spec says 900ma or 4.5w.&nbsp; I just measured one at 5 w.&nbsp; So it exceeds spec.&nbsp; You can buy a USB power meter on Amazon for around $8.00</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second,&nbsp; the way the book works is there is a bub in the base.&nbsp; I would change the network adapter out for a high quality one. Your signal is likely reduced by noise, could be power, but you wont know until you measure it. More likely interference than power....

            <p>This is exactly my issue. I have the latest Surfacebook with the larger power supply and when I plug in an ethernet adapter and my logitech wireless dongle, the mouse will sometimes become laggy. The USB to ethernet adapter I have also has 3 USB ports on
 it. If I unplug the ethernet cable, those jacks work. If I plug in ethernet, the mouse will work at about 10%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can connect to ethernet and use other usb items reliably? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just noticed this is due out soon, not seen anything about it before. Made by slightly mad of nfs:shift fame. Looks decent with some classic Ferrari F1 cars in there, looks like some 1990's spec v12's etc.</p>

<h3> shanelee1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pen warranty</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface pen that comes with my surface pro 4 that i bought more than a year ago. The surface pen decided to not work a few months ago and I have tried all the suggested method on the website to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the pen is the tip is not able to write as usual, only the top clicking button works. I have tried using a friend's pen and it works perfectly on my surface and therefore I am sure that it is my pen that is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried submitting a repair request however I am not able to get pass step 2, it kept telling me that there is no repair option for the surface pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering does anyone has the same problem please? Also am I able to request it to be repaired under warranty?&nbsp;</p>

<p />

            <div>Shane,</div>
<div>The warranty on the pen is 1 year. Don't call support, they will charge you $29</div>
<div>just to speak with them. You MAY have luck if you are in the USA and go to a</div>
<div>physical retail Microsoft Store on getting an out of warranty exchange, but to</div>
<div>be honest, I'm not aware of Microsoft even offering an out of warranty exchange</div>
<div>for the pens. I've sent email to an internal contact on this (everyone is at</div>
<div>Build this week) so I don't know if or when I will get a reply. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;I have a surface pen that comes with my surface pro 4 that i bought more than a year ago.</div>

<h2>            DVD RW on Windows 10 installs as CDrom and I&#39;m at a loss</h2>
                    <p>Hi...Help...Please...</p>
<p>My system is a Windows 10 Home Edition custom build with 8 core AMD, 12 GB of RAM, 64 bit Operating System and everything worked great till I had to install a new hard drive. Moved from a 500GB drive to a 6TB drive - due to errors on the original drive -
 New fresh install of Windows 10 Home - got all my partitions going, Steam, Origin, and even Blackboard for my Masters Course-work - but when I plug in my DVD RW drive ( says it is an: ATAPI iHAS124), it installs as a CDrom, will not recognize any disc whether
 it is DVD or CD or Burnable - and tells me the system does not recognize my request. Now I'm tech savy but this is over my head. I have installed, uninstalled, updated, driver fixed, scanned, and even looked at code. I'm ready to take the drive out and use
 it as a freesbie but I need my RW to work!!!!! Please - any advice - I'm a (literally) poor college guy and need help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

<p><span>Hi Mikeaka Smitty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I can see that ATAPI iHAS124 is not compatible with Windows 10 and you can click on Specifications from
<em><a href="http://www.liteonodd.com/en/dvd-internal/item/dvdinternal/ihas124.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">iHAS124</span></a></em> and check the Compatible Operating Systems. The only compatible operating systems are
<strong>DOS 6.xx, Windows 8 / Windows 7 / XP / 2003 / Vista and Linux</strong> operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model number of your computer?</span></li><li><span><span>Are you able to see DVD driver in Device Manager?</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Did you try the DVD Rom on another computer?</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check if DVD driver is present in Device Manager or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>R</strong> keys &gt; Type <strong>
devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong> &gt; Expand <strong>DVD/CD ROM</strong> drives.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Then please send the <em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/forum/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">screenshot</span></a></em>

<h2>            Active Directory Schema Admins and Enterprise Admins Groups</h2>
                    I have a forest and domain setup and running the same name as ****.&nbsp; We don't own **** domain so I would like to migrate our domain to corp.yyy.com.&nbsp; I have added the new domain to the existing **** forest and the trust relationships seem to work
 fine.&nbsp; I have added corp.yyy.com\administrator to the Schema Admins and the Enterprise Admins groups.&nbsp; When I try to install Exchange to the new domain, the install errors because it does not see corp.yyy.com\administrator as a Schema or Enterprise Admins
 user.&nbsp; Should this configuration work for installing an Exchange server into my new domain or should I just setup my new domain in a new forest?&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hi aarogg!</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting the Microsoft Community Forum. &nbsp;I'll be happy to assist. In order to show 2 windows side by side, make sure the window isn't maximized, and slide the window all the way to the left or right of your screen. It will auto size it to fit.
 You can adjust as necessary. &nbsp;You should be able to fit up to 4 windows on your screen (2 on top, 2 on bottom) at the most. However, I prefer the dual-window setup when I multitask. Hope this helps answer your question! If you need any more assistance, please
 don't hesitate to reply back. Have a great day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Dustin</p>

            <p>Hi aarogg,</p>
<p>Try this:<span>&nbsp; </span>In file explorer, open your downloads folder, then hit
<strong>windows key + right arrow </strong>to snap it to the right.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then in the left pane of that same window, right-click your pictures folder and click
<strong>Open in new window</strong>, and hit <strong>windows key + left arrow</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;That will give you</span>&nbsp;two explorer windows open side-by-side that you can transfer files between.</p>

</p><p>Hi again! As you can see above, I've got the folders you mentioned Side by Side without a problem. Just use the method I outlined for you earlier. You can Right-click on the File Explorer icon in your task bar to open both folders, then Drag one folder all
 the way left, and the other folder all the way right. It may not fill the screen at first, but if you place the cursor at the bottom of a folder the cursor will change to a vertical line with arrows at both ends to show you can resize the window. Just click
 and drag down to fill the half screen. Hope this helps clear up any confusion!</p>

<h2>            Crackdown 3 impossible de jouer en coop&#91;Translation-Crackdown 3 unable to play Coop&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour,&nbsp;<br />
J'ai souscris à un Gamepass la semaine dernière et j'ai installé Crackdown 3 dans sa version Windows 10 sur mon PC. Pas de soucis en solo, le jeu tourne parfaitement.&nbsp;<br />
Cependant, un ami qui a également un gamepass a voulu me rejoindre pour jouer en coop et rien à faire, ça ne fonctionne pas.<br />
On a à chaque fois le message qui indique que la connexion est trop lente et va nuire à l'expérience de jeu et finalement on est déconnecté avant même de pouvoir lancer la partie au moment de se rejoindre.&nbsp;<br />
Il a essayé à la fois sur son PC sous Win10 et sur sa Xbox One X. Toujours les mêmes messages d'erreur, donc ça ne vient pas d'un problème possible de crossplay. J'ai même pensé que ça venait peut être du fait que je n'étais pas Xbox Live Gold. J'ai un code
 14 jours gratuit, mais on ne peut pas les activer sur Windows 10, donc ça ne doit pas être ça non plus.<br />
<br />
Quel est le vrai problème ? Est-ce qu'il va être régler sous peu (le jeu est quand même sorti il y a deux mois) ? Merci d'avance.</p>
<p><strong>[Translation-Hello </strong><br />
<strong>I subscribed to a GamePass last week and I installed crackdown 3 in its Windows 10 version on my PC. No worries in solo, the game turns perfectly.
</strong><br />
<strong>However, a friend who also has a GamePass wanted to join me to play Coop and nothing to do, it does not work.</strong><br />
<strong>We have each time the message that indicates that the connection is too slow and will harm the gaming experience and eventually we are disconnected before we can even launch the game when joining.
</strong><br />
<strong>He tried both on his PC on Win10 and on his Xbox one X. still the same error messages, so it's not from a possible crossplay problem. I even thought it might come from the fact that I wasn't Xbox Live gold. I have a free 14-day code, but we can't activate
 them on Windows 10, so it doesn't have to be that either.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the real problem? Is it going to be settled shortly (the game is still released two months ago)? Thanks in advance.]</strong></p>

<p>Hi Streptos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. We understand unable to join a game with a friend. This is due to your network, his network or a combination of both. You can try the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
multiplayer error guide</a> to see if it helps any. Although it is for Xbox one consoles. You can try some of the steps that are referring to your network hardware. Also could be the game server itself causing you both not able to join or play together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Kumiko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, when you install games, it goes directly to <strong>Program Files </strong>
folder. If you are using custom install or changed its location path, all future updates for this game will have difficulties locating your files. This means that it is recommended to follow the default destination folder path of this application when installing
 it. To resolve this concern, we'd like to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you perform a custom install? <br />
</li><li>Can you install this game to a default path like <strong>Program files</strong>?
</li><li>Is your <strong>Windows Firewall </strong>turned on?</li><li>Did you transfer the .exe launcher file to another folder location?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you can install this game successfully.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 creates its own network and disallows internet access</h2>
                    Hi.
<div>I'm having trouble with windows 7 when it comes to getting online. upon every boot, an "Unidentified Network" is created, causing my regular network to not function. I cannot delete this new network, and the only way to fix it that I have found is to disable
 and re-enable my network device, which is annoying to do every boot. I have tested all drivers, and I am not going through a router, I am directly connected to my cable modem. Thanks for any help you can offer.</div>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Firstly, make sure you have the latest network adapter drivers installed. Visit the manufacturer’s website and check if there are any recent updates or latest version available and update the same.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below and check if that helps in fixing the issue:</p>
<p>1. Click "Start", type "NCPA.CPL" (without quotation marks) in the Start search bar and press "Enter".<br />
2. Right-click the network connection and click "Properties".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Click to highlight "Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)" and click "Properties".<br />
4. Check "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".<br />
5. Click "OK".<br />
6. Click to highlight "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click "Properties".<br />
7. Check "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".<br />
8. Click "OK".<br />
9. Reboot the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The issue is that the ROUTE table contains a phantom persistent default route 0.0.0.0 to one of the network interface cards. This activates the "Unidentified Network" (Public) every time the network connection becomes active. Sharing permissions are turned
 off.</p>
<p>Solution is to use the Windows Command Screen as Administrator and remove all default routes.</p>
<p>Access the link below for a similar issue in TechNet and follow the steps to resolve the issue:</p>

<p>Tried this.&nbsp; Scanhealth returned with no problem.&nbsp; Restorehealth was successful.&nbsp; Rebooted.&nbsp; Still have inactive start button, and Microsoft Edge starts and closes itself immediately.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; I have tried a restore to 2 days ago when all seemed good,
 no difference, except that I have my sound back.&nbsp; Even Picture Viewer does not open.</p>
<p>Problems started with Outlook that did not open because of access denied to .pst - tried to rectify by granting permission to my user directory and then next thing the start button stopped working - can right click, but a normal click does not bring up the
 menu.&nbsp; Other apps like Edge opens but closes immediately.</p>

            It sounds like a simple but have you tried power cycling your Xbox?&nbsp; I have started doing this more often and it simulates rebooting a computer.&nbsp; The issues it resolves are amazing.&nbsp; Simply hold the power button for 10 seconds while the system is on, then
 restart.

<p>Laptop does not detect the WIFI but i am able to connect to internet through LAN cable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, your&nbsp; IPConfig&nbsp; is showing that&nbsp; Wi-Fi adapter is being detected just fine; it is just not started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same symptom but we are interpreting it differently.&nbsp; We are both multi-homed and Ethernet is working automatically but Wi-Fi is not.&nbsp; That seems OK to me but I would agree it is strange that Wi-Fi still shows as "Connect Automatically" but requires
 an actual manual Connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coincidentally I was starting a reply to this message and got into a state where&nbsp; Netsh&nbsp; was hung trying to check Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Eerie.&nbsp; Here's the command I used (from an Administrator Command Prompt)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">netsh&nbsp; wlan&nbsp; sh net</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stopped after the first line and would not do anything, completely hanging my Command Prompt.&nbsp; I had to use&nbsp; ProcExp&nbsp; to find&nbsp; netsh.exe&nbsp; under&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; and kill it that way.&nbsp; I couldn't even use Task Manager in this state.&nbsp; But something else was obviously
 wrong so I had to reboot.&nbsp; Now there is no problem (except that I am having to do extra work to recover from that outage.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, see if you get anything from the above command.&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess is that you will, so then, same as me, just need to start your Wi-Fi connection manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Download Mail&#47;Calendar app from Store. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Download Mail&#47;Calendar app from Store.</h2>
                    <p>Because of a problem with Mail, following an engineer's procedure the Mail app was removed, then&nbsp;to be re-installed from Store.</p>
<p>At the Store I clicked the app and it prepared to download then stopped with nothing showing on the progress bar. It stated 'Try that again. Something went wrong. Error Code Ox80072CFB'. Tried again several times, same thing. Tried to click on Install, failed,
 stated 'Try that again' etc. Also stated was 'You own this product and you can install it on this device'.</p>
<p>Tried wsreset.exe to no avail.</p>
<p>Is this a problem with the Store (maybe a very busy server or something) or a problem at my end? Please advise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I notice after clicking Windows 10&nbsp;'Start' there is a heading 'Recently Added'. Under this is 'Mail and Calendar'.</p>
<p>When 'Mail and Calendar' is clicked a screen opens&nbsp;titled 'Downloads and Installs'. It again states 'Try again....'</p>
<p>Doing so again gives progress bar of download but nothing happens except 'Try that again....'</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Now I've noticed the 'Edit' in the initial query above. Sheesh.)</p>

            <p>This has sorted itself out.</p>
<p>I went to check Store for Mail and found it. It said I already owned it.</p>
<p>I checked and the app had been downloaded, automatically as I didn't do it.</p>
<p>Where the app went to in the interim I have no idea but at least the app is back on my Windows 10.</p>
