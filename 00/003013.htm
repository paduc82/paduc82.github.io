<h2>            I am getting emails from &#34;invalid&#34; email addresses and I can&#39;t block them</h2>
                    <p>I'm starting this as a new topic in the hope that someone from Outlook will take notice and give a sensible reply this time. (I'm not holding my breath, by the way). Many other people have this problem and I've yet to see a reply from anyone associated with
 Outlook or MSN that actually addresses the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, like many others, I get loads of emails on a daily basis from senders that I can't block.&nbsp; The address of the sender usually starts &lt;info&nbsp; and ends with another &gt;.&nbsp; These email addresses cannot be blocked as Outlook says that the address is invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my settings set to exclusive so that only safe senders get through to my Inbox, but I still have to check my Junk folder in case anything gets sent there by mistake, especially if they're new contacts which I've yet to add as safe senders.&nbsp; All of
 my anti-virus and malware software is up to date, I have taken every security precaution mentioned by so-called "experts" and "moderators" in other threads but still this stuff gets through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the answers I've seen on other threads, generally, are useless. Telling us to do something we've already done is a waste of their time and ours! I've also never seen anyone from Outlook or MSN answer the question many of us have also asked:&nbsp; "WHY
 DOES THIS STUFF GET THROUGH IF IT'S FROM AN INVALID EMAIL ADDRESS?" Yes, I'm shouting that question!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, like many others, I'm considering giving up Outlook.&nbsp; It's going to be a real pain if I do, as I have two Outlook email addresses, one for work and one for personal stuff and I get this problem with both of them.&nbsp; I wonder if that's why nothing gets
 done?&nbsp; They know a lot of us just can't be bothered to move our email elsewhere.</p>

            <p>The fact that you see &lt;someaddress&gt; is not what makes the address invalid. Having a string enclosed in &lt;&gt; in a sender address is perfectly legitimate. Moreover, trying to block an address on a message already being delivered to the Junk Email folder is pointless
 because the message is already being "blocked" as far as Outlook.com is concerned. Blocking doesn't mean the message won't be delivered. It means it will be delivered to the Junk Email folder. Since that's already happening, there's nothing more you need to
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some examples of <strong>valid&nbsp;</strong>email addresses are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"very.(),:;&lt;&gt;[]\".VERY.\"very@\\ \"very\".unusual"@strange.example.com</span></p>
<p><span>#!$%&amp;'*+-/=?^_`{}|~@example.org<br />
</span><span>"()&lt;&gt;[]:,;@\\\"!#$%&amp;'-/=?^_`{}| ~.a"@example.org</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also that what you see in the From header isn't related in any way to the address that actually sent the mail, although legitimate mailers are kind enough to include the actual sender's address in the From. The mail systems spammers use are generally
 not kind.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Brian.&nbsp; It's actually the most pertinent reply from people like yourself that I've seen so far on this topic. But it was my understanding that "blocked" emails didn't get through at all, not even to the Junk folder.&nbsp; To quote what it
 says on the Blocked Senders screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"If you don't want to receive email from a sender or domain, add the address to the box below, click the plus (+), then save."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely that means they shouldn't even be getting into the Junk folder?&nbsp; Arriving in the Junk folder means that they
<strong>HAVE</strong> been received!&nbsp; <em>I would point out that it's only the Junk folder that has "Block" as an option on the Menu bar.
</em>Why is it there if not to block unwanted emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very annoying to have to trawl through all of this rubbish in my Junk folder, just to check in case some valid emails have been diverted there, if a new sender hasn't been added as"safe" yet.&nbsp; Why are they still getting through if the sender's address
 is invalid? Why doesn't Outlook prevent this?</p>

 a message to Outlook.com address. Adding that new address to the blocked list caused the message to show up in my Junk Email folder. I also found a Microsoft support page that says, "</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">The blocked

<p>Why, do I get mail in my inbox that I don't want and when I try to block it it says the action can't be performed because it is an invalid email address but, yet it makes it to my inbox (but) when I try to reply back, it says I can't do that? Shouldn't that
 be a two way street? In other words, if it's allowed to enter my inbox, isn't it only fair that I should be able to reply back and tell them that I do not wish to receive their unwanted mail? If the unwanted mail is allowed to reach my box by Microsoft, shouldn't
 I also have the option to reply back? Just not right!!!</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am also getting excessive amounts of these emails</p>
<p>Yes they are in the junk folder BUT the key here is I don't ever want them on my machine usually they are selling services which are questionable at best if not illegal / offensive&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to be able to go into my junk folder</p>
<ol>
<li>Select and move email which is not junk - can do</li><li>Delete junk - can do</li><li>Block stuff I don't ever want on my machine - cannot do</li></ol>
<p>Why can't outlook allow me to block these &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; the &lt;&gt; prevent me from blocking (also starting with a none alpha-numeric can't be blocked)</p>
<p>If outlook would allow this I could sort through my junk folder without having to wade through loads of offensive and inappropriate email</p>

            Stopping the delivery of incoming messages can be done only from the server. Since Microsoft owns the server, only they can control what gets blocked form delivery or not. As far as your own mailbox is concerned, Microsoft has decided that "blocking" on
 a mailbox level means delivery to the Junk Email folder. If you don't like that, then use the Feedback option at Outlook.com to let Microsoft know you want additional control.

<p>Just give your phone some time cause generally the phone data including the maps cache gets cleared or rested... For each time you get a fix the next time you will get a faster fix till you reach a certain limit and this is all subject to weather conditions.
 So just try getting fixes no matter how long it takes and take help of Assisted GPS.</p>

 doesn't remove the pane).</p>

<p>1. Put the reading pane at the bottom instead of the side. This makes your email space wider, but shorter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Look to the top rightof the email and you should see an up arrow, down arrow and black-and-white box. Clicking on this box turns on
<strong>Full View</strong> to give you the most view of your email (and it does cover the ad pane on the right). but this only temporary - you have to close it (with the x) to get back to your Inbox, although you can use those arrows to move up and down your
 inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panels on the left that show you Inbox and folders can't be removed either. (Except as above, the Inbox is temporarily removed if you use
<strong>Full View</strong>).</p>

            <p>One of the MVPs on this forum has said that the ads and pane are removed when you are using Hotmail Plus/Ad-free Outlook.com, however I have noticed only the ads being removed, not the pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only other suggestion is to "zoom in". Press CTRL and the plus key. This makes everything on the page a bit larger. It may help you to read your email better. However, it actually makes the email box itself smaller, and you will have to scroll more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the limit of my knowledge on this. Sorry I can't be of more help.</p>

<p>My reply is to offer my suggestions and should not be taken as criticizing Woodg's post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Reading pane cannot be Off if you want the ad pane hidden when reading an email full screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Reading pane is on the right, the message list goes to a two line view.&nbsp; You can move the divider between the message list and the Reading pane.&nbsp; I find that shrinking the Reading pane to expose more message list shows more messages and does not look
 as cluttered.&nbsp; If I want to look for a message, I prefer the Reading pane Off or to the right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change the Reading pane from Off to right or bottom, click on the Gear icon, ......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Double clicking on an email in the message list also opens the email Full view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Folder pane can not be hidden, it can be resized.&nbsp; The divider can be moved.</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem as pklady, and each document I print only prints half the page because of this horrible right-hand sidebar. I have no advertisements on there, so there's no need for it. And even in the days when there were advertisements, the
 user always had the option of pressing the red X bar. This is pathetic. </p>
<p>Outlook will lose users with this forced right hand sidebar. You're supposed to cater to what users want and give them the option of deleting what they don't want. I live in South Africa and am not prepared to pay the US$20 fee to remove the sidebar - not
 just for the reason that users shouldn't have to pay to remove it, but also because the exchange rate for me is 10 times this fee. It is really unfair of Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Data Validation - Pasting a list while sheet is protected</h2>
                    
<p>I need to allow users to copy and paste a data validation list (from a selection of three possible lists) in a protected sheet. Even when the relevant cells are set to unprotected (format cell option), as soon as the sheet is set to protected, it will copy
 and paste the cell contents and format, but it will not paste the validation list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to allow pasting a validation list in a protected sheet?</p>

 and to select either a checkbox for "yes" or a checkbox for "no".&nbsp; I would like to set a rule that would require the user to enter a start and end date in two date fields&nbsp;if the 'yes' checkbox is selected.

<br />
<br />I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />Turn off folder protection for the Documents folder in the OneDrive app. That will use the documents folder on your computer that isn't inside the OneDrive  folder.

</p><p>I can only turn off folder protection at the top-most level --&gt; "Documents" or "Pictures" or "Desktop" and not a subfolder? Also doesn't this remove all the file that are in This PC&gt;Documents? Is there a way to turn off folder for just a subfolder under
 "Documents"?</p>

            when you sign into the OneDrive app, it creates a folder called OneDrive on your computer. Inside that folder is also a documents folder. After this, your computer has two documents folders, that one inside the OneDrive folder and the original documents folders that was there before that.
<br />
<br />Turning on folder protection makes your computer use the one inside OneDrive, while turning it off, makes your computer use the other documents folder instead.

            You can't without getting a reflash from a Nokia Care store. Nokia say they will release them. If you have done a hard reset be prepared for problems like Social missing from your phone and not being able to use Ovi Store and Maps. There are threads in
 the forum for solution for the last three issues. Please search.

<h2>            Help&#33; I&#8217;m being inundated with junk emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help me! I’m being inudated with close to a hundred junk emails a day, of which the majority are inapproriate and distressing! I’ve spent hours reserching how to stop this and have actioned setting up safe senders lists, blocking IP
 addresses, setting filters, applying rules, reporting all of them to MS, but they are still coming in thick and fast, to the point I’m very close to closing my msn email, although I’ve had my address for so many years! 1. Is there anyway you can ensure you
 block emails even getting through to your junk folder or the inbox with certain words i.e. sexy etc. as I mentioned, I’ve set up rules based on the body and content of the email, but they are still coming through! So that hasn’t worked</p>
<p>2. Can you stop receiving junk emails if you choose to?</p>
<p>It’s just so upsetting! It’s only been in the last year this had happened but it’s now getting to the point that it’s stressful spending hours at the weekend blocking mail, and reporting it, only to receive hundreds more with the same content.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help provided!</p>

<p>Hi Aram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Spam or junk emails are usually being sent by automated systems. With that in mind, it may contain unique contents from unique senders which make it possible to bypass your sweep rules. While there's no way to block these junk emails, we can only tell you
 to be careful with your activities online. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the emails are probably newsletter from different websites that you visit. Chances are, there are Unsubscribe link that you can click to stop receiving updates. Check this

            Thank you for the reply. However as mentioned in the question, the rules I have set are not working. I’m still receiving emails with those words in. This is nothing to do with spam in regards to websites I visit, this is inapproriate disgusting emails
 and not something relates to any websites I would visit. I think I’m just going to have to close my MSN account and go to a different provider, which is a shame!

<p>I’m so sorry you’re having the same trouble. I really wish mircosoft would set up some sort of filter to automatically stop this happening. What you’ve described is exactly what I’m receiving and they shouldn’t even get through to us. I’m thinking of now
 switching to google. I hear they have much better filters. It’s still free. Such a shame to have to close an account you’ve had for years, and not an easy task transferring emails, notifying everyone etc. but it would be much better than getting these dreadful
 emails.</p>
<p>I hope you get it sorted. Im so upset about the whole situation&nbsp;</p>

            You're wasting your time trying to set up filters/rules or blocking email. Those haven't worked for anyone (that I know of) for at least a year.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't care that we get this junk email. &nbsp; I often forward those emails to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;

                    I am receiving the error in the subject line when I open a database that is both split and encrypted. The code stopping and the '3031' error occuring when the form nominated to open on opening of the database, opens and the first line of code is executed.<br />
<br />
I've searched through some of the other issues that are similiar with an underlying thread of a password length greater than 14 characters. I can confirm that my password is only nine characters in length.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<h2>            Lumia 730 dual sim &#40;RM-1040&#41;, India - Serious issues after firmware upgrade through WDRT</h2>
                    <p>Friends,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>about a week ago, i upgraded the firmware of my Lumia 730 dual sim from .02004 to .53005</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this upgrade, I have been facing some serious issues, like,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The brightness control is gone. it always remains high, no matter what i do</p>
<p>- the battery drains really fast, even during standby</p>
<p>- the screen heats up, due to brightness i guess&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Very critical, if you restart the phone, it goes into boot-loop for at least 4 to 5 times and sometimes to my horror, infinite</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried quite a few things to resolve this, namely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- updating the phone to Windows 10, that made the problem really really worst, so downgraded it again</p>
<p>- Hard reset, soft reset the phone, few different occasions</p>
<p>- have done re-installation of firmware through WDRT, more than one </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after i have done lot of research and after talking to few of my friends and even repair guys, I have come to conclusion that I need to downgrade to previous firmware version, i.e. .02004 , desperately, if I may add. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the million dollar question is, where do i get the FFU file for the same? I searched a lot, not getting anywhere. Please help, this is desperate plea.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Digi&nbsp;</p>

            Of course I'm not suggesting that you should exit without saving changes. Just save the document under a different file name, if necessary. Then try the rest of my response.

<p>If this was a rare occurrence, I would agree, but it happens a lot. I don't want to keep saving doc under new names to my desktop, and replacing the old ones later. I'd like to know why it keeps happening. One of my users says it happens pretty much everyday.

</p><p>I'm trying to figure out if it is a network issue or a software issue. It is common enough that MS has developed an error message specifically for the problem, I'm just trying to understand why it happens.</p>

    <title>How to force custom color scheme&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aroeiradailha  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to force custom color scheme&#63;</h2>
                    I am using PowerPoint 2010. Most users are in PowerPoint 2007, but a few are in 2010. Regardless of the version, the design templates and also design themes are not saving the custom color theme I created and applied for them. Our custom corporate color
 scheme only works on my machine. Once someone opens the template or uses it to create a new slide show the colors revert to PowerPoint's default blank presentation colors.<br />
<br />
How can I ensure my custom colors travel with the design template/design theme? <br />
<br />

            <p>You can add custom colors to the color theme in PPT 2007 and 2010. You have to edit the XML to do so, but it's totally doable. I do it for my corporate clients all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if you mean you created a color theme and you're concerned because it doesn't show up in the Design Tab | Colors dropdown, well...that's by design. It doesn't show up there because the color theme is built into the template and will show up in the color
 pickers. That is assuming, of course, that you appled that color theme to your template. (Just select it from the color dropdown on your computer.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, what <em>exactly</em> do you mean when you say that it doesn't show on other users' computers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or are you trying to create a second color theme that travels with the template?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, you don't need an add-in or macro-enabled anything. Check the link to my site that John already posted:

<p>It depends on what version of Skype the PC has. Skype for Windows 10 that's from the Microsoft Store and built into the W10 Operating System starts automatically as long as Skype has been signed in with a Microsoft Account either upon signing into Windows
 or by launching the Skype app and logging in once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the PC has Skype Classic, you just need to launch Skype once and log in. Once you're logged in, just down log out from inside either program and it will stay running in the background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more help, figure out what Windows their PC has and what Skype they're running. Holding down the Microsoft key on the keyboard and hitting the Pause/Break key in the top right corner of keyboard will tell you. Starting Skype app and clicking
 your profile picture (top left) then going to About this version will show it. Starting Skype Classic and going to Help, About Skype will work there.</p>

                    I have Office 2007 and in the Word program under the Review tab in the Tracking section I have removed all check marks from the Track Changes Options.&nbsp; I select the Final option and remove all checkmarks from the Show Markup dropdown menu.&nbsp; The next time
 I change something in the document I'm working on it reverts back to that "Final Showing Markup" and all of the checkmarks are back on the Show Markup dropdown.&nbsp; I hate losing part of my wokring area beccuase of tht tracking pane.&nbsp; Is there any way at all
 to make the changes I make to Tracking to stay permanent?

<p>By default, Word will redisplay tracked changes, in particular when you re-open the document after it has been closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can control the behavior to a certain extent by clearing the option "Make hidden markup visible when opening or saving" in Trust Center. After you have done that, Word will save some of the view options for tracked changes with the document. Note, however,
 that the "Make hidden markup visible..." option does not travel with the document. In other words, if you send the document to someone else, they will see the markup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To display Trust Center, first display the Word Options dialog box, and then click Trust Center | Trust Center Settings. Go to the Privacy Options category for the "Make hidden markup visible..." option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the only safe way to get rid of markup is to accept changes and turn off the tracking.</p>

    <title>Account Blocked when trying to place a call to US - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account Blocked when trying to place a call to US</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community! I want you to help solve my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I authorized my Virtual Assistant who is in Venezuela to manage my Skype account to call my customers here in US. What I understood at first was that I have to pay a subscription for landlines and mobile phone lines calls for North America, which I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She could communicate barely with us the first day, but couldn't then. Every time she wanted to place a call to our office, for example, a message appeared saying "Account Blocked - Call Ended". Then, I added a credit balance and she continued with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She decided to used a VPN app, and was the same situation. Turned off the app and decided to contact the Skype Support Team by chat. Right now, the problem is apparently solved, but at the practice, she continues with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can we do? What's the real cause of this problem? This is affecting my teamwork productivity!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for answers, thanks!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend taking the phone to a Nokia Care Service point for refurbising/reflashing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SW reinstallation on Nokia Suite does not touch those applications (it only reinstalls the phone software, not the additional content) and thus that method will not unfortunately fix the problem... :(</p>

                    I keeping getting junk mail that I tried to block with the junk mail settings. It's starts with on email that states "this is a trusted source, open immediately". With in a few minutes after I send to junk mail, I getting 4-5 more junk emails from different
 sites. This happens at least twice a day. The website domains and addresses constantly change, making it almost impossible to keep adding to the blocked junk mail list.

<p>Perhaps this:<br />

To check the unique Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Media Access Control (MAC) address that identifies your Nokia device, enter *#62209526# in the idle mode (or with touch screen devices after opening the dialler).</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Technician removed CSRSS.exe and offered to install &#34;microsoft network security&#34; for 300&#36; for all our computers. True or hoax&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft community!.. my GF received a call from what is possibly a microsoft technician regarding issues with her online account (hotmail mainly) ... He told her that hackers from Australia, Mexico and Spain tried (some successfuly, some not) to enter
 her computer and get access to her cookies... Soo he had her son installed teamviewer, got access to her computer and... removed the "threat" which was CSRSS.exe (in the windows/system32)... Then of course, out of his generosity, offered to clean all our computers
 of this so called trojan, for as little as 300$... claiming he would install a microsoft network security software... because my current software (ESET) was not able to catch it... So even though I had warned them up front that I doubted that a microsoft technician
 would call out of the blue, this last thing rang a bell and I told them not to buy anything.. that microsoft did ship out with a firewall protection (She has windows 8.1 pro)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sooo... can anyone confirm my fear, that this was indeed a hoax, and what kind of damage could they have done.. (they came in by teamviewer, the free version, so I assume they were not able to transfer any files, right?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx for your help..</p>
<p>

            <p>Long running scam! &nbsp;And it's well publicized also - it was mentioned on our local news (again) a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Consider all personal and financial information in the computer to be compromised and take appropriate action. Notify financial institutions of this transgression, change credit card account passwords (maybe she needs to change accounts period) and try to
 get the credit card company to not pay these fraudulent charges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove Team Viewer (a legitimate application) since it's no longer needed and scan the computer for malware. &nbsp;Assuming it's a new computer (Windows 8) a fresh/reset/ restore would be a good idea.</p>

 "Update and Restart" and both times it restarted 15002.</p>

</p><p>I went into Windows update and it said it would Restart on a schedule several hours into this evening, and I initiated the Restart from the button there - that finally worked and after 3 reboots (IIRC) and about 30-45 minutes, I was finally running on 15007.</p>

<h2>            Why is using Onenote so much harder than Evernote&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to like OneNote but I just can't understand why a company with the resources of Microsoft hasn't developed its own processes for getting information into OneNote and making them as simple to use as Evernote.<br />
- no Microsoft approved clipper from Firefox to OneNote<br />
- no ability to email clippings or anything else into OneNote <br />
- no ability to send from Android app to OneNote<br />
I could go on...<br />
<br />
The whole point of using a note taking or information compiling resource is to be able to get information and data into the resource as simply and efficiently as possible, no matter what platform you're using (PC, smartphone, tablet, etc.).&nbsp; This just seems
 pretty fundamental to me and yet OneNote lacks these capabilities.&nbsp; There's just no excuse for these shortcomings.&nbsp; Someone on the OneNote team needs to get an Evernote account to see what the possibilities are.<br />
