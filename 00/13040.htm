<h2>            Windows 10 - lost my access contacts and calendar</h2>
                    <p>I blindly accepted an installation this afternoon of software on my phone and it seems I am now the lucky owner of Windows 10 on my Lumia 930.</p>
<p>Problem is, I have lost my access to all my contacts and my calendar (but still have access to OneDrive for my pictures). I have added my hotmail-account number of times now and switched my phone off and on again.... but nothing. How can I get my calendar
 and contact back on my phone????</p>

            <p>I had the same issue yesterday when I tried the update for the first time.</p>
<p>You can read what I did on this post <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdupdate/lumia-930-win-10-update-issues/e232cede-72d9-49e0-b5a0-ea2617264ef9" title="I just tried the update to win 10 and ended up using the recovery tool to go back to 8.1. After the update I lost all of my phone contacts, texts, emails and calendar entries. Clock alarms were still there though. Phone contacts were no where to be found. I managed to setup my email account and it did sync at first with the mail server then failed to start the mail app everytime after that. I cant remember the error code it came up with. Sometimes when trying to select an icon on the home screen it would take me to the app list. it was as if the phone thought I had swiped left. Anyway I am back to 8.1 with only 1 minor issue. Hopefully the update will get sorted out soon and I can try it again. Anyone else seeing these issues?">
<p>Some people suggest doing a hard reset but it did not work for me first time around but you could try it.</p>
<p>Do hard reset. Allow phone to reboot then go to store app and allow phone to do all app updates. Reboot phone and see if they have all magically reappeared.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as i can see, this phone does not have the feature of showing who the incoming caller is?&nbsp; It just shows CALL.</p>
<p><br />
Can someone confirm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read somewhere that this may have something to do with my network?</p>

            Yes its right that caller id showing incoming call details is completely dependant on ur network service provider. Its a service called Caller Line Identification Presentation (<em>CLIP</em>) and has to be activated by ur service provider........ nothing
 to do with the device

 gone back to windows 8.1, the ports are still not working. I have done the trouble shooting, it did not help. The site would not refund the purchase and now my computer is also not working probably.

            <p>Hello xiaochun898</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why you purchased a copy of Windows 10 if you already&nbsp;own Windows 8.1 as it is available free of charge as an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this doesn't solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should boot your computer into 'System Setup' and make sure that the USB ports are 'Enabled'</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer has a DVD drive, you should use that drive to install Windows 10.&nbsp; During installation, Windows will correct the problem with USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 HTML Links Opening from Local Cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klipp_81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 HTML Links Opening from Local Cache</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having a problem with HTML links&nbsp;opening from Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I'm currently running Windows 8.1 Update 1, and noticed this started happening after the update 1 update.&nbsp; Basically, if someone were to send me a link in&nbsp;Outlook&nbsp;to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com</a> I could click it, and it would open up in IE11 with the address of
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a> , instead, it opens up IE11 and a local address is in the address bar such as c:\users\username\appdata\local\Microsoft\windows.... and then fails to open.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this issue
 and had any success in fixing it?&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional notes;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a desktop running IE11 and Office 2010 and it seems to be fine, so this may be an OS issue with update 1.&nbsp; If this need to be moved, please do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

            The issue has been resolved.&nbsp; There was a group of Microsoft&nbsp;patches that were ready to be installed, and once done the hyperlink functionality started to work again.&nbsp; I'm not sure which patch did it, but it now seems to be resolved.&nbsp; Long story short,
 if you're experiencing this issue, make sure that your device is completely up-to-date with Microsoft patches and this should resolve it.

<p>
</p><p><span>To make&nbsp;an email address primary, first we need to create&nbsp;the email id. We cannot create an email id which starts with numbers, if you attempt to do so you will receive the following error message:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>With no Alphabets anywhere: </strong>"Your email address can contain only letters, numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), and underscores (_). It can't contain special characters, accented letters, or letters outside the Latin alphabet."</p>

            Yes it happens with picture too so it must be a sleep issue. As I mentioned it wasn't an issue with previous builds.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by an incompatible or problematic display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, boot your computer in safe mode and uninstall your graphics driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're unable to boot your computer into normal mode, we recommend booting into safe mode through the Advanced Startup Options:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn off your computer, then turn it back on.</li><li>As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button (4-5 seconds) until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>It should give you the message: <em>Preparing Automatic Repair</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>On the next screen, choose&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Startup Settings</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Select Restart.</li><li>Press the <strong>4 </strong>or the <strong>F4 </strong>key on your keyboard to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, press <strong>5 </strong>or <strong>F5 </strong>to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to boot into safe mode, follow the steps below to reinstall your graphics driver:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open the <strong>Run </strong>dialog box.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter </strong>to open<strong> Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your display adapter and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Choose<strong> Delete the driver software for this device</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once done, open the <strong>Run </strong>dialog box again (by pressing <strong>
Windows key + R).</strong></li><li>Type <strong>msconfig </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Boot </strong>tab.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Safe boot.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Windows will automatically reinstall the driver upon restart.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

If you do not see a drop down arrow next to All, your People page has been updated.<br />
<br />
There has been a recent change in the People page and part of the update was the steps in managing your Groups.<br />
</b><br />
The dropdown option or filter for Groups next to the word <strong>All</strong> on top left corner of the page has been removed.
<br />
Hence, the Groups are viewable or accessible by scrolling down your contacts list as&nbsp;it conforms with the alphabetical arrangement of your contacts.
<br />
Furthermore, the creation of a new Group is under the dropdown button next to the option
<strong>New </strong>in the command bar of your People window. <br />
The steps in adding and deleting members in your Groups are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Go to your People page. </li><li>Locate and click the group name in your contact list. </li><li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> in the command bar on top of the page. </li><li>To delete a member of the group, click the <strong>X</strong> button at the bottom right of your contact's picture.</li><li>To add a member, type the contact's name in the <strong>Add member</strong> box and click the desired contact from the dropdown option.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>. </li></ol>

<h2>            Outlook.com Android App Not Properly Syncing All E-mails</h2>
                    <p>I only noticed today, but with the on going recent issues with Outlook services I'm not sure if its been happening since the start.<br />
<br />
On my Samsung Galaxy S3 Outlook.com Android App I am not able to sync all my e-mails, some messages appear but the majority do not. I do NOT have the same issue with the web version or Windows 8 App.<br />
<br />
Here are some screenshots<br />

<br />
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/YRCoXdO.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com Web Version Screenshot</a> *<br />
<br />
You'll notice that in the Web Version I have 3 messages in my Inbox but the Android App is only showing 2 messages. The issue is not limited to my inbox only --- its affecting all my folders.<br />
<br />
*I had edited the screenshot to remove any personal information</p>

<h2>            How to fix Microsoft Security Essentials &#40;recurrent app&#39;s service stopped when running full scan&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is a brand new computer with windows 7 professional and Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a regular basis (daily and sometimes multiple times per day)&nbsp;I update MSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this week and today I ran MSE as a full scan and encountered problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stopped during the scan.&nbsp; Then MSE was no longer monitoring for virus protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the scan is running in full scan mode it may unexpectedly stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then MSE is no longer monitoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the link below are snipping tools of the malfunction today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aaiq0pyws03tk0x/AADpJlQXp9Q4I8EeKaQ8s3SXa?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come MSE is malfunctioning?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can MSE be fixed so that it no longer unexpectedly stops in full scan mode?</p>

    <title>automatic update of links - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifer71  say:</h3>
<h2>            automatic update of links</h2>
                    
<p>Its been awhile, but I thought I could have two independant workbooks.</p>
<p>Workbook/File A could contain data.</p>
<p>Workbook/File B contain calculations based on data in workbook A.</p>
<p>Workbook A could be maintained by others and I would not have to open it&nbsp;once I wrote the calculations.</p>
<p>When I try to do this, I get a message bar at the top of my calculations workbook that reads "automatic update of links"</p>
<p>When I enable them, all my formula results turn to value#.</p>
<p>The data is only updated if I open that workbook.</p>
<p>I can not easily move my calculations into that workbook, some&nbsp;else wrote some VBA that I am not familiar with and I get an error message.</p>
<p>Workbook A is Excel 2007</p>
<p>Workbook B is Excel 2003</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            Not all formulas can work with an unopened workbook. A direct link (aka, =Other_Cell) will work just fine. Some lookup formulas work. Others, such as SUMIF, will not work.<br />
My recommendation would be to use a sheet in workbook 2 to simply "pull over" the data from workbook A. Then perform your calculations off of this sheet.

<p>Like Luke says, you would probably be better off pulling the data from Workbook A, (or multiple Workbook "A's")&nbsp;into Workbook B to do the calculations and then you could delete it.&nbsp; However, Workbook A should be saved as an .xls file to be compatible with
 XL2003.&nbsp; Then again, if you would like everything to be in XL2007, you could open Workbook B in XL2007 and wherever the macros crash, just come here with the problem and someone will help .............</p>

</p><p>There's no available option to print out call logs and chat&nbsp;history using the Skype version 8. You can copy and paste it to a word document, as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tap and hold on a message you received or the call logs, and then tap a message option from the menu to copy the messages.</p>

<h2>            WPRT firmware installation failed in Lumia520</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a lumia 520 and its OS crashed by its own.</p>
<p>It was in windows 8.1 denim version.</p>
<p>and now, just a cyan color screen appears after NOKIA logo.</p>
<p>I tried to recover it by using windows phone recovery tool,</p>
<p>the whole process went well,</p>
<p>i was able to download the whole firmware package,</p>
<p>then it asked if my battery is more than 25% or not,</p>
<p>then it starting installing the package,</p>
<p>a bigger than normal size NOKIA logo appeared,</p>
<p>but, before the installation could start,</p>
<p>it failed.</p>
<p>And it displayed,&nbsp;</p>
<p>' software package installation result</p>
<p>operation ended with failure'</p>
<p>(I'm also attaching a screenshot of the same)</p>
<p>I tried it several times, it went through the same procedure.</p>
<p>I tried changing the USB cables and different PCs also,</p>
<p>but it was repeating in the same way.</p>
<p>Don't know how can I get my Lumia back to work.</p>

                    Is there a way to turn off Adobe Flash on Windows RT? Internet browsing on the Surface can get kind of sluggish, especially on Flash-heavy websites. Thanks.

            <p>I've seen so recent few posts on this well-known problem with PDFs and 64-bit Internet Explorer that I assumed that it had been resolved by updates from either Microsoft or Adobe, but this registry edit was the fix a few months ago...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This registry edit has fixed this problem for many 64-bit IE10/IE11 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Work slowly and carefully and create the registry backup that I mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start&gt; Run, type in regedit and hit Enter.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the left pane of the regedit window, select Computer, right-click it and choose Export. Save that REG file to the desktop. That's your backup. By double-clicking or right-clicking&gt; Merging that REG file you can restore the registry and undo changes, if
 necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You navigate the registry just like you would drill down through a folder structure to get to a specific file (key.) Just click the + to open the next level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start&gt; Run&gt; type in REGEDIT and hit Enter.</p>
<p>By clicking in the [+} drill down to</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</p>
<p>&nbsp; Software</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main</p>
<p>With Main selected in the left pane, right-click in the right pane and choose New&gt; DWORD (32-bit)</p>
<p>Name the new DWORD Value <strong>TabProcGrowth</strong> then right-click it and set the value to 1.</p>
<p>If <strong>TabProcGrowth</strong> already exists (you didn't have to create it) just change the value from 0 to 1.</p>
