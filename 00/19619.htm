<h2>            Windows XP sync</h2>
                    Had to do a reboot of system. Reloaded my Windows XP office. When I attempt to sync my Verizon smart phone&nbsp;&amp; HP IPAQ I get "Outlook is not installed on PC". I have reset partnerships several times with soft reboot of both mobile devices as well as disconnecting
 cradel and reboot of PC. The problem is I lost my contacts on both the PC and phone. The IPAQ list is intact and would like to resync everything. Can anyone help?

<h2>            New APPS</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand that Microsoft is such a big organization then why we are not getting new apps in our store.</p>
<p>If I say then the problem is that, the developers of that app are not developing for windows phone.</p>
<p>Then why should we get impacted because of your terms if you (Microsoft) is unable to satisfy users need why don't you just give up??</p>
<p>Please guys we have wasted our money to buy phones.</p>
<p>It is quite shameful when we are left behind with this kind of issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>According to</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>the largest market of mobile apps is Google Play, which has over 1 million apps available for Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the link above, the second largest market of mobile apps is the App Store, which has 650,000 apps available for Apple iPhone/iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the link above, Windows&nbsp;Phone Store&nbsp;has 120,000 apps available for Windows Phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is up to the mobile device developers to decide what platform to develop on.&nbsp; As the top two platforms are&nbsp;Google Play (Android) and the App Store (Apple) this is probably why most app developers keep going to these two platforms, as they are the two
 most popular platforms.&nbsp; I think most app developers will simply look at the market leaders, and go with the top two (Android/Apple) mobile device markets, and will NOT go with Windows phones at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for me personally, I have an iPad, and Android tablet, and a Windows Phone, and thus I enjoy apps that I have downloaded from all three platforms.&nbsp; However, as would be expected by the market data from the link above, I have only found a few apps I like
 for Windows phone, while I have found lots of apps I like for my iPad/Android tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can only&nbsp;have one mobile device, and must have a very high number of apps available, I would suggest going with Android.&nbsp; I think Android mobile devices work fairly well, and a huge number of apps are&nbsp;available.&nbsp; As for iPads, although they do have
 a huge number of apps available, I personally, just do not like the way iPads work.&nbsp; I also have an iPhone via my work place, which is locked-out for any app downloads, and I really do not like my iPhone very much.&nbsp; I love the way Windows phones work, and
 in-spite of the lack of apps available, I have chosen Windows for my personal mobile phone (if I want to run apps, I use&nbsp;my iPad and Android tablets).&nbsp; However, I can understand the frustration you might have,&nbsp;if all you have is a Windows phone, due to the
 small number of&nbsp;apps available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a few&nbsp;notes for further explanation of what I am saying: I think Windows phone&nbsp;is the best mobile phone, in the way that&nbsp;it works.&nbsp; However, if&nbsp;you want a phone that has a very high number of applications available, and if you are&nbsp;OK with the phone
 just working "OK", then I would recommend an Android phone.&nbsp; In other words, in my opinion, if you must have a very high number of applications available, and are OK with the phone only working "OK", then go with an Android phone.&nbsp; I personally do not like
 iPhones/iPads work very much, however I know some people who love their iPhones/iPads (thus I realize that this is basically my personal preference).&nbsp; However, I do like the&nbsp;apps I downloaded on my iPad (many are not available on Windows/Android), thus I use
 this device for those apps (in spite of other things that I do not like about my iPad/iPhone).&nbsp; As this Website is primarily for Windows devices, I will NOT go in to my opinions further here about iPhone/iPad/Android (other than the simple statement saying,
 "if you must have a ton of applications, and are willing to use a phone that just works "OK" then go with Android for your mobile device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found an app that the developer has put on all platforms that I use.&nbsp; It is called "Chess Online" and the developer is "NetVisions.r.o".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have downloaded this free "Chess Online" application on these platforms:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows Phone 8</li><li>Windows 8 (personal computer)</li><li>Windows 10 (personal computer)</li><li>iPad</li><li>Android Tablet</li></ul>
<p>My point being that&nbsp;developers sometimes&nbsp;develop an app on&nbsp;a&nbsp;large list of&nbsp;platforms, if they have&nbsp;reasons to do so, and if they take the time/effort to do so.&nbsp; I think some of reasons the developer put "Chess Online" onto a large list of platforms, is probably
 to increase the&nbsp;number of registered users, and to&nbsp;maximize profits when&nbsp;a user&nbsp;chooses to buy optional items from the site.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to add here, that in the Windows Phone 8 site, the developer says "chess online" is a "perfect tool for . . . children".&nbsp;
 However, the Windows 10 games site says about this app: "Simulated Gambling, Users Interact, Digital Purchases", and gives it an age rating of "Teen".&nbsp; By the way, "Chess Online" is also available for iPhone, although I have not tried it out on an iPhone yet
 (my iPhone is supplied by my work, and I am not allowed to install any&nbsp;apps on it).</p>

    <title>Build 10586 will not install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Build 10586 will not install</h2>
                    <p>th2_release Core 10586 does not install on my compaq presario. It says " Windows kann mithilfe von Setup nicht auf einem USB-Speicherstick installiert werden" ("= Windows cannot be installed on an USB stick"). However, there is no USB stick attached to my
 computer, but I built in a Samsung SSD drive (850 EVO) a view weeks ago and cloned the original Win10 installation to this new disk. Maybe, Setup treats the SSD as an USB stick?? How can this be solved?</p>

            <p>Hi Guenter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was your originating disk also an SSD? If not, the OS probably thinks it is still talking to an HDD, which is NOT the same. In any case it never a good idea to clone OS installations. Download the ISO (link below) and do a
<strong>Clean Install</strong>. You&nbsp;<em>can</em> do an Upgrade but I would not advise anyone in your situation to do this.</p>

            <p>Hi Dyvia,</p>
<p>thanks for your proposals, but ...</p>
<p>Neither of the proposed solutions did help. In the meantime - after some research - I found the solution in a German forum and was able to fix the problem:
</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\PortableOperatingSystem was set to "1". I changed it to "0" and now everything works fine. I have no clue which of my actions might have changed that key - at least I am sure I didn't set it with regedit.</p>
<p>Regards </p>

    <title>Lost Emails from Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogerbehagg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Emails from Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p>I have lost several thousand emails from my Outlook 2007 following a factory reset of the laptop.</p>
<p>The workshop that did the reset have provided me with a backup that allows me find the .pst files at C:/users/admin/appdata/local/microsoft/outlook and I have imported all of these back to Outlook 2007 (including all the subfolders) - there are nearly 4Gb.</p>
<p>All the emails with a date range from end of 2012 to early 2016 are missing. Can I recover these and how could they have disappeared from the .pst files when the remainder are there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't recover them from my emails server as I had cleared them from it after I had checked that in doing so they remained on my laptop in Outlook - some time before the factory reset was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help I have tried for over 6 months to find a solution and the workshop are worse than useless!!</p>

            <p>Any pst data files would have been stored on the local PC, usually, but not necessarily at the location given.</p>
<p>If the PC shop provided a backup disk containing the data files all that was necessary was for you to copy these data files to the local PC in say \My Documents\Outlook Files, then within MS Outlook opening these data files</p>
<p>Export/import loses data and various settings.</p>
<p>Other from any backup data you cannot recover anything</p>
<p>In any case you should have had your own data backups&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thanks Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup files the computer shop gave me (and I still have) I imported back into Outlook using import/export but this was when I discovered that I had the emails up to end 2012 and from mid 2016 but was missing &nbsp;2013-15 mails. I can't understand why most
 of the mails have come back but lots in this date range are missing.</p>
<p>Is this because of the data loss you mention when using "import export" from Outlook or might the 2013- 2015 mail PST files be stored somewhere else on the hard drive that we have not found and restored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any prospect of a data recovery specialist being able to recover them if I gave them my hard drive - given that it has undergone a factory reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know now that I should back up my pst files but I told the shop specifically that I had not done so and that the emails were important. They assured me that they would not be lost !!!</p>

            <p>Open these backup data files within MS Outlook, by copying them from the backup disk to My Documents\Outlook Files on the local PC then inspect the contents.</p>
<p>When you import any modified data is changed to the import data.</p>
<p>There is a default location for MS Outlook data files, but a user may have located them elsewhere</p>

            <p>Thanks again Palcouk,</p>
<p>Sorry for delayed response - I've only just been able to get back to my emails and - as you will have gathered I am not very tech savy !!</p>
<p>I cant work out how to copy to my docs/outlook files. I don't have a folder in my docs for outlook files -if I create one and then copy .pst files to it and try to open them it asks me what program to open them with but does not give me the option of outlook.
 This was why I thought the only way to see the mails was to import from the .pst files back to Outlook. That's when I got emails back until late 2012 but lost 2013/2014/2015?</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>Regards Roger</p>

<h2>            bizarre issue with attachment icons - Outlook 2016 on Windows 10 desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have a new installation of Office 2016 on a just-reset Win 10 desktop, using IMAP. &nbsp;What I am seeing is:<br />
<br />
Some emails that have attachments do not show an attachment icon.<br />
<br />
Some emails that do not have attachments do show an attachment icon.<br />
<br />
When I sort by attachment icon, the emails are sorted correctly...an email that has attachments, but no icon, is grouped at the top with emails that have both attachments and icons. &nbsp;An email that has no attachments, but no icon, is grouped at the bottom with
 emails that have neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another Win 10 desktop, the same emails show the same errors.<br />
<br />
On my iPhone accessing the same IMAP email, the attachment icons show correctly.<br />
<br />
I never noticed this issue on Office 2013.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed, I need some more information to help you better:<br />
<br />
1. Do you receive any error in Outlook while processing?<br />
2. What are the troubleshooting steps you've tried so far?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>3. </span>&nbsp;</span>Have you tried </span><span>removing and re-adding the email account</span></span><span><span>?<br />
<br />
Let's try the following methods and verify the result:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></span><strong> </strong><span><span>Start Outlook in safe mode following steps
</span></span><span><span>mentioned below and then perform Send/Receive and verify the result.
<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Outlook /safe </span></strong></span><span><span><br />
Note: There is a space between Outlook and '/'<br />
<br />
If Outlook works as expected in safe mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></span><strong> </strong><span>If issue still persists, create a new profile, configure the email account and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile:</span><span>&nbsp;

            I tried both methods and unfortunately neither worked. &nbsp;For both new and old emails, I continue to see the same behaviors. &nbsp;And as I mentioned originally, I also see it on a different desktop running Outlook 2016 and accessing the same IMAP emails.

 be informed that no one is trying to access it. Only we and the staff are using it and i have to change the password so many times. It is very annoying and irritating!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to stop this? Can someone please let me know how to solve this problem????

<h2>            Can I create an alias with a deleted Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have 2 Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete one of the accounts and make it an alias in the other account to make it easier to manage instead of having to log into 2 different accounts all the time, is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is, I am worried that once I delete the account, a previously used email address will not be available again to use as an alias. I know Gmail does not let you use a previously used address but I'm not sure about Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please advise me if it is safe to do this?</p>

    <title>Can I select a nested Contact or Calendar to sync to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brennenw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I select a nested Contact or Calendar to sync to</h2>
                    Just hooked up my new LG Incite and started the sync process with my local outlook.&nbsp; I have around 200 contacts on my SIM card that when the syncronization finished it pulled all my local Outlook contact information over onto my phone which is now a mess.&nbsp;
 I would like to keep these two contact lists separate.<br />
<br />
As a result, under my "Contacts" folder on my local Outlook, I created another contacts folder called Mobile Phone and would like to sync all of my SIM contacts into this Outlook folder and just manage my contacts viat this list.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Active Sync 4.5 isn't recognizing or allowing me to select this nested or sub contact folder on my local Outlook.&nbsp; I know other phone syncing tools (Motorolla Phone Tools) allows users to sync to subfolders.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is this an option with Active Sync

            <p>OK, that doesn't seem to be a question of missing mailmerge filters, but of the displayed content from the Excel file not including a range named 'FilterDatabase'&nbsp;you expect to see there.</p>
<p>The most likely cause is not having a <em>worksheet-level name</em> 'FilterDatabase'&nbsp;for your 'Tie Booklet-Label Others1' worksheet. Try re-applying the 'FilterDatabase' name to the 'Tie Booklet-Label Others1' worksheet.</p>

            Repairing Office certainly won't do any harm (Programs &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Change in the Windows Control Panel), but if the problem is a corrupt workbook, it won't do much good either.

</p><p>You can either get the driver from dell or realtek.&nbsp; Sometimes computer makers tweak their drivers a bit so you might want to try them first.&nbsp; If the driver you get is for win 8 set compatibility to win 8, etc.</p>

            Still no luck :( I tried from Dell and Realtek using Win 8 compatibility and I still have a red x over my speaker and a message that says no audio device. Device is disabled. Guess I will just wait for the official release to come out. Thanks for all of

<p>Yes, that's the error that CrazyKats is referring to. There is a workaround that involves increasing the driver installation timeout, but really the fix is for us (Microsoft) to correct that fact that the installation is timing out in the first place. We're
 working on it right now.</p>

<h2>            outlook.com - new ability to undo previous action such as delete. Win10</h2>
                    <p>I've just removed an email from my Inbox - something that I do frequently of course. Immediately afterwards, a short message flashed up at the bottom of the screen that gave me the option to undo my 'delete' command. [Unfortunately, it didn't remain on screen
 long enough for me to take a screen print, but I'll keep trying.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure it's a useful tool but when was it introduced and why weren't we told?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Unsure in which forum I should post this. Would a Moderator please move it if appropriate? Thanks.</p>

            Dear Taffy,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply.
<br />
<br />This is new feature in Outlook.com that allows you to undo actions done by mistake. You can find it here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/n...</a> at the bottom. If you do not want them to appear, untag the box.
<br />
<br />There is another that was available in classic version and now is also present in the new UI. The undo sending - you can set up delay sending for emails. It is controlled here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/messageContent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/mess...</a>
<br />
<br />As for Adblock please see this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> the part about Adblock. Although there is for Chrome, this is relevant to all browsers, if you excluded Outlook.com for blocking, than there should be no problem.

<h2>            Virus attack.  Under control.  Now can&#39;t view photos and SQL server error message...</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I was working with photos just yesterday then all **** broke loose.&nbsp; Superantivirus did the trick and I now have ZoneAlarm in place. I can use the internet but the photos are really screwed up and I keep getting this error message:&nbsp; "An error occurred while
 initializng SQL Server Compact.&nbsp; The database file may be corrupted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't open photos with Stylepics, from the desktop, from Picassa...Picassa gives me this message:&nbsp; "There were errors loading the database."&nbsp; And I get a string of "CBlock" error windows that I have to delete before it tells me that.&nbsp; When I try to open
 a photo from the desktop it says:&nbsp; ""Windows Photo Viewer can't open this picture because the photo viewer doesn't support this format.&nbsp; Or you don't have the latest updates to the photo viewer."&nbsp; UPDATE:&nbsp; Just realized I can view the photos in my Pictures
 file and the icons still show the pictures there.&nbsp; If a drag a photo on the desktop into the Pictures folder it still does not work.&nbsp; Also all the notepad files I created that are on my desktop have Chinese characters instead of English.&nbsp; I can save new photos
 to the desktop and they save correctly and I can open them.&nbsp; And all the photos in folders, too, on the desktop won't open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scan just finished.&nbsp; No integrity violations were found.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running an fsc scan now.&nbsp; Should I try reinstalling Windows Photo viewer?&nbsp; I found a download for Windows Photo Viewer 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I want to know why my folders are marked with a red cross. And, of course, correct it. Inside the folders instead of the green checks, I have blue clouds as icons. I want to keep my files and sync them w/o losing nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me -- I really don't understand cloud storage when it doesn't work.</p>

            hi mrcsvilela,
<br />
<br />Red Cross means a synchronization error, ill suggest to go trough each folder and sub folder to see if you can find a file with the error if any try resetting onedrive syncrhonization.
<br />
<br /> to reset Onedrive 
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows key + R. 
<br />In the Run window, enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />After 2 or 3 minutes OneDrive should start by itself, sometimes does not open.
<br />
<br />In the Run window, enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope it works       
        </p>

    <title>Standard Color Palette in EXCEL2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee cc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standard Color Palette in EXCEL2007</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Standard Color palette has only 10 colors shown under the HOME/FONT ribbon. How can I make it to show more? (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span> clicking MORE COLORS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to EXCEL OPTION/SAVE/COLORS, I can see there are about 40 colors under the Standard Color, how can I bring some of these colors to appear among the 10 displayed under HOME/FONT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. That saves me a lot of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since we can't expand the Standard Color palette, can I replace one of the 10 colors displayed in the ribbon with another desired color by using SAVE/COLOR/MODIFY in the EXCEL OPTION button?</p>

            The only way to do that is by creating your own Office theme, which is quite a daunting task. Google for Office theme editor.

            To be honest, in my opinion, using lots and lots of different colours while formatting a spreadsheet does not lead to a very good design. Less colors is better.

<h2>            Re install Office&#58; mac 2008 PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>

<p>I bought Office: mac 2008 student and home in 2010 and had no problems. I then had to get my MacBook Pro completly wiped so I lost the software. I still had the backup disc so loaded it up and went through the installation process, I had to ring Microsoft
 support for my office product key which they found from the codes on the disc. This all worked/indstalled fine. The logos for each programme apeared on the icon bar. I then click on word (for example) and then another window appears saying:
</p>

<p><em>Activate Trial or Purchase</em></p>

<p><em>"If you have a product key for office 2008, enter it below to activate your trial or purchase now"</em></p>

<p>I have rung Microsoft again and they are now saying this is an absolete product and therefore can not assist me.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2f4.5.6%2fimages%2femoticons%2fcry.gif" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2f4.5.6%2fimages%2femoticons%2fcry.gif" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2f4.5.6%2fimages%2femoticons%2fcry.gif" /></p>

<p><strong>PLEASE HELP!!!! </strong></p>

<p>Additional: When I re installed from the back up disc I entered the product key that I was re sent from Microsoft. Whilst installing I took down another product key that only includes numbers? I dont know what this is, but I have tried both product keys
 several times, in several ways </p>

<p><strong>If anyone knows what I should do please dont hesitate to reply to this message.
</strong></p>

            Ah - you have a backup disc - of your drive or of the Office installer?
<div><br />
<div>Good practice is to make a disc image of a drive before wiping it. Another good practice is to use Time Machine. &nbsp;If you have either a disc image of your old drive or a Time Machine backup of your old drive you can use Apple's Migration Assistant to restore
 your old installation of Microsoft Office.</div>
