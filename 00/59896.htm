<h2>            deleted user account and screen wants username and password</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for assistance in advanced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal&nbsp;PC at home&nbsp;never used to ask me for a&nbsp;password when&nbsp;I start it up,&nbsp;I don't remember putting it in when I took it out of the box, if I did, then&nbsp;I forgot it. now I went and I deleted the user account ( admin )&nbsp;on W7( the only one&nbsp;I had ).... went
 to RUN&gt; typed in "control userpasswords2" &gt; highlighted the account&gt;remove... the PC didn't ask if I want to keep the files or not, it just asked me to reboot later or now. I rebooted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM IS:&nbsp; after I rebooted the PC, it now wants me to put the username and password,&nbsp;I am not sure if it wants my old username and password or what? (&nbsp;I don't remember my password )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will starting up a PC on safe mode help without a boot disk ( haven't tried it yet) and what if the hidden admin account is the one I deleted, then where to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help because I have tried to put my old username that I used before&nbsp;I removed the account... what username and password does it want and what can&nbsp; I do to use my PC again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to create a bootable disk&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to create a bootable (BackUp) disk with a copy of my Windows 10 OS and the MS Key.<br />
Is this possible or do I need to buy a Windows 10 package when my Notebook crashes?

            <p>I should have mentioned that the image file is compressed, so it will occupy much less space than the data it includes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another technical detail: An image doesn't include empty areas of the hard drive. So, for example, if your hard drive is 120 GB, but only 20 GB of that are being used and the rest of the drive is empty, the image only includes the 20 GB that are being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the difference between an image and a <em>clone</em>. A clone includes even the empty space on the disk. That's vital if you're doing forensic analysis on the disk, e.g. for criminal investigations. There's a lot that law enforcement with the right
 software can find in empty space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, if you wish, image the entire hard drive, software and data. But that can cause a big inconvenience: Let's say something bad happens to Windows and you need to restore an image that you made yesterday or a few days ago. Like I wrote above, Windows
 will go back to the way it was at the time you made the image - and so will all your personal files. Any new documents you created since the last time you made the image are gone. But there is a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hard disk is a physical thing, but it can be organized into <em>partitions</em>. A partition is like a file folder in a filing cabinet. Most people don't organize their hard disk into partitions so, in effect, their hard disk consists of one big partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can organize your hard disk into partitions by <em>re-partitioning</em> your hard disk. Each partition gets its own drive letter, and Windows treats each partition
<em>as if</em> it was a separate disk, even though the partitions are all on the same disk
<em>physically</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you can see where this is going. I re-partitioned my hard disk into two partitions, one for Windows and my installed software (that's called a
<em>system partition</em>) and the other for my data - documents, music, pictures, email, bookmarks, etc. With this setup I can backup my system partition and my data partition separately. It also means that if I need to restore an image of my system partition,
 nothing happens to the data in my data partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's lots of good disk imaging software. I use Macrium Reflect because 1) it's good and 2) it has a great knowledgebase and user forum to help me figure out what to do. Imaging (and re-partitioning) is complicated. It takes a while to learn. But the results
 are fabulous.</p>

    <title>Cannot set external monitor as Primary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmspike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot set external monitor as Primary</h2>
                    Dell Precision M6500 64 bit Windows 7 running Oracle Virtual Box for Development environment running XP Professional.<br />
<br />
I originally(at the office) had the external monitor set as the Primary on my Virtual machine. I had to do some work from home(with only the laptop, no external monitor attached) After returning to the office the Primary Monitor is not the external monitor.
 I can no longer Set the external monitor as the primary. All options for doing so are greyed out in the Display Properties. Not the end of the world, but very annoying because our development tools open all new windows on the primary, so I have to reposition
 everything I open.<br />
<br />
Laptop display driver = NVIDIA Quadro FX 2800M<br />
Virtual = VirtualBox Graphics adapter<br />
Oracle VirtualBox Version = 4.1.18 r78361<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your concern. I understand that you want to add an effect on your video to make it look old-fashioned. To better assist you, I would like to gather first more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the exact version of your Movie Maker? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Movie Maker, click
<strong>About Movie Maker</strong>.</li><li>What is your operating system?</li></ul>
<p>As for the effects, to make it look old-fashioned or vintage you can try setting your filter/visual effects&nbsp;<strong>to Black and White</strong> or<strong> Sepia</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

Seriously??&nbsp; Why would MS do that?&nbsp; I'm now going to uninstall movie maker and use another software for this effect.&nbsp; So not impressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>No need to be so drastic as to uninstall Movie Maker.&nbsp; As noted above, you can install Windows Movie Maker 6.0; it can co-exist on your system with the version of Movie Maker from Windows Essentials.&nbsp; Open your footage in WMM 6.0, apply the desired Film
 Age effect and save that as new footage (File &gt; Publish Movie &gt; To your PC).&nbsp; Now use that new (or should I say "old") footage in your project as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, you can always suggest additions/improvements to Movie Maker on the <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Failed to Connect to EA Online &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<pre>Still not working consistently for me, tried all of the above, but it just works when it feels like it. This has been down for too long. Since I pay Microsoft a monthly subscription, I feel they should use their clout to get this issue addressed by EA. It's daylight robbery by EA that I can download a game from Microsoft e.g BF1943, but then not be able to play any of it. SHAME ON YOU MICROSOFT &amp; EA,  <br />XBOX Support on Twitter is no help, same cycle of questions and responses every time. I only play BF online, havn't been able to in months, you should give my money back. Corporate Thieves!!!</pre>

 ANYONE ON THE PHONE WITH A GOD DAMNED CLUE.</p>
<p>TRY RESTATING THE MODEM/ ROUTER... BLOW IT OUT YOUR EAR! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DONE IT 1000 TIMES</p>

<p>ONE FREAKING RAGHEAD TOLD ME TO DUMP ALL OF MY GAME FILES SO I GOT TO SIT AROUND HALF A DAY AND RELOAD THEM ALL... TOOL!</p>
<p>RESET THE DEFAULT SYSTEM SETTINGS...THIS IS BULLCRAP XBOX AND EAGAMES! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>FIX THE G-D THING ALREADY! YOU GUYS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DREAM THIS CRAP UP... MAKE IT WORK ALREADY! I TELL YOU I WONT SPEND ANOTHER CENT ON XBOX OR EA GAME UNTIL THIS CRAP IS STRAIGHTENED OUT. AFTER MY XBOX SUB RUNS OUT, I AM GOING BACK TO PS3. I SURELY

<p>BF3's out in four days. They're obviously doing some server shuffling down at EA. I doubt that they're ending support for BC2, there are plenty of older EA games that are still up and running. Just roll with it. Connectivity will probably be back in two
 or three days.</p>

<h2>            PC keeps randomly restarting &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I have a windows 10 Desktop PC and today it would randomly shut off out of no where, no warning at all. The screen would go black for a second then the windows logo would pop up meaning it had rebooted out of no where, this has happened 2 times. I don't
 know what's wrong. Could it be windows 10 doing this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try the troubleshooting mentioned in the below link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/resolve-windows-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/resolve-windows-blue-screen-errors</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, try the below methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking </strong>and perform the Clean Boot.<br />
Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart</strong> at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.<br />
2.Select <strong>Startup Settings </strong>and click on <strong>Restart.</strong><br />
3.After restarting, choose <strong>Enable Safe mode with networking.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.<br />
By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After Clean Boot troubleshooting step, refer to "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with Clean Boot</strong>" from the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> You may try to boot from the Windows 10 media and try performing an Automatic repair from
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 10 computer follow these steps:<br />
a) Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer<br />

            <p>I checked the Event Log and it said "Kernal - Power (Critical)" and I have two lights on my tower Blue = On, Orange = Off, and everything was on while this happened, keyboard, monitor, even the tower was on because it was blue, nothing flickered. The second
 time it happened it didn't log it the second time there was only one instance of this happening in the event log. And once again it happened two times.</p>
<p>Edit: Also I did not receive a blue screen when this happened, it just rebooted like nothing happened, no shut down screen no blue screen it just flickered black then 3 seconds later it showed the microsoft logo like it just had started up.</p>
<p>(I'll help you in anyway I can, I just really need to figure out why this happened, someone suggested it could of been my PSU shutting off the power to my utilities.)</p>

            Mine is doing the exact same thing. Seems to do it more often now. It's very annoying and just shuts off with no warning. Restarts and goes back to the main screen.

<p>
</p><p>So, can I assume you're facing problem while updating the Credit Card information on a website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, then I suspect that the problem might lies with that particular website. Moreover problem might also lies with the web browser you're trying to access it. Try accessing the website on different browser to see if the problem still happens.
 Do ensure that there shouldn't be any problem with the website which you're trying to access. I mean, website&nbsp;maintenance or downtime.</p>

                    Each time a song is added to my library, whether it's from a puchased CD or an online music MP3 website, Windows Media Player automatically creates a new Playlist for the album.&nbsp; Is there a way to prevent this?

            <p>Thanks for trying to help.&nbsp; UNfortunately, that's not the fix.&nbsp; Here's the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Media Player, there's a list of Playlists that appears on the left side of the screen.&nbsp; In the past, those Playlists listed in my Windows Media Player were only those that I personally named.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, whenever I buy a CD and rip the CD to Windows Media Player, the name of the album becomes listed as a Playlist, whether or not I've saved the songs on the CD as a Playlist.&nbsp; Also, if I buy a song online (for example,&nbsp;from Amazon), the name of the album
 on which the song appears then becomes listed as a Playlist in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm able to manually to delete each of those unitended, extraneous&nbsp;Playlists, that's a painstaking process; and even after I've manually deleted those Playlists, they reappear in Windows Media Player after I close out of Windows Media Player, and then
 re-open it,</p>

            You may have to connect the printer, with USB so it installs drivers for it. Thats what I had to do with this printer I've got here. Then type the key in (if its secure). So, I could print to it.<br />
<br />
Then I put it back in the lounge<br />
<br />
I would read the manual for it, to see what youre meant to do to connect to it<br />

            You haven't provided any information about your system.&nbsp; Did you set up file and printer sharing on your local network? Can you share files between the two computers? What operating systems are on the two computers (if Windows, what versions, including
 service pack)?<br />
<br />
At a very high level, you first have to configure things so that the printer can be shared and then you have to install the printer.&nbsp; How you go about doing these steps depends on the operating systems installed on the two computers.<br />
<br />
To save time, and assuming that you have Windows XP (Home, Pro, or Media Center) on the two computers, here is some old but still good advice from former MS MVP Malke (if you have Windows 7 on one or both of the computers, you may need to do a few things differently):<br />
<br />
The best and easiest solution is to purchase a wireless router. That way you get Internet connectivity to both machines and the added benefit of some more security between you and the Internet. Then you set up your wireless network securely, and then you set
 up file/printer sharing. Below is information about setting up a router and also doing networking. It looks lengthy but don't be daunted. Setting up a router and Local Area Network sharing between two computers takes approximately 15 minutes.
<br />
<br />
A. Router configuration <br />
Setting up a router is quite simple. Normally you run the CD that came with the router and follow the instructions. If you're running Vista perhaps the CD that came with the router won't work; I don't know this. But you can set up the router without a CD. Note
 that if you have cable Internet, for the connection you just set the router to do DHCP (or there may even be a choice of cable for you to select). If you have DSL Internet, you usually select PPoe and enter the username and password which you chose when originally
 setting up the DSL connection. So: <br />
<br />
1. Turn off the power to your cable modem. <br />
2. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable (usually provided with the router) going from the router's Internet/WAN port to the cable modem's ethernet port.
<br />
3. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable going from your computer's network adapter to one of the ports on the router. If you don't have an ethernet cable (because you were using USB), you will need to go to the store and buy one.
<br />
4. Turn on the cable modem. After all the lights are on, turn on the router. <br />
<br />
To configure the router: <br />
Have a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Examples given are for a Linksys router. Refer to your router manual or the router mftr.'s website for default settings if you don't have a Linksys. Open a browser such as Internet Explorer or
 Firefox and in the addressbar type: <br />
<a href="http://192.168.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a> [enter] (this is the router's default IP address, which varies from router to router so check your manual)
<br />
<br />
This will bring you to router's login screen. The default username is left blank and the Linksys default password is "admin" without the quotes. Enter that information. You are now in the router's configuration utility. Your configuration utility may differ
 slightly from mine. <br />
<br />
Click on the Administration link at the top of the page. Enter your new password. WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. Re-enter the password to confirm it and click the Save Settings button at the bottom of the page. The router will restart and present
 you with the login box again. Leave the username blank and put in your new password to get back into the configuration utility.
<br />
<br />
Now click on the Wireless link at the top of the page. Change the Wireless Network Name (SSID) from the default to something you will recognize. I suggest that my clients not use their family name as the SSID. For example, you might wish to name your wireless
 network "CastleAnthrax" or the like. <br />
<br />
Click the Save Settings and when you get the prompt that your changes were successful, click on the Wireless Security link which is right next to the Basic Wireless Settings link (where you changed your SSID). If you have a newish computer, you will be able
 to set the Security Mode to WPA2-Personal. Do that and enter a passphrase. The passphrase is what you will enter on any computers that are allowed to connect to the wireless network. WRITE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT.
<br />
<br />
At this point, your router is configured and if the computer you were using to configure the router is normally going to connect wirelessly, disconnect the ethernet cable and the computer's wireless feature should see your new network. Enter the passphrase
 you created to join the network and start surfing. <br />
<br />

B. File/printer sharing <br />
Excellent, thorough, yet easy to understand article about File/Printer Sharing in Vista. Includes details about sharing printers as well as files and folders:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
For XP, start by running the Network Setup Wizard on all machines (see caveat in Item A below).
<br />
<br />
Problems sharing files between computers on a network are generally caused by 1) a misconfigured firewall or overlooked firewall (including a stateful firewall in a VPN); or 2) inadvertently running two firewalls such as the built-in Windows Firewall and a
 third-party firewall; and/or 3) not having identical user accounts and passwords on all Workgroup machines; 4) trying to create shares where the operating system does not permit it.
<br />
<br />
A. Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, this means allowing File/Printer Sharing on the Exceptions tab. Normally running the Network Setup Wizard on XP will take care of this for
 those machines.The only "gotcha" is that this will turn on the XPSP2 Windows Firewall. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus with "Internet Worm Protection" (like Norton 2006/07) which acts as a firewall, then you're fine. With
 third-party firewalls, I usually configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Do not run more than one firewall. DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.
<br />
<br />
B. For ease of organization, put all computers in the same Workgroup. This is done from the System applet in Control Panel, Computer Name tab.
<br />
<br />
C. Create matching user accounts and passwords on all machines. You do not need to be logged into the same account on all machines and the passwords assigned to each user account can be different; the accounts/passwords just need to exist and match on all machines.
 DO NOT NEGLECT TO CREATE PASSWORDS, EVEN IF ONLY SIMPLE ONES. If you wish a machine to boot directly to the Desktop (into one particular user's account) for convenience, you can do this. The instructions at this link work for both XP and Vista: Configure Windows
 to Automatically Login (MVP Ramesh) - <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Autologon.htm</a> <br />
<br />
D. If one or more of the computers is XP Pro or Media Center, turn off Simple File Sharing (Folder Options&gt;View tab).
<br />
<br />
E. Create shares as desired. XP Home does not permit sharing of users' home directories or Program Files, but you can share folders inside those directories. A better choice is to simply use the Shared Documents folder. See the first link above for details
 about Vista sharing. <br />
<br />
F. After you have file sharing working (and have tested this by exchanging a file between all machines), if you want to share a printer connected locally to one of your computers, share it out from that machine. Then go to the printer mftr.'s website and download
 the latest drivers for the correct operating system(s). Install them on the target machine(s). The printer should be seen during the installation routine. If it is not, install the drivers and then use the Add Printer Wizard. In some instances, certain printers
 need to be installed as Local printers but that is outside of this response. <br />

            Unfortunately the only fix was to restore my system to Windows 7.&nbsp; Took quite some time but finally was up and running.&nbsp; People should be warned that the upgrade to Windows 10 can create havoc when it continues to "update". Even if the initial upgrade
 appears to work, the updates do not play nice with older systems.&nbsp; Lesson learned!!

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Assuming you want to use English (United States) as your preferred language, try these steps
<br />
<br />1. Right click Start Button or press Windows + X keys and select Windows PowerShell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />2. In the administrative Windows PowerShell window, type these commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each: 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />This will display list of installed languages on your machine. Note the LanguageTag for your preferred language. 
<br />
<br />$1=New-WinUserLanguageList &lt;LanguageTag&gt; 
<br />
<br />Replace &lt;LanguageTag&gt; for your preferred language. For example, if your preferred language is English (United States), then you can use $1=New-WinUserLanguageList en-US. 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />After this, when opted, type Y to confirm setting preferred language. Close Windows PowerShell and you're done.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            Hi basilorjwan, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Maybe a system failure or some actualization but if you want to remove it apply this:
<br />
<br />1. From the Start menu, search for powershell.
<br />
<br />2. Right-click Windows Powershell in the search results and choose Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type or copy/paste the following command at the command prompt, and then press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />
<br />After typing this command, make note of the “LanguageTag” listed for the language you wish to remove, as you will need it in the next step.
<br />
<br />4.  Type or copy/paste each of the following commands at the command prompt, and then press Enter. In the following commands, instead of typing &lt;languagecode&gt;, replace it with the language tag you wish to remove, such as en-in for English (India).
<br />
<br />$LangList = Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />$MarkedLang = $LangList | where LanguageTag -eq "&lt;languagecode&gt;"
<br />$LangList.Remove($MarkedLang)
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $LangList -Force

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities.
<br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p><span>Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions
 mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>
<p><span>Which operating system is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
With Remote Media Streaming in Windows 7, now you can. Forget about copying all your media from your home PC to your laptop: Remote Media Streaming taps into your complete Windows Media Player 12 library over the Internet.<br />
<br />
If you don’t want remote media streaming, I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
To turn on media streaming on your home network in Windows Media Player, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the Start button , click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Stream, and then click Turn OFF home media streaming.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Turn on home media streaming won't be available on the Stream menu if streaming is already turned on.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
c. On the Media streaming options page, click Turn on media streaming.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK.<br />
<br />

            Hello Diana! 
<br />1. Insert the blank disc into your disc burner and push in the tray. Then click or tap the Notification box that appears in the screen’s upper-right corner.
<br />
<br />2. When the Notification box asks how you’d like to proceed, click the box’s Burn Files to a Disc option.
<br />
<br />3. Type a name for the disc, describe how you want to use the disc, and click Next.
<br />
<br />4. Tell Windows which files to write to disc.
<br />
<br />5. Close your disc-burning session by ejecting the disc.
<br />
<br />Hope I could help!

 10 on my laptop&nbsp;with built in wifi that windows sees and signed during setup&nbsp; and everything worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I Don't find a solution I will have to dump 10 and go back to windows 8.1. Help!</p>

            Thanks for your reply but that was the first thing I tried ,it didn't work. I have reinstalled same version with a old wifi adapter that windows sees and signed in during install and everything works. I then installed the new adapter drivers and all is
 fine. I am still at a loss as to why I cant sign on this computer with this build after install. By the way I have windows 8.1 also installed on this computer and sign in on it has no problems.

            Hi Ruriimasu, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You can't legally purchase OLP licenses from another business, and they won't remain activated for long even if you do. The PC with an OLP license needs an activation server to be configured for the business it was intended.
<br />
<br />The sellers offering cheap Windows licenses are in breach of the terms of use. The only legal way to purchase Windows licenses is through Microsoft directly, or a licensed reseller.
<br />
<br />Here's the best place to purchase licenses:
