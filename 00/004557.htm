<h2>            OneNote is not updating pages - error 0xE000002E</h2>
                    <p>I used&nbsp;OneNote attached to my Office 365 Work/School account (for work)&nbsp;and my Microsoft account (for personal usage).&nbsp; I use OneNote&nbsp;2016 included in Office Pro Plus from Office 365 on a desktop and&nbsp;Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I also use the OneNote application built
 into Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3 (for the improved interface with the&nbsp;pen input).&nbsp; I&nbsp;create content in both version of OneNote.&nbsp; I also use the OneNote clipping tool in Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several articles in my Work notebook which are not syncing from the OneNote 2016 (Office Pro Plus version) on my desktop.&nbsp; Since September 22, 2017, in the "Shared Notebook Synchronization" window, it tells me "We're sorry, something went wrong during
 sync.&nbsp; We'll try again later. (Error code: 0x000002e)."&nbsp; I have stubs for the pages in my Notebook views on other devices and in the cloud (onenote.com), but "Content Not Yet Available.&nbsp; Sorry, it looks like this page was added from another computer and hasn't
 synced yet.&nbsp; Click here or press enter to reload this page."&nbsp; You can't click on anything on the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I have taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forced my desktop OneNote 2016 (Office Pro Plus) version to sync.&nbsp; It doesn't say that it fails, I just get the errors above.</li><li>Went from an automatic update to a manual update and then attempted to manually update.&nbsp;
</li><li>I have deleted and re-created the pages that are not syncing and that doesn't help.&nbsp;
</li><li>I've tried shortening the titles (as I use rather lengthy titles to sort articles) and that hasn't helped.</li></ol>
<p>I cannot find any other logs or error messages to troubleshoot.&nbsp; I use OneNote for just about everything, so with it not working correctly, I'm at a standstill.</p>

            And I have copied the problematic pages to another notebook and the pages sync successfully there.&nbsp; So the pages are only not successfully syncing in my Work notebook.&nbsp; Thank you for any assistance.

<p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why your notebooks are not synchronizing properly across different OneNote platforms and versions. One possible reason that this is happening could be caused by pending updates for OneNote that need to
 be installed. For us to resolve your concern, kindly refer to the steps available in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Fix-issues-when-you-can-t-sync-OneNote-299495ef-66d1-448f-90c1-b785a6968d45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how you can correct issues preventing OneNote to synchronize notebooks properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note that the first thing the article will advise you to do is make sure that the Office applications are up to date before proceeding with the different troubleshooting methods available. For the error code (0x000002e) that you received, kindly refer

    <title>Flashing White Screen Nokia N80 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2deeep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flashing White Screen Nokia N80</h2>
                    I have a nokia n80 and about 2 days ago i woke up and i was using my phone and a blank white screen kept randomly flashing on it. Every 5-6 seconds it just pops up and disappears ! it doesnt effect any of the features of the phone and you can use everything
 as before but its extremely annoying especially when your using the camera. I took it to a approved nokia service centre in norwich and they said its due to water damage, which struck me as a shock because its been no where near any water, ive looked after
 it a lot ! i think they may have said that because they didnt know what the problem was, anyhow i still had to pay £10 to get my "water damaged" phone back. The only way i can think that any water could get in it, is by condensation which would be hard because
 i dont take my phone in the shower with me !<br />
<br />
Anyone have a clue what the problem is?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
I have firmware version: V 4.06.23.0.42 Installed<br />
<br />
And its unlocked

            Strange ..<br />
<br />
There are 2 patches inside the phone that change colour when they're exposed to moisture: it is possible for them to change colour due to things like condensation or rain.<br />
<br />
Would need quite a bit of condensation though - I heard of it in Singapore where it's never less than 90% humidity, but you have to figure that in Norfolk it's more likely to have been rain ..

            Well, I'd first want to check with a different service centre that the moisture detectors really have been triggered. If they have, your warranty is void. Also, you can only see one of them: opening the phone up to see the other one also voids your warranty.<br />
<br />
If your warranty is void, then you probably want to search this forum for info on drying out phones. I know that there's a link somewhere to an article on it.<br />
<br />
Basically, it says to remove the battery (first thing to do!) and dry the phone out by opening it up and leaving it for around 3 days in a dry place. Optionally you can put it with things that will absorb moisture like those silicon bags you sometimes get things
 packed with.<br />
<br />
You MAY then want to clean the inside by dunking the phone with alcohol - has to be very pure alcohol that won't leave a residue.<br />
<br />
Finally you need to carefully check the connections for corrosion and gently remove it with a toothbrush.<br />
<br />
And after you've done all that, there's no guarantee your phone will work .. :(

            Probably the best idea: I suspect that if you hadn't invalidated your warranty before, you definitely have now!<br />
<br />
Besides the N95 is fab - I'm jealous: my contract's until the end of the year ..

<br />
Please, kindly continue with your suggestions. Presently, I expirence this nasty situation. I had been following your post for a while.<br />
<br />
A local technician adviced and offered to DISSECT the phone which am sceptical about. He claims the "flex" is damaged. How far is this true. What do you advice ?

            This is a problem with numerous ones. Mine does the same and has done since i got the thing. As you can see by my user name, im not to chuffed with the N80.<br />
I wa stold the sme by Orange that its got wet. Well it was stil in its packaging when i got it and and it started oing it from day one ten minutes after i had charged it!<br />
<br />
response from Nokia? Its your problem or speak to your service provider. Orange response? Its your problem speak to NOKIA.<br />
<br />
Im assuming Nokia is monitoring the site they own so is anyone out there from NOKIA going to take some responsibility or do we all have to take Nokia to court re sales of goods act? By all i mean 37 people in my job alone has similar problems. so how many are
 there nation wide?

Please, Nokia Administrator make some findings and repond to our yearnings. Kindly advice on what to do.<br />

Sincerely, I do not want to upgrade to N95 because I perceive it fragile. Also, rumours of Nokia phones with Xenon flash and 5MP are all over.

            well this is really wierd ! the flashing blank screen problem has seemed to stop with my n80 now ! i dont have a clue how its stopped or why in that matter ! But then again i did open it up and crack the screen which was stupid of me. Maybe all that it
 needed was to be "dry" its not that opened it up all you need is a a t6 torx screwdriver. ive discovered a new problem though, i went to take a picture with my phone the other day and i found out that the camera button has been pushed in and i cant seem to
 get it back out ! I really want a n95 but my contract doesnt end until decemeber so i have to wait until then to get a upgrade ! And the prices on ebay are ridiculous over £350 for a phone is just stupid. a answer to previous posts you can get the clips and
 belts for the lcd screen for the n80 from ebay, or the whole screen for around £40 including everything.

<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Are yo able to visit other parts of the same site?<br />
<br />
It might also be timing out if it seems like it's taking a long time to load, depending on the lag of your USB Internet connection. Have you tested another computer using the same USB internet connection to see if the ISP is blocking the site?<br />
<br />
I suggest checking the setting for, or turning off your firewall software temporarily while you try to visit the website.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>PST File Size Does Not Decrease After Removing Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ntx1  say:</h3>
<h2>            PST File Size Does Not Decrease After Removing Folders</h2>
                    I am running Outlook '07 in XP.&nbsp; The original size of my Outlook.pst file was 8.4 GB.&nbsp; My objective was to reduce the .pst file to something under 4 GB for DVD backup purposes.&nbsp; I moved multiple folders from Personal Folders to the Archive folder.&nbsp; Right
 clicking on Personal Folders shows the size of the Outlook.pst file at 3.7 GB.&nbsp; Using the Outlook Backup Tool, the backup folder size continues to be 8.4 GB.&nbsp; I then compacted the Outlook.pst file and also ran the Inbox Repair Tool Scanpst.exe on the file.&nbsp;
 I rebooted and ran another backup and the folder size continues to be 8.4 GB.&nbsp; In Explore, I found the Outlook.pst file, right clicked on it and the size is 8.4 GB.<br />
Why is the Outlook.pst file size not smaller after removing multiple folders from it?&nbsp; How can I fix it?<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

You should use the one in Outlook and not in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click your Personal Folders file in Outlook-&gt; Data File&nbsp;Properties-&gt; Advanced...-&gt;&nbsp;Compact Now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this process can take quite a while and you may have to repeat it several times. Also, note that it will not decrease the size of the pst-file to the combined total of your Outlook folder sizes as additional meta data is stored in the pst-file
 and additional white space is required for performance reasons as well.</p>

    <title>Outlook not recognizing contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizzyb_365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook not recognizing contacts</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 365 to access my email hosted by google g suite. When I add a contact to my address book via outlook, I can see and edit that contact. I can start a new email to that contact, etc. But when that contact emails me, outlook does not recognize
 that this is an existing contact. If I right click on the sender's name, outlook provides the option to "add contact to address book" rather than edit the contact. This is a problem because I save email certs to my contacts. So when replying to an email, outlook
 isn't recognizing that this is a contact in my address book with a saved email cert. This started when I set up my outlook using g suite sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start outlook in safe mode, I don't have this problem. I can reply to an email and that person's email cert is recognized in my address book. I disabled all addins and restarted outlook in normal mode but the problem returned.&nbsp;</p>

            It's related to the g-sync utility - it sync calendar &amp; contacts with the google server. If you save the address as a new contact when you right-click on an address, is it recognized the next time?

<p>Thanks! Yes, I previously used gmail and outlook without using the g suite sync setup. I manually set it up in outlook. At that time, my calendar wouldn't sync properly. So I switched to using G suite sync. Now my calendars sync but my contacts don't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, when I save a new contact in outlook, the same thing happens. I wanted to see if there was a way to set up a local contact list that outlook could reference. I honestly don't care if it doesn't sync with g suite and is just local.
 I could live with that. I just want outlook to recognize my saved contacts in outlook.&nbsp;</p>

            Add a Personal folder - pst - to your profile and see if that helps.  Take a look at step 4 in this article - <a href="https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/icloud-contacts-address-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/icloud-contac...</a> - you'll need to change settings there to make the contacts the default and the first one searched.

            <p>If your Works documents were created in Works 6-9, you should be able to open them directly in Word. If they were created in an older version, you can download converters from
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, start Word, navigate to one of your Works documents, and try opening it. If this works, then you should be able to open these documents by double-clicking (without having to start Word first) if you assign Word as the default program. To do
 this, in an Explorer window (My Computer), right-click on a Works (.wps) file and select
<strong>Open with | Choose default program...</strong>. Select Word as the default program, check the box for "Always use the selected program to open this type of file," and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>

I urgently need these saved emails back for legal situation currfently going on.&nbsp;

PLEASE RESTORE ALL EMAILS that have been removed or advise how I can access them again.&nbsp; This could mean the end of my hotmail.com account after many, many years due to what appears to be a total lack of regard for customers.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#40;Office 365 Home&#41; crashes on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this has been reported multiple times, but my error messages looks differently and
<strong>safe mode works</strong> for me. Also, <strong>setting up a new, clean profile also works for me.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the new office 2016 well for a few days. Everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It always starts with Excel crashing when I hit the "File" Tab. After that, my Outlook profile seems to get corrupted. Safe mode works, but in order to get it working again, I have to start a new profile. However, since the error appeared daily now for three
 days, I am really reluctant to set my outlook up again every day only to hope it will last more than a day or two.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have issues in Excel with the "Export", "Share" and "Publish" tabs under "FILE". Also, "info" crashes my app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Office 365 Home (click to run) on Windows 10. I used to work with the regular Office 2013 before this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my error log:</p>
<p>

            Hi Jerry,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. Please try to uninstall the audio device drivers and then reinstall the latest to check this issue.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may try to check this issue via using the qualified/certified device for Skype for Business to see whether the problem still occurs. For your reference:

<br />
Best regards,<br />

            See if there is an expired trial version of Office 365 installed alongside your full version of Office. If you find a trial, uninstall it. Afterwards, you may have to repair your remaining full version.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have a couple of users who are not MFA enabled but have already set themselves up with their accounts on desktop Outlook.&nbsp; Although I don't see why it should, when I set&nbsp;<span>OAuth2ClientProfileEnabled to true will this have any effect on them?
 &nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>For the users I mentioned above, if I then enable MFA I guess they will need to enter a one time MFA code to re-connect to their Exchange online mailboxes?</span></li></ul>

<li><span>We have a BYOD policy for end user devices, but these devices are only ever registered with AAD - Will MFA on desktop Outlook work with these or do all devices need to be AAD Joined?&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I</span><span>f you set
<strong>OAuth2ClientProfileEnabled </strong>to true</span><span>, all the users who access to Exchange Online service&nbsp;</span><span>in that tenant</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>will
 be effected.</span><span> But </span><span style="font-weight: bold">only</span><span>&nbsp;affects modern authentication connections by Windows-based Outlook clients
 that support modern authentication (Outlook 2013 or later)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile,
</span><span>please don't worry, they may just need to re-si</span><span>g</span><span>n into the Outlook client again.</span><span> And the App Password isn't needed for the Office 2016 clients any more
 when the modern authentication is enabled. Unless the end users are using the Office 2013 clients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For the latest question,
</span><span>I </span><span>personally have no idea about it, but</span><span>
</span><span>you can confirm it </span><a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowsazureactiveauthentication&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a><span>

<p><span><span>Hey Raeychel,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To add to Robert Aldwinckle's suggestion, links not opening when you click on them can be a symptom of needing to register the components of Internet Explorer. Try
 using this repair script created by MVP Kai Schatzl. You can download the script from:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Repair IE8 (IE7)</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have a 64-bit operating system you will need to download/use both the 32on64 and 64on64 scripts for Internet Explorer 32-bit and Internet Explorer 64-bit.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

Where are you posting from?&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I just started from the Answers IE forum and clicked on&nbsp; Ask a question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after entering the question "Where do I see related topics?" &nbsp;I could see on the
<strong>left </strong>a section titled Similar questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after that filled in, a Ctrl-F for related on that page only found the instance of that word that I had just typed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, clicking on one those links opened its link in a new tab, so
 my guess would be that you are seeing the effect of a popup stopper.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using the standard popup stopper you could try pressing Alt+Ctrl- when clicking to try to bypass it.</div>

            Rules apply to all messages that arrive in the Inbox. You need to add to the rule that moves the particular messages to the folder in question to reply using a specific template - that being the automatic reply message.

<h2>            Excel 2016 print preview does not match result</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read what seems to be a similar question on similar forums but am yet to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting the printer as MS print to PDF, the print preview screen and what results (in the pdf document) are vastly different. The page break lines in page break preview match the print print preview but the actual PDF comes out different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the preview:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac4daaaf-f714-4715-afed-aac402b7fdf5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac4daaaf-f714-4715-afed-aac402b7fdf5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is the result:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35480083-0ca7-4bc4-bdd9-247135dec732?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35480083-0ca7-4bc4-bdd9-247135dec732?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be difficult to see in the screenshots above but the result chops off the page near the bottom and results in more pages being printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different PDF print drivers and the same results. Also, i've just updated my Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> kkinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove incorrectly setup email address in Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first setup Outlook, I incorrectly added an email address. When i started Outlook, I received an error message and then received the correct email settings. I created a new address and tried to remove the original email address by setting the new
 one to the "default". I am not able to remove the original email address - the error message that I receive is:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot delete this Outlook data file. Configuration information in the file is being copied to your new default data file. You can delete the file after this information is copied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying this for 3 months and have restarted the machine multiple times. When Outlook is started, it says that it can not log me into the server and always starts in offline mode. To get mail, I have to always manually do send/receive on the one
 address/account that works. if I do send/receive on the bad address, it hangs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I assume you are asking about email accounts, not email addresses, right? Shall we also assume that you created a separate data file when you created the second account? You can't remove a data file if it is the delivery location for any existing email
 account in your profile. What happens if you try to remove the invalid email account instead?

            I go into Account Settings, then under the EMail tab, I highlight the row that reflects the incorrect account. When I hit remove, I receive the original error message about configuration settings being copied. I'm at a loss and very frustrated. Any other
 suggestions?

            Different problem and 8 months later. Suggest posting complete description of the account in question, how you configured it, Outlook version&nbsp;and the steps that created your problem. &nbsp;

<h2>            Failed to Uninstall Preloaded Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook.</h2>
                    I want to remove preloaded office 365 from my laptop since its trial is over. I right-clicked each items to uninstall it. Acess, Word, and Publisher have no problem but Excel, Powerpoint, and Outlook still exist with exclamation mark on its start menu

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, try going through Apps and Features to see if the applications are still present and if so uninstall from there.  The application may have gone however just the three shortcuts remain. If you right click on the shortcuts you have on the start menu tiles then you should be able to remove them

<p>It's not exist on Apps and Features. I can remove the tiles, but the "dead" icons still exist on "All Programs". There's an Uninstall option if I right-clicked it, but it doesn't work.</p>

            I would suggest you to Restore Default Start Screen Tiles. Please follow the below steps.
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.
<br />Enter the following command: %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows, which will open the  Microsoft Windows App-data folder.
<br />Scroll down to find these two files, namely, item-data file and the item-data.bak.
<br />Select both files to delet, right-click on it and select Delete option to send it to the Recycle bin. Don’t press Shift to delete it permanently, let it go to recycle bin. On the safe side you can make a backup copy of these two files on another disk location.
<br />Restart your PC or log out and log in again. Now you will see Windows 8.x Start Screen reset to default tiles.
<br />Now re-arrange the tile as you want and new tiles will also be created automatily when you install any apps from Store.
<br />Note: If anything went wrong and you want to revert start screen tiles to your tiles. restore item data files from recycle bin or from the location where you backed up to the Windows app data folder.

            <p><strong><em>Some</em></strong>&nbsp;PivotChart functionality is currently working in the 15.16 build of Excel. First thing to do is get everything updated:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mac OS X updates:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Office Updats</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To get the update:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Open any Office application:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting is fully functional. You can format PivotCharts and they look great. Right-click a chart element and choose Format from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filtering - you can filter PivotTable data, but you can't update a PivotChart to reflect the changes. Hopefully, that will come in a future update to Excel.</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Be sure to use the Smile button to let Microsoft know which PivotChart features you really like and which missing features you want them to work on first.</p>

            <p>Thanks all for the advice, all worth trying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now on 15019 (no change), and turned transparency off (now I get an empty&nbsp;black action centre instead of a empty tastefully frosted one...). Back to the devs for the next iteration I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I right in thinking you can't get to&nbsp;see Notifications anywhere else? All the ones that have come up since this are acknowledged and thus presumably lost. Hope none were important.... Probably just update notes though.</p>

            <p>Solved (for me) by simply unlocking the taskbar, moving it&nbsp;to another edge, opening the&nbsp;action centre, then moving the taskbar back to where it was. Thanks to this thread:</p>

    <title>Using SUMPRODUCT to find the conditional maximum - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using SUMPRODUCT to find the conditional maximum</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got column A with A1:A100 either having a "YES" or "NO" value.</p>
<p>I've got column B with B1:B100 all having individually unique numbers</p>
<p>I'd like to set up a named value (Maximum_Value) that will be equal to the maximum "YES" value.</p>
<p>I've tried using SUMPRODUCT in conjuction with MAX but I think I've got an issue with syntax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUMPRODUCT isn't the correct function, try this ARRAY formula and see below on how to enter it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=MAX(IF(A1:A100="Yes",B1:B100))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.<br />
</p>

<div>The <i>array formula</i>&nbsp;would be,</div>
