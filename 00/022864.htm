<h2>            MS Excel&#58; Change from Right to Left PERMANENTLY</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got MS-Office 2016. Excel is from right to left. I did EVERYTHING to change it from Left to Right but to no avail. Made the changes in Options, under Advanced; didn't work. I even used a Visual Basic command to change it; still didn't work. It
 works for the sheet I opened only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is becoming really frustrating and annoying to say the least. How can I make the changes permanent???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting back. I would like to confirm, what is the settings you've used when you configured your account as IMAP protocol to Office Outlook? Since you're using 3rd party account, you still need to use the configuration setting for your AOL
 account. &nbsp;It will depend on which server (POP, IMAP and SMTP) is&nbsp;configured in the domain registrar admin panel. You will need to contact your&nbsp;domain administrator to check which servers are set up on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your wishes to use Outlook server in the domain&nbsp;registrar, you need to visit this Microsoft article:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Set up an email app with Outlook.com</strong></a>&nbsp;for the correct configuration settings for Outlook server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other questions or any other concerns, please reply to this thread and we will be happy to further assist you.</p>

<h3> jimmyfr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate 365 on iMac that had Office 2016 installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with activating my office subscription. I have two computers: a MacBook and an iMac, both are up to date. I also have two products on my microsoft account: Office 2016 Home for Mac (for one installation), and an Office 365 Personal subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my MacBook, I installed 365 Personal and had no problems: it asked me which license I wanted to use and I chose the 365 license. It activated and it shows up in my Microsoft account webpage (1 out of 2 installations used).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the iMac, I previously had Office 2016 for Home installed, but because I want to switch and use the Office 365 Personal license, I uninstalled Office 2016 following&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-Office-2016-for-Mac-issues-by-completely-uninstalling-before-you-reinstall-ec3aa66e-6a76-451f-9d35-cba2e14e94c0?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">these
 instructions</a>. After uninstalling, I reinstalled Office but received no prompt to choose which license I wanted to use. When I open MS Word and click "About Word" it says "Retail license" instead of "Office 365 subscription".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, also using AppCleaner to remove all related Office files from my system. But somehow it seems stuck on the 2016 Home license (even when I reinstall without an active internet connection!). Does someone
 know how to switch from the 2016 Home license to the 365 Personal license? I searched these forums but could not find an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Jimmy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use my Unlicense tool to remove the&nbsp;Retail/Volume License. The tool can be downloaded from https://github.com/pbowden-msft/Unlicense</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Once downloaded, open Terminal and run:</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">$HOME<span>/Downloads/Unlicense-master/Unlicense --all</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, launch one of the Office apps (like Word) and you will be asked to reactivate. At that point, you can enter your Office 365 account details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            No &#39;Brochure&#39; Option in Word 2007</h2>
                    Word 2007 is supposed to have a 'Brochure' template. &nbsp;My copy of Word is a full, paid-for version, but has no such 'Brochure' template option, even though all instructions for making brochures in Word refer to this template as if it should be there. &nbsp;I've
 looked for it under all of the headings at the top of the template box that one gets in the left column when one tells Word to open a new blank document. &nbsp;Why is my version missing the 'Brochure' template option, and how can I get it? &nbsp;

<h2>            Locked out of Skype. Have paid credits. Recovery process not successful</h2>
                    <p>I tried to sign on to Skype on a different computer for travel. That was a month ago, as I had to leave for my trip the day after this happened and I didn't have time to jump through hoops to get my account back! It said I needed to be emailed an access
 code because it was a new device - but the access code never arrived in my email. Now I am locked out of my account on all my devices.<strong>&nbsp; My actual account is still inaccessible.</strong>&nbsp; I have all my contacts in it. I have tried the recovery process
 twice - it rejects it every time. From this forum, I see that if I try a 3rd time and get turned down that it will close the account permanently. This forum also recommends the Customer service page --- you have to be able to SIGN IN to get to that!&nbsp;<strong>I
 am posting this from an old account that I haven't used in years. This is not the account I am having trouble with.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I need help from a HUMAN! &nbsp;I have paid credit on the account which Skype will not let me back into. Skype is essenitally STEALING MY CREDIT by not allowing me into my account. If a HUMAN would actually look at this, they would see that no one has been using
 my account for the past several weeks - so it has not been hacked! I just need my contacts and my credit back out of it! PLEASE!!! HELP!!! &nbsp;I have been a loyal Skype customer for years, and this is insane that I can't have even a tiny bit of customer service!!!
 Again, this is not the account that I am having trouble with - SOMEONE PLEASE CONTACT ME TO HELP ME GET BACK INTO MY ACCOUNT!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer. However, as I already stated, I have already filled out the form twice and it doesn't like my answers. The account I am trying to recover was my very first Skype account, made YEARS ago. At first my husband and I were sharing it,
 but he quickly got his won account, so I am not sure if the old info in the account is my email, etc. or it could possibly be his. Again, this is why I need to speak to a HUMAN, please!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering your refusal to let your customers actually have a conversation to resolve these issues as SKYPE STEALING PAID CREDIT. In my last form I filled out, I gave you the amount/date and method paid. But this still doesn't seem to be enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I make the point that if someone could just look at the account they would see it has not been used or touched since you locked me out - indicating that this is a mistake and I am not being hacked. On the contrary, your system is ripping me off my
 paid credit and causing me to lose numerous contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, since you have to sign into the problem account in order to even post on here (seriously?) which is IMPOSSIBLE - it would require a HUMAN to acknowledge me and have me give them the correct account info, as your own site recommends against posting
 the info on here. YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO FIX THIS PROBLEM. AND YOU HAVE MY MONEY.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE! I need to speak to a person, NOT another automated response!!</p>

            I had the same problem. I forgot my password and filled in the form which answers got rejected three times. The Microsoft forced me to make a new account but with this account I can't sign in my old Skype account. I also have credit on there and to transfer
 credit from old to new Skype needs the log on to the old one but that's not possible. Skype, respectively Microsoft service definitely sucks. There is no way to get help for this issue.&nbsp;

<p>Your form doesn't work. Look in other forum. Thousands of people are complaining about Microsoft's SKYPE bad service. I spoke to your "virtual agent" and the last response was "<span><span>I'm
 sorry that didn't work. You can try another question, or you can&nbsp;</span></span><span>
</span>". Well I tried that but there are no "persons". SKYPE shall be back in the hands of people who know how to provide service and Microsoft should get sued for stealing Skype credits from people who they decline to get their accounts
 recovered!!</p>

<p>Hello everyone having the same problem,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to update you, I finally received a private reply to this from Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Sign in using your Microsoft account and select&nbsp;</span><span>Payment &amp; Orders</span><span>on the second box, choose&nbsp;</span><span>How
 do I cancel or refund?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After that you will be routed to the next page select&nbsp;<span>Text Chat Support</span>&nbsp;to be connected to our live chat support."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not sure why they sent that info privately, instead of posting it on here, but anyway - following those steps did actually get me a live agent!! They escalated my case and after about 8-9 back and forth emails
 with various people (some responding as though they were paying attention, and others just giving standard not-helpful responses) finally one suggestion was made that allowed me to unlock my account!!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For me it was that the email for the code they send you was blocked in my senders list. I didn't know. Unblocking it allowed me to receive the code needed to reset my password and get back into my account.
 It is probably not the same issue for everyone, but I wanted to pass on the steps above, as it actually finally got me in contact with HUMANS to try to resolve the issue. Hope this can help someone else!</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 OS is not close to prime time. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobby allred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OS is not close to prime time.</h2>
                    <p>This is a personal opinion, but I do not feel that Windows 10 is anywhere near being close to retail product release.&nbsp; I know that bunches of software engineers and managers are working on the design, code and test while I am currently typing, but this OS
 is a step backwards in GUI quality from Windows 7, even worse than Windows 8.&nbsp; At least Windows 8 masqueraded as a touch screen OS.&nbsp; Following are some of my reasons, and they are all related to the user interface:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; There is little polish, pizazz and color&nbsp;to the OS GUI which would allow&nbsp;you to enjoy the look of the OS, and would increase enjoyment of using the OS.&nbsp;It has a very dull look.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The desktop looks like a kluge, with parts of it having been accomplished by a kid with a white crayon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; During boot, we have to stare at those same goofy dots going around in a circle as we did with Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know whose idea this was/is, but it is not a good one.&nbsp; Also, the four light blue windows panes give a cheap appearance during the boot
 process.&nbsp; Come on, you can do better than that - Windows 7, although nothing fancy during boot, at least had a little better look.&nbsp; Can't the look of Windows 8 be put behind us?&nbsp; No matter how well something works, if it doesn't look good you're going to be
 less inclined to buy it and use it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As it stands, for me to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I'm not sure that I would even if Microsoft paid me.&nbsp; I just would not enjoy it, and I still enjoy using Windows 7.&nbsp; After all these versions of Windows, this is what we currently end up with?</p>

            <p>I agree that it's not ready, and the majority of people using Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 are probably better off staying with what they have, at least for six months after release to see how Windows 10 continues to evolve.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not concerned about me—I can take care of myself.&nbsp; I'm concerned about all the ignorant people Microsoft has tricked into reserving the "upgrade" that will experience feature loss, bugs, incompatible drivers, slower performance, and 5+year old HDDs
 that will be pushed to failing point by the "upgrade".&nbsp; Or people being fired from their jobs because they "upgraded" a company computers, causing problems for the business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly the upgrade will go well for the majority as planned (even if some end up not liking it), but with that many people involved, there will be a significant number of people with real problems.&nbsp; I can already imagine all the people who's computers
 won't be able to play DVDs anymore.&nbsp; I have gotten plenty of complaints about this because of Windows 8 already.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>no, it's NOT enough. &nbsp;Just because YOU say it is (meaning 'no discussion', apparently, like trying to SILENCE THE OPPOSITION maybe?) doesn't make it FACT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'forcing you to upgrade'. &nbsp;I define 'force' as being 'intense pressure'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how about THESE things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) a windows update for 7 and 8.x that NAGS you to upgrade to 10</p>
<p>b) end of support for windows 7 at some point in the not-so-distant future</p>
<p>c) unable to PURCHASE windows 7 'home', 'pro OEM' still available but getting harder to find.</p>
<p>d) lack of NEW machines pre-installed with 7 because of Microsoft policies</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, not "forced" as in "you will be punished". &nbsp;More like COERCED as in "you have NO other CHOICE".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and windows 10 is NOT close to 'prime time'. &nbsp;It's barely a beta these days. &nbsp;And it has WAY TOO MANY "features" like the ADWARE, the SPYWARE, and the "the METRO" sewage, that make it look like a BAD JOKE. &nbsp;What, customers are supposed to LIKE IT? &nbsp;That's
 why it's being GIVEN AWAY for FREE, because NOBODY would PAY MONEY for it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'd rather have an OS I'm willing to PAY MONEY for, like 7 or XP)</p>

            <p>I am&nbsp;used to Facebook so I automatically assume people are going to provide input and their opinions!&nbsp; Thanks for providing yours!&nbsp; I definitely agree with your comments and one of the biggest considerations to not "accepting" Windows 10 is that the end
 of support for Windows 7 at some point will be very problematic,&nbsp;so from that aspect I am being "forced," although not for a few years.</p>
<p>All that are involved with their computers, whether it is as a hobby, gaming, professionally, or whatever, are emotionally and physically dependent upon how that computer looks and functions.&nbsp; I don't feel that the direction that Microsoft has taken with
 Windows 10 will provide me, and maybe others, with enjoyment of using the operating system, from Boot to Desktop to Start Menu.&nbsp; There has to be more creativity, imagination and ability available to Microsoft for something so important to them and those who
 use the Operating Systems than what we are seeing now with Windows 10.&nbsp; I know that to reach this point numerous people&nbsp;invested many, many hours of effort, but if we as users don't point out to them that we don't like where the OS is headed, we deserve what
 we get.&nbsp; Oh, they definitely have their own ideas, and they may not even be very receptive to what input we provide.&nbsp; So undoubtedly creativity is stifled to a certain degree by those higher up in the corporation and what they have dictated.</p>

    <title>Duplicate Custom QAT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcstillings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Custom QAT</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with a template I created to for developing instructional lesson plans. &nbsp;I attached a custom QAT to the template that contains several macros for use with the template. &nbsp;I did this instead of building a customized tab for the ribbon
 because there are extremely tight controls on that in my agency. &nbsp;The problem I am having is that the custom QAT is showing up twice in any documents created from the template. &nbsp;It only shows up once when you create a new document, but it then shows up twice
 every time you open the document after that. &nbsp;I can't figure out why it's doing that. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas on what I should check or look at to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screen cap of what's happening. &nbsp;Let me know if a copy of the actual template would help. &nbsp;I just don't want to post it if it's not needed.</p>

            <p>When you select "For all documents (default)" in the "Customize Quick Access Toolbar" drop down at File | Options | Quick Access Toolbar, the modifications go into the
<strong>Word.qat </strong>file (this applies to Word 2007) or <strong>Word.officeui
</strong>(this is the file name in later versions). The path to the file, at least for Word 2013 on Windows 7, is C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, you can add buttons to specific Word files (*.docx). You can pick an open file in the "Customize Quick Access Toolbar" drop down and then customize its QAT buttons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote, when you save your changes you will see the&nbsp;buttons saved to the Word.qat or Word.officeui on the far right of the toolbar and then the buttons from other open documents or templates follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I notice that while you use the word "Template", the file For 50034 Trial 2 20150929 is a document (docx), not a template that would have a dotx or dotm extension.</p>

            <p>I don't see any duplicate buttons on that first QAT (unlike the one in your previous screen shot). Is this problem occurring only in one document? If you did add those buttons with a document open and did not change the
<strong>Customize Quick Access Toolbar</strong> dropdown from the document setting to the template, then indeed&nbsp;you would have the buttons added to the document in addition to the buttons added to the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start with a new blank document (based on Normal.dotm), when I open the <strong>
Customize the Quick Access Toolbar and keyboard shortcuts</strong> dialog, the default setting of that dropdown is "For all documents (default)," which would save the changes to the Normal template. But I also have the option of saving in them in Document 2.
 It appears that perhaps this is what you have done: you created the QAT for the template in a specific document with the wrong setting?</p>

<h2>            How do you permanently rename 365 calendars shared from outside the organiztion&#63;</h2>
                    One side of our company is a .net and the other side is a .com.&nbsp; When I shared the calendars between the two I tried renaming the calendars (they defaulted as Calendar) but when I sign back in they revert back to Calendar instead of the title I gave it.&nbsp;
 This is no good as we need to know who's calendar we are looking at.

            <p><span>Hi ABRAHAM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, please use different web browsers to check if the issue can be resolved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists with different web browsers, I would like to collect the information below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you (.net) and another user (.com) all Office 365 accounts?
</span></p>
<p><span>2. How do you open the calendar that shared from another organization?
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Do any other users in your organization have the same issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any update will be appreciated. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards, </span></p>
<p><span>Poppy&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Yes, all parties have 365 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I log in through the browser and go to Calendar. &nbsp;I right click on Other Calendars and select Open Calendar. &nbsp;I then paste the ics link of the outside calendar into the Internet Calendar box and click Open. &nbsp;I then right click on the new calendar and
 click Rename. &nbsp;However, for some users when you log back into the email through the browser the renamed calendars are back to their default "Calendar" title; this means they have 20 calendars all called "Calendar" and they can't tell who's calendar any of
 them are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Only some user accounts are having this issue. &nbsp;I'm logging into these accounts through my laptop (I'm the IT guy) to set the calendars up. When I log back into some of these accounts on my laptop to check on them some users have gone back to the default
 "Calendar" titles for the calendars outside of the organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to reproduce the issue from my side but failed. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the external calendar is shared to these affected accounts via email, please check if you can rename the shared calendar by click Accept in the email as screenshot shows below.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/795046fb-a513-473f-887a-18f625acfff9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/795046fb-a513-473f-887a-18f625acfff9" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I’d like to confirm:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does these affected users have anything in common? </span>
</li><li><span>Do you mean these affected users cannot rename all other calendars or specific other calendars via opening the ics file?
</span></li><li><span>To check if the issue is related to these affected user account, please do a test to share my test account’s calendar to the user and open my test account’s calendar then check if the issue persists.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have sent my test account to you via private message. Please access it via the link:</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it again today and the renaming seems to be sticking this time. &nbsp;I don't know what happened but they are no longer reverting back to "calendar".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do have one other question:</p>
<p>What's the easiest way to open these shared calendars from outside the organization in Outlook 2007? &nbsp;I added them in the browser version of 365 but they don't automatically transfer to Outlook 2007. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>About your additional question, since Office 365 is not designed to work with Office 2007. I recommend you update Outlook to Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 and deploy some patches, then check if you have issues when using updated Outlook.</span></p>

            I had this some months ago and had to use the ISO for 17758 to update, luckily I had the previous build to this installed at the time. But it may be an option once the ISO is released for the next build, depends what you are on currently.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Screen flashing violently</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to windows 10 on a Lenovo U410. I previously upgraded to Win 10 insider edition and it worked like a charm.</p>
<p>Ever since I upgraded to proper win 10 edition my screen keeps on flashing violently. ( feels as if F5, refresh, is stuck on repeat )
</p>
<p>Even Task Mgr keeps on refreshing.</p>
<p>If I kill Shell Intfrastructure host exe then flashing stops but then explorer stops responding so nothing happens when I click on start button or swipe in from right. If i open Edge it says expolorer.exe has stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flashing is making me go insane !!</p>

    <title>modifying tables in multiple worksheets within the same workbook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            modifying tables in multiple worksheets within the same workbook</h2>
                    I have a workbook in which 110 worksheets are set up identically; 23 rows of statistical calculations followed by a data entry table. I now need to add 3 columns to each table but can't seem to find a way. When I record a macro, the macro lists the specific
 table ID for the sheet I record it in, and when I try and group the sheets the edit icons are greyed out. I know that there is a "modify table" SQL command but I can't figure out how to use it. Is there a way to "generalize" the table name in a macro to allow
 it to modify each table in the workbook?<br />

            <p>On one of the tab right mouse click and you get "select all sheets" option.. I have never had so many sheet in one workbook, so there may be a limit. But at least with,&nbsp; for example, 10 sheets anything I add to one is added to all the sheets selected in
 the group. If this fails and you revert to&nbsp;using a macro, you can use a loop to perform the same task in each sheet of the workbook. A quick internet search should get you example code.</p>

            This is same approach that I was directed to in another forum and doesn't work with formatted tables. The problem is each table is a unique entity and you can't seem to modify all tables by simply modifying one in a group. I'm all for not using a macro
 if I can avoid it, but I believe the solution to my problem lies in a macro; I just haven't figured it out yet.<br />

<p>I think it's fairly possible to run Linux on 5800.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia 5800 has ARM 1136 processor &amp; 128 MB RAM. I think it uses NAND of around 64/128MB (=phone memory). ARM 1136 supports upto 2GB or NAND Flash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are couple of platforms (Eval board +&nbsp;BSP) available&nbsp;in the market. Atleast I know about TI and Freescale.</p>
<p>TI has&nbsp;platform targeted for&nbsp;mobile devices. You can download 2.6.24 or latest version from kernel.org and check for /arch/arm1136/ directory. You will get&nbsp;enough info on this processor support. As bootloader u-boot / redboot are vaiable options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I understand you need to erase Flash offset 0x0 to keep your bootloader which certainly will remove S60 related stuff. So we will need a backup tool which can restore complete S60 as it is. As no body likes to loose orignal stuff (Alteast not me).
 I'm in search of one such tool (ready to spend&nbsp;couple of bucks on it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if Linux is possible then Android must also be... I don't know about Android full touch sceen support. I have heard about such developments (not sure about&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone is knows about&nbsp;such development, please let me know. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I will try which ever sounds better.</p>
<p>Can you share some experience how Linux looks on 5800, Did you got X or any GUI running on it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>At this moment i'm porting linux on Rover S5 (Lenovo ET980), but i've just bought 5800 on my birthday, so i've got some exp about porting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, i don't know much about bootloader (for WM5.0 we've got the "HaRET" tool). But about porting - Android is just a distro, main and only problem is kernel. If our arch is supported - it's good, but we must catch cpu's GPIOs, and so we need smth
 for tracing signals (HaRET can do this, but there's no port for symbian yet).</p>

            Also we need not only cpu name, but board and all other devices names... So, best of all will be if nokia'll open specs. Or someone must steal/buy/copy them ;)

            Isn't it possible to get those from Maemo? - the Maemo supporting devices must be similar in architecture to the S60 ones.

            <p>Just wanted to give everyone a heads up; I just reinstalled the software and its working fine. I did not uninstall the software just inserted the disk and ran it. I called Microsoft and they wanted $99 (really) which is a rip as I can go out and buy a new
 one for $139.99 with support. Total BS..... I wish the world would switch to MAC OS because Microsoft products are horrible and Tom (Indian voice) is almost impossible to understand. Now I remember exactly what drove me to Apple.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to find small page size for PDF when send to Onenote&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> basidiomycota  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find small page size for PDF when send to Onenote&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My professor usually gives us his lecture slides in PDF format. While I was trying to send them to Onenote for notetaking (from Reader in win 8.1), I realized that the size options available are just all too big. I don't need letter size slides, the font
 is big enough for me to see even if in 4-in-1 layout.</p>
<p>Is there any way to downsize the pages sent to Onenote, other than manually drag them smaller?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply Marjolein!</p>
<p>I wish I could see that window! (like what I used to do in Win 7) However, what I saw in Win 8 system is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18bbb1a9-ab60-4e91-b999-ddd7b69678f4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>and when I went to "more settings", this appeared:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d192b60a-ef95-4be0-a4af-9730ebef192f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The multiple pages setting is nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>I am new to Win 8 system and don't know how to get the regular print window out in Win 8.
</p>
<p>By the way, this time I used Adobe Reader Touch. Sorry I don't have Acrobat on my tablet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you very much!&nbsp; =D</p>

            <p>You're welcome and ah, yes! I should have asked if you are using Windows Store apps or desktop apps on Windows 8.1. This explains why you have less options.</p>
<p>For curiosity's sake: do you have the possibility to install full-blown Windows apps and try the solution I gave you or is that a step too far right now?

            <p>I have had some difficulty in opening apps from the desktop, still working on that.</p>
<p>But your suggestion has inspired me! I have a laptop of win 7&nbsp;so now I just insert PDTs in 4- in-1 format from my laptop the night before and open the OneNote file from tablet&nbsp;in class for note-taking. With One Drive, it's the same everywhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I will continue working on the desktop apps and see what else I can do with that.
</p>
<p>Really thank you! That helps a lot!</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 - f2 brings up brightness instead of edit cell</h2>
                    In Excel 2016 - I have to hit the Fn button and f2 to bring up the edit cell function.&nbsp; If I don't, the brightness function comes up.&nbsp; Is there a way to switch this so the f2 brings up the edit cell function and Fn + f2 brings up the brightness?

            It all depends upon the laptop model. You can not control this through Excel.
<br />
<br />You will need to lock your function key once so that when you press F2, you need not hold Fn key. And then Fn+F2 will bring up brightness key,
<br />
<br />I have Lenovo and in this, to lock Fn key, I press Fn Key followed by Esc key. Then I can press any function key without keeping Fn key pressed.
<br />
<br />You will have to see as per your laptop model about how to lock Fn key.

<h2>            DEVICE REPLACEMENT</h2>
                    <pre>Hi,
Iam Raj Narvekar &amp; I have purchased Nokia Lumia 730 on 17th June 2015 &amp; that would be the worst nightmare for me coz of buying Lumia device. Iam facing hell lot of issues on my device since purchase.
First thing,my phone was started getting hanging issues after second day of purchase. I dont even installed any apps except Whatsapp,Facebook &amp; Messenger. Then too it was giving me issues. i visited to the authorised Microsoft service center nearby my location on 3rd day itself. They saw the problem and juz updated the software for me. I was not expecting this type of issues in Lumia atleast coz i buyed an Windows Phone 8.1 not any Kiddish Android phone.
Second thing,after getting software updated i was again facing an issue related Sim network and freez of phone camera bluetooth and wifi. I already got my sim replaced by the network provider but thing happening is the network goes off automatically(means no network) &amp; the phone gets stucked. Iam not able to use the phone coz it got freezed. Then i have to restart the phone again &amp; then the network comes. This thing i have to do several times in a day. Now you tell me how can i supposed to use this type of defective handset for a long time!!!? I visited to the store from where i purchased &amp; requested them to replace my handset but they denied &amp; told me to go to the service center for the DOA Process. 
Now within a week i visited to the service center for the second time &amp; i requested for the DOA thing but they denied coz they told that we cannot replace the handset coz now the phone is not under DOA policy coz the DOA only happens within 4 days this is what they told. I dont understand when i visited to the center for first time with the issue why they didnt gave me the replacement of the handset? The hanging issue,The network Issue is also happend in front of the technician in the center while testing but still they denied to gave the DOA/Replacement for the handset!! Am i a fool to buy this handset or the technician itself is a fool that after knowing also that there is a serious issue in a handset,then too they are ignoring to give me the replacement for the handset!!! I didnt expected this type of service from Microsoft company. Now what they told me that they will send this Phone to the Main service center for the inspection of the handset &amp; they will only let me know that what can be done but
Service center details:
Fones 4 U
Prime mall,2nd floor,Irla Lane,Vile Parle(West),Mumbai,Maharashtra 400056.

    <title>Outlook 2007 displays recipients name and email address of same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zakiuddin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 displays recipients name and email address of same recipient in sent items</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Iam using Outlook 2007 and had arranged the sent items sorting to "To" in order to see to whom I had sent emails. Iam facing a strange issue when searching emails. As an example, I sent many emails to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** during the past 2-3 years. Now when I see the sent items with "To" sorting, it shows some emails with the name "Malica Sima" and further when I scroll down there are some more emails to the same recipient but
 with email address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. All emails sent to recipient Malica Sima is not displayed continuously.</p>
<p>This makes it very hard to track sent messages and sometimes we feel the sent email is missing whereas it will be there in sent items but we need to dig down and find it.</p>
<p>Even if I try to search for that user in sent items by name or by email address, Iam getting a lot of resulting emails and still some emails are displayed by name and some are displayed by email address.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any possibility I can change the display name in sent items to Malica Sima for all emails I sent to her. Please note that I do not have any entry of this contact in my address book. Infact I do not have any entry at all in my Outlook Address Book as I do not
 use it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Appreciate your response if any of you had came across this issue and had solved it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Zaki Uddin <br />
