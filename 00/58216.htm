<h2>            Surface Pen stops working all the time</h2>
                    <p>The pen for my Surface Book stops working ALOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">And by that I mean: ALOT</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst thing is, I got a brand new pen from Microsoft, because the old one also stopped working. This is now the newest version without a clip, but guess what. it still does not work half the time. Most likely there is nothing wrong with my brand new
 pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">After not being used for some time, the pen will basically disconnect its cursor/writing ability. Which results in a dead unusable pen. However, the pen is still connected by bluetooth, and the back button/eraser still works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Often this problem will solve itself by restarting the computer. But I feel that for a machine this incredibly expensive, one can expect the pen to work at all times, whenever needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>And before you even ask, I have talked with Microsoft support many many times. They simply do not have a clue. Even the Surface Diagnostic tool doesnt even seem to know that people uses pens for these devices, as there is no diagnosis to perform for the
 pent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suspicion is that something is causing the driver in Windows to shut itself off. And simply forget the pen.

<p>same problem on the Surface Book 1 (i5 / 8GB / 256 GB / GPU). It occured in the last couple months the first time and it occurs now constantly at least once a day. I owe the surface book for over a year, I have never (of what I can recall) experienced it
 before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>pen suddenly stops writing (tip will not be recognised anymore) while I take notes or after standby. Buttons still work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Solution</strong>"</p>
<p>restarting the book reenables the pen for a random amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>other solutions which might work:&nbsp; deactivate and activate following drivers</p>
<p>- Intel Precise Touch Device (1.2.0.83)</p>
<p>- Intel HD Graphics 520 (22.20.16.4811)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why I also suspect a driver problem. My driver versions are listed in the brackets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could reactivate the pen when I restarted the Intel Precise Touch Device driver until last week. Now only the Intel HD Graphics driver restart has an impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step</p>
<p>undo all windows updates from the last moths and see what happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not too confident that there will be a fix coming from microsoft in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: any microsoft moderator who doesnt read the actual description of the problem and just posts a link on how to connect the pen via Bluetooth owes me a beer.</p>

<p>Thank you for the Link. I have not known this troubleshooter. </p>
<p>By running it, the surface book gets restartet which reactivates (or whatever) the pen. So I tried yesterday to run the troubleshooter after the pen got lost, but after the restart the pen was already functioning again and no problem found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still there has been one problem found by the tool (as shown in the picture below). There is no text under
<em>possible causes</em> and <em>next steps</em> so I do not know if this could have some complications with the pen input.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to add that I have unchecked (device manager - energy management) the Intel drivers to be shut down to save energy - could this have an impact on the outcome?</p>

            That is unlikely to be related to the pen issue. Are you in the USA? If yes, I suggest visiting the closest physical retail Microsoft Store for help with this.

<p>The customer I replied to stated "&nbsp;"I could reactivate the pen when I restarted the Intel Precise Touch Device driver until last week. Now only the Intel HD Graphics driver restart has an impact. " " which may indicate a different issue with the graphics
 driver. I think it is important to verify system integrity in this case. And for the other customer, the SDT showed something strange with Modern Standby.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for touch and multi touch also being disabled at the same time, Microsoft issued a fix for this. It is important to know why some of these folks are again experiencing this and a work around isn't going to get to the bottom of this.

<p>No I do not live in the US. So my only other option is to send it in and go without the surface book for some weeks i guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I've gotten updates at different times based on my location?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I prefer to avoid work arounds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I have to clarify what happens when the pen stops being recognized. Single touch with one finger still works. Multiple fingers does not work anymore (until pen is back working again after a reboot or any of the other "solutions").</p>

    <title>What is the ClearType Tuner&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lnachtigal  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the ClearType Tuner&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering about the ClearType tuner. I was on the Microsft Typography website and it wanted me to tune my Cleartype settings. I was wondering is ClearType automatically tuned? If I tune it, will it screw anything up? I am currently using the defaults
 for cleartype,&nbsp;that came with my computer and&nbsp;I was wondering if it would be a good idea to change anything. Also, I am using Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2&nbsp;64bit and using a 1600x900 display. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;using a laptop by the way. Anyway,&nbsp;thanks for your
 time and support.

<p>Hi Inachtigal,</p>
<p>I too am using the default settings for cleartype. Changing the cleartype settings is a bit like going to the opticians. All you are basically doing is viewing two sets of typeface and selecting which looks the clearer/sharper of the two. I already wear
 glasses and, to me, anyway, the default settings appear to be the sharper. Whether you change the sttings or not is a personal choice. If the text looks clear and sharp as it is then you may as well leave things as they are. As the saying goes 'if it ain't
 broke, don't fix it.'</p>

    <title>Enforcement team xbox party chat and game chat needs to be fixed after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chief x abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enforcement team xbox party chat and game chat needs to be fixed after 1 week ban</h2>
                    
<p>I was banned from all forms off communication on xbox live and wasnt provided with information why to "protect the complainers identity". I shouldnt have to talk to someone who reported me i would atleast like to know what i said.<br />
<br />
On to the main problem I was banned for 1 week and after that i cannot talk in party chat or game chat. WHY are they banning people still if they know this is a problems thats been going on for almost a year now? The only tips they have is to reset your xbox
 and update your controller, but no it's a problem on there side because you can use party chat on the computer and you can stream your xbox to talk in game chat and i can do both and still cannot speak but I can hear. Stop saying this is an enforcement team
 problem this is xbox altogether's problem. It needs to be fixed before christmas comes. How am i supposed to talk to my friends and people in game chat what kind of gaming is that when you cant talk to people. I play multiplayer games. This needs to be fixed
 stop continuing to block peoples communication when you dont know how to unblock it after. Do not link me to the hard reset and update. This has been a problem for over a week now and i have done everything you can possibly do. xbox you need to come out with
 an update that includes this fix in the patch notes. if you talk to any type of person who works for xbox they say they are working on the problem with no eta so it could be a century before they fix it ive had my account for almost 4 years all my achievements
 and games are on this acc and i am not looking to change anything when my acc are all already leveled up and so on this needs to be fixed as soon as possible<br />
<br />
how could u ban me when i have an amazing reputation jesus christ fix this. this is not a small problem it is a huge one.<br />
<br />
thank you and good day</p>

<p>I was advised yesterday that my account had communications privileges banned for a week it seems.
</p>
<p>I never use game chat, and only ever play with close friends, all adults who have adult conversations.</p>
<p>I refrain from any kind of abusive interactions over messaging or otherwise and my email/messaging history can prove that.
</p>
<p>I play adult rated games, games whos characters use profanity, derogatory remarks and depict violence etc. Microsoft has obviously deemed these games and their content as appropriate for adult audience.
</p>
<p>Do I use profanity on occasion in private party chat? Yes, I'm an adult and so are my friends.
</p>
<p>I've spoken with my friends and know them well enough that none of them would have reported me for using a cuss word. Why would they, when they all use profanity too. Why would any of us even play Xbox games if we could be banned for using similar language
 used in the very same games we play?</p>
<p>I've asked Xbox Live to provide specifics of whatever infringement I'm being punished for. I've read the code of conduct, and I don't meet and of the criteria they say is the cause of a ban.
</p>
<p>There's also plenty of online discussions that suggest that your can't be banned simply because malicious individuals (probably young kids who don't like losing a game) you don't know decide to report you/have all their friends report you - all without any
 interaction other than my virtual character beating their virtual character in a game.
</p>
<p>So if I know that my friends didn't report me, and there's no abusive, threatening, derogatory etc. communication between other players, then how can they ban me, or anyone else for that matter? It raises the question of proof. And since I can confirm (having
 reviewed every email ever sent from my account) that I've never sent abusive comments to anyone, is Microsoft recording private chat conversations? If so, I have a monstrous problem with that.
</p>
<p>I'm awaiting some kind of &nbsp;response from their enforcement team as to the specifics of the ban, undeniable physical proof of some infraction. If they can't provide this information, then it's obvious that their enforcement team is simply making carte blanche
 decisions that restrict my services based on here say or malicious reporting from unscrupulous people. Or, they are actually recording private party chat conversations/looking for keywords and then banning based on adults using adult language in a non confrontational
 environment.</p>
<p>To help anyone else, I'll report back exactly what their reasoning is, verbatim. I already know that there's no physical proof unless they are recording conversations, and if that's the source of their information then I'm done with their services.
</p>
<p>I'm an adult, playing adult rated content with other adults (if a child is playing adult rated content then that's a parenting issue) and if I'm being monitored and recorded, then banned for using the same language used by characters in the games Microsoft
 endorsed for play on it's Xbox Live service, this is a huge hypocrisy/trust/privacy issue and needs a vehicle to raise massive public awareness of this fact</p>
<p>Why would anyone pay money for a service that abuses customers privacy/trust and freedom of speech between consenting adults?.</p>

<p>Games may be rated M, but anything done on Live, including private chats, are either unrated or rated E for everyone. So use of profanity, even in a private chat, does violate the code of conduct whether you're having an adult conversation or not.

<p>OK, appreciate the info.</p>
<p>So essentially is a double standard.</p>
<p>They endorse and process millions of $'s in transactions for games with verbal content (GTA5 is an example) that's far beyond anything the average player would say, yet they want to play police officer on private conversations that are not offensive to anyone
 in the chat. This is essentially a form of wire tapping, and whilst I'm sure they are covered legally in their terms of use, they still have a responsibility to tell people specifics on why they are receiving bans. Abuse by its very definition must involve
 all parties, and there must be a party member clearly indicating duress from verbal abuse. A secretive listener is acting subjectively and knows nothing about the friends playing. I understand if there's communication on heinous subjects then it's a different
 matter, but a group of consensual friends using occasional profanity isn't the same thing.</p>
<p>I'll await their response, but I'm done with the service if it's simply a case of them trying to police my vocabulary when it is not offending anyone other than a Microsoft employee who is making subjective decisions based on their own thoughts on the conversation
 with absolutely no care for the history/friendship or context of the discussions. That's nothing to do with abuse or bothering other players, it's abuse of power and I'm not paying money to be treated like a school child - which by the way is why we never
 use game chat to ensure our conversations are amongst private, consenting adults.</p>

<h2>            bluetooth bug in windows 10</h2>
                    i have a computer with Intel wireless Bluetooth running the windows 10 creators update and i can't pair a device so i test if it is a hardware or software issue by creating a windows 7 vm that i would then upgrade to windows 10 creators update. i mount
 the Bluetooth adapter to the vm and Bluetooth works as it normal should. so i upgrade to windows 10 and Bluetooth work fine with the exact same update on the host system. what do i do to fix this issue? is it specific to my install of windows? the host system
 is an alienware aurora r5 and the virtualization software i used was vmware workstation player 12.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see
<br />
if that helps. Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal
<br />
manner? Heat related&nbsp;does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible <br />
that something is too sensitive&nbsp;to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when <br />
possible) -&nbsp;actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust <br />
bunnies and clean&nbsp;the&nbsp;vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening <br />
the case). If a laptop about all&nbsp;you can do is reseat the memory and clean the <br />
vents (still can try adding a small fan as a&nbsp;test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need <br />
the help&nbsp;of a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service)&nbsp;or the <br />
System Maker's&nbsp;Support.<br />

<br />
</strong>This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though
<br />
it is&nbsp; "possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all
<br />
cards, memory&nbsp;and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not <br />
just snug. Make sure&nbsp;the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan <br />
blowing into intakes. Carefully&nbsp;inspect the motherboard and other cards for <br />
damage. Pay attention to the <strong>fatal hardware&nbsp;error</strong>&nbsp;implication. You may need
<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy&nbsp; or other BigBox stores) <br />
or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor <br />
and&nbsp;the heat sink which are common causes.<br />
<br />
There have been a few instances&nbsp;where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security&nbsp;programs have caused this&nbsp;error.<br />

            Sadly mine is a notebook so I dont think it is possible to remove and components. I am curious if it is a hardware problem because the notebook goes into bsod 5mins into the startup sometimes and when I am streaming videos on youtube, however, when I am
 playing games like DOTA, COD or TERA, the computer does not go into bsod.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Is that an issue while launching a particular application or is it random?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method1.</strong><br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>c. The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
For more details follow the link given below.<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of the issue.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong><br />
Type <strong>eventvwr.msc /s</strong> in the address bar.<br />
List any events that are listed as "Error" in the main window when you go to "Windows Logs" and "Application." There are often a lot of them. Send us whichever ones you see listed for the last couple days. (Please also do for the logs in "System"). When you
 do, provide us the name of the "Source" and whatever is listed in the description box below the list of logs when you click on one.</div>
<div>
<p>For more information about event viewer refer to the articles below:<br />
<strong>Open Event Viewer</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a></p>
<p><strong>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</a></p>

            Not an acceptable solution.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time setting my phone up the way I need it to be and do not have HOURS AND HOURS of time to reset the phone every time this happens.&nbsp; It is not the first time I have had an error on my phone.&nbsp; Maybe you have
 days to spend playing with you phone, but as a professional..... I DO NOT.&nbsp; Please tell me how I can delete the cache for the app store so it can retrieve the app info correctly and fix this problem.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to specific CD?</p>
<p>By default, when you rip a CD and are connected to the Internet, the Player is configured to automatically retrieve album art and other related media information. If you have changed
 your privacy settings, you might be prompted to change them back when you click the Find Album Info button. To change your privacy settings back to the default values, do the following and then check if this resolves the issue:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Tools menu, click Options.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the Tools menu is not visible, right-click the Windows Media Player title bar, and then click Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Options dialog box, click the Privacy tab, and then select the Update music files by retrieving media info from the Internet check box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps do not help you may need to rebuild the Windows Media player database.</p>
<p>Here is how:</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:</p>

<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿
 - check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>

                    <p>Yesterday (4/5/2017), I successfully upgraded Windows 10 on two computers, but on my office desktop, it failed.&nbsp; It generated Windows Update error 0xc1900204 when trying to update from version 1607, OS build 14393.693.&nbsp; Searching for help on this error generated
 a number of pages relating to the Windows 10 preview or upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, but I see nothing related to the newest upgrade.&nbsp; If anyone can point me to a discussion or web page that addresses this issue, please let me know.</p>

<h2>            Console turns on but no lights</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, I've tried everything I can think of. I haven't used my XBOX 360 in awhile, went to try a new game today, and the console turns on just fine (Kinect starts up and responds as well), but it doesn't light up at all (used to turn green when it turned
 on). I replaced the batteries in the controller as well since they were dead, but cannot get it to sync with the console - maybe it has something to do with no lights on the console? I've unplugged everything and plugged it back in. I also have Apple TV connected
 to my TV - moved the Apple TV box to the other side of the TV thinking that maybe there was signal interference. Still nada.</p>
<p>Any ideas on what else to try?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey there Plains! Can you clarify that the light you are missing is on the console or the controller? Are you referring to the lighted 1/4 circle or the power icon? If you are having trouble syncing your controller, please refer to this guide (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/connecting-game-controllers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../connecting-game-controllers</a>).
 Please let me know, thanks! </p>

<p>I am having the same issue. &nbsp;My Kinect works fine but my wireless controllers won't sync. &nbsp;There are no lights on the console but the console turns on fine and works with Kinect. &nbsp;There are lights on the controller, replaced batteries on controller to be
 sure the issue isn't the controller. &nbsp;Could this be the power supply somehow? &nbsp;I read that the red/orange light could mean you need a new power supply..</p>

<p>Hey there Cornet! Can you try syncing your controllers to this console again to see if that helps. You can find those steps here (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/connecting-game-controllers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../connecting-game-controllers</a>).
 Thanks! </p>

<br />
=====================================<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot (when possible).</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t delete a game from All Apps view and Games folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnygui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a game from All Apps view and Games folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I finished playing&nbsp;a game (Fez) and after&nbsp;uninstalling it I noticed that its (blank) icon is still showing in the All Apps view&nbsp;from the Start menu. Clicking on it doesn't do anything. Right-clicking it and choosing Delete brings me to the Programs and
 Features dialog from which I already uninstalled the game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose to open the file location&nbsp;from the right-click menu it brings me to this weird Games folder that also shows the blank icon with the name&nbsp;Fez. However, I can't rightclick it or delete it with the keyboard.&nbsp;It's just sitting there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the icon I'm talking about in the All Apps view:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d8607bb-0d54-4254-826d-1186395e6773" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here it is when I right-click the icon above and choosing to open the file location:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca8d7815-d5e2-4674-8fed-8e22638b8504" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, there must be an easy way to just delete this icon from the All Apps view and the Games folder since I uninstalled the game. I just don't know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can help me with this?</p>

<p>Now go to the location mentioned here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;may try to delete the file from this location-&nbsp;"<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Games</strong>" Folder.&nbsp;Search for the games folder.

<p>Nothing happens when selecting it and pressing the delete button. That's what surprised me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to go to the mentioned path but&nbsp;there&nbsp;seems to be no Games folder ("Ontspanning" in Dutch)&nbsp;in the Programs dir. Searching for Fez in that directory also doesn't yield anything. (hidden items is checked)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other workarounds for this? It's just annoying to see a worthless blank icon from&nbsp;an uninstalled game in the All Apps view and in the Games folder.</p>

</p><p>Open Windows Explorer C drive and on top of the search area, type 'games' (ignore the quotes). Wait for the results and check if you find any files specific to Fez. Also check the sub files in the games folder.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It didn't find anything. However,&nbsp;it resolved itself for some reason by uninstalling another totally&nbsp;random game that was also showing its icon in the Games folder. Now the Fez&nbsp;icon is gone from the All Apps view and the Games folder.&nbsp;I don't know what exactly
 the trigger was. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, I have the same problem. I uninstalled 2 programs (an oldie game and Cheating Death for CS) and then like I use to do I cleaned the register. Now I have 2 garbage apps in the All Apps and nothing in the hidden folders nor in the regedit tree (as far
 I see). Maybe I deleted the info of the file in the folders without deleting the info in the "all apps" view? What's the path to the info of all apps in regedit? Thanks!</p>

<p>Well I tried the solution of uninstall another app, it works. I don't know why but I delete a new program and all the previously uninstalled apps are gone from the "all apps" view.. I uninstall it by going to "all apps", right click, uninstall, and then
 using the control panel programs pop up window. Thanks!</p>

            <p>hello Pavan</p>
<p>I don't get any errors, I can hear sound thru the PC speakers. My computer is MSI gaming running windows 10.</p>
<p>I went to the link below and followed the instructions. in control panel I right clicked on the JBL icon, but there is NO listings under the 'services ' tab or the 'hardware' tab. Because it is a speaker (JBL charge 2) I can't adjust any settings on it.
 There is no &nbsp;'find my PC' there is only a Bluetooth button to pair.</p>
<p>I can't find Bluetooth options under the 'settings, Bluetooth, more Bluetooth options.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the Bluetooth adapter. Refer these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key +X</strong>, select <strong>
Control panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Change the <strong>view by </strong>option on the top right to
<strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and click on the
<strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run the <strong>Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> your computer and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: Update drivers for JBL speakers from Device Manager.</strong></p>

    <title>File explorer thumbnail will not expand into a larger window - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File explorer thumbnail will not expand into a larger window</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 (home edition). Everything seems to work except the "file explorer". It is a thumb nail on the task bar, but it will not expand into the larger window. When I click on the thumbnail, it just flips me back to desktop.
 Any solutions??</p>
