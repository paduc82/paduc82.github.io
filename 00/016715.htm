<h2>            Synchronizing Windows 10 contacts with Office 365 Outlook email app</h2>
                    I just purchased a new laptop with Windows 10, and also purchased Office 365 Home which includes Outlook.&nbsp; I have synchronized my contacts from my desktop, phone, and google account to the Windows 10 People App.&nbsp; I can also access these contacts via the
 Outlook.com web interface.&nbsp; But Outlook 365 on my laptop cannot see the contacts in the Windows 10 People app, and try as I might, I have not been able to find a way to connect Outlook 365 to the People App for contacts.&nbsp; Please help.

<br />I have not been able to find a way to connect Outlook 365 to the People App for contacts
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Outlook and the WIn10 apps are separate and distinct. Outlook desktop (part of the Office suite) does not natively sync with any other apps - it only sync's with &lt;email accounts&gt; and what gets sync'd depends on the protocol (POP3, Imap, Exchange) used to connect to the account.
<br />
<br />In short there is no native connection to Google contacts. You need a 3rd party sync utility for Google contacts/calendar such as gSyncIt.

            I don't need to sync to Gmail, I just need to sync to a Microsoft native app - the Windows 10 People app that is built into Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;It makes no sense whatsoever to not have this functionality,&nbsp; or at east some way to connect to an address book other
 than the Outlook address book.&nbsp; The lack of this functionality makes the Outlook component of Office 365 Home completely worthless to me.

    <title>Report system resource exceeded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claired  say:</h3>
<h2>            Report system resource exceeded</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
I am working on a budgeting database and am currently creating a report that compares the budget to the actual costs for one department.&nbsp; There are a bunch of stacked queries to arrive at both the budget numbers and the actual numbers, and the results are also
 attached to the values of a form (setting the date range and which budget number to compare).&nbsp; The budget and actual numbers are joined in a union between a left join of the two and a right join of the two (Many to many).<br />
<br />
The query itself runs, slowly, which is what I'd expect at this point.&nbsp; However, when I try to make a report of the query (and I made a fresh one with no totals or anything) I receive a "system resource exceeded" error.&nbsp; I traced the queries the first time
 I did this and found one step that is the third from the bottom of the actual costs side of the query that I made into a table (the table will be able to be appended just once a month) and used this table in all of the subsequent queries instead of the original
 query.&nbsp; This should have resolved some of the complexity.&nbsp; However, the report is still showing the same "system resource exceeded" error.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What could cause a report to be exceeded when a query isn't?<br />
<br />
As a side note, the actual to budget comparison report for the company as a whole runs perfectly (though a bit slowly as well).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts,<br />
Claire<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Large and complex query criteria in the WHERE clause that gets a lot of memory. So you need to optimize your query. You can make table query, from the created
 table show the results in your report. or simply on open report event run you query using Docmd.openquery or Docmd.runquery, and assign recordsource of your report to your table name. For more about this, please refer to:

            Hello MichaelZielinski. You have a couple options. One is to open DropBox online and download your DB and then upload to your OneDrive (OD). Open DB online, CTRL + A, and click Download. Then upload to OneDrive. 
<br />
<br />Another option is DB actually works with Office 365. In your DB settings, Go to preferences, General and select to use DB with MS Office. See screenshot. It should like you want the 1st option, but you could do both options.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3025a361-af2f-4fa4-9e36-3cb05b2322af?upload=true" />

Yup it's set as UK in Regional Settings but for some reason it accepts 911 (US) and not 999 as the emergency number. I don't know how or why it's changed.

<p>Thank you very much! It has fixed the problem. That software didn't run on my Smartphone as it was only for PocketPC, but I managed to find another registry editor

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>the number of days for the shopping list is set in the VBA macro behind the scenes. You can change the number of days, but it will be really, really difficult to change the shopping list to monthly, as in from the first of the month to the last day of
 the month.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want, you can change the setting to four weeks instead of one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, let's correct the error of the template returning 8 days worth of shopping instead of 7 for the default of 1 week:</div>
<div><br />
<div>While you have the file open, hold down the Alt key and hit the F11 key. This will open the VBA editor.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the left hand navigation panel of the VBA Editor expand the + sign next to the word "Modules" and then double-click the
<b>Module1</b>. Now you will see the VBA code in the big code window. You should see something like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3e3342a-e06d-4091-bd22-0f2dd27a14c5" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>The 10th line of text is this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>[WeekPlanCriteria].Offset(1).Resize(1) = Array("&gt;=" &amp; [ShoppingStartDate], "&lt;=" &amp; [ShoppingStartDate] + 7)</div>
<div><br />
<div>This sets the search criteria for the Shopping period from the Start date to a date that is less than or equal to the Start date plus seven days. Which will result in eight days being returned. &nbsp;Remove the = sign in the combination "&lt;=", so the line reads</div>
<div><br />
<div>[WeekPlanCriteria].Offset(1).Resize(1) = Array("&gt;=" &amp; [ShoppingStartDate],<b> "&lt;"
</b>&amp; [ShoppingStartDate] + 7)</div>
<div><br />
<div>and you will get seven days of Shopping in the list. Along the same lines, you can change seven days to 28 days, for example, by using</div>
<div><br />
<div>[WeekPlanCriteria].Offset(1).Resize(1) = Array("&gt;=" &amp; [ShoppingStartDate], "&lt;" &amp; [ShoppingStartDate] +
<b>28</b>)</div>
<div><br />
<div>That will return four weeks worth of shopping list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know how you get on.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <p>Awesome thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are planning to try it out both ways (7 days and 28 days) as we get paid monthly and this helps us out a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now... is there a way to and a new column to the ingredients &nbsp;worksheet to have "food type" as the header so we can arrange the sort to list like types of food (ie. canned, protein or produce)?&nbsp; If I were to and the "food type" column would this mess up
 the current worksheet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your assistance!!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the following steps work for me: first add the new recipe in the recipes sheet. Make sure that you enter it in the table, i.e. don't leave any blank rows between existing and new recipes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next add the ingredients. The new recipe will show in the recipe dropdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can use the dish in the meal plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the template does not work with regional settings where the date format is different to MDY. My defaults are DMY and I could not get the shopping list button to work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is that a hidden sheet holds the date filters used in VBA. But VBA is so very fixed on the US date order MDY that filter won' work for regional settings that use DMY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the template work for a DMY date order, change the following line of VBA from</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>to &nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">[WeekPlanCriteria].Offset(1).Resize(1) = Array("&gt;=" &amp; Format([ShoppingStartDate], "MM/dd/yyyy"), "&lt;=" &amp; Format([ShoppingStartDate] + 7, "mm/dd/yyyy"))<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, the template will work in any regional setting.</p>

<h2>            Delete &#40;not reset&#41; style of followed hyperlinks</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have two questions regarding hyperlinks?</p>
<p>1) Is it possible to delete the style of followed hyperlinks</p>
<p>What I mean is this: supposed I have 2 texts A and B. A is times new roman size 16 in black, B is arial size 12 in green. I set them to hyperlinks and they turn blue and underlined (however their font police and size do not change). Now I would like these
 attributes to remain the SAME as before after I click on the hyperlinks. Is this possible?</p>
<p>I have searched around and it seems that it's possible to change the style to something specific, but not to keep it the same as what the text currently has.</p>
<p>2) Hopefully this should be a possible yes/or answer: is it possible to differentiate the styles of external hyperlinks (to internet pages) vs. internal ones (bookmarks within a document)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

    <title>Office 365 and Outlook 2016 diary appointment synchronisation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johncloughuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 and Outlook 2016 diary appointment synchronisation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we have a client that has an ongoing issue with calendar entries. Some users do not see all the appointments within other user's diaries. One user cannot see all the appointments in his own diary. It's only a small proportion of diary entries that don't
 appear, maybe 10% but it has caused problems with double booking of appointments. There doesn't seem to be a pattern to this. For example, user A can only see 90% of his own appointments in outlook, 2 or 3 other users have the same view but everyone else can
 see all user A's appointments</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've narrowed this down to a problem with the local OST synchronising with the Office 365 service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know;</p>
<p>- when we switch off cached Exchange all the appointments appear all the time</p>
<p>- when we delete the OST and rebuild it, all the appointments appear but over a period of a few days some appointments go missing again</p>
<p>- all appointments appear in the web portal and on phones</p>
<p>- there is no pattern to the missing appointments, for example they're made by different people (internal and external), there are no private appointments, there are no specific days or times of day</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client is using;</p>
<p>Office 2016 via a Vodafone E3 subscription, most if not all copies were on the latest version as of last week</p>
<p>Most desktops are HP i5/4Gb Ram Windows 7 or Windows 10</p>
<p>Connection is via a 10/100 leased line</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a couple of similar posts on the forum but not fixes, other than deleting the OST but we can't keep doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi, the support and recovery assistant doesn't seem to have an option for missing calendar appointments, it has missing emails but not appointments. I looked through the other options and didn't find anything relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try an online repair tomorrow so will let you know how I get on.</p>

            <p>Hi, a repair didn't work, neither did safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with specific appointments showing in Outlook for some users. It's the same appointments that the users can't see. So for example, if there are 20 appointments in A's diary. Two or three appointments will be missing from his Outlook calendar
 but he see's all appointments in the web portal, and on his phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If B looks in his diary on the web portal then all appointments are there. If B opens his calendar in Outlook then the same 2 or 3 appointments will be missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C, D, and E may all see all the appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users all use Outlook 2016 from the same E3 service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the OST and rebuilding does work but only for a week or so before the appointments start disappearing from Outlook again...</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description, the issue can be temporarily fixed by deleting the OST file and re-creating the OST file. It indicates that the issue could be related to the OST files. So I would suggest you confirm that whether these problematic
 users’ OST files are too large as a large size of OST file could have some issues. If so, I would suggest you enable online archive for these users and move some emails or calendar items into the archive mailboxes. You can refer to the article below for more
 details about online archive:<br />

            <p>Hi, thank you all for your comments, its most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end we exported the user's PST, deleted their Office 365 account, created a new one, and then imported the PST. After the import, all emails were there but some calendar appointments were missing. We assume these were corrupted and were the source
 of the syncrhonisation issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's early days but everything appears to be syncrhonising correctly.</p>

<p>Generally when you get this error you'll need to erase everything off of the Zune before updating the software.&nbsp; You will want to make sure you've copied everything to your collection before doing this.&nbsp; The easiest way is to go to Settings -&gt; Device -&gt;
 Sync Options and select the button there to Erase All.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, you will need to do a full format of the device and reinstall of the player's firmware.&nbsp; There are steps on how to do this here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/zuneplayers/solvingproblems/reinstallplayer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/zuneplayers/solvingproblems/reinstallplayer.htm</a></p>
<p>You will want to scroll about halfway down to find the steps for your Zune 80gb.</p>
<p>If you continue to experience this issue, your device will likely need to be serviced.&nbsp; You can register your Zune and check it's warranty here:</p>

            <p>Hi Johan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this issue is account and application independent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first encountered the problem using Thunderbird. It's reproducible with at least two other clients:</p>
<p>http://openradar.io/15855913</p>
<p>http://www.limilabs.com/qa/183/outlook-com-removes-attachment-when-using-move</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no error message. It's even worse: The server's reply to the copy command is: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">tag OK ...</span>" suggesting&nbsp;everything went well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The replaced header "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MS-Blob-Excluded" is unique to this problem. So it should be pretty easy to search your ticket system or find a responsible developer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Tobias</p>
        </p>

</p><p>The forum moderators are replying in droves - but I get the impression that no-one technical is actually looking at this issue - or we'd be getting sensible replies. The other frustration is that we have both given clear directions on how to reporoduce the
 errors and the moderators are not even trying the simple steps required to see the issue for themselves. This is extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resorted to downloading the WHOLE message to the client and then re-uploading it to the destination folder before deleting the original. Extremely inefficient and bandwidth hungry, but the only way to preserve the attachments.</p>

            Looks like you have 75 photos in your phone but only 28 got uploaded. Can you check where the rest of photos are stored in the phone?&nbsp;If they all are in the same folder, you would probably try to manual sync again by clicking "Sync" after opening "My Phone"
 in your phone, then check if rest of&nbsp;photos get uploaded. Sometimes the syncing was broken due to bad internet connection, etc.

<h2>            Why is the order of text being shown back to front&#63; Outlook.com Win10</h2>
                    <p>When I'm typing text in a new email, it's appearing like this: <strong><em>"liame wen a ni txet"
</em></strong>and it's moving to the right-hand side of the window i.e. in a right-to-left direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume that how some languages appear but I've made no changes to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened several times yesterday and twice this morning. I had to delete the block of text to make it return to left-to-right. I'll post a snip if it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a combination of keys to change to right-to-left ie might I have caused it accidentally?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be conflicts that have occurred with the browser that you’re using or an issue with the Outlook.com server when composing an email. Now, let’s try to isolate this concern by using a
<strong>different web browser</strong> available on your device and see if it will have the same behavior as you typed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just in case that it will happen again, please provide us a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">screenshot</a></strong>
 for us to check it further and find out what may be causing it to occur</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your update after trying the steps.</p>

<h3> greg low - australia  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPivot pivot table - how to set cell fill color for uncovered cells</h2>
                    <p>I set fill colors for all cells in a worksheet. On the worksheet is a PowerPivot pivot table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then expand the pivot table. All ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I then collapse the rows in the pivot table, all the rows that were previously covered by the pivot table are now white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Run the SFC command when troubleshooting a buggy Windows system. SFC works by scanning for and replacing system files that are corrupt, missing, or changed. Even if the SFC command doesn’t repair any files, running it will at least confirm that no system files are corrupted and then you can continue to troubleshoot your system with other methods. You can use the SFC command as long as the computer itself will start. If Windows will start normally, you can run it from an administrative command prompt. If Windows won’t start normally, you can try starting it in Safe Mode or in the recovery environment by booting from your installation media or recovery disc.

<br />
<br />You can also try to repair Office.

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2011</h2>
                    I had Microsoft office 2011 installed on my mac. My mac crashed with the latest update and I had to get it sorted out. I know Microsoft office 2011 is no longer supported by Microsoft - but I really would like to get it back. I have the product key and

<p>Hi Customer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the product key but cannot install Office suite from the external drive, you could download the Office 2011 for Mac installer from<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/update-history-for-office-2016-for-mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 this page</a>. After installation, use your product key to activate the Office suite.

            Hi Zu_Max
<br />
<br />Sorry, that is not possible to do, the thousands and decimal separator cannot be set individually, that is a system wide setting on your PC
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Region - Additional Settings that option is set for your whole system from there . ..<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d45061cb-90b2-4393-83ae-2cd1122b0fe5?upload=true" />

<p>As DaveM121 points, this cannot be done changing System Settings per sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do it using a helper cell and a formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(TRIM(TEXT(A1,"### ### ### ##0.00")),CHAR(46),CHAR(44)),CHAR(32),CHAR(46))</p>

</p><p>Thank you Gord for that direction.</p>

<p>To have that formula apply that formatting to every cell in a workbook would require VBA in my estimation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the expertise to write event code to change Windows Regional Setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can find code on the 'net?</p>
