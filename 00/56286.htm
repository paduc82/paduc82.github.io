            <p>When I had that happen on a different brand computer I solved it by going to Device Manager and uninstalling the video codecs, or the graphics adapter or whatever type of video device your system has.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will usually then just rescan and reinstall it correctly but you may have to tell it to scan for hardware changes or even reboot.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any that worked for me, good luck.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As “ITknowledge24“has mentioned in his earlier post, a conflicting program can be the culprit. I would suggest you to boot into safe
 mode and check<br />
if the issue with desktop shortcuts occurs again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to follow:<br />
1. Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
2. Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
3. Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
4. Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
5. Select Safe Mode and press Enter.<br />
6. You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.<br />
7. You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
8. Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link for help:<br />
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode, then it means that a third party program or service was causing the problem and you can
 isolate the program <br />
using the clean boot method. Perform a clean boot to eliminate the conflicting program or service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to perform clean boot:<br />
1. Click the start orb on your desktop<br />
2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
4. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. <br />
5. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
6. Click OK. <br />
7. When you are prompted, click Restart. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If this resolves the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing
 the problem” <br />
to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue. </span></span></p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;How to set your computer back, to boot normal:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the start on your desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box, type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
3. Click the General tab. <br />
4. &nbsp;Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.<br />
<br />

    <title>Why do I receive the update icon to shut down and install every time I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruth2340  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I receive the update icon to shut down and install every time I go into sleep mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I close my lid, my computer goes to sleep and Internet disconnects.&nbsp; About 10 minutes later, the computer wakes up and the Internet comes back on even without opening the lid.&nbsp; I find there is an Update Icon to shut down and install updates.&nbsp; I do,
 but there it is again.&nbsp; All day today and yesterday it has been doing this.&nbsp; It doesn't appear to be installing any updates and no configuring and it shows no updates have installed since Sep. 9th.&nbsp; Yesterday it said an Update failed but it doesn't show what
 Update it was.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I totally shut down each time, because as soon as I log back in, that icon shows up to shut down and install Updates.&nbsp; Since I don't want my Internet on all night I have to shut down, so it won't do this.&nbsp; Any suggestions
 would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem persists.&nbsp; This is the next day, and I have tried just about everything.&nbsp; Microsoft Fix It.&nbsp; Scans.&nbsp; Find and Fix Problems.&nbsp; I don't know what the update is.&nbsp; No way to check.&nbsp; I went in and turned off my update notification, then restarted.&nbsp;
 Then did a manual update scan.&nbsp; Well, that did not show anything.&nbsp; It did not even tell me there were no available updates.&nbsp; Just flipped back to the Windows 10 box, which I have not reserved.&nbsp; And of course that icon showed up again in my system tray.&nbsp; &nbsp;I
 clicked on view updates installed and there is still the failed one but doesn't say what it was that failed for the 24th of Sep. but nothing about what this update is that is in the system tray.&nbsp; I have set my laptop to shut down now when I close the lid,
 so the Internet does not automatically come on as it is doing when I had it set to go into sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to resolve this issue myself with total persistence on my part to resolve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided again to shut off my Updates.&nbsp; Then I shut down.&nbsp; Brought back up.&nbsp; I then went to McAfee and clicked on Check for Updates through McAfee.&nbsp; I had
 tried checking for Updates several times&nbsp;thru McAfee today before I turned off Windows Updates and also yesterday and&nbsp;none were found.&nbsp; But by shutting off Windows Updates, McAfee found that one update, downloaded it and installed it.&nbsp; I still don't know what
 the update was.&nbsp; It does not show in my Microsoft Update records, therefore I am assuming it was an update for my Virus protection.&nbsp; In the 6 years I have had this laptop and McAfee, I have never encountered this issue before.&nbsp; I am wondering if I will need
 to keep my Windows Updates turned off.&nbsp; Right now I turned them on to "check for updates, but notify me before downloading or installing them".&nbsp; It is no longer on Automatic in case this issue returns.</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have Windows install important updates as they become available, we turn on automatic updating. Important updates provide significant benefits, such as improved security and reliability. You can also set Windows to automatically install recommended updates,
 which can address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can also set to check and install Windows Updates manually. This way you can keep&nbsp;a check what updates are being installed. Refer to the following article for more information:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates in Windows&nbsp;7</a></strong></em></p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to corrupt Windows Update packages installed. To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the&nbsp;Windows Update troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press Start button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) In the “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong></span>” on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Click on “<strong><em><span>Windows Update</span></em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on “<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click “<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
I would suggest you to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool and then check for the issue.
<ol>
<li><span>Open an elevated command prompt. Press <em><strong>WinKey + X</strong></em>, click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li>Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.<br />
<span><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></span></li><li>After you get message “The operation completed successfully” type second command and press enter. It will take some time to finish.<br />
<strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></li></ol>
<span><strong>Important: </strong>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reboot your computer, check for the issue and post back your results for further assistance.</span></p>
<br />

            <p>I am experiencing a similar problem since days ago. In my case, the error is even simpler, just updating Windows Defender definition package:</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.203.838.0) - Error 0x80248007</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer is under a domain controller and I have pending (I am on vacations) to talk to the IT Admin in order to check if anything incorrect in the domain policy that is preventing this update to be executed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have executed the two suggested methods and it didn't improve. First said some problems were found and repaired but I have my doubts the&nbsp;real problem was found. For the second method, in the execution of Dism (with scan parameter) it was
 resulting without no problems found. Anyway I have executed second Dism command and I have rebooted my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is still there, so I cannot update windows with this windows defender definition package.</p>

            <p>I want to update that I have solved it. In my case, it seems the problem was with regard the supervised update when a system is under domain policy. Since I am on vacations I am not connected to the domain and the system was out of date in updates and probably
 there was some inconsistencies in the pending updates when I left from the office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paying a bit of attention ;-) to the windows update screen I noticed about the check box about "Check online for updates from Microsoft Update" which is telling to me that for those who are following a domain policy, this allows to overwrite this policy
 and be able to update the system directly from Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I did like this, a lot of pending updates appeared and the system was taking its time to upgrade everything (specially Office 2013). I repeated the process several times until I achieved the message "Your device is up to date", so my original problem
 disappeared. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!!</p>

                    I write material in five European languages and use the foreign language keyboards in order to get the characters not found in English.&nbsp; Will keyboards for French, German, Icelandic, and Spanish be available in Windows 10?&nbsp; Otherwise, i'll stay at Windows
 7.

<br />What folder is this ghost file located in according to that application?
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer to that folder
<br />
<br />On the View ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Can you see that file?
<br />
<br />If not, click 'Options' on the View Ribbon
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the View Tab
<br />
<br />Scroll down and temporarily uncheck, Hide Protected Operating System Files', confirm that, then click Apply and OK
<br />
<br />Can you see that file?
<br />
<br />Please remember to undo those changes . ..

            <p>Hi Lisabob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to transfer the files from one PC to other PC is by using External Storage devices. You can use the
<span>Backup and Restore Center option in&nbsp;Vista&nbsp;to perform the same.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the compatibility, you can check the compatibility of device drivers, app updates, and downloads by using the below link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Lisabob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your old computer is 64 bit, one of the easiest ways is to use Windows Easy Transfer from a Windows 7 64-Bit computer (maybe someone you know uses Windows 7?) to move your files. Copy the
<em>C:Windows\System32\<strong>Migwiz</strong></em> folder from the Windows 7 computer to the Vista and Windows 10 computers. Run "<strong><em>Migwiz.Exe</em></strong>" from the "<strong><em>Migwiz</em></strong>" folder you copied from the Windows 7 computer
 and continue with the Easy Transfer Wizard. Enjoy Windows 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have performed this procedure on my old Vista computer transferring files/data to my new Windows 10 computer with success.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Notes: A Windows Easy Transfer's "Migwiz" folder taken from a 32-Bit PC will not run on a 64-Bit PC and vice-versa. However, the 64-Bit version will accept
 the Easy Transfer file created from a 32-Bit version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the programs, you can try installing them in compatibility mode for Vista (right-click on the installer file, select
<em>Properties</em> then <em>Compatibility Mode</em> tab and check the box). &nbsp;Some worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Amazon Kindle for PC will not run on Win7 64bit</h2>
                    I cannot get Kindle for PC to run on my Win7 64bit Ultimate machine, it says "Kindle has stopped working, A problem caused the program to stop working correctly ......". I've tried the compatibility route and Windows says that the program is incompatible.
 Also tried running as administrator. Any ideas? Web search shows lots of other people with the problem but none of the offered solutions work for me.

            After about 35mins on the telephone to Amazon I at last got put through to someone sensible. They came up with the same idea that one of the posters in Bil-SE's link, and it worked - uninstall Kindle for PC, then delete the "...AppData/Local/Amazon/Kindle
 For PC" folder, then re-install Kindle for PC. It worked for me.<br />

            Thanks for the heads up. Yes this is frustrating to say the least. Yesterday I went all day without issues from a fresh startup. Today, it started fine, then in the middle of web session, it hung up on a page change and then dropped the wireless adaptor.
 &nbsp;I had to run troubleshooting and it reset the adaptor and all is well for now. &nbsp;I honestly don't have the patience to wait on hold for Microsoft who will just tell me the same things I have been trying (update drives, etc). &nbsp;This is such an inconvenience
 and should not be happening.

    <title>Xbox controller won&#39;t reconnect after disconnecting it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox controller won&#39;t reconnect after disconnecting it</h2>
                    I have the xbox dongle and I used to be able to turn my controller off and on as many times as I needed to. Now I can only connect once and if the controller gets turned off I can't reconnect it without restarting steam or my computer. It's a bit of an
 annoyance. Does anyone know why this started happening or how to fix it?

            Hi SethGardner,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft/Xbox customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like the drivers might not be functioning as per normal, given that rebooting seems to reinstate the connectivity between controller and computer. 
<br />
<br />The following Xbox website provides a few troubleshooting steps (the headings do not indicate the same problem that you are having, but these fixes might work for you): <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/troubleshoot-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/access...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can advise further. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            I followed the instructions, it will still connect to the adapter and I can play just fine with the controller until I turn it off or it gets disconnected. Then when I turn it back on it connects for a moment and then turns off.&nbsp;

    <title>Keyboard fails to enter password while signing to Zinio App - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard fails to enter password while signing to Zinio App</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Zinio App</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why the desktop Zinio App (used within my Windows 10 Pro x64 desktop environment) refuses to accept keyboard input in the account password field, in order to log on to one's Zinio account, from within the "settings" page. The web based reader
 option presents no problem, and allows the reading of purchased e-magazines. It would appear that many others are having the same problem. I am baffled and would like to get to the bottom of this! The app installs without problem and one can still browse potential
 magazines to purchase within it's explorer environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the attempt to log on unsuccessfully, CPU usage for the app is around 35% and it appears to be stuck within a logical error it cannot complete. I have to terminate the App from within the Task Manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure occurs in both normal desktop environment and tablet mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zinio's response to this query in their FAQ web page is to reload or reinstall app. If still not working then seek help from microsoft...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to some insight on this matter. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Braidwood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can answer these questions for a better understanding.<br />
1. Are you able to sign in to other apps by entering keyboard input in the account password field?<br />
2. May I know the browser you are using to sign in?<br />
3. Did you make any recent changes prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try using different browsers to sign in to app and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile use On-Screen keyboard and check whether you are able to type the password.<br />
Follow these steps to open On-Screen keyboard:<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large</strong> icons.<br />
3. Select <strong>Ease of Access Centre</strong> &gt; <strong>Start On-Screen Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot </strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>To make your console download when off, you need change your console's power settings to 'Instant On'. &nbsp;This puts your console into a low power state when you either turn it off via the controller or press the Xbox power button on the front of the console.<br />

When in the store choose this DLC and go into it, there instead of a line to buy, the inscription that this product is temporarily unavailable. But there is a line to enter the code.<br />
I installed the old 2-disc version of Dead Space 2. Could it be necessary to download the digital version from the store so that the DLC&nbsp; "Collector's Edition" became available? What other ways to buy this DLC? Or buy a code.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. Unfortunately, it seems that this particular content you are attempting to purchase is unavailable for purchase. If you installed&nbsp;a backwards compatible game using a disk, the DLC should automatically download with it.&nbsp;To verify, you
 can visit My Games &amp; Apps, highlight the desired game, press the Select button, and select Manage Game &amp; add-ons. There you will see a list of all installed DLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            Hi wyckedwytch 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            Network issues with two Xbox Ones connected to one Modem</h2>
                    
<p><span>Does anyone know of restrictions set by Microsoft regarding having two XB1s connected to the same modem / same IP address?</span></p>
<p>Recently purchased a second xbox one and when trying to play online together, we receive alot of "lost connection to server" messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a premium ISP service hitting over 100mbps down and 20 mbps up, so its not an internet speed issue.</p>
<p>One xbox is connected with an ethernet wire and the other is connected with wifi.</p>
<p>When one xbox is online the NAT type is wide 'Open', but it switches to strict on both consoles when running simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Any thoughts on how i can maintain two open NAT's on both consoles?</span></p>

<p>Alot of times you need to port forward one xbox, then can try setting the ip address out of the range of your DHCP server.. &nbsp;Make sure you assign one xbox's ip with in range, for example if your DHCP reange is 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.200 &nbsp;set the first
 xbox in that range, say 192.168.1.75 and set port forwarding for it if you can, then set the second xbox outside that range say at 192.168.1.275 and you may have to DMZ it aswell.. &nbsp;I had two 360s and an xbox one and this is how I fixed it. &nbsp;Now I have a new
 Asus router and it works just perfect without any need to do anything.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are able to boot to Safe Mode with Command Prompt then you can use the DISM tool to remove the most recent updates.&nbsp; Then you can see if you are able to log in.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>DISM to remove updates.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Boot to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>System Recovery Options</span></a><span> and select Command Prompt</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the command prompt run the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>Dism /online /get-packages</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This will produce a list of installed updates and packages. <span>&nbsp;</span>They will look like this:</span></p>

<p><span>State : Installed</span></p>
<p><span>Release Type : Feature Pack</span></p>
<p><span>Install Time : 9/25/2009 12:02 AM</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Find the most recent one and then make a note of the package name.</span></p>
<p><span>Then run: dism /online /remove-package /PackageName:<em>WUClient-SelfUpdate-Core-TopLevel~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~7.4.7600.226(name of update from previous step)</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then reboot your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You will want to start with the most recent and remove them one at a time to find the problem update.</span></p>

    <title>xbox 360 wireless receiver for Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew sa.  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox 360 wireless receiver for Windows</h2>
                    
<p>Looks like I bought a knock off wireless receiver for Windows. What are support options? Does Microsoft deal with any of these devices? I'm running windows 7 and apparently the device has 'compatible with Windows 8' on the outer package, so I am assuming
 it does not work with earlier OSs (when I tried to setup it says not compatible with OS). And when windows 10 comes out will I be stuck with a device that does not work again? Anyone with the same problem?</p>

<p>Is there any chance that the Microsoft version of this device (marked Microsoft, rather than Xbox 360) provides software to map the controller to keystrokes, such as the Xpadder software offered on the web? Seems like a smart idea, I could then use the xbox
 controller with DosBox.</p>

 Dashboard shows all of the files. It worked flawlessly until recently, which is how I got the 2.7TB of files backed up to it. Even Seagate Toolkit can't find the device. What gives? I switched the cable from the main router to the same switch my other two
 NAS boxes are on but no go. It worked fine after I swapped HDD units. Am I suffering with a Seagate feature or a Microsoft feature?

            Curiouser and curiouser. When I search using Ultra File Search Lite, all of the files on the mapped drive show up. When I right click on the mapped drive, the normal properties window opens with all the details as on any other drive. It's the same behaviour
 under both Win7 and Win10.
