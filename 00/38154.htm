<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things to Know Before You Start<br />
The evaluation edition will expire and cannot be upgraded.<br />
To upgrade, the evaluation must be uninstalled and a non-evaluation version of Windows must be re-installed from your original installation media.<br />
Consider running the evaluation edition in a&nbsp; virtual environment or installing on a separate hard drive or partition. The will allow you to upgrade your original Windows installation to Windows 8.<br />
During registration (required) you must login with a Microsoft account and provide your name, e-mail address and country.<br />
You are required to activate the product online within 10 days after installing.<br />
Once the evaluation is installed, you cannot upgrade. To revert to a previous version of Windows, you must do a clean install from your original installation media.<br />
(...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the evaluation period, you will need to replace the operating system on your test computer and reinstall all your programs and data. It is not possible to upgrade the evaluation to a licensed working version of Windows 8. A clean installation is
 required.</p>

<p>They are backed up into my OneDrive account.</p>
<p>I've heard that they'll delete from OneDrive if I delete them from my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you tell me how to safely remove them from the phone without losing them in the cloud?</p>

 the same old people who join and fly around with god mode. so basicly i want to know how many people it takes to file a complaint on one of them to atleast get reviewd.</p>

<p>i don't thnik anything will ever be done. the devolpers want you to move on to MW3. but ignoring this problem, they are hoping you will give up on WaW and buy MW3. i think this is wrong myself. devolpers should support us the same way they want us to support
 them. i feel bad for those that like to keep playing older games and have to go through stuff like this. modders are ruining online gaming. it won't be long before they move on to the new games.</p>

<p>[/quote]Oh so not true, I know of one individual who sent everyone on his friends lists step by step pictures as he modded his console, then sent out modded lobby invites, and then bragged about ripping off some kid for his halo reach flaming helmet code.
 Multiple complaints filed on him and not once was he ever banned. Despite the vast amount of evidence he himself provided in messages. The PET is a pale shadow of what it was when Stepto, Bootblack and the &nbsp;Pro were running the show.</p>

<p>If the DEV's no longer support this game then they need to remove it from shop shelves, why are they expecting us to still buy a game that can no longer be used? also dont you think they have shot themselves in the foot by not supporting their older titles,
 why would we buy MW3 knowing that a couple of years down the line it might be unplayalbe.</p>
<p>Is it worth the risk?</p>

            Over time, batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.&nbsp; How old is the battery?<br />
<br />
Be sure that you turn the computer off or put it in <em>Hibernate</em> mode.&nbsp; In <em>
Sleep</em> mode, it uses a small amount of power and will eventually discharge the battery.<br />

    <title>Bitlocker with eDrive results in system not waking from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bitlocker with eDrive results in system not waking from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have just completed a clean install of Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607) on a ThinkPad W540 with all latest BIOS updates. I have a Samsung SSD 850 EVO, also with latest firmware, put in eDrive "Ready to activate" mode and completed Windows 10 installation.
 "manage-bde -status" shows hardware encryption is enabled as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Size: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 465.21 GB<br />
BitLocker Version: &nbsp; &nbsp;2.0<br />
Conversion Status: &nbsp; &nbsp;Fully Encrypted<br />
Percentage Encrypted: 100.0%<br />
Encryption Method: &nbsp; &nbsp;Hardware Encryption - 1.3.111.2.1619.0.1.2<br />
Protection Status: &nbsp; &nbsp;Protection On<br />
Lock Status: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlocked<br />
Identification Field: Unknown<br />
Key Protectors:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; TPM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Numerical Password</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good. I then installed all driver updates from Windows and Lenovo, skipping only Intel RST which has a
<a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/77885?start=15&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
known problem</a> with Bitlocker, so using Microsoft AHCI drivers instead. Beyond this, nothing has been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, if I put the system to sleep or close the laptop lid, it will sleep as normal. Pressing power to wake up the system shows the lock screen and allows me to move the mouse, but no interaction is possible. The system is effectively frozen. Sometimes,
 after waiting a random amount of time, a blue screen appears with an error similar to CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED or IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL or some other kernel-related error. There are no system or error logs recorded indicating that this has happened, so
 the system has no access to the drive at all after waking up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested this swapping out the SSD with a normal hard drive with no encryption and sleep works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! I'm not sure how to diagnose this problem any further....</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might have occurred due to incompatible or non-updated device drivers or third party applications conflicting with the action performed on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</span></strong><span> error indicates a critical system process died when executing a program or application
 on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
</strong>message indicates that a kernel-mode process or driver attempted to access a memory address to which it did not have permission to access. The most common cause of this error is an incorrect or corrupted pointer that references an incorrect location
 in memory. A pointer is a variable used by a program to refer to a block of memory.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run the
<strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> by following the steps below and check if any power components have changed, corrupted or missing from the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press
<strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type<strong> troubleshooting </strong>
and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on
<strong>View All </strong>from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, boot the computer in
<strong>Safe mode with networking</strong> and check if similar issue persists on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using. Logging into
<strong>Safe mode</strong> will help in diagnosing if the issue is caused due to the corrupted user profile or the services disabled on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select appropriate options to boot the computer into

            <p>Hey MS guy.. this seems to be an issue with computers using Samsung 850EVO SSD drives. See this
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/5607cd34-725e-4f2b-b786-f5ee67b9aa9e/windows-10-1607-hardware-bitlocker-edrive-wake-from-sleep-issue?forum=win10itprosecurity&amp;prof=required" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Bitlocker working in edrive mode fine for months.. then a month or so ago some update caused it to stop waking from sleep. Nothing else changed on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got so mad i reinstalled Win 10 Enterprise 1607 from ISO, Registered, Joined Domain, Enabled Bitlocker. Verified it's running in hardware mode then put computer to sleep. When wake it's hung at a blue screen and nothing works but mouse moves. Let
 it sit for 5-10 min and nothing.. Had to hard power off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not some little check to see if you computer is turned on and install updates issue. If you would like to arrange a call or some how force it to generate dump logs.</p>

            <p>Thanks Likitha and junk430,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that this is a driver problem, but it not some peripheral thing, it is failing at one of the earliest processes that the kernel must perform when waking from sleep. Since it fails before access to the drive is reestablished, it is very hard to diagnose
 because it is impossible to write logs to the encrypted partition. This requires some much more advanced troubleshooting, possibly writing logs to an external device or an unencrypted partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likitha, I tried your two basic suggested troubleshooting steps anyway. The power troubleshooter suggested my sleep timeout was too high (I had set it to "never" to prevent the computer from sleeping and crashing itself after 15 minutes) but didn't fix anything
 else. Rebooting into safe mode did not help because the sleep function is not available in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks SO MUCH junk430 for linking to that technet thread. It's great to know I'm not the only one out there with this crazy problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help continue troubleshooting, these are the BSOD errors I have seen so far:</p>
<p>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (ntfs.sys)<br />
IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL (storahci.sys)<br />
CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously all related to the kernel trying to reestablish drive access and failing. Can we escalate this?</p>
<p>

Technet</a>&nbsp;with no reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a PSID revert last night, wipes all data and reinstalled everything AGAIN! To my horror Bitlocker enabled without asking how much of the disk to encrypt so I knew it went into hardware encryption again!! @#($(%*$% yep.. sleep is again broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I 100% agree there is some issue with the disk not re-connecting. I can see the drive light flickering like mad as it tries to read the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was a betting man.. I'd say the drive is not re-connecting or authenticating after sleep. Anyone from MS want to contact me about this? It's 100% repeatable.. and it USED to work so you guys broke it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The joy of Win10 and the never ending upgrade.. you never know when your computer will BRICK because they hosed encryption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS if you want to run this fast and loose development model you need to support us when you kill things like this!. The clock is ticking...</p>

            <p>Thanks Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the clean boot and the issue remains. I did not get a BSOD this time, instead one time it just stayed completely black, and another time I got a full blue screen with the 'loading' dots spinning in a circle, but nothing happened even after a few minutes.
 When I did a hard power off, the computer entered Automatic Repair mode and did a disk check, but after booting normally the problem with sleep mode is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/5607cd34-725e-4f2b-b786-f5ee67b9aa9e/windows-10-1607-hardware-bitlocker-edrive-wake-from-sleep-issue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, 10 separate users are experiencing this issue immediately after a clean install. The chance that 10 experienced IT users with Technet accounts all made some stupid settings mistake is tiny. This is a new bug related to something that changed in Bitlocker
 eDrive mode, in or shortly before Windows 10 1607 Anniversary Update. Can we please escalate this beyond the boilerplate safe mode troubleshooting scripts? We have already isolated the source of the problem and it isn't some stupid app running at startup.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can absolutely confirm what you're saying. We have 10 Dell E7470 Notebooks (clean install), all have the issue as soon as we enable Hardware Encrypted Bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And MS is just providing "Do clean boot" hints for almost 2 weeks now both here and in the technet forum :-(</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#39;s Outlook Mail app&#58; is it possible to re-sync a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew neilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#39;s Outlook Mail app&#58; is it possible to re-sync a folder if I have previously selected &#34;don&#39;t sync this folder&#34; for that folder&#63;</h2>
                    Right-clicking or long-pressing a folder and selecting "don't sync this folder" stops syncing the folder and deletes its contents from the Outlook Mail app. I'd like to re-sync a folder I've previously selected "don't sync this folder" on.

            <p>You can call me Drew.</p>
<p>1. Yes, I was referring to the Windows 10 Mail app. I call it "Outlook Mail", because in the apps list, it appears as "Outlook Mail", so that is its proper name.</p>
<p>2. No.</p>
<p>3. Open the Outlook Mail app. I'm on a Windows 10 Mobile device, but I assume that the interface is the same for desktop Windows 10 users. In the app, on the left side, three icons below the menu icon is an icon of a folder. Click it to open the "all folders"
 list. On any folder, right-click (or tap and hold, if you are on a touch-screen device) and select "don't sync this folder". Now right-click or tap-and-hold on that same folder, and look for an option like 'sync this folder'. Can't find an option like that?
 Neither can I.</p>

            I have this same problem. If you right-click one of the folders and you select "Don't sync this folder" you would expect to right-click it again and select "Sync this folder" but that is not the case. There is nothing to re-enable syncing for that particular
 folder. Where can this be re-enabled?

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First of all we need to disable the automatic restart on system failure and then we can check if the issue exists in safe mode or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1.</strong> Disable the Automatic Restart to prevent the restarts on system failure.</div>
<div>a. When your computer starts keep pressing F8 on your keyboard till you get the Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
b. Now,&nbsp;use&nbsp;arrow keys, select Disable automatic restart on system failure and press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2. </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a> and check if you still get the error message. If it boots properly may
 be a third party application, drivers&nbsp;or a service is causing the issue. We can use 50-50 approach to narrow down the root cause of the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3.</strong></div>
<div>Also I would ask you to update all the hardwware drivers from the manufacturers website.</div>
<div>
<div><strong>a. Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. Au<strong>tomatically get recommended drivers and updates for your hardware<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

</p><p>This means your Xbox account is a child/teen account. If your Xbox account is a child account that can't be changed in any way as the date of birth is permanently connected to the first date of birth entered when creating your Microsoft account. If that
 is so, you will need an adult to create an account, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12417/microsoft-account-add-members-to-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
invite you to a family group</a> and change some privacy settings for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Microsoft account is an adult account you may be able to access the page to change privacy settings but any changes will not take effect for real if your xbox account is a child account.<br />
<br />
If both are a child/teen account that page will take you to a page about adding a child account to a family.<br />
</p>
<p>On your adult account go here <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/Settings</a> and click on the child's account and allow the option on the first page called "Share stuff people make (Xbox 360: Member Content)" to everyone (must be everyone). Also, on the first page, "Others can communicate with voice,
 text, or invites" to Friends or Everybody. And on the xbox one/windows 10 tab the second option down, "Join multiplayer games", enable that. Then enable joining clubs. And then log out and in on the account in question on the console/device and that account
 can play online and join clubs.</p>

<p>No there is not, and I'm not sure that's something Xbox support can give out due to privacy issues. You could ask them, though.<br />

<h2>            Skype is sending my messages after 10 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know skype had technical issues over the past months and they said it got fixed in november, but that is not valid for my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet speed is best from the world because i live in Romania and i have fiber optic 300 mb/s internet speed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is my skype sending messages after 10 seconds?</p>

<p>Same goes to my colleague here. </p>
<p>He faced this issue, and I helped uninstalled Skype and reinstalled the latest version of Skype.
</p>
<p>Then the same issue happened again. The Skype status changed from online to Blue spinning circle (connecting) status.
</p>
<p>But it went back to normal after few seconds, it happened intermittently.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be because of the age based or content based rating of the app.<br />
Click on this article and refer to the section<strong> '</strong><span><strong>Family</strong>
<strong>Safety settings might be hiding apps because of age rating'.</strong></span></p>

    <title>Surface Warranty Policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidsolar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Warranty Policy</h2>
                    <p>I bought a BRAND NEW Surface Pro. 3 months later stoped working, and the service I get is a return of a refurbished item, clearly with physical signs of damage and use, worse than my almost brand new Surface</p>
<p>The service center claims this is the policy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am stuck with a 2nd hand item, for wich I paid over $2000, and with a product that when brand new failed after only 3 months, now I have about 8 months left on my REFURBISHED $2000 Surface Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think it is just and fair, to pay full price to get a 2nd hand item with a shortened life warranty? I believe, as all other serious technology companies, should have more respect for their customers</p>

<p>I completely sympathize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just last month, January 2019, I bought a Surface laptop i7, 16GB RAM, directly from Microsoft Hong kong. There was a problem with the laptop. Microsft said they can't fix it. Then they exchanged it for a so-called "REFURBISHED" machine. It's obviously not
 a 100% certified machine because the touch screen didn't work properly. Now they will collect this one and send me another "REFURBISHED" machine. This is how Microsoft treat its customers. You spend a load of money to buy their expensive product and when it
 breaks down, they give you a used one?? They "REFURBISH" used, rejected and returned machines to replace other broken machines. I didn't pay all that money for a "REFURBISHED" laptop. It's been more than a month now since I paid all that money and I have wasted
 so much of my time with them. I don't have a working machine to use, and when I do get one back, will be a "REFURBISHED" machine.</p>

<h3> boogieman&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            system can&#39;t access folder</h2>
                    <p>I have two folders that seem to be unaccesible...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. All Users/Documents</p>
<p>2. Program Files/Microsoft Security Client..... (created by my first installation of Security Essentials)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure when the 'Documents' folder became inaccessible, but the Client Security folder was withikng the last week...... It either stopped Security Essentials from working, which resulted in a virus attack (AMSECURE), OR something else stopped it working
 and the virus attack rendered the folder inaccessible... (Not sure which)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discoverd the probelm with the 'Microsoft Security Client' folder, when I tried to re-instal Security Essentials,&nbsp;when recovering from the virus. The instal failed everytime.&nbsp; Once I found out what the problem was, I was able to rename the 'Microsoft Security
 Client' Folder, so that the installation of security essentials then completed ok...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched the internet for a solution to the folder access issue and nothing I do allows me to access the folders......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both folders are shown as READ ONLY which I change, but it immediately reverts back to READ ONLY. I've started in SAFE MODE and checked the ownership and all seems OK,&nbsp;Also... all folders and files within the folder have assumed the same properties and are
 inaccessible.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've completed a full disk check/scan and whilst that found a few bad sectors, it didn't fix the problem......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't open the 'Documents' folder at all...&nbsp;However, I can open the 'Microdoft Security Client'&nbsp;Folder, but can't open folders within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to delete it, I get the meesage&nbsp; that a folder within it is not empty.... however, the top folder and folders within it are all shown as 'empty'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.....</p>

<p>When I listed the attributes nothing was displyed.... I added me to have FULL access and low and behold I can now access the folder...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER.... the 'Microsoft Security Client' folder (renamed to BADFOLDER), has 3 other folders within it.....
</p>
<p>Backup</p>
<p>Drivers</p>
<p>en-us</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After adding me (Graham) and SYSTEM &nbsp;to the list of users with full access, using *.* to ensure everything within BADFOLDER was also changed, I still can't open the folders...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top folder (BADFOLDER) is allowing me access&nbsp;but I can go no further... When I try to open any of the subfolders I get
<em>'The File Cannot Be Accessed by the System'</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>CACLS&nbsp;folder name</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; now produces</p>
<p>OFFICE/Graham:&lt;OI&gt;&lt;CI&gt;F</p>
<p>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM :&lt;OI&gt;&lt;CI&gt;F</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>For about a week now, my windows 10 photos app isn't working and I have no idea why! I checked the screen resolution and tried to access it through my photo files but it comes up with a message saying "invalid value for registry". The app was really good
 when it worked! </p>

<h2>            Microsoft connection problem</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10, and after a few weeks,&nbsp;I discovered I could no longer access the Windows Store.&nbsp; I don't use it that much.&nbsp; I've since discovered that Windows, when trying to connect to any Windows locations (Windows Store, Games, Xbox, weather(!)),
 doesn't think I'm connected to the internet.&nbsp; Everything else works fine.&nbsp; I have manually downloaded updates in the hope it would fix ti but it doesn't.&nbsp; And despite the error messages that people seem to get when unable to access the Windows Store (it's
 really the only clue I have as to what's wrong) I am unable to fix it.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check this KB artivle to see if it applies.<br />
<br />
After you wake a Windows Vista-based computer or a Windows 7-based computer from <br />
sleep or from hibernation, the network icon and the speaker icon in the notification area do
<br />
not show the correct status<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937477</a><br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You mean the Network Notification Icon near the clock on lower right?<br />
<br />
Right Click the Icon - Troubleshoot problems.<br />
<br />
Also it there is an Animation setting (probably not there) toggle it off and then back on (twice).<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Do<br />
same for Network Card (NIC) - Then Right Click on both&nbsp;Devices and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will<br />
refresh the driver stacks.<br />
<br />
Now go look at System maker's site for updated drivers.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Windows 7<br />
loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

There are many causes one of which is the little monitor is paying attention to the wrong network device.<br />
You can try disabling any other network device such as WiFi and rebooting to see if that has an affect.<br />
<br />
Even a hardware issue such as a loose network card&nbsp;that is not secured properly in the computer can<br />
cause this.<br />
