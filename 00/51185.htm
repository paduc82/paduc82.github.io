<h2>            NO SOUND. WINDOWS 10 NOT ALLOWING TO DOWNLOAD REALTEK SOUND DEVICE.</h2>
                    <p>URGENT PLEASE, NO SOUND! I was gifted Windows 10 by MS. It came with no sound, so I followed instructions to install Realtek HD sound driver. The sound has been very poor, so I tried to re-install the Realtek driver, to try to improve crackling noises, etc.
 After removal and attempting to re-install Realtek, OS Windows 10 stated I needed to also re-install Microsoft UAA HD Sound driver, which I never touched!
</p>
<p>WINDOWS 10 IS NOT ALLOWING MY PC TO AGAIN DOWNLOAD REALTEK HD AUDIO DRIVER, NOR THE MS UAA SOUND DRIVER IT IS SAYING NEEDS TO ALSO NOW BE DOWNLOADED! BEFORE, WHEN I DOWNLOADED REALTEK DRIVER, THIS WAS NEVER REQUIRED AND MY PC ALWAYS WAS ABLE TO DOWNLOAD
 SAID DRIVER! NOT ABLE NOW, EVEN&nbsp;WITH MY ANTI-VIRUS "TURNED OFF"!</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE, AND DO NOT REFER MY ISSUE&nbsp;TO MS SUPPORT IN BRAZIL. CALLED THEM YESTERDAY, AND ALL THEY DID WAS "DISQUALIFY" ME FROM ANY HELP, STATING THAT MY COMPUTER WAS TOO OLD, AND HAD HP ISSUES, WHICH THEY NEVER, NEVER, DIAGNOSED! THEY WANTED TO "CHARGE"
 ME SOME STIPEND, TO BE ABLE TO HELP ME!</p>
<p>NOTE, I HAVE BEEN USING WINDOWS 10 FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, NEVER HAD ISSUE DOWNLOADING REALTEK, ONLY NOW, AND WAS ABLE TO USE THIS POOR SOUND SYSTEM WITH "CRACKLES" CONSTANTLY, BUT HAVE BEEN "LIVING" WITH THE POOR QUALITY SOUND! WITH NO SOUND NOW, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
 TO USE MY PC.</p>

            <p>Hello Ron,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>What is the exact error message you're getting?</li></ol>
<p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with incompatible sound drivers. Suggest you to try executing below mentioned troubleshooting steps and check if they help you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). If it does, then right click on the </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">High Definition Audio Device

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>” then restart the system and let the system install
 the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong>Recommended step</strong>)</span></p>

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e11edfe3-bfe6-449b-83b7-e0dce5a6ccae" title="Yashwanth Kotakuri">
<p>Sorry for not returning a response earlier, but somehow I lost your
 kind e-mail! Had seen it in my Outlook, and when I came back it was no longer there. My apologies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Pavilion s7420n, with 4 Gigs memory,&nbsp;which originally had OS XP, then was upgraded to Vista, and then MS offered me free, Windows 10 downloadable version, which I have had for much less than a year. It is a good system less the "sound" quality.
 Sound has always been very poor with Windows 10, I could say horrible! I even changed the speakers thinking they were too poor quality. The truth is that I have always believed that Realtek would improve its audio driver, and this last time on Sunday, I uninstalled
 my Realtek HD Audio Driver, to try to install the most current version again on my PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had an issue re-installing Realtek until yesterday. Suddenly now the OS states that I have to first also re-install the Microsoft UAA HD sound driver and then the Realtek HD audio driver! I try to download the two drivers and it always says, "not
 able to download this on you system". Therefore I have NO SOUND, as the OS won't allow it! Unheard of. I always did it before with Windows 10, and never had a problem downloading Realtek!</p>
<p>Tried calling MS Support here in Brazil where I am visiting, and all they wanted was to find excuses not to help, and disqualify me from service! Not like US or India, where they are always helpful! Always! I don't like MS in Brazil and don't want to speak
 to them ever again!</p>
<p>I have a few screen pictures which I could send but here I do not see where attachments can be placed. I have no, none, sound or audio drivers and the moment and no sound! URGENTLY PLEASE ASSIST.</p>

<h3> dannielcorbit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 incompatibility with Watchtower Library 2014</h2>
                    <p>I can install the Watchtower Library 2014, but when I try to run it, I get the error message:</p>
<p>"incompatible program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the compatibility mode does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a Windows 10 installation be rolled back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I installed it, I have had nothing but problems trying to run my old applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my compilers gave me "side by side" errors.&nbsp; I was eventually able to install the free Visual Studio 2015 (with many dozens of manual steps because it was looking for MSI files in all sorts of strange places that were incorrect), but all of my professional
 compilers have bit the dust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get by with just this one primitive compiler, but I really want to be able to access the Watchtower Library.</p>
<p>Oddly, my older 2011 version works, but it lacks many of the documents that I need to access, since it is out of date.</p>

            <p>Hello Danniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Window 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that you can revert to the host operating system using Windows Rollback feature in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>However, the Windows.old folder located at the root of the local disk where Windows 10 is installed will be deleted after 30 days automatically. The Windows.old folder is used to facilitate the rollback. So please perform any rollback within 30 days or this
<strong>option will no longer be available</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I would suggest you to keep Windows up to date&nbsp;to receive&nbsp;further updates on additional software support.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to help you.</span></p>

                    <p>I'm using a Toshiba 64-bit laptop, running Windows 10 Home, 8gb memory, 1T hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so tired of the continual problems with Windows 10 and here is another one to add to the long list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For over a week now, the Taskbar has not worked.&nbsp; To change from one app to another I have to minimize all the apps I have open and then click on the one on the Taskbar that I want to see.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the solutions I have found on the internet and nothing has worked.&nbsp; Just because of this problem, I wish I never had to turn a computer on again.&nbsp; Are there any solutions that are going to work?&nbsp; If so, I would love to hear them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you said Taskbar is not working, and you will minimize all the opened apps to access the one you wish to from Taskbar. Be clear with&nbsp;how exactly you are trying to accessing the apps from Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I suggest you to check if you have enabled the Auto-hide option for Taskbar, if so try to disable and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>I tried all your suggestions but that didn't change anything.</p>
<p>After considerable research, I was able to determine (surprisingly) that this problem was caused by an Add-on in Firefox rather than a problem in Windows 10.&nbsp; I must say this was a first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believed it was a Windows 10 problem because it affected all the applications on the Taskbar, not just Firefox windows.&nbsp; And I was not having it on my Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; When I ran out of other ideas, I contacted the Support Forums for Firefox and they
 suggested that I disable the Add-on called&nbsp; ReminderFox as it might be causing the problem.&nbsp; They said that it was being re-written due to other issues that might cause problems like this.&nbsp; I disabled it, rebooted, and everything is working fine now.&nbsp; They
 have since contacted me and said that only one option that I had set in the Add-on was causing the problem and all I needed to do was not check that option.&nbsp; Sorry, I can't remember which option as by that time, I had disabled the Add-on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm marking this as solved.&nbsp; I posted this here in case someone else might be having a similar problem and this might help.&nbsp;

</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To reinstall the Operating System:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (Most don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>_____________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>

<h2>            ISATAP Adapter &#35;9</h2>
                    I have been having an issue that on some days my wireless card will read my modem and other days it will not. I am currently plugged in using a wire, but did pay to have a wireless computer to use a wire. This is a recent problem that has occured in the
 last month. How do I fix this problem. When I go to my device manager it says my device is working properly but I have a yellow exclamation triangle on my ISATAP #9. what is this and how do I fix it?

            MrRichofSTLMo,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
The ISATAP #9 is related to Internet Protocol 6, which can cause issues with devices that don't use it and can safely be uninstalled as most networks today still use IPv4.<br />
<br />
To remove IPv6 and all of it's associated devices:<br />
Go into the properties for each network adapter, wired and wireless,&nbsp;and either uncheck the box next to Internet Protocol 6 (TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer.&nbsp; Then go into device manager
 and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or ISATAP adapters.&nbsp; Then reboot your computer.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, try this:<br />
To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:<br />

    <title>How to get rid of Free Sound Recorder toolbar and search engine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sevenbeauties  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get rid of Free Sound Recorder toolbar and search engine</h2>
                    <p>OpenOfficeOrg, Schirmfoto, and YouTube Music Downloader are great freeware programs.&nbsp; They do what I want.&nbsp;&nbsp; But beware of freeware on the whole.&nbsp; My problem is with Free Sound Recorder.&nbsp; It's something I wanted, and it's freeware, so I downloaded it.&nbsp; I
 was careful to uncheck two boxes before installation that would've included the Free Sound Recorder toolbar and search engine, but these unwanted extras were installed anyway and appear at the top of every browser I use.&nbsp; I used Revo Uninstaller Pro to uninstall
 the toolbar and seach engine, but no good.&nbsp; Then I uninstalled Free Sound Recorder altogether, but I still have the pesty toolbar and search engine.&nbsp; Worse, the added toolbar fattens the top of my browser and makes searches in Facebook much more difficult.&nbsp;
 I've contacted the vendor four or five times for help in removing their pests, but I receive no reply.&nbsp; I haven't done a system restore and after three weeks or so time is running out as System Restore only goes back so far in time.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Too bad FreeSoundRecorder didn't provide me with the link you did, but after informing them I had filed a complaint against them to their State's Attorney General's office I received prompt apologies and instructions for disabling or deleting
 their toolbar.&nbsp; An&nbsp;add-on toolbar takes up space at the top of your browser and, for me,&nbsp;made searches on Facebook very difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love some of the freeware I have, especially OpenOfficeOrg, but with few exceptions, my experience with freeware has been disappointing.&nbsp; I caution anyone to remember the old adage: "if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Well 1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load or use the "Even better methods" or "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.

<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have update the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Tried all of the above apart from clean install from ISO file as thats too involved and I'll lose too much. Still stuck in previous build 1703 (which works) but Windows Update stuck in RESTART REQUIRED mode and it takes ages to shut down. I read it could
 be associated with Samsung DRivers on 960 EVO SSD whic is why I supplied spec ?????? any more ideas?

            Well, you definitely need the latest firmware for your drive from Samsung.(This has been the 1st line of my performance troublshooter for a long time.)
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that eventually 1703 will not be supported and you will lose security and other important updates.

<br />Here is my performance troubleshooter :
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Cick Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Docking Station casues speakers to make clicking noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterlt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Docking Station casues speakers to make clicking noise</h2>
                    When my surface is docked the speakers intermittently make a clicking noise. I do not have anything connected to the dock's audio port. When it happens It seems to be about one second apart, one speaker then the other. It does not seem to be tied to the
 screen sleeping. I have not tracked down weather it happens while the speakers are muted from windows or not. Also have not tracked down if it has to due with connection to a monitor via HDMI (which i cam currently using via display port to HDMI adapter).
 Will post further updates. Anyone else seeing/hearing the same issue?

                    I upgraded my Toshiba L50-B-1NL to Windows 10 yesterday and I now find that my Bluetooth mouse is not working (it was absolutely fine in Windows 8.1). On checking device manager, I find that the Bluetooth is completely missing in the alphabetical list.
 I cannot seem to find any assistance anywhere on how to resolve this problem. Can anyone help?

            I have a Lenovo Y510P and I have updated by Bluetooth drivers 2 or 3 times. Still no luck. I did this running windows 8.1, then when the issue didn't get resolved, I did a clean install of Windows 10. This did not fix the problem. I went to go download
 the drivers again but only Windows 8.1 and older are available. What do I do?

<h2>            phone number changed, can&#39;t update because Microsoft chat requires a verification code from the old number</h2>
                    My phone number changed. When I try to update my account, it requires a verification code to be sent to the old number which is no longer working. I went through the "other" verification process and was approved to update my&nbsp; password with a note that
 I should enter my new phone number, but of course when I try to enter it, Microsoft again requires the code to be sent to the old number. Very frustrating. How can I update to the new number?

<h2>            Auto Windows update keeps turning itself off</h2>
                    So, I've done a bit of looking into this, but I haven't been able to find a solution. It seems that my SP3 keeps turning off Automatic Windows Update every now and then; I think it the 3-4 days I've had my SP3, it's done it 5-6 times. I saw something about
 Bitdefender 2015 interfering with it, but after looking into it, every box that says 'Postpone Automatic Update' is left unchecked. Does anyone know why this might be happening and how to fix it?

<div>Uninstall Bitdefender, and use Windows built in protection. Does Windows Update</div>
<div>work correctly after doing this? If yes, <a href="http://www.bitdefender.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bitdefender.com/support/</a> is</div>

            Thanks for this. I just spent the whole day over at the Microsoft Surface Forums (the unofficial one) trying to sort this out, and it degenerated into a flame war. Turns out all I had to do was rid myself of the horrendous Bit"defender" that was installed
 by the Geek Squad at Best Buy where I bought the machine. I'm now running Avast Internet Security with no issues. I'm set to update automatically. All is well. Now if I could just get my one other little quibble sorted out (but that's a matter for another
 post).

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for responding to my first post. &nbsp;I am new at this and not very smart.
<div>My system was compromised by a malware. &nbsp;I removed it but in doing so was afraid it might</div>
<div>have left some other malware.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I used Ccleaner to clean my files and registry. &nbsp;It show I had missing files. Trying your links&nbsp;</div>
<div>you sent. &nbsp;It asked for the product key. &nbsp;The only key I have is the one provided by HP which is</div>
<div>a OEM key and it does not. work for microsoft. &nbsp;I have made recovery disks from the recovery</div>
<div>drive but am afraid that if I try to install it will ask for it.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HP support says they can't provide one. &nbsp;They want to charge me a $100.00 buck to fix it. &nbsp;I&nbsp;</div>
<div>then thought I would just go ahead and purchase Window 8.1 but it seems the only ones or for</div>
<div>a upgrade from windows 7. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Any suggestions on how to get out of this mess I got myself into? Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Problem with the Windows Volume Mixer&#58; doesn&#39;t show anymore the green bars for the application</h2>
                    Hi to all!<br />
Sorry for my bad english, but it isn't my mother language :s<br />
I've a PC with Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 x32 with this issue: the volume mixer show me the green bar&nbsp;(that indicates the volume level)&nbsp;only for the speakers and not for the other applications as windows media player, for example.<br />
Maybe this screen explains better: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4538/immaginevfo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4538/immaginevfo.jpg</a><br />
I hope someone can help me (if someone understand how I speak english :S)<br />
<br />
Thanks, TheDarkTrainer

<p><span>Hi TheDarkTrainer,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Windows Vista Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will need some additional information in order to help you better.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the sound card installed on the machine?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this the first time you are experiencing the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For single channel sound cards, you will only be able to see the green bar for the Master Volume Control and not for the other applications
 such as Windows Media Player. </span></p>
<p><span>The controls on other applications are given to control the volume of the particular application with reference to the Master Volume
 Control.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>For instance</strong>, if you scroll the Master Volume Control bar to 100% and then play a music file in
 Windows Media Player. You can try to open the Volume mixer and increase/decrease the volume control for Windows Media Player, you will notice that the Master control will set the green bar accordingly and will not let the green bar cross the bar of the Windows
 Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you mute the Volume Control for Windows Media Player, it will automatically make the green bar disappear from the Master Volume Control.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you have multiple applications running on the machine at the same time and using the sound card, you can try changing the
 levels on different controls to see the effect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With multiple channel sound cards such as sound blasters, it may be possible to see green bar on individual applications also.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information will help. Please post back and let us know<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
