<h2>            Managing Office 365 installs shared among family, and office mobile</h2>
                    Last spring, my dad and I split the cost of an Office 365 Home Premium subscription. He has one install on his PC, I have one on mine. He paid with his card and I just gave him half in cash, so it is registered with his MS account. Of course, I was able
 to sign into my own Live account on my install after initial installation, which is great. However, I have a couple questions about managing it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.) I read recently, starting in December those who share 365 installs will be able to manage their install, even if they aren't the account with whom it's registered. How does this work? Has it begun yet?</div>
<div>2.) is this required for me to use Office Mobile on my Android device under my own account, or can I sign in with his initially, then just use my account, like I did when I installed it on my PC?</div>
<div>3.) or will Office Mobile recognize that I am signed into the subscription on a PC and thus work?</div>
<div>4.) and finally, do Office Mobile logins count from your five installs you get with the main subscription, or is it like an added bonus?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your time! I think that's all my questions so any answers concerning these items will be unbelievably appreciated. Have a beautiful day!</div>

<div>PS I'm not sure what Version and Topic to select since this pertains to both Mobile on Android and 365 on Windows 8.1. I selected 365 and Win 8.1. I hope that is sufficient and apologize if I did that wrong. First question here. Thanks again!</div>

            Thank you for the clarification. Will this sharing apply to people who have it installed already. Will he be able to still delegate it to me, or at least by me reinstalling it without taking up another install?
<div><br />
<div>And is it just five, so that each activation on a computer or android/iPhone take away, or is it - as I read last night - five PC and five mobile? There's so much conflicting info out there, I thought it best to come here, to the source. Thanks for your
 time.</div>

<div>you said "Please be informed that the location of the cache of a certain app depends on its mobile device settings. Most probably, the cache of the data of the app, Outlook.com app in your case, is located on where its information has been saved." which
 restates my question but does not answer it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where does outlook.com app keep its downloaded email data?? If its on /data or /cache&nbsp;</div>
<div>they are unix file systems and a soft link redirect is possible, if its on /sdcard its fat32 and not&nbsp;</div>
<div>movable by file system redirects.</div>

            So thus means the app stores all the email data on the device internal storage, &nbsp;not on the sd Card and it is impossible to change this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question here in Microsoft Community. We understand that you wish to know how the cached data on Outlook.com being stored on your mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, installing the Outlook.com app will be installed on the internal memory of the device. Some other mobile devices have the ability to move the apps from internal memory to external storage (e.g. SD).&nbsp; Now if your mobile
 device is capable of doing so, then the Outlook.com app can be moved to SD storage. However, we cannot guarantee if all the components of Outlook.com app are being moved as well. We suggest that you contact your mobile device manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>

<p>That was a very poor answer. &nbsp;I assume Microsoft did some testing. &nbsp;I have the very popular S5, most apps move the memory to the SD card. &nbsp; It does not appear that it does but can someone at MS say for sure.</p>

            <p>Has anybody been able to determine if Microsoft plans to update the Outlook app so that it is capable of storing data on the SD card? &nbsp;Or, is there some funny hidden trick to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that we don't get into another loop of "your mobile device", allow me to qualify the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;--&gt; We are only concerned about versions of Android that support either moving an app to the SD card or allowing an app to access data on SD card (e.g. modern versions that basically everybody uses now)</p>
<p>--&gt; We know that most phones have not re-written Android to prevent the above mentioned functionality. &nbsp;But if there is a phone with blocks preventing an app from working as designed, we are not concerned about these phone either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a pure Microsoft App perspective -- is there a way to have Outlook store data on the SD card. &nbsp;If not, will that functionality be added?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Yes, in theory you should get emails when people post replies.</p>
<p>You can also quickly find all of your posts by taking a look at your profile. The simplest way is to click on your name above your "picture". It is a hyperlink to your profile.</p>
<p>If you post a reply to someone elses question, in this "new and improved" version of the site you have to "Me too" it to get emails for other replies.</p>

            You say "Outlook Address Book" but you posted in the Outlook.com forum. Outlook.com doesn't have an "address book" per se. It's web-based and the contacts can be found at <a href="https://outlook.live.com/people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/people/</a>. Desktop Outlook, the Outlook application that's part of the Office 365 suite you install on your PC, has an "address book":, but that's just a specialized view of the Contacts folders you have in the mail profile.
<br />
<br />Is your subscription for Office 365 the Home Personal, or Business subscription and are you accessing an office365.com mailbox or an outlook.com mailbox? In either case, simply connect the Outlook for Android app to that mailbox and it will sync your phone's Contacts to the mailbox's contacts and you won't need to export/import anything. I've done this very thing and I know it works.

<h2>            Emailed Excel spreadsheets appear blank, but data shows in the formula bar when a cell is highlighted.</h2>
                    Emailed excel spreadsheets appear blank, but data shows in the formula bar when a cell is highlighted. Similarly, emailed Word documents show grammar and spell-check cues but appear to be otherwise blank. Essentially, when anyone sends me a document that
 is .xls, .xlsx, .doc, and .docx, I can't see anything in it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's going on and how do I make the data show up in these documents?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The data is not visible in print preview, and I have tried changing font sizes, zoom, and selecting the areas where I know data exists. The spreadsheets and word documents open just fine on other computers. I have tried this in Word/Excel 2007 and Word/Excel
 2010 on the same computer.&nbsp;</div>

<p>In Outlook, click on Contacts -or Search People - then I have two folders.</p>
<p><strong>My Contacts</strong> - with sub folder Contacts - Personal Folders</p>
<p><strong>iCloud</strong> - with sub folders:</p>

<p>Contacts - iCloud - all my contacts appear here.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t synchronize Nokia 6288 with Outlook contacts</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have PC Suite 6.81.14.1 installed. Have a problem sycnhronizing my Nokia 6288 with both Outlook and Outlook Express contacts (which are the same). Sync of Outlook's calendar and tasks goes completely fine and smooth but upon starting sync of contacts the
 screen of the phone suddenly turns white and the connection with the computer is lost. I've tried it both on MS Outlook and OE6 but the result was the same. Please help.

Maybe you should try the latest PC Suite version (6.86). If that didn't solve the problem, update your phone SW to the latest one.

            try this (if you don't have yet): Nokia PC Sync &gt; Settings &gt; Create new settings<br />
<br />
If that did not help, I think that problem is in your contacts in phone. Maybe you can try this copy those to SIM card and then delete those from phone memory -&gt; does sync working after that?<br />
<br />
(And if the result is same again, maybe you should restore phone's factory settings)<br />
<br />
(BTW: when you move contact to SIM, you lose some information from contacts, e.g images)

            Yes, I've already tried to create new settings a couple of times but it still fails. I'll try to follow your advice moving contacts to SIM. The question is: having contacts in phone memory with images etc should generally create such a problem with sync?
 Thanks for your help.

            Same problem - still have to do a retry. But I've seen elsewhere that having an SD card installed may cause the hang. So will remove that before trying again.

            <p>I can now report that 14316 has installed - removing the sd card seemed to be the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be on the safe side, perhaps try removing all USB connected&nbsp;drives as well.</p>

            I didn't have an SD card connected, but I did reset my BIOS to default configuration, and the update proceeded. I then went back to my standard BIOS configuration, and everything seems to be working properly.

            Simply removing the SD card, as well as a USB mouse dongle unstuck the installer for me.

<h2>            Emails delayed up to 24 hours when delivered to Hotmail addresses</h2>
                    <p>We have observed that emails sent to Hotmail addresses are consistently delayed for up to 24 hours. We have registered on the&nbsp;<a href="https://postmaster.live.com/snds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SNDS Program</a>&nbsp;and observe that all Sends have a
 'green' indicator. We also check the email that it has a high deliverability score (using spam testing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails sent to other domains arrive immediately, but there is a transient delay to Hotmail addresses. We've inspected the message header and we observe that emails are being delivered immediately from the Email Marketing Platform to Microsofts Server, but
 it's almost as if Microsoft are quarantining these emails for a few hours before delivering to recipients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, this does not occur for all Hotmail recipients, but for those who this affects, the emails are consistently delayed in being received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can review a message source of one email at&nbsp;http://digital-logic.s3.amazonaws.com/temp/sun-email-source.txt (note that I have obfuscated the email address but I can provide this on request).</p>

Possibly Excel sees those as text.</p>

<h2>            Build 16281 - another build that fails to install</h2>
                    <p>Build 16281 downloaded and installed on my Toshiba laptop without missing a beat, but,</p>
<p>the same build downloaded to my Toshiba desktop All-in-one failed to upgrade from build 16241 to build 16281.</p>
<p>This problem with the All-in-one has been ongoing for each new build since 16241.</p>
<p>The upgrades all download and get to a 45% install before restoring back to 16241. (Build 16281 got to 54%)</p>
<p>I can't access numerous functions from build 16241 including the feedback hub, so this is from my laptop.</p>
<p>I have tried numerous suggestions posted on the feedback hub, even a clean install,&nbsp;without any luck.</p>
<p>Would appreciate a suggestion that works.</p>

<p>I have been having update problems since build 16241. I have tried all the recommendations re the registry,&nbsp; troubleshooters, deleting the update folders, even trying to do a clean install from a usb with build 16251 as suggested by&nbsp; someone on the forum.</p>
<p>That resulted in the error:</p>
<p>0x8007001F - 0x2000D</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation.</p>
<p>and keeps restoring to the previous version.</p>
<p>So how can I do a clean install which formats my hard drive and installs windows 10 without loosing my windows 10 registration ??</p>

</p><p>As long as you have windows 10 activated on the computer, when you do a clean install and get to the screen asking for key, just skip entering anything and continue on. Once your computer is back online it will auto activate with MS servers. Activation is
 now machine dependent, no key required.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue still persists, we suggest performing a clean install using Windows 10 Media Creation tool. Refer to
<strong>Use installation media to reinstall Windows 10 </strong>section on this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for more information on how to perform a clean install on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Performing a clean install will remove all your personal files, apps, drivers you installed, customization from your PC manufacturer, and changes you made to settings. We recommend that you back up all of your important documents,
 pictures, software installers, and other personal data before beginning the process.</span></p>

            The installation of the latest builds (16288) is still a problem. I have tried all offered suggestions without any success. The Update trouble shooter finds corrupt database errors, but doesn't seem to fix them. I tried a clean install from a USB with&nbsp;build
 16251 recommend by a feedback, but all that did was to go through the update motions and reverted to build 16241, no clean install. What is so frustrating, build 16288 installed on my laptop without any problems, but will not install on the desktop. I will
 just keep trying each new update as they are released.

</p><p>Did you install from the ISO file itself? To do clean install you have to make a bootable flash stick or DVD using Rufus, or if&nbsp;you use installation media, it can do this for you to flash stick.&nbsp;You then would boot from the flash stick and go from there.
 You would then use custom install, delete all existing partitions, and then let windows do its thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just ran setup.exe, all you are doing is updating but keeping whatever is corrupted on your system.</p>

<h2>            Seeing Unwanted Reminders - Outlook for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded my Outlook from 2011 to 2016 (or 365 - I still am not sure exactly which I have, except that it says version 15.16), I am seeing calendar reminders for another user at my college. This did not happen with Outlook 2011, and I can't find a
 setting that would allow me to turn these off. I can't dismiss or acknowledge these other reminders, since they are not mine, but they will pop up frequently during the day - I can close the window, but sometimes the reminder come right back, and sometimes
 I will not see them again for 20-30 minutes. The other user has me as a reviewer on their calendar, but has not changed my permissions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to turn off reminders completely, since I would like to see my own reminders. Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott</p>

            <p>I deleted Arshad's ridiculous answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think there is a setting where you can turn off reminders for a shared calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think permissions can be set so that the owner can get reminders and the shared calendar can go without. I think either everyone gets the reminder or no one. You can easily test by turning the reminder off for an item and check with the owner to
 find out whether or not the reminder was displayed in the owner's calendar.</p>

            <p>The more specific question is, "has there been a change in the reminders processing between Office 2011 and Office 2016?" The specific circumstance did not occur in Outlook 2011 at all. When I asked other people whose calendars I am a reviewer for, they
 had seen their reminders before I migrated, and since I migrated. I did not see their reminders before the migration, and aside from the one user, I do not see their reminders now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to make sure I did not mis-state the case before, this is not a "shared" calendar in the sense that multiple users are owners/authors. The account whose reminders I am seeing has only one owner, but I am one of several reviewers with no editing
 privileges (which I suspect does not allow me to acknowledge the reminders that I am seeing). And since the calendar in question belongs to my boss, I suspect that she really does not want me to edit her reminders...

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log in with Internet Explorer v.11.0.9600 I am completely successful in logging in with all my options and settings available to me, but when I try to go to my mail all I get is the following error message at the top of the page under the "Outlook.com"
 bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: Unable to get property 'name' of undefined or null reference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I appear to be able to log on OK.&nbsp; I can access my profile, acc't settings, options, etc., Just no folders, nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!&nbsp; Just a blank page except for the error message at the top of this page where my folders normally appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to worry or will it straighten itself out by itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to get my mail again tomorrow morning and see.&nbsp; If it's OK you won't hear from me again, except I'll thank you now if (hopefully) that's the case.</p>

            <p>Well, it still doesn't work.&nbsp; Now trying with Firefox v. 30.0.</p>
<p>I get a slightly different error message in Firefox:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: n.FolderList.getContainerById(...) is undefined. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that contains more info.&nbsp; The Outlook bar indicated I had several unread messages, but of course, I just get the above error message when I click on it.&nbsp; Oh, and when I click on it, it opens a new browser window with the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further investigation shows that all my mail, to my great relief, is still OK because both POP and IMAP access worked properly.&nbsp; I set up Thunderbird for IMAP and Outlook 2013 for POP.&nbsp; I was able to read my old and new messages, deleted two using IMAP and
 one using POP, so it's just my web access that's broken.&nbsp; I'd like to fix/have it fixed because I'd like to be able use the Web interface again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not at my end because I'm able to fully access, using the web interface, my wife's email plus a couple of other hotmail/live.com accounts that I have access to.</p>

</p><p>OneDrive, People and Calendar work from your post and also from the "Outlook.com" bar along with the other links Word Online, Excel Online, PowerPoint Online, OneNote Online.&nbsp; As I've said, once I log in, EVERYTHING'S normal except my mail folders don't
 work, all I get when I click "Outlook.com" is a new browser window with the "Outlook.com" blue bar at the top and just the error message where my email folder normally would appear.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I log in at: &nbsp;"https://login.live.com"</p>
<p>
</p><p>get directed to:&nbsp; "&nbsp;https://bay179.mail.live.com/default.aspx?id=XXXXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XXXXX number may be to sensitive to post publicly, maybe not.</p>
<p>I'll try&nbsp;that url&nbsp;and if I think it's safe to post, I'll post it a little later.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us. I see that server status for your account is running normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the possible causes, we need to ask further clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>When does this started?</li><li>Have you done any changes in your account before this happened? If yes, please provide details about it.</li><li>Do you access your account in a mail client or mobile device? If yes, were you able to view your emails from there?</li><li>Do you by chance have another Outlook.com account? If yes, do experience the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>For us to review your account, please provide us the affected email address. Post it on the private message I’ve initiated for you. Note that you need to be signed in to your Microsoft Community account to view this then click

<h2>            Can I get Skype &#34;active speaker focus&#34; with just two callers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I would like to have a Skype call consisting of Me and One other person (two on the call in total), but I would like the screen view to switch between me and the other caller when each of us speaks - so switching between each of us on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might sound a bit strange to be seeing yourself on-screen when you're speaking but I'd like to record the output in Video to replay back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea if / how this can be achieved please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately, there’s no option to set the screen share feature to automatic when someone starts speaking on a group call. You will still need to manually
 share your screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How do I share my screen in Skype?</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, Skype does not have a video and audio recording features this is to protect consumer’s security and privacy. You may search for available third-party
 applications that function as a recording which can be used side by side with Skype.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Van_M,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not looking to 'screen share' but to hold an interview format with the focus changing o match who is speaking at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this way, when the recording (recorded using a 3rd party app) is played back it is naturally switching the view to the speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense - is there a way to get Skype to do this switching of focus to the active talker during the call at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 missing some 2007 animation effects&#63;</h2>
                    I m working on a powerpoint presentation created using PowerPoint 2007, however I am working on it on a machine with PowerPoint 2010.&nbsp; In using 2010 some of the animation effects that were used in 2007 appear to be missing.&nbsp; The key one for me currently
 is the ability to change the font and font size (an emphasis effect in 2007).&nbsp; This is useful to be able to increase the size of text without getting aliasing (jaggies) issues.&nbsp; Where has this effect gone?&nbsp; How can I get it back?

<p>You know grow/shrink is a very poor substitute for the change font size animation. The quality is appalling with text.</p>
<p>If you would like the original animation back this may help</p>

    <title>Creating dynamic references to a changing list of appendices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pait123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating dynamic references to a changing list of appendices</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently writing a document which will ultimately have a large number of appendices at the end, but the final number and ordering of the appendices won't be clear until almost the very end of the process. I would like to start adding appendix references
 within to the main body of the document now (eg "Please refer to 'Appendix D: The Cat Sat on the Mat' for a specific example of this"). However, if I do this using just plain text, my appendix letter references (eg Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C) in the
 main body of my document will soon become out-of-sync with my actual appendix letter assignations. For example, my original Appendix D may later become Appendix E if I insert a new additional appendix above the original Appendix D; and that will render incorrect
 any plain-text references I've already made to "Appendix D" in my main section.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that there must be some way to create dynamic headings for, and in-text references to, these appendices. Ideally, I would like two things to happen any time I add a new appendix above pre-existing appendix/ces. Firstly, the subsequent appendices'
 headings should automatically update (eg, the heading 'Appendix D' will automatically change to 'Appendix E'; the heading 'Appendix E' will automatically change to 'Appendix F'; etc). Secondly, any references I've made to, say, 'Appendix D' in the text of
 the main section, should automatically turn into to 'Appendix E', etc.</p>
<p>I've had a look online but can't seem to find the exact steps required to make this happen. It might have something to do with table of contents and/or headings settings (both of which I'm very rusty on), but the articles and answers I've looked at so far
 seem to begin at the halfway point, when half of the steps I need to know have already been undertaken. Does anybody know how I could proceed with this? Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>To begin with, you need to use autonumbering for the appendix titles. Ideally, you will use one of Word's built-in heading styles for these paragraphs (if you have used the top heading levels for other headings in the document, you can use lower-level styles
 for the appendixes; see <span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numberingappendixes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numberingappendixes.html</a>).
</span>In the <strong>Define New Multilevel List</strong></span> dialog, select A, B, C numbering to link to your heading style and type "Appendix" before the number field in the "Enter formatting for number" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then use <strong>References | Captions | Cross-reference</strong> to insert a cross-reference. If you used a built-in heading style for the appendix titles, select&nbsp;"Heading" as the "Reference type"&nbsp;and "Heading number" for "Insert reference to."&nbsp;
 If you haven't used a built-in heading style, you can still use cross-references, but you will have to first bookmark the heading, then insert a cross-reference to the bookmark. Cross-references don't update dynamically, as numbered paragraphs do, but they
 do update automatically when you update other fields, as by printing or switching to Print Preview.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help. I've been making some headway, also using the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ohONwESuLo for help. However, I am still finding it difficult to insert a reference to a full appendix title (by which I mean, "Appendix D -
 The Cat Sat on the Mat" rather than just "Appendix D -" or "The Cat Sat on the Mat") It seems I can do so by inserting two cross-references one after the other, the first to 'paragraph number' and the second to 'paragraph text', with a space manually added
 in between. This seems inefficient though. Is there a way of including the whole title in a single cross-reference?</p>
<p>I'm also finding that any insertions of 'paragraph text' cross-references (eg, "The Cat sat on the Mat") don't conform to the formatting of the paragraph around them in font size; the cross-reference text comes out larger than the surrounding paragraph.
 However, insertions of 'paragraph number' cross-references (eg, "Appendix D -") do conform to the surrounding paragraph's formatting, even though the original referenced "Appendix D - " heading text has different formatting (italicised and bolded in the heading,
 vs standard formatting in the paragraph). I'm not sure why the two cross-reference types are treated differently in this regard. I'm also finding that even if I manually change the formatting of an overly-large 'paragraph text' cross-reference, if I later
 need to update that cross-reference field to reflect changes to my appendix list, it goes back to the incorrect formatting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this means that to insert a single cross-reference, I'm having to do all this:</p>
<p>1) Insert a 'paragraph number' cross-reference for the desired appendix (eg, "Appendix D -")</p>
<p>2) Add a space manually</p>
<p>3) Insert a 'paragraph text' cross-reference for the same appendix (eg, "The Cat sat on the Mat')</p>
<p>4) Change the formatting of the 'paragraph text' cross-reference to match its surrounding paragraph (by reducing font size).</p>
5) Additionally, whenever I need to update all fields to 'sync' my cross-references to my updated appendix list, I need to manually find my 'paragraph text' cross-references again and update their formatting again (by reducing font size again), to make them
 match their surrounding paragraphs again.
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that there are ways to get around some/all of this! It hardly seems worth it to proceed with this if the above steps can't be cut down.</p>

            <p>Step 4 shouldn't be necessary unless you have applied direct formatting to your headings. Direct formatting is formatting that you have applied by selecting text and changing text properties via the ribbon or the Font dialog box for example. Instead, apply
 heading styles to text and modify the styles as needed. </p>

            <p>I'm not sure whether or not I've done that aspect correctly. What I did was this: I created a new heading style for appendix headings via Home --&gt; Styles --&gt; [arrow] --&gt; Create a Style, and added some formatting to the style's numbering via Home --&gt; Paragraph
 --&gt; Multilevel List --&gt; Define New Multilevel List. If I recall correctly, this caused correct formatting for the "Appendix A -" part of a given appendix title, but the next part of a given title (eg "The Cat sat on the Mat") came up in a different format.
 I therefore added further formatting to the new style by going to Home --&gt; Styles --&gt; [right-click the new style] --&gt; Modify. That made the full title of each appendix (eg "Appendix A - The Cat sat on the Mat") consistently and correctly formatted. However,
 then came the steps 4 and 5 issues mentioned above. Weirdly enough, the 'bad' formatting of certain cross-references embedded within paragraphs, is not the same formatting as that which I set for that part of the style via Home --&gt; Styles --&gt; Modify. I set
 that part of the headings to be bolded and italicised, size 10, but the cross-references come up as non-bolded (good) and non-italicised (good), but size 11 (bad), even though the surrounding paragraph is size 10. (Hope this makes sense.)</p>

            By default, the numbering of an autonumbered style will match the font formatting of the style. Applying direct formatting to the heading paragraph will also affect the formatting of the paragraph number and may be propagated to the cross-reference.

            I'm not sure if the formatting I've done (described, rather awkwardly, in my previous post) counts as direct formatting or not, although I suppose it must count given the subsequent cross-referencing issue. I don't suppose anybody knows if there is a better
 way of adjusting the appendix titles that doesn't involve direct formatting, but which will still propagate to every new appendix title?

            To change the formatting of all appendix titles, modify the style that is applied to the titles. This formatting will also apply to the paragraph number unless you have directly modified its formatting through the
<strong>Define New Multilevel List</strong> dialog.

            <p>I assumed that you had been using the built-in headings for the appendix, but the same principle applies to any paragraph style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove direct formatting (that is, formatting which is not saved in the paragraph style applied to a paragraph), you can do the following: Select the text of the paragraph. Press Ctrl+SpaceBar to remove direct font formatting (font, size, italic, bold,
 underline, etc. not in style) and press Ctrl+Q to remove direct paragraph formatting (spacing before/after, line spacing, etc.).</p>

            <p>I've just tried CTRL + SpaceBar; the appendix heading text looks the same after I've done this, but presumably any formatting of the wrong type has been removed. Unfortunately, adding a new cross-reference to that appendix still yields the same in-paragraph
 font size issue. I tried applying CTRL + Q as well; this removed the numbering part of the heading title, ie the "Appendix 1 - " part. I might have been able to work around that by manually re-entering it, but I found that without numbered that part of the
 heading title, that appendix doesn't appear in the list of items that can be cross-referenced. I tried searching for headings to cross-reference, instead of numbered items, but no 'cross-refererencable' items showed up.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into this, but it seems that what I want either isn't possible in Word, or it will take up too much time to achieve it and won't be easily replicable in other documents without generating problems anew.</p>

            <p>The fact that Ctrl+Q removes the numbering tells me that numbering hasn't been set up properly. You really should associate numbering with the styles.</p>

<div>I have a row of sales values on a worksheet called Sales, it simply a row of sales for each day from the previous year.</div>
<div>On a worksheet called 2014 i have a calendar, each day references the sales sheet in order to give this years daily goals.</div>

</div>
<div>ex.</div>

</div>
<div>f3:&nbsp;=SUM(Sales!D2)</div>
<div>f4: =SUM(Sales!D2+1)</div>

            <p>Copy this formula and put it into F2 and copy it down as far as you need:</p>
<p>=OFFSET(Sales!D$2,0,ROW()-ROW(F$3))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $ symbols are important, in this case they keep the row reference from changing in the formula as it is filled down the sheet.</p>
<p>OFFSET() says take a basic cell address [D$2] and look some number of rows above/below its row (in this case we use row offset of 0, so we're leaving alone and always looking at Row 2 on the Sales sheet) and also how many columns left (negative) or right(positive)
 of that basic cell to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the column offset we use&nbsp; ROW()-ROW(F$3)</p>
<p>and that says take the current row number that the formula is in and subtract the row number of cell F$3 from it to find out the number of
<em>columns</em> we need to offset.&nbsp; In the first formula that evaluates to 3-3=0&nbsp; but when you copy it into F4&nbsp; it becomes 4-3=1&nbsp; which says look 1 column to the right of Sales!D2,&nbsp;in other words&nbsp;look in cell Sales!E2.&nbsp; When you copy it into F5 it will evaluate
 to say "look in cell Sales!F2".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>A note, and I know that several of Microsoft's examples make it look like it is required, but when you are just going to get the value of a single cell you don't need the SUM() part of the formula:</p>
<p>=SUM(Sales!D2)</p>
<p>is the same as</p>
<p>=Sales!D2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUM() is actually a math operator that adds the values referenced in it, like this:</p>
<p>=SUM(Sales!D2:G2)<br />
would total up all the values over on the Sales sheet that are in D2, E2, F2 and G2</p>
<p>It can also be written like&nbsp;this if you just like to type:</p>
<p>=SUM(Sales!D2, Sales!E2, Sales!F2, Sales!G2)</p>
<p>and you can use it to total up cells that are scattered around, like</p>
<p>=SUM(Sales!D2:G2, Payments!R3:R6, F5)</p>
<p>Which would get the sum of Sales!D2:G2, add it to Payments!R3:R6 and finally, add in the value in F5 on the same sheet the formula is on.</p>

Try...&nbsp; =OFFSET(Sales!$D$2,0,ROW()-2,1,1)<br />
<br />
Above assumes formula in is row 3, so column offset is 3 -2<br />
In row 4, the column offset equals 4 - 2 and so on.<br />

            I think you'll (probably) find that all of them work, based on those providing responses.&nbsp; The key for you will be which one(s) you understand best and can continue to work with in the future should you need to.&nbsp; Thanks for letting us know you're reviewing
 things - a whole lot better than some who just come, post, go and we never hear back from them at all.

<h2>            I want to use my old email address to rename my existing email account.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Hotmail account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was obliged by Outlook to create a new account because my Hotmail address was not accepted. After four rejections, I finally was able to establish a new account, however I have lost all the e-mail messages I had accumulated in Hotmail over the years.<br />
I now find out that I could have kept my Hotmail address and wonder what I can do to revert to my previous Hotmail address.<br />
Many thanks for your assistance<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to help you with your issue in using your old email account as your new email address. Let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you create a new email account, your emails, contacts, and other information of your old Hotmail account will not be transferred to it. Your new email account is a separate email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When was the last time you accessed your Hotmail account? <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<font>Free Microsoft email accounts will be deleted if you don't sign in for more than 365 days. After an account becomes deactivated, all messages, folders, and contacts are deleted. Incoming messages will be sent back to the sender
 as undeliverable.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>However, you can try to rename your new email account. You can use your old Hotmail email address if it is available. Please check out this

<br />
That's not the behaviour I experience; it does print the file.&nbsp; However, Adobe Reader does remain open (I can't speak for Acrobat, which I don't use).&nbsp; This seems to be a peculiarity of the application as the same doesn't happen if you call the procedure to
 print other files formats, such as Word or text files.<br />
<br />
What is the exact code you used to call the ShellToFile procedure?<br />

<h2>            Hi Navigation Bar, Are You Ok With Windows 10 &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After long time wait Microsoft released Windows 10 for Phone but i think Navigation Bar is not feeling good with Windows 10 also all Lumia users are not feeling well with Windows 10.The reasons are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Unsmart and fatty/wider Navigation Bar in Windows 10 Mobile .</p>
<p>2.Navigation Bar can't hide in most of the apps in Windows 10 Mobile .</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5ddc2d-645f-428f-9971-5fdd41de06f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5ddc2d-645f-428f-9971-5fdd41de06f2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.If Navigation Bar can hide in some apps ,it cut the screen space as black bar.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26f0293-4749-4625-9a07-950cc6166da3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26f0293-4749-4625-9a07-950cc6166da3" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Now when Microsoft can make happy our&nbsp;beloved Navigation Bar in Windows 10 by solving this important issues???</p>

<p>Thanks for ur reply.I am using Lumia 540DS also Navigation Bar issue is not only for 535 &amp; 540, it common issue for all users who have updated their phone into Windows 10.Please solve this irritating issue urgently.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, this is not a common issue, therefore I had to ask for your phone model. Furthermore, you face a different issue than Lumia 535 users do: In their case, big parts of the content of an app are not shown at all, because the app is getting wrong values
 for the screen dimensions – or uses the wrong values to calculate the screen dimensions – that seems to be Microsoft’s point of view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case of your Lumia 540, the apps do not cope with the ability to rescale/redraw when the navigation bar is hidden by the user. Now the question arises: Was this done on purpose or slipped that through Microsoft’s internal testing. No answer for that.
 Microsoft wants you to report problems via Windows 10 Mobile » All apps » (Windows) Feedback. If possible, switch to the keyboard ‘English (United States)’ before you open that app. Then, you see the ‘international’ issue. You might find a similar report(s)
 like yours: Pick only one (!) and upvote it. Did you go for that already? Furthermore, please, inform the app developer(s) of your app(s) about this issue. App developers have other resources to double-check the current situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, please, note: Some app developers left the Windows platform already but their app remained in the Store. You might not see any interest in your report nor any update of that app, from that developer. Anyway, please, report, otherwise developers
 might not be aware of that issue at all – not every app developer owns a phone for each possible screen resolution and with software buttons. Therefore: Did you consider to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 via the
<a href="http://download-fds.webapps.microsoft.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/WindowsDeviceRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery Tool</a> (requires a Windows computer)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please solve this irritating issue urgently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to avoid a possible misunderstanding: I am an end-user like you. Furthermore, Microsoft does neither leverage Microsoft Answers for individual support or as feedback channel. Why ever. Therefore here, your comments drown in the Internet swarm, because
 Microsoft does not even answer the above question: ‘Is that intended or not; is that a software bug of Microsoft or something the app developer has to cope with, now.’ Go figure!</p>

</p><p>No, the app developers must adapt their apps to Windows 10 Mobile - if they want to. One of the main purposes of the Insider program is to allow developers to test their apps in the new OS environment - again, if they are interested. It is quite normal and
 far from surprising that the apps work OK on 8.1 - that is the OS they were most likely developed for.</p>

<p>The issue on the Lumia 535 is a different one. If you do not understand this yet, please, try to explain which part of my answer were unclear.</p>
<blockquote>Microsoft has to solve this issue.</blockquote>
<p>Mhm. Difficult to answer that one – back in Windows Phone 8.1, what worked differently? Were those apps bigger, more buttons or … which feature is affected by this? If I understood you correctly, in case of the Lumia 540, this is a ‘cosmetic’ issue. Or is
 there any functionality affected?</p>

            Ya may be cosmetic issues but when an user upgrade his device he just expect&nbsp; more perfect user experience.But incase of Windows10 Mobile the opposite incidence is occured&nbsp;.Lots of silly faulty issues is existed in Windows 10 Mobile over the Windows 8.1
 Mobile. I don't know how and when Microsoft solve all those issue!!!!

<p>Yes, therefore this is different from Lumia 535 users, because there buttons and content is missing. Nevertheless, you are right, in those apps, you should not be able to hide the navigation bar at all. So consequently, you asked about not hiding the navigation
 bar in those not-yet-updated apps. That is a valid concern. Did you feedback that via Windows 10 Mobile » All apps » (Windows) Feedback already? Then, you would not have this degraded experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to the size of the navigation bar itself, that is a very complicated issue, because the size of that bar changes with All apps » Settings » System » Display » Size of … on this display. Therefore, five different drawing areas exist for app
 developers, for each screen resolution. More than five different screen resolutions exist in the Windows phones landscape. That are more than 25 situations (states) a game has to cope with. Microsoft really knows how to get rid of app developers. I am not
 sure, if it is worth to report this to Microsoft. You have to show continued interest in Windows 10 Mobile towards your app developers.</p>
