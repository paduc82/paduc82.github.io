<h2>            Newly built PC can&#39;t connect to the internet</h2>
                    So I've just finished building a pc for myself and I installed Windows 10 on it but I can't do anything because it won't connect to the internet even with an ethernet cable. Looking around on the internet it seemed like my problem may have been that i
 hadn't loaded the disk that came with the motherboard onto, but I did that and installed all the drivers on it but it still won't connect to the internet at all.

            Hi Shenan thanks for replying, but no device manager doesn't come up with any exclamation marks. When I click update drivers it says I have to best ones. I think part of the problem may be because I'm a student I'm trying to connect to eduroam, which is
 the network the ethernet cable is hooked up to but for that to work you need to download a programme called a Configuration AssistanceTool from the university website, and I can access those pages but when I try to download and run CAT it's just telling me
 that "No Wireless interfaces found. The installer cannot continue."&nbsp; The only thing I have found online is that maybe I am missing a Wireless Network Interface Card, but even if that is the case (and I'm not sure it should be) I don't know why that would mean
 the ethernet only allows me to access these two webpages to download CAT.<br />

<br />
<br />Yes you can use wildcards when searching in Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Here is a really good guide to all sorts of advanced search criteria, including the use of wildcards . . .

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Have you tried disabling your security system's firewall? Have you deleted and re-added the printer in Control Panel?
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
 If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>If not, do it in this manner:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>1. Make sure the printer is turned on and connected to your network. Verify that you can access the printer's internal web page by browsing to its IP address before continuing.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
2. Click &gt;&gt; Start &gt;&gt; Control panel &gt;&gt; Printers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
3. Click the Add a printer</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
4. Select Local printer</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
5. Select Create a new port and select Standard TCP/IP Port and click Next button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
6. Under Device type, select TCP/IP Device. Under Hostname or IP address, enter the printer's host name (found on the printer's network configuration report the generated above). Click Next.<br />
If you get a message about Additional Port Information Required, then the printer was not found using the host name. You can go back and retry or using the printer's IP address instead of the host name.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
7. Select Hewlett-Packard from the list of manufacturers and select and select your printer model. Click Next.<br />
If your printer model was not listed, then select Have Disk, browse the HP CD that came with your printer and select the first file that starts with hp and ends with inf. Click Open then OK. Select your printer model. Click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
8. If you are asked, use the currently installed driver.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
9. It will ask for the Printer name -- enter a new name or use the existing one. This will be the name of the printer that you select from other applications.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
10. You may be asked to share the printer. Make a choice and click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
11. The Print Test Page box appears. Go ahead and print it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
12. Click Finish.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope the above information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Type cover - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcsdjustin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type cover</h2>
                    I own a Surface Pro 3, and a Microsoft type cover, that was working perfectly when i shut it down the other evening, but when i went to use it the next morning the type cover would not work.&nbsp; Neither the trackpad or the keyboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have since&nbsp;<br />
1)<span> </span>attempted to do a force shutdown by pressing and holding the power button for 30 seconds then pressing and holding both the power button, and the volume up button for 15 seconds.<br />
2)<span> </span>Cleaned the contacts on both the keyboard and the surface with alcohol.<br />
3)<span> </span>Updated windows.&nbsp;<br />
I have tried the type cover on another surface and it works without error so I am certain it is not the type cover.&nbsp; I have also tried another type cover on my surface, which did not function either.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The type cover is not listed in the device manager, and when I leave the device manager open then disconnect and reconnect my type cover it does not refresh like it would normally do when a new device has been detected.&nbsp; Further, when I click scan for new devices
 it still does not recognize the type cover.&nbsp; Even when I press and hold the power and volume up buttons to enter the configuration menu the type cover does not function, and it appears to not recognize the device.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please advise<br />
<br />

<h2>            Issue with the USB not being recognized on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface 2 which I chose primarily because it has a USB port.&nbsp; I have tried connecting my external hard drive but the tablet doesn't recognise that it has been added.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second surface I have had the first got sent back since the touch
 screen became unresponsive and had some issues with&nbsp;the USB port.&nbsp; I have tried the trouble shooting forums for advice, reset my tablet and the hard drive did connect then until the tablet went into sleep mode. The error message says USB root hub (xHCI) code
 43 the USB hub failed to reset.&nbsp; I understand this is an issue with the driver but can not find a&nbsp;way to fix this on my tablet all the web sites say app unsupported by this device.&nbsp; Starting to wonder about the choice I made since having so many problems,
 would really appreciate any help you can give, not really techie so layman terms please.

<p>Where is the power?&nbsp; E.g. is the drive powered separately?&nbsp; Do you have a powered USB hub you could use?&nbsp; Is your Surface plugged in?&nbsp; Otherwise I can imagine, for example, having a problem trying to drive an unpowered USB drive with just the Surface's battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have had a related problem with USB ports associated with my powered hub on both my Surface and Surface Pro.&nbsp; I had to use Device Manager to delete all USB hubs and controllers and start over to get them to recognize everything again.&nbsp; This happened
 after some updates.&nbsp; Troubleshooters were unhelpful for this scenario though I don't see why they would not have considered it and at least offered it as an option to us.</p>

<p>FWIW I just deleted them and just let the OS decide what it wanted to do about adding them again through Plug-and-play.&nbsp; Also, I deleted all the hidden ones.&nbsp; I suspect that may have been just as significant.</p>

<p>Sounds like you aren't seeing the advice about setting power options or about using a powered hub.&nbsp; FWIW I do have a powered hub and even with it found the OS absurdly turning it off to save power!&nbsp; Changed that and have since had no more problems with the
 devices that the powered hub supports.&nbsp; Of course I also disabled the power saving setting for those devices JIC.&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would probably get some telephone or chat&nbsp;support for this, either from your drive manufacturer, your retailer or your computer manufacturer.&nbsp; Any of those sources would probably be aware of the changes necessary to be made in your OS to avoid your symptom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Installed vs Usable RAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ksdn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed vs Usable RAM</h2>
                    
<p>I had a quick look at some other threads which talks about Usable RAM being shown less than Installed RAM.&nbsp; Mine is also same case.&nbsp; In my case, my Windows 7 x64 Ultimate box shows:</p>
<p><strong>Installed memory (RAM): 4.00 GB (3.75 GB usable)</strong></p>
<p>I understand that .25 is gone, due to other devices/motherboard etc....</p>
<p><strong>Now my question to experts</strong>: Considering that there are no hardware changes and if I add 4GB more RAM (making total 8GB of physical RAM), then what will be the value of my usable RAM?</p>
<p>The first right value will be marked Right Answer :)</p>

    <title>Input Language&#58; Setting Could Not Be Read - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexleadingedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Input Language&#58; Setting Could Not Be Read</h2>
                    <p>I am getting this error message in Windows 10 Language Settings. I have tried to change everything to English (United States) to try to reset this issue but it has made no difference. I suspect that there is a corrupt Registry entry somewhere. Any idea how
 to rebuild / reset this so that Windows realises what the correct language pack is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Language settings are a major issue here in New Zealand as English (United Kingdom) has keys in the wrong place (@ and $) while English (United States) has different spelling and date format (we use DD-MM-YYYY) so we need to have this correct or else it
 can break programs, including databases, and can be a major issue for people who use special characters in their passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to delete this profile and rebuild it as it has been heavily customised.</p>

            <p>Cortana doesn't work in New Zealand with English (New Zealand), Cortana says "I'm afraid I'm not available to help in your region."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change our locale to Australia and language to English (Australia), which is very similar but has a few critical differences, then it works. We have the same issue with Siri on our iPhones, which must be set to Australia for it to work. The AI (Cortana
 / Siri) then expects us to say "mobile" which isn't a word we use, we say "cellphone", which is a major issue when we want the AI to call someone on their non-landline. We also don't use the word "Freeway", we say "Motorway" and no where will you find this
 term in New Zealand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see some of the other differences here if you're interested:</p>

<br />
<br />Where did you purchase Windows 10, was that from the Microsoft Store, or some 3rd party vendor?
<br />
<br />That error seems to indicate corrupt installation media, was the installation media included in that purchase, or did you create that yourself?

<br />
<br />Do you have a product key for Windows 10 Pro or only installation media?
<br />
<br />What is your current OS? Is it Windows 10 Home?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Updates troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hi.
<br />
<br />The error code 0x80070424 that you described also means "ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST". The Windows Update depends on the following services:
<br />
<br />- Windows Update
<br />- Intelligent background transfer (BIT)
<br />
<br />If these services are disabled or missing, you will find this error code. Therefore, you must ensure that the services are running. Follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Click Start, type services.msc in the Start Search text area, and then click on enservices.msc.in the list of programs. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or click Continue.
<br />
<br />2. Double-click on Intelligent Transfer Service in the background.
<br />
<br />3. If the start status shows Stopped, click Start and then OK.
<br />
<br />4. Double-click Windows Update.
<br />
<br />5. If the start status shows Stopped, click Start and then OK.
<br />
<br />6. Double-click on Workstation.
<br />
<br />7. If the start status lists Stop, click Start and then OK.
<br />
<br />8. Close the Services window and try to install updates again.
<br />
<br />
<br />If the intelligent transfer service in the background does not appear in the list of services, check the following link:

<p>Same issue here. I wondered if they will "unlock" after the June update. I read something about needing to "check in" so if your subscription lapses, you lose access the games.

<h2>            Skype won&#39;t log in suddenly.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype on my Microsoft Lumia 640 XL LTE phone will not let me log in because "network issues". Last night, July 4, I was able to log in perfectly through my home wifi network. This morning I can't. Every time I put in my correct username and password the
 pop up says that it can't log me in and I should try later. Or that my network settings aren't right, when I already know it's not a problem. I can use my WiFi for everything else, except for Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Sincerely , Erik</p>

</p><p>Can you post the version of the OS that you are running on your Windows phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please be advised that Skype is no longer supported on <strong>Windows phone 8.1 and lower
</strong>so this might be&nbsp;the reason why you are unable to sign in to your device. Kindly check and let us know.</p>

<p>How is it possible to stop an application like Skype on Windows Phone 8.1 that has been running fine for years??<br />
<br />
I have a Lumia 640, I don't have any reason to buy another phone. Considering that Skype was already removed from Windows Phone 7.5, that the modern App on Windows 8.1 was stopped as well (making it unusable on 7" tablet), even if I still prefer a Windows Phone
 to Android, I won't get another Windows Phone anymore.<br />
<br />
I think this policy of Skype/Microsoft is totally stupid and is the best way to convince the last Windows Phone users to go for something else than Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Unless you're going to push Windows Phone 10 for free to all existing Windows Phone 8.1 users, this is f..g stupid decision.<br />
<br />
Right now you're simply pissing off the few Windows Phone users left. Not a very smart move! Maybe you just want to finally bury totally the Windows Phone division?</p>

            This is absolutely crazy. &nbsp;One day it works fine, then the next day Microsoft is purposely blocking Windows Phone 8.1 users from accessing the App. &nbsp;Sure, the app wasn't great, but where is the alternative? &nbsp;Where is the upgrade? &nbsp;Oh wait, I found it,
 on my desk top suddenly appended to my OneDrive. &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;It has nothing to do with removing support for the device. &nbsp;It has everything to do with trying to kill it. &nbsp;Microsoft, will you pay for me to upgrade my recently purchased Windows Phone to an Apple
 or something that actually works? &nbsp;What other functionality are you removing? &nbsp;Was always happy with my Windows phone, and a big supporter, but not anymore, and not of Microsoft products. &nbsp;Any and all alternatives will be sought. &nbsp;Microsoft no longer has the
 monopoly it once had.... too bad it treats its customers like it still does.

            Hi. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems, but I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />You can follow this guide from Microsoft to change your language settings:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027670/windows-10-add-and-switch-input-and-display-language-preferences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402767...</a>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps. Please let me know if I can assist you with anything else.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can change the system language by following these steps:
<br />
<br />Use the Windows key + I keyboard shortcut to open the Settings app.
<br />Click Time &amp; language.
<br />Click Region &amp; language.
<br />Under Languages, click Add a language.
<br />Click the language you want to add, and select the specific variation if applicable.
<br />Select the new language and click Options (and download any the language packs as necessary).
<br />
<br />On Region &amp; language, select the new language, and click Set as default.
<br />
<br />If applicable, under Country or region, select your location to enable the Windows 10 to give you local content.
<br />Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Control Panel.
<br />Click Add a language.
<br />Click the Advanced settings link in the left pane.
<br />
<br />Click the "Apply language settings to the Welcome screen, system accounts, and new user accounts."
<br />
<br />On the Administrative tab, under the "Welcome screen and new user accounts", click the Copy settings button.
<br />
<br />Check the Welcome screen and system accounts and the New user accounts options.
<br />Click OK.
<br />
<br />Click OK again.
<br />Reboot your computer and upon restart, you should see the new default language globally set through the operating system.
<br />
<br />You'll find this feature especially useful when you work on a mixed-language environment where you need to configure workstations with different preferences to accommodate users. In addition, this feature will help in those times when you happen to purchase a new computer that ships from another country with a different language, or even when you move to another region of the world and you want to change your PC preferences to match the local settings

<br />
<br />
I am new to Vista (I know a late bloomer, but been holding out for 7) I have learnt over the pass few days of my options, I don't know which way to go.&nbsp; I can down load a password changer, or reload Vista Home Premium account.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If I download the password changer will it work for 7?<br />
<br />
Also, I am a bit muddled.&nbsp; I want to burn/copy across my OS Vista onto CD's or DVD's, could you advise me on how to do this, pls.&nbsp; I have a software called Power2Go Version 6.&nbsp; I would like to have this done in case I do something wrong with the Vista if using

            You will have to see how the Manufacturer has set the Recovery Partition up, and how they&nbsp;make their Recovery disk/s from it..<br />
<br />
<br />
"Your Computer Manufacturer set up the Recovery partition on your Hard drive&nbsp;at their factory, not Microsoft.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You will have to contact them either about how to access your Recovery Partition, or ask them to send you a set of Vista Recovery disk/s."<br />
<br />
<br />
The Recovery Partition reloads Vista to Factory settings..<br />
<br />
Please contact them re this matter.<br />
<br />
Cheers.
