<h2>            photo&#47;video is all dark even with all the lights in my room on</h2>
                    okayao before I downloaded windows &nbsp;i was using "youcam" and was able to manually adjust the brightness/contrast what have you, well now all my photos/video's are dark..There isn't an option to make these adjustments. I "googled" it, and received - answers
 like, make sure your batter isn't in &nbsp;power saver mode,"check" and to make sure the brightness was turned all the way up "check" I made the few adjustments you can on the camera settings, and I downloaded several different cameras from the store...and yes
 all my lights are on room is totally lite up????????????????

<span>Hi guantai,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers from device manager and restart the computer , let Windows install generc drivers and check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Uinstalling from Device Manager:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the<strong>Start</strong>
 button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under
<strong>System</strong>, clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the list of hardware categories, find
 the device, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the<strong>Driver</strong> tab,
 click <strong>Uninstall</strong>, and then click ok and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may download the driver for sound adapter from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    <div>Recently I've had a problem with the Bluetooth on my computer. I haven't been able to connect any devices. When I went to the device manager I found this error code "This device cannot start. (Code 10) STATUS_DEVICE_POWER_FAILURE" I've found a few other
 pages on advice on fixing this problem but nothing has worked. So far I've tried to run the troubleshooter, I've tried reinstalling it, I've tried the System File Check tool but still I get the same error. Anyone know what I should do?</div>

            am I understanding correctly, that you have had Windows 10 version 1903 installed for some time now and only recently began having an issue? The issue did not occur shortly after updating to the newest version?

    <title>Windows RT 8.1 Installer directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enrique_spain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows RT 8.1 Installer directory</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows RT 8.1 in a Asus Vivotab RT TF600T.&nbsp; I have observed that Windows store the patchs files on a directory (C:\Windows\Installer) but Cleanmgr don´t delete such files. The directory has now 8.4 Gb on a SD of 32 Gb, and with every patch installed
 the size of that directory growth continuosly. How I can clean that disk space? Asus have said to me that they don´t give any support for the Operating System installed on their tablets. I have read that cleanmgr offer some switches (sageset, tuneup, etc.)
 but I´d prefer to ask if some of these can be used without problems and how to do it. I use a microSD 32 Gb also in the tablet to store information, but the operating system are consuming more and more disk space on the primary SDD of only 32 Gb. In an HDD
 environement this is not a problem, but in a tablet with its SD limitations is a hard situation. I have created a sageset profile with almost all the options marked for deletion, except the older service pack intallation files and some reports. When I run
 it I free up nearly 0,5 Gb, but I wish to know if the other options, that the cleanmagr not recommend to mark, could be marked without problems. I think that Microsoft could have designed RT with some oprtions to free all the innecesary files due to the SD's
 space limitations.<br />
Thanks.</p>

            I used Disk Cleanup frequently in admin mode and delete all the unnecessary files of the SD drive with it. I have tried all the recommendationes given, but the problem is the installer directory. I´m interesting in the command sageset. I have enable almost
 every options, but I don´t know if Windows update cleanup and Files discarded by Windows upgrade could delete some extra files without any problems to the operating system. What exactly these options do? Is there exist some option that allow the deletion of
 the installer files? Office and Windows updates are filling the SD drive and that's a very serious problem in a tablet. I can´t replace the internal SD drive with one bigest and all the posible information has been alredy tranferred to the external microSD.
 I don´t understand how Microsoft allow such an abnormal&nbsp; situation in the tablet's environments. In a PC a HD has space enough to allocate the installer directory, but in a tablet this is not possible at all.<br />

            <p><span>Hello Enrique,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>“Cleanmgr /sageset:n” </strong>is command-line option to configure the Disk Cleanup tool (Cleanmgr.exe) to automatically clean up certain files and schedule a task to run at a specific time by using the Scheduled Tasks tool.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, please reply to these questions, to understand the issue better:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. When you were using Disk Cleanup, did you select “<strong>More Options</strong>” for<strong> uninstalling the programs you no longer use</strong> &amp; for deleting
<strong>System Restore and Shadow Copies?</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the section: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">To delete system files</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Have you tried to delete files from <strong>WinSxS folder</strong> (It stores the Windows Component Store files, which are used to support functions needed to customize and update Windows).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the section:<strong> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/free-up-disk-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span><span>Important Notes: </span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><em><span>1. Deleting files from the WinSxS folder or deleting the entire WinSxS folder might severely damage your system and make it impossible to restart or update your PC.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>2. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p><span>I would also like to inform you that in Windows RT 8.1 there is no “Installer folder” under “C:\Windows”. It could be a virus infection or a corrupted folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to </span></span><strong><span><span>run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner
</span></span></strong><span><span><span>to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</em></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Answering your questions, YES when I use Disk Cleanup I always delete the latest system Restore points and the Programs and logs. I mark all the options availables to deletion. The WinSxS folfer is not a problem because its size is small, compared with the
 installer directory. This WinSxs only have some megas of data, not the gigabytes of the intaller directory. In this revision of Windows RT 8.1 the installer directory exist, not only in my machine. I have used two Asus Vivotab with the same directory structure
 under Windows RT 8.1 and the files in these directories are msi. Windows Defender has check all the unit without finding any abnormal files or virus infections. In an Acer tablet I have found also the same installer directory. As I have said, my question is
 if I can mark ALL the options in the sageset command of cleanmrg, except the relative to the ESD recovery files, without problems to the operating system.</p>

            <p>Running into the same issue here, on a Lumia 2520. The "C:\ drive" is only 25GB, and the Windows folder is 15GB (60%! crazy!), of which 6GB is in that "non-existing" Installer folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup (user / admin), Restore Point clean-up etc don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Installer folder is a system folder, which is hidden from Explorer, which contains files for the Windows Updates. Running "dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup" as admin might cleanup that folder, but I haven't been able to test. On my
 2520 it fails due to some pending operations and I can't reboot the tablet now (wife has a "few" open tabs in IE). There's an optional /resetbase parameter which might reduce the size even further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're up for a test, please run "dism /online /cleanup-image /?" first and read the description.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. I have cleanup near 1.5 Gb of SD drive space with: dism /startcomponentcleanup /resetbase, but no change has ocurred in the installer directory. As I have read about that command, it allows the cleanup without the 30 days delay period
 and work over the WinSxS directory. Fortunately, due to this space freed up it is possible to apply new updates to the operating system and Office, but if the installer directory is continously growing, at the end all the SD drive space would be filled by
 it. In a tablet I can´t change the SD drive with one bigger, and I must work with its 32 Gb of space. I dont know if it is possible to redirect the installer directory to other unit (join command), but without such a solution the problem persist. In my tablet
 don´t exist any Service Pack backup files to be deleted, probably because I have cleanup before. I work with Windows RT 8.1 and Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have resolved the problem reinstalling the OS, not refreshing it. With this solution I have recovered all the space in the SDD drive, from 3 Gb free to 14 Gb now, with all the patches installed. I use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows RT 8.1
 in the tablet Asus Vivotab TF600T and its work. The problem is the time requiered to do so, but I only had less than 3 Gb free on the SD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to other users with the same problem.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just can't install windows virtual PC in my windows 7 enterprise 64 bit machine. When the PC restarts to install it starts installing it and then says that it had failed and reverts the changes... I already tried many many suggestions that I was online
 with no luck.</p>
<p>I tried using System Update Readiness Tool to fix my Windows with no luck... I tried using sfc /scannow also with no luck, they both say I have a problem they can't fix. Anyway, it doesn't seem to be related to windows virtual pc but it just won't install...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uploaded the logs from the CBS log folder here:</p>
<p><a href="http://cid-662594af1ed7e330.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-662594af1ed7e330.office.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public</a></p>
<p>In the CheckSUR.log there is a problem that the tool couldn't repair but I also have no idea how to fix this manually... I have the original win7 installation dvd on hand but still no clue how to fix this or this affects windows virtual pc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has any idea how to fix this?</p>

<p>I haven't seen it come back yet. It somehow got triggered after I used an USB device ( my cardreader ). The exact moment the error popped up was a couple of minutes later when the system started doing its automatic maintenance. I've indeed loaded all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of refreshing this surface,&nbsp;even though&nbsp;Ive had nothing but problems after I did this with previous models, seeing as its still having the driver issues occasionally ( 4101 driver display error).</p>

<h2>            What is the best magazine for New game info&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My main focus is on XBOX 360, but my kids have a Wii and a Nintendo DS (they want a Nintendo 3DS).&nbsp; I used to have the XBOX magazine, but before I subscribe again, I thought I should see if something like Gameinformer would be better.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp;
 I'm not on the net a lot, so I need a mag to keep me up to date.</p>

<p>To be honest, even though you had said you're not on the net much, online is the best place to get all the new information as obviously it's updated all the time, whereas a magazine only comes out every month. GameInformer is very well regarded, as it magazines
 like Edge and Game. I also enjoy reading Gamesmaster.</p>

<p>Game Informer is the only gaming magazine that I read, mostly because it's included in my Gamestop membership. &nbsp;But it is a high-quality magazine and offers good reviews of games for all systems. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I generally wouldn't buy magazines. The information in them is usually a month, or two, old. I use the net and have accounts at places like IGN and Gamespot.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If I do want some toilet-reading, though, I will occasionally pick up a copy of Game Informer. They're the best.</p>

<p>I think most of the mags outside of Nintendo Power are going digital so I'd be careful about subscribing to print mags now. &nbsp;You might pay your subscription and they end up stopping their print editions, so unless you have a iPad, Kindle, etc etc you'd be
 screwed. &nbsp;Just check Kotaku.com once in a while and you'll be fine. &nbsp;</p>

<p>though for a magazine, it's pretty meh</p>
<p>@gamer, the best buy magazine, is very nice because it has good coupons for games, if best buy has a sale on the same thing the coupon pushes the price WAY down.</p>

    <title>Movies come out looking squished after I burn them onto DVD. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevo3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movies come out looking squished after I burn them onto DVD.</h2>
                    Before I burn the DVD the movie plays correctly, nothing is squished, the aspect ratio is correct. Even when I preview the DVD before I burn it on Windows DVD Maker the movie does not look squished. I tried burning the movie in both aspect ratios, but
 I still get a squished look. Am I doing something wrong? Or do I just need to use a different DVD software?

<p><span><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You stated above that the aspect ratio is correct before burning but are you changing the aspect ratio in the settings before continuing with
 the burn?</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You might try taking the file and importing it into the Movie Maker program and let it build the file with the proper settings. Save the file
 in Movie Maker using the proper aspect ratio and color encoding (PAL/NTSC). After the file is saved open DVD Maker and click add files then add the project file you saved in Movie Maker. Hopefully this will import the file in the right aspect ratio and allow
 it to come out burned properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Give this a try and let us know if this helps.</span></span></p>

            Hi Edward,
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            You can try the Office forums for ways to install the right Office 2000 Service Pack for your version. Windows 7 will run Office 2000 if updated, but your Swedish spell checker may be one of the features that will not work.

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem iwth resolution in SFB. When I want to call via my phone using SFB app to videoconference (Yealink VC120) the resolution of video that I get to the skype is really bad (the vcs has 1080p camera). When I tried to call via skype (normal client)
 the resolution was better. If I am calling by for example easymeeting app the resolution is very good. I am attaching the screenshot.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Mateusz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, please make sure the Skype for Business is up to date. Then, please check if other attendees encountered the same issue. And please check if the issue occurs on screen sharing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If others encountered the same issue in a conference call and screen sharing works well, the camera may not be compatible with Skype for Business. In this situation, you can try another camera to check the issue. If the issue persists, may I know if you

    <title>Missing DLC content for ARK&#58; Survival Evolved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> il shadow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing DLC content for ARK&#58; Survival Evolved</h2>
                    <div>This is regarding items for the game ARK: Survival Evolved. There are 5 Distinct DLC items that you can purchase that are Bionic skins for 5 different Dino avatars in game. These have been non existant in the game yet are still available to purchase in
 the store.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>These items should be removed from the store until the developer chooses to fix the issue (issue has been ongoing since November 6th of 2018).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to report these items as a potential violation in the store itself with no confirmation that it went through. I have also attempted to contact support with no clear means of doing so, so i am posting about it here.<br />
<br />
These items have been purchased by many people and no longer exist in game, the developer has reported they are looking into once over a month and a half ago with no further communication on the issue, these items are still being sold in the store, yet do not
 exist in the game.</p>
</div>

<p>If the dev has said they are looking into it following up with them is your best bet. You also reporting via the store was a good move.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Forza 4, cracked disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fms dazza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza 4, cracked disk</h2>
                    
<p>Hello :) I dont know if this is the right place to ask this but sure, what harm if it isn't... &nbsp;I bought my disk on launch day and over time i have noticed a crack forming from the center of the disk outwards, I have the game installed to the hard drive
 so as soon as the console reads the code on the disk it plays away normally, but it has gotten to the stage where the crack is to big and its unable to recognise the disk at all now, has this happened to anyone else before?</p>
<p>Im not 100% on this but I think that its the friction caused inside the console on the disk that has caused the crack, therefore its not really my fault..? Would I be able to get the disk replaced with another..? Any help would be great :) I dont fancy paying
 another €40 for the same game....</p>

<p>Most likely the crack comes from putting the disc in and out of case. &nbsp;This has happened to numerous games of mine in the past, I now take extra care when putting them back in the case. &nbsp;Another suggestion is to keep your discs in a CD case, eliminates the
 possibility of cracking the plastic. &nbsp;And if your game is installed, I highly doubt any friction inside of the console would cause this, unless your console has fallen.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply! :)</p>
<p>The xbox has never fallen...partly because its already on the ground :P I broke my Forza 3 disk from putting it in and out of the case.. since then i have been careful with it and also i have started leaving the game on the xbox upside down when im not playing
 it (rarely)... Here's a pic of the crack.. &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi800.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fyy290%2fDaza7200%2fIMG00022-20120404-0924.jpg" /></p>

<p>Yep, I've done the same thing to some of my disks over time, pulling them out of the case over and over. &nbsp;I've had no luck returning anything as it's always dismissed as wear and tear. &nbsp;End result being the purchase of a well inspected used disk. &nbsp;I've also
 switched to using an old CD case I used to carry my music around in way back in the day. Haven't had a disk break since. &nbsp;You can probably find a used disk for less than $20. &nbsp;Sucks to have to purchase another game, I know, but at least you won't be paying
 full price.</p>

<p>I know this thread is a bit old but what kind of case do you recommend to put it in? &nbsp;Like a paper sleeve, or a cd jewel case, or something like a cd book that holds 100s of discs?</p>

<p>I used a CD case in the past, but now I just take extra care when taking them in and out of case. &nbsp;Only thing I have noticed that is a negative is if you use a CD case, sometimes the disc's get 'marked' from the cloth underside but not sure if this is from
 extreme heat or the compression of so much weight (had it happen with a 250 capacity) or a combo of both. &nbsp;If you keep your games stationary in the same environment I doubt there would be issues, just something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Yeah I'm kind of worried about using a cd book, because I think the friction would scratch the discs. &nbsp;Maybe I'll try the slim jewel cases, or the paper sleeves. &nbsp;With the paper sleeves you can push in a little on the outside of the sleeve which opens the
 sleeve a little better. &nbsp;Then the disc can come out without rubbing too much on the paper.</p>

            <p>Hi Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that somewhere (probably located in one of the folders in your path statement) you have a CMD.EXE that has been renamed to NET.EXE.<br />
<br />
NET.EXE should be located in two places:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32<br />
C:\Windows\System32\DllCache<br />
<br />
If you delete NET.EXE (or replace NET.EXE) in C:\Windows\System32 then it will automatically be replaced by the copy in the DllCache folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably where your rogue NET.EXE is and this is also where you need to remove it/copy the proper NET.EXE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, <span><span>We have a dedicated team to help you with this type of issues. I would suggest you to post the same in TechNet forum.</span></span><span>

<h2>            Kinect v2 Power Supply for PC use</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>does anyone know where I can buy a power supply for the new Kinect sensor. Got one without power supply and want to make some computer vision experiments on the PC. I know that there is a development kit but I only need a power supply and not the full package.
 It is only for private use. I am from Austria, so a seller from Europe would be nice.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>thank you very much for your fast answer but this power supply is for Xbox 360 Kinect devices and not for the Xbox One.</p>
<p>It seems to be that there is no official way to get only the power supply so I will have to contact the MS support team.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to contact the System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM the System Maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. Added the unit is under full warranty and may
 be in need of repairs or replacement. Also keep in mind the more you do the more they will claim it is something your have done.<br />

<br />
<strong>We can analyze the&nbsp;DMP&nbsp;files&nbsp;if you make them available from the OneDrive

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security
<br />
products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />
corrupt or go out of bounds.&nbsp;The video driver or something affecting it would <br />
be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by <br />
manually checking&nbsp;at the System maker and device makers' sites.<br />

====================================================&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most&nbsp;current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and&nbsp;<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>On small home network typical subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and basically it's same as netmask and mostly both names are used to refer same mask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On large networks subnet mask can be used to divide large IP-address space for smaller groups (sub networks), but that's not necessary for private home networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With subnet (or netmask) 255.255.255.0 three first digit of IP-address represent network address and last digit represent devices on that network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DNS address tell PC where it should look corresponding IP-address for given network / computer name and on small home networks that is in most cases same as gateway address. This case DNS query is directed to ISP operator network.</p>

            If there is one (monitors, in most cases don't supply drivers) it will be <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
When you get to that page, click the button named Show Categories. It's to the right of "Don't Know What Your Model Number is? Look for Your Product Below."<br />
Click Monitors and a popup will open. For me nothing happened when I clicked it in Firefox. I had to use Chrome. Didn't test in IE.<br />
I looked around quick and couldn't find it because it has different categories of monitors and I don't know what type yours is so click your category and look for it. If it doesn't appear then don't worry about drivers.<br />
Also, search did not find any results.<br />

<p>Den Originalpost von DMZilla zu dem Thema findet ihr <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/de-ch/xbox_forum_fr_die_schweiz/de-at/xbox_forum_fr_sterreich/xbox_forums/forum_faq/f/6/p/35286/209149.aspx#209149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hier</a>. Anbei eine Übersetzung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Die Möglichkeit Multimedia-Inhalte zu posten ist ein neues Feature des Xbox Forums. Im Folgenden einige Regeln zu dem neuen Feature:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Posts mit Bildern/Videos:</b></p>
<p>- Es darf nicht anstößig oder beleidigend sein. Falls Zweifel bestehen sollte, dann bitte einfach nciht posten. Die Entscheidung eines Moderators ist endgültig.</p>
<p>- Es darf nicht die <a href="http://www.xbox.com/de-DE/legal/xboxComTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nutzungsbedingungen</a> oder den
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/de-DE/legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Verhaltenskodex</a> verletzen.</p>
<p>- Ein Bild per Post. Ausnahme: Anleitungen oder Erklärungen in den Support Foren.</p>
<p>- Breite: maximal 600Pixel</p>
<p>- Bilder/Videos die Nacktheit, Pornographie oder andere extrem anstößige Inhalte wie Rassismus enthalten, können mit einer Strafe geahndet werden, die über die&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox Foren hinaus geht.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bilder in Signaturen:</b><br />
-Die gleichen regeln wie oben.<br />
- Keine animierten .GIFs<br />
- Die Höhe ist auf 125Pixel beschränkt. Wir werden nicht zu streng sein, allerdings ist diese Regel dazu da um es zu vermeiden, dass Threads missbraucht werden um sie mit Bildern zuzuspammen. Moderatoren können Signaturen bearbeiten/entfernen. Wenn diese wieder
 eingefügt werden, kann dies in einem Bann/Sperre enden.<br />
- Es ist nicht gestattet die offiziellen Logos von Xbox, Xbox LIVE oder Microsoft zu verwenden. Diese Logos sind eingetragene Markenzeichen und alle Rechte sind der Microsoft Corporation vorenthalten. Diese Logos in der Signatur könnten dazu führen, dass man
 mit einem offiziellen Mitarbeiter von MS verwechselt wird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wenn ihr ein anstößigen Bild/Video seht, bitte den Melden Button am Ende des jeweiligen Posts benutzen.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear&nbsp;the issue with the party chat feature. In order to provide you with some troubleshooting steps, I have a couple of questions. Are you and your wife on separate consoles? Do both profiles have a&nbsp;Xbox Gold Subscription? Is there a certain
 error message you receive? Have you <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
tested your NAT type</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to start a party, please take a look at our troubleshooting guide for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/xbox-live/how-to-start-a-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Local Disk Space Other People</h2>
                    I have a total of 440 GB of space on my lap top and i am somehow using 308 GB even though my files and programs only take up 13.3 GB. When i locate the majority of the storage being used it says that “Other people” accounts for 194 GB. What is this file?
 How do i delete or minimize it? I do not use that much data on my laptop. I have done several disk clean ups but i only clear up around 20 MB total so where is the source of all these GB being used? I only use my laptop for school, internet, and to save my
 photos from my phone which is a total of 4 GB on my laptop. PLEASE HELP! I don’t know what this “Other people” file is and why it’s taking up 194 GB&nbsp;

</p><p>Okay this is the photo. I would also like to mention that i am compressing the data in my (C:) drive for more storage. So now in my settings it says that i have used 301 GB currently. It will slowly be descreasing.&nbsp;</p>
