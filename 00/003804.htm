    <title>Outlook is sending the first version of my emails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook is sending the first version of my emails</h2>
                    On several occasions over the last few weeks myself and a co-worker of mine have been writing emails where after we click send the email receipt is showing the first version of our message. &nbsp;I hope that makes sense. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This will happen on both emails written from scratch and ones where we may copy and paste words into the message. &nbsp;After completing our thought or copying what we needed, we will go back and proofread and change the message. &nbsp;However, for the past couple
 of weeks on several occasions the receipt will show the first "draft" of the message was sent.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there some weird autosave function is going on here? &nbsp;We are using a normal internet connection, meaning we are not on a server.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I am also experiencing this with several of my organization's users. It is something we have only noticed recently, perhaps a few weeks as well, just like you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have noticed that the first time I save an email as a draft, it is saved correctly. Re-opening the draft email, I am able to make changes to the subject and the body, but when I save and close, only the subject modifications are saved. The subject change
 is visible in the preview pane of the drafts view. Can you confirm if the above is also happening to you?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not noticing this behavior when accessing Exchange (2007) from Outlook Web Access (OWA). Drafts appear to work correctly in that realm.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have removed the profile, and recreated it without cached exchange mode for one user, but it doesn't appear to have resolved the problem.</p>

            I have this same issue with Outlook 2003 (first same you save a draft email it works, but subsequent changes disappear). I only noticed it yesterday and I just updated to IE11 a few days ago. Do I need to go back to IE10? How do I do that, or will Microsoft
 have a fix for this?

 regarding auto-correct changes, and let this and that thread know if you're getting that problem as well. We'd like to be able to relate these two bugs for other users, if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can uninstall (rollback) the IE11 update by going to Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Installed Updates. From there, you should be able to select and uninstall "Windows Internet Explorer 11," and this will roll your software back to
 IE10. This should resolve&nbsp;the problem.</p>

            I had same problems for last few weeks&nbsp; - emails not saving after first draft, sending unknowingly with sometimes hilarious or embarassing results. IE11 auto-updated in early Dec and i uninstalled it today and that seems to have solved the problem - thanks!

            this is because of IE11 breaking some functionality in outlook 2003.<br />
the easiest workaround is to configure outlook to use word as editor.<br />

still, microsoft should fix this issue!

            <p>I use Outlook 2003.&nbsp; Recently I also noticed a problem with truncated emails and emails that were sent without the spellcheck corrections..&nbsp; Editing the email and attempting to save it in the Drafts folder also did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browsing for an answer I discovered other users had a similar problem that was related to IE11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had recently upgraded to IE11&nbsp;from IE9, so I uninstalled IE11 and upgraded only to IE10.&nbsp; The uninstall of IE11 did the trick.&nbsp; No more saving or correction problems.&nbsp; After I installed IE10, I checked to make sure the problem did not recur.&nbsp; All is well.&nbsp;
 I will stick with IE10 for now since I don't use IE except to access the Microsoft web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft wants people to keep IE updated, they should find this problem and fix it.&nbsp; Otherwise all their development and updating will go unused by much of the user community.</p>

    <title>scam verify microsoft account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajd 62  say:</h3>
<h2>            scam verify microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I have now received 6 e-mails in 24 hours from the Microsoft account team thanking me for verifying my account, giving me a pin code and recommending me to go to account.live.com and change the password if I did not request the code. I have seen several
 on-line discussions about this some saying it is a scam. Most end up going to private communication. I think it is a scam. Is it and what is the solution? I have summarised briefly what I did below.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. When I saw the 2 messages first thing in the morning I panicked and I went to the account.live.com link.</div>
<div>2. Having changed the password I got worried as I saw that the hotmail account name was not exactly mine - an underscore added but difficult to see as all text was underlined. So within 2 or 3 minutes of changing my Outlook password I went directly into
 my Outlook account, my gmail account and my skype account and changed all 3 passwords.</div>
<div>3. 2 hours later I got exactly the same type of e-mail from the Microsoft account team but now with my correct outlook address. Seemed to confirm my worst fears - it looked like a hacker had picked up info from me using the link to account.live.com - but
 thankfully I had changed the passwords again directly through my accounts.</div>
<div>4. Later last night I got 3 more e-mails from the Microsoft account team all at the same time. These reverted back to the incorrect hotmail name used at the start.. I am ignoring them for now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I may be somewhat paranoid but none of the above looks like the normal behaviour of a professional Microsoft team or system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have run AVG and Msoft safety scanner - no problems found. I have tried using the Msoft Security Support Centre and the Get Support sites - these can both be accessed but both of them do not work. So now I am trying the forum. Please can someone help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks AJD.</div>

            <p>Sorry I mistakenly marked this as answered.&nbsp; As far as i can tell, the only website I'm having trouble with is redbox.com &nbsp;using internet explorer 9.&nbsp; It works using google chrome.&nbsp; I have not made any hardware changes, and I don't think I've made any software
 changes since the last time I used redbox.com which was last week.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of that I changed was things like popup blocker settings, tracking protection to prevent popups and ads.&nbsp; Maybe theres some other setting I've change but I can't
 remember any.&nbsp; But after I've had problems with redbox.com I've uninstalled internet explorer 9 and reinstalled it.&nbsp; now I can get to redbox.com using the address bar ( previously I couldn't.&nbsp; I had to use Bing bar and then click on redbox.com official site).&nbsp;
 But once I click sign in button, nothing happens (as far as i can tell, logging in is the only problem).&nbsp; On botton of page it says "waiting for response from redbox.&nbsp; I have no problem logging in to other sites.&nbsp; I've also tried running no add-ons, and that
 does not work either.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I also just tried the fixit link that you provided and that didn't work.&nbsp; thanks for help.

<h2>            Windows desktop blinking continuously and not able to create shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>After reboot screen started to blink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reboot - and no icons on desctop at all.</p>
<p>On the taskbar - I see start and search buttons, but they not active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the desktop allows to create new ones - but after "new - shortcut - etc." nothing appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to drug a shortcut from the folders - it's not allowed. Just a "stop" cursor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reboot to safemode - nonstop blinking of something. Looks like notification utility tries to popup message after message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Edel,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I‚Äôd like to confirm some information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Regarding ‚ÄúWe have a meeting room set up which 5 users can add into it‚Äù, do you mean you‚Äôve granted the Full Access permission of the room mailbox to 5 users in your organization?<br />
2.&nbsp;About ‚Äúrecently the users have added in entries into the meeting room calendar however, the other users were not able to see the entries‚Äù, do you mean that one of the 5 users added an entry into the meeting room calendar and other 4 users are not able to
 see the calendar entry?<br />
3.&nbsp;If so, could you please run the PowerShell command: <strong>Get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Calendar</strong> and capture a screenshot of the result for further analysis?<br />
To upload a screenshot, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> &gt;<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.<br />
4.&nbsp;Can the other users see the calendar entries in the Outlook Web App by referring to the following steps?<br />
a)&nbsp;Sign in to OWA, go to calendar page, right click <strong>My calendar</strong> &gt;<strong> Open calendar</strong>.<br />
b)&nbsp;Type in the email address of the room mailbox, click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Mouran</p>

<p>Hi Edel,</p>
<p>Of course you can. The PowerShell command mentioned above is just for the Office 365 cloud users.</p>

    <title>References to &#35; values in a numbered list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            References to &#35; values in a numbered list</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way in a Word document to reference the value of a specific row in a numbered list?&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Version 1</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Following are the steps for the process.</em></p>
<p><em>1.&nbsp; First do this</em></p>
<p><em>2.&nbsp; Next do this (alternate step #.#) ("#.#"=2.1 as shown below)</em></p>
<p><em>3.&nbsp; Last do this</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If at step # (#=2 as shown above), you need to do this other process instead, then do this...</em></p>
<p><em>2.1 first do this alt step</em></p>
<p><em>2.2&nbsp;Next do this alt step</em></p>
<p><em>2.3 Last do this alt step, then&nbsp;return to Step "#" (#=3 as shown above)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Version 2</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Following are the steps for the process.</em></p>
<p><em>1.&nbsp; First do this</em></p>
<p><em>2.&nbsp; Then do this (alternate step #.#) (#.#=2.1 as shown below - this is a newly added alternate step)</em></p>
<p><em>3.&nbsp; Next do this (optional step #.#) (#.#=3.1 as shown below -- was 2.1 in v1)</em></p>
<p><em>4.&nbsp; Last do this</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If at step # (#=2 as shown above), you need to do this other process instead, then do this...</em></p>
<p><em>2.1 first do this alt step </em></p>
<p><em>2.2 Next do this alt step</em></p>
<p><em>2.3 Last do this alt step, then return to Step "#" (#=3 as shown above -- this alt step was not part of v1)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If at step # (#=3 as shown above, was 2 in v1), you need to do this other process instead, then do this...</em></p>
<p><em>3.1 first do this alt step </em></p>
<p><em>3.2 Next do this alt step</em></p>
<p><em>3.3 Last do this alt step, then return to Step "#" (#=4 as shown above --&nbsp;was 3 in v1)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically, I need it to recognize if I insert numbered items in both the primary list and alternate list so that it updates the correct instruction numbers.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; Each of the steps are numbered with help from the Word Number Formatting
 List levels and using styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 200 page document and a&nbsp;ridiculous amount of these types of references to keep udpated, especially when the document is in the draft stages.&nbsp; Need some suggestions for getting me out of this nightmare, please and thank you!</p>

            <p>Insert a unique bookmark in the paragraph you want to refer to. Then, at the point of the reference, replace the # with a cross-reference (References &gt; Cross-reference) to the bookmark, selecting "Paragraph number" in the "Insert reference to" dropdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that bookmark names can't contain spaces or any punctuation other than underscores. Since the paragraph numbers may change, I would not use them in the bookmark names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time a referenced list item's paragraph number changes, select all (Ctrl+A) and update fields (F9) to update the cross-references. (Alternatively, press Ctrl+P to go to the Print page, and then press Esc to go back to the document body. This requires
 having the "Update fields before printing" option turned on.)</p>

            If the numbered paragraphs are autonumbered (as these appear to be), it is not necessary to manually bookmark them, as the paragraph number can be inserted from the
<strong>Cross-reference</strong> dialog as the paragraph number of a "Numbered item."

            Depending on how the numbering scheme works, it may still be preferable to use bookmarks. If there are lots of groups of steps, each of which restarts from 1, the list of "Numbered items" in the Cross-reference dialog can become very hard to use.&nbsp;

<p>You still have a very early beta build of WinXP SP3 installed (which is what that cryptic error message was telling you).<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall <strong>Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3)</strong> via Add/Remove Programs &amp; reboot twice.<br />
<br />
2. Now get your computer fully-patched per the instructions in this archive post of mine:
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/msg/a066ae41add7dd2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/msg/a066ae41add7dd2b</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[You may be able to skip Step #4 and/or you may need to Reset Windows Update per <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>]<br />
<br />
TIP: Do NOT install IE8 via Windows Update! "Hide" it instead, for now.<br />
<br />
After you've gotten the computer fully-patched &amp; you're ready to install IE8, my personal recommendations include:</p>
<p>=&gt; Install IE8 manually, not via Windows Update/Automatic Updates!! =&gt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx</a></p>
<p>Save the installer to your desktop, do not Run it.&nbsp; When you're prepared to install IE8, double-click on the saved file.</p>
<p>=&gt; Uninstall all third-party toolbars (e.g., Google; Yahoo; Windows Live) and third-party Windows Themes before installing IE8.</p>
<p>=&gt; Close all open applications (i.e., anything with a taskbar icon) before installing or uninstalling IE8.</p>
<p>=&gt; I would strongly recommend disabling your anti-virus application and any anti-spyware application's "system protections" (other than Defender's) before installing (or uninstalling) an IE upgrade.&nbsp; If you're running a third-party firewall, I would recommend
 disabling it and then enabling the Windows Firewall before installing (or uninstalling) an IE upgrade.</p>
<p>=&gt; Reboot twice after installing (or uninstalling) IE8, then go to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> | Select CUSTOM and scan | Install any Critical Security Updates offered (i.e., KB976325).&nbsp; If a Root Certificates update is listed in the Optional Software updates category on the left-hand side, install it to take full
 advantage of IE's enhanced security.</p>

            yes and no...I have 35 to 40 passwords stored.&nbsp; The way suggested I loose all of them and have to actually remember all of the passwords I used where.&nbsp; I was hoping to be able to edit the password file.&nbsp; It is only anoying in facebook every time I go in,
 the saved password fills in the old password. I was hoping to edit it to the new password...I may have to simply go back and use the old password or be annoyed.&nbsp; I just can't believe that it would be that difficult to correct this.<br />

                    If you have ever seen the elegant mind mapping app called "Mindly" you can see why it might be beneficial to teams collaborating on projects or getting projects off the ground.&nbsp; A mind mapping tool similar to the aforementioned app would be an amazing
 addition to O365.&nbsp; Thoughts?

            PowerPoint always pastes centre slide OR if you copied from a slide in the same position or&nbsp; a little offset if its the same slide. You cannot change this. The solution is probably to learn to creat layouts with content or picture placeholders and NOT
 copy paste but use the inbuilt icons to add content.

<h2>            Can&#39;t hear my contacts hardly on Skype Calls&#63;</h2>
                    Now, before you jump me and say "There's already plenty of these", allow me to say--I'm on an Acer&nbsp;Google Chromebook. It runs a Google Chrome iOS. So I have to use the Skype-web app, not the downloadable version. So, I don't have a "Tools" option.<br />
<br />
How would I be able to boost the sound up, so that I can hear her?

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Skype for Business in my Macbook Pro successfully. But when I try to create an online meeting in Outlook 2016, I got an error message saying that I have to log in at Skype for Business first. If I log in to Skype for Business first, I'm
 still getting the same error. I have restarted my Mac as well, but still getting the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to install anything else to create the link between Outlook 2016 and Skype for Business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards:</p>

            <p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post. I understand you are creating a Skype for Business meeting in Outlook 2016 for Mac. There are steps to fix Outlook integration with Skype for Business, you can follow the steps on the
<strong>Outlook integration</strong> section of this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Known-issues-Skype-for-Business-on-Mac-494ac5d5-50be-4aa7-8f5a-669c71c98c9a?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            how do i know if windows 10 has installed on my phone&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 820 of which my Fitbit wrist watch keeps having problems with over the last year. The Fitbit guys suggest I need Windows 10 on my phone and kindly sent me details on Windows Insider. I have done my best to follow its instructions,
 however did feel like I was going around in circles. Now I think I have cracked it as my mobile rebooted. But how do I know it has been successful? Have I now got Windows 10 on my phone, I cant tell? Thanks, Cathy

            <p>Windows 10 Mobile cannot be installed on a Lumia 820.<br />
(It was supported for the first Insider Previews, but it's no longer eligible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please notice there is no guarantee the FitBit app will work any better for you on a replacement Windows 10 phone. It seems there are unresolved connectivity, sync and notification issues for some users with some FitBit hardware:<br />

<h2>            Lumina 950 Shutting down &#38; locking up</h2>
                    My Lumina for a week off and on was randomly giving me error message about memory card or sim card. I removed the memory card and backed up the phone. Still had same message even after restarting the phone. Last night I did a reset. Now it's "Your phone
 has been locked for security reasons. Leave it plugged in for at least two hours and restart device." Any ideas???

            OK, so what I would do is press and hold the power button. <strong>Keep it pressed until it vibrates then you can stop pressing.</strong> It should reboot and hopefully will start back up and be as it was before the update.

<h2>            Categories for On My Computer folder doesn&#39;t match Exchange</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some old email archived from Outlook for Mac 2011 that is in "On My Computer" folders. &nbsp;They are organized as 2012 Archive, 2013 Archive, etc... &nbsp;I would like to apply an category on them and export them off of "On My Computer" folder. &nbsp;For some reason,
 the categories on these folders are different then the ones in the Exchange server (which I can edit). &nbsp;Is there anyway to synchronize them? &nbsp;Or a way to edit the ones that are already in "On My Computer" folder? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I can only apply the categories in the "On My Computer" to the emails that are in that folder. &nbsp;I can't apply any of the categories that are in my Exchange server. &nbsp;This prevents me from setting a label to email and exporting them off of "On My
 Computer" folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for my mistake. You can only edit categories in Exchange server. To edit categories,
</span><span>you must have one Exchange account</span><span> selected. It‚Äôs not feasible to edit categories in On My Computer.
 You can only assign the existing categories.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Word - gray text and weird blue borders in equation editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krishnachittur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word - gray text and weird blue borders in equation editor</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've been using Microsoft Office tools (mostly Word and OneNote) for several years now to quickly typeset equations, and they've been great. I use the Alt+= shortcut to insert equations both in "inline" and "display" mode, and enter most special symbols
 via escape sequences (like \lambda or \sqrt). It's been useful until now since it required minimal keystrokes compared to LaTeX and it was a WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I was randomly "upgraded" to Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 on my Windows 10 machine. This has completely destroyed my workflow. I cannot comprehend why anyone would change the equation editor like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To illustrate my point, here is a random excerpt from a document I wrote a few months ago:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/726db2df-c8a2-429d-9e47-69a24f8c3559?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/726db2df-c8a2-429d-9e47-69a24f8c3559?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is the result of me trying to reproduce that same paragraph today, with more or less the same keystrokes:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01fc54c9-9e76-4687-a77a-73c767c6fd05?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01fc54c9-9e76-4687-a77a-73c767c6fd05?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, this is what that new paragraph looks like when printed or in reading mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e830cec-3b2e-41cd-8837-398478cd183b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e830cec-3b2e-41cd-8837-398478cd183b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many things wrong with this.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The blue borders are incredibly distracting and completely unnecessary. They make the text illegible when inline.</li><li>The fact that the text is gray makes readability even worse, and it's a pain to fix over and over. Why would anyone want gray equations?</li><li>Underscores and carats for subscripts and superscripts no longer work for no discernible reason and it's very annoying. Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+plus) also don't work. Messing with "linear" vs "professional" settings ALSO doesn't work. How am I even
 supposed to do these anymore?</li><li>The blue borders are so huge that spacing between lines is messed up in the paragraph.</li><li>The fact that the blue things disappear when printing or entering reading mode means that the editor is no longer WYSIWYG, which is a huge headache for aligning across pages.</li><li>The spacing and aligning is completely messed up inside the equations. For example, spaces must now be manually inserted before and after an equals sign and other operators. WHY?</li></ol>
<p>I can't believe that the equation editor has been messed up this badly. Until someone explains to me how to fix it or manually downgrade to an older Word installation, I'm going to have to switch to LaTeX.</p>

<p>Hi Saeed,</p>
<p>We can‚Äôt export SharePoint Online sites from the server end&nbsp;as on SharePoint on-premises.</p>
<p>A feasible way to export a specific&nbsp;site is saving it as a site templates: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Create-and-use-site-templates-60371B0F-00E0-4C49-A844-34759EBDD989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create and use site templates</a></p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>One of our users asked us to have read only access to a shared mailbox. Is there a way to give the user Read Only permission on a<strong> shared mailbox</strong> and give the user access to this mailbox in outlook?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi ARIPirooz,</p>
<p>Yes, we can use PowerShell to do that.</p>
<p>Are you an administrator of your organization? If not, please involve your administrator to follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;<b><i><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a></i></b><br />
2. Run the following two commands in PowerShell:<br />
<strong>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***:\Marketing -User *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -AccessRights Owner</strong><br />
Note: This example grants the Owner role to Ed on the Marketing folder in Ayla's mailbox.</p>
<p>Please feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Poppy</p>
