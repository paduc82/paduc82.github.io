<p>what i like to do is have a chest near the Brewing Stand and place starting from the top left to right the recipe for each potion that i can make, with the finished potions to the right of the ingredients, then i can just grab and make when needed.</p>
<p>you always start with Nether Wart other needed ingredients are redstone, Ghast Tears, Glowstone Dust, Gunpowder, Glistering Melon, Magma Cream, Blaze Powder, Sugar, Spider Eyes, Fermented Spider Eyes.. with that you can make everything... (note Golden Carrots
 are not yet in the xbox version)</p>

<h2>            Nvidia GTX 960m drivers problems on Windows 10</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have recently bought a new Lenovo Y50-70, with an Intel HD 4600 Graphics&nbsp;chipset and a Nvidia GTX 960m graphics card. I upgraded the hard disk to a new Samsung SSD.&nbsp; I was having this problem after trying to play a game: the screen froze and there was
 a strange sound. After that a blue screen with the error, Video_Tdr_Failure. After that, every time I tried to use the laptop for video or anything video related where my Nvidia Graphics Card was involved, the same blue screen occurred. After a while a different
 blue screen with the error Thread_Exception_Not_Handled.&nbsp; After various attempts, uninstalling and installing the Nvidia drivers in safe mode and scanning for viruses in Bitdefender's Rescue Mode, I noticed that my Laptop had the option to use either Switchable
 Graphics (default option) or UMA graphics (Intel chipset on the processor). Note that the computer is running Windows 10 and this problem didn't occur on the previous version of Windows (w8) when I firs

I suggest you to download and install all the available Windows update and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong><span>I see that you have tried re-installing the drivers. However if you have not tried uninstalling the display driver and installing the latest version of

            So i tried updating windows and installing the nvidia driver in compatibility mode. There were no changes as the driver was the one i had already installed and there was no available windows 10 update. So i couldn't see any other choice but reseting the
 pc. I tried keeping my files but the installstion stuck due to the video card problem so nothing happened. Then i tried erasing everything thinking that this would erase tne drivers and with them the problems. However, an error occurred, another blue screen
 due to the graphics card. The computer wouldn't boot up at all and the installation kept failing and there was notning that could fix it. So i tried the one and only solution. I formated the pc and reinstalled W10. There were some improvements there as the
 computer now boots up with switchable graphics and there is no blue screen errors. However, after a minute or two of starting up, there comes a message that the video deiver failed and was recovered. After a few seconds the screen freezes a

            <p>hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had similar problems with my new DELL XPS 15 (9550). &nbsp;I had to disable the dedicated&nbsp;<strong>NVIDIA GTX 960M</strong>, because my screen always went black after 5 minutes. i installed all the new drivers (yes, also from the NVIDIA site), including the
 integrated&nbsp;<strong>Intel HD Graphics 530.</strong> My screen produces fine black lines in the lower half, which disappear after a second. This indicates the looming black screen. It takes about 2-3 minutes and then the entire screen goes black. I somehow have
 the feeling that everything stops. The music stops as well. But you can clearly hear the laptop churning. My only viable option is to force my laptop to shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already made a clean install. I updated all the drivers, including the BIOS firmware update. I'm running on Windows 10 Pro 1511. Any suggestions or ideas?</p>

            <p>Hey Mike, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no side effect other than not using the notebook to its full potential! I actually have contacted my retailer and handed the laptop in for repair. It seemed that it was a software issue, but then they formated the laptop, as I did, and they are
 sending it back to lenovo for repair. (Assuming hardware issue) Hope they fix the problem or replace the laptop for me.&nbsp;</p>

            I have a Dell Inspiron 7559 with Geforce GTX 960m as well and I am having the same issue with display going black for no reason forcing me to reboot system. I have&nbsp;tried drivers and nothing seems to be working. Whenever I run mem tests on the gpu they
 either won't run or give me back errors. I assume I have a bad gpu card (memory crash - hardware) so I've requested a replacement from retailer. Hope I get this fixed. I guess this is a mather of luck.

<p>Have you tried disabling whatever mouse is native to the notebook, either a touchpad or the little "eraser" type control in the middle of the keyboard?</p>

    <title>Why is windows detecting my wireless printer but not the scanner when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t aniles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is windows detecting my wireless printer but not the scanner when using my Epson XP 300</h2>
                    At one time my multi-function Epson XP 300 worked fine with Windows Fax and Scan (WFS). Now, when I try to use WFS I get a message that no scanner has been detected. I can print just fine, I can scan using the device, I can scan using Epson Scan, but not
 using WFS which I prefer. Any ideas? I have uninstalled and re-installed the device, downloaded the newest Epson drivers and utilities, and still having issues. Thanks. T. A.

            Hi!<br />
<br />
You can install a scanner manually by completing the following steps:
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In Windows Explorer, access <code>C:\Program Files\Windows Photo Viewer</code>, where C: is your system drive, and then double-click
<code>ImagingDevices.exe</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Scanners and Cameras window, click Add Device. This starts the Scanner and Camera Installation Wizard.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click Next.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You must now specify the device manufacturer and model. This allows Windows 7 to assign a driver to the device. If the device manufacturer and model you are using are displayed, choose a manufacturer and a model, and then skip steps 5‚Äì7.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the device manufacturer and model you‚Äôre using aren‚Äôt displayed in the list, download the driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and then extract the driver files.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click Have Disk. In the Install from Disk dialog box, click Browse.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Locate File dialog box, locate the <code>.inf</code> driver file for the device and then click Open.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click Next. On the ‚ÄúWhat is the name of your device?‚Äù page, type a name for the scanner or accept the default name. You‚Äôll see this name in the Scanners and Cameras window.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click Next and then click Finish.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Scanners and Cameras window will have an additional icon with the name set the way you specified. You can change the scanner properties and check scanner status at any time.</p>
</li></ol>

 help go to waste :). T. A.

I suspected as much, since I had no problem using WFS before, but right now it seems more hassle than it's worth since I can use the Epson scan program. Hate to let them dominate me, but...:) T. A.

            Hi H√©ctor, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Did you perform a reset of the PC, or a clean installation? If it's a reset, there might still be log in information saved on the PC, which is why it requires credentials.
<br />
<br />You could try a clean installation which would then ask you to create new login credentials, allowing you to log in.
<br />
<br />Here's a detailed article explaining the steps to perform a clean installation:
<br />

            Hi, H√©ctor
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.

<br />Try entering Safe Mode with network function
<br />
<br />To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

    <title>Communication Ban Means I cant play online&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Communication Ban Means I cant play online&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was wondering who to contact or if anything can be done regarding my suspension. My issue is that I've not played xbox in a solid 2 months, I just came back to play fifa pro clubs today, however, because my console was banned from communications I can't access Pro Clubs. My multiplayer suspension is already over, has been for months, I can play Call Of Duty fifa, however fifa (clubs in particular) wont let me play. As I personally wasn't banned I really don't see why this is the case, it suggests my account doesn't have the correct privelages and if i want to enable them, which I do but when i click accept, it pops up saying that because of my past behaviour I cannot play, this to me is an issue and i would like it if someone would point me in the right direction to which I can find an an answer. cheers.</p>

            Yes that is correct, you are not able to access Pro Clubs with an active communication ban. The same goes for similar features in games like NBA2K

    <title>2.5mm Jack to 3.5 Split - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            2.5mm Jack to 3.5 Split</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, im scouring the internet for an adapter, which , will allow me to take audio out of my xbox controller and to my headset as usual and to my computer, i.e a 2.5mm to 2.5mm and 3.5mm.<br />
-<br />
I understand they may not be around so , I have devised this situation:<br />
-<br />
One of these - <a href="http://www.kenable.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=5433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a> (OPENS IN NEW TAB)<br />
-<br />
I then plug that into my controller.<br />
-<br />
Then, I plug my normal headset into one of the spare sockets.<br />
-<br />
Then get a 2.5mm to 3.5mm Line In Cable.<br />
-<br />
My question is to those who know of audio , will that work, will either output distrub the other? Will they work side by side together nicely , and do 2.5mm jacks have the same 2 headphone out and a mic line thing around the jack? or is it just mono and microphone
 on all?<br />
-<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>The controller has a 2.5mm female stereo jack, you need an adapter(s) that will switch that into 2 mono plugs. One of them will be the mono mic input and the other will be the mono chat audio output. I don't use the chat audio output on the controller because
 I figure it's got to save the controller battery not to use it, less cables, and you can get better voice audio output sent to the speakers in the xbox preferences.</p>
<p>Most guides online show you how to buy some Radio Shack parts and cut them up and solder them back together. If you are like me and have boxes of misc. cables and adapters you can hack something together with no soldering. I was lucky and had these parts
 already, &nbsp;a male 2.5mm stereo to 2 female RCA mono adapter plugs into a 2 male rca to male 3.5mm stereo adapter that plugs into a male 3.5mm stereo to 2 female 3.5mm stereo splitter that I just used the 2 female plugs as a coupler that the PC mic plugs into.
 Of course there are many different types of different adapters you can link together to accomplish the same thiing. Good luck.</p>

<p>Sorry just read your post again, I was thinking you were using a stereo headset. Sounds like you are using the single headphone standard headset. To do it like you describe, you need the 2.5mm male stereo to 2x 2.5mm female stereo splitter, plug the headset
 into one and then split the other female stereo into the mono channels like I described above and run the output one to the computer and leave the input one unused. If you don't split it out to the two mono plugs I think the input and output will be shorted
 out and the mic will no longer work.</p>
<p>It might be easier and sound better if you instead have audio out on you tv &nbsp;(or tap into whatever type of soundsystem you are using) that can be hooked up to your computer and change the xbox preferences to play the voice chat through both the headset and
 speakers.</p>

<p>Hi, this is on a sort of related topic. I want to find an adapter that will allow me to use my Xbox wired headset on my PC. So do you guys think this would work</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beepbee.com/35-mm-female-to-dual-male-audio-cable-for-pc-p-39001.html#.UTh_GhzwlJg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.beepbee.com/35-mm-female-to-dual-male-audio-cable-for-pc-p-39001.html</a></p>
<p>I was trying to make out whether it's the right way round </p>

<p>I assume you are talking about the standard xbox headset. You still would need an adapter to step up the male 2.5mm plug on the headset to the 3.5mm female plug of that adapter. Might be able to find a cheaper dedicated PC headset. I have the same adapters
 and if I get a chance will try this weekend to confirm it works.</p>

<h2>            My Boot Drive is not showing full capacity</h2>
                    <p>I just bought an HP Pavilion All-In-One yesterday. It came with a 1 TB hard drive. When I check This PC, the C drive shows only 76.4 GB available. The Restore partition is only 17.3 GB. I checked the Storage Usage, which says I'm using 909 Gb of 914. The
 usage displays don't add up to that, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fa08a2f-f77c-4826-90b3-c7b7d0c5eb8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fa08a2f-f77c-4826-90b3-c7b7d0c5eb8d" /></a></p>
<p>I then checked Disk Management, which also doesn't add up. It shows a partition of 912.91 GB, but the&nbsp;capacity only shows 76.45 GB.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35abab40-528e-403c-aa98-4f15395652ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35abab40-528e-403c-aa98-4f15395652ca" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, I ran a dskchk and it doesn't make sense, either. It shows 80.16 GB total disk space.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fdea59f-5d31-416c-a4e6-3018da892167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fdea59f-5d31-416c-a4e6-3018da892167" /></a></p>
<p>So, I'm not a computer expert. I don't know what the resolution is from here. I did all of these checks form doing searches. Can anyone help me out? My HD shows almost full, but I shouldn't even be close.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Power Options in Control Panel are blank - can&#39;t do anything.</h2>
                    Recently I noticed that Power Options in Control Panel is blank. &nbsp;I can't create anything or do anything there. &nbsp;Could something in Services.msc have disabled this? &nbsp;Anywhere else I should look? &nbsp;I can't Shut Down, Restart or put it in Standby. &nbsp;Also when
 I start the computer (after using the hardware Reset button on the computer case) it doesn't remember my User Name. &nbsp;It asks me every time. &nbsp;There is no password. &nbsp;I just hit Enter after entering my User Name.

<h2>            How to Get Sleep or Hibernate options in SAFE MODE&#63; &#91;Windows 7&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I searched and searched, couldn't find anything, but my thick head still thinks there may be an answer somewhere out there.<br />
<br />
It says I could not get Audio on SAFE MODE, got that working fine after following a tutorial.I figure the same can be done with SLEEP or HIBERNATE, I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Now I still want to know how to get either SLEEP or HIBERNATE in SAFE MODE,<br />
I don't care if my attempts ruin anything on this crappy Compaq HP pathetic excuse for a laptop. I don't want any other help other then getting 1 or both the options. This Laptop doesn't have a built in fan (got 3 other fans making do), hence why I run SAFE
 MODE or it would melt quicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Window 7 Home Prem, 64-bit.<br />
<br />
TLDR; &nbsp;Anyway to get Sleep or Hibernate in SAFE MODE?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about your query.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Error Code 43 is a Device Manager error that means the following:</span></p>
<p><span>Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;When you get this error with USB devices it‚Äôs because one of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating
 system that the device failed in some manner. This can be because of corruption in one of the loaded drivers and the driver cache just needs to be flushed. Unplugging the computer sometimes doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem because the battery still holds power.
 To fix this, unplug all of your USB devices, then turn off the PC and take out the battery (This is assuming that you‚Äôre on a laptop), let the PC set for about 5 minutes, then put the battery back in and restart the PC. Next, plug your USB devices back in
 one at a time and make sure that they work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If this does not work or you‚Äôre on a desktop, follow the steps in this KB article</span></p>

                    &nbsp;why do Offline Files still show up in Disk Cleanup when they aren't supported in Windows 7 Home Premium? Can I disable collection of offline files through the registry somehow since the operating system is saving them for no purpose but clutter since
 they can't be used?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><br />
You may follow these steps to disable the offline files.<br />
</span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Control Panel (All Items view), and click on the Sync Center icon.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click on the Manage offline files link.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the Disable offline files button.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If prompted by UAC (User Account Control), then click on Yes.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on OK.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Yes to restart the computer.<br />
</span><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> This will restart the computer immediately. Be sure to save anything that you have open first.<br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enabled Offline Files, then all you need to do now is to make the network files or network folders you want always available offline.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Note: Use of Offline files are available only with <br />
Windows 7 Professional&nbsp;<br />
Windows 7 Ultimate <br />
Windows 7 Enterprise <br />

            The "Manage offline files" link through Sync Center&nbsp;in Windows 7 Home Premium does not work. Therefore I am unable to disable offline files, thats kinda why I was asking if there is something in the registry I can change to disable offline files from being
 saved and showing up in disk cleanup?<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to reply though I appreciate it!
