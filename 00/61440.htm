<p><span>Had a Dell Optiplex 745 computer running Microsoft XP that failed. Purchased a rebuilt Dell Optiples 745 computer running Windows 7 premium. Connected equipment to new computer
 remained unchanged from original computer. Sound worked O.K. on old XP computer but does not work on new Windows 7 computer. Can anyone advise how to get sound from new computer?</span></p>

<p>The Dell 745 is technically not supported under Windows 7 so there are no drivers listed for it. However I have found the Windows 7 combo cabs available here<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-driver-cab-files-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(155, 79, 150, 1)">http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-driver-cab-files-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;about
 half way down the page has resolved a lack of Windows 7 drivers for both older Dell and for that matter non Dell hardware on occasions. Scroll down to about half way down the page. Although the specific OptiPlex model is not listed pointing the driver update
 wizard to the cab file seems to work.</p>

<p>Thanks HairyFool for your reply. I can open the link you reference and page down to the Optiplex section. However, I'm at a loss to find the<u>

            I was unable to use this method to load a windows 7 sound driver to my Dell optiples 745 computer However, I did find a solution to my dilemna from another site. Go to the following Dell driver link
<div>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/Product/optiplex-745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/04/Product/optiplex-745</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Then follow through and select the Vista audio driver (use 32 or 64 bit depending on your system). Mine is 32 bit. You will only find one audio driver listed. Open it and download it using run upon download. &nbsp;Override any alert that this driver is not
 proper for your computer. Once this driver has been activated (run) you should have sound on your Dell Optples 745 computer.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one thing to note, this was not a password issue. &nbsp;Let me make this clear: IT IS NOT A USER PASSWORD ENTRY ISSUE. &nbsp;Let me just repeat that: NOT A FU**ING USER PASSWORD ENTRY ISSUE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we clear? &nbsp;Just in case: I know what my fu**ing password is, and I entered it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is more to do with the fact that Microsoft is a mediocre product at best. &nbsp;To keep ploughing ahead they release things prematurely. &nbsp;They work on the theory that they are only going to screw a few people and Apple products are expensive.
 &nbsp;So FU*K Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I solved the problem by taking the drive out of my computer, putting it into a BlacX external drive thing and copying my personal files/documents to my old computer. &nbsp;Then I put it back into the computer, and booted from a USB drive with onto which
 I had put the installation files for Windows 10. &nbsp;I had to format the drive first, and then it loaded Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the full version of Windows 10 works better than the upgrade from 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest in the problem.</p>

    <title>how do i totally remove windows xp pro network login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sherylcoleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i totally remove windows xp pro network login screen</h2>
                    <p>I bought a used computer several months ago. It's a HP Compaq that was apparently set up for online schooling with K12.org. It came with no discs, and I have been having an awful time trying to get the login screen for that network off the computer without
 having to use it. I managed to find and disable the Client For Microsoft Networks as per prior research, but the screen would still pop up. I used the forums to get the info I would need to get the thing to only require us to hit an "OK" button so we wouldn't
 have to enter a password every time. Now the screen, which used to pop up, won't show up or only shows intermittently at startup and Windows shows the "Windows is starting up" screen and just hangs and hangs without taking me to the "Welcome" screen.</p>
<p>This particular problem only started last night. I'd really love to get that thing off to be able to use it hassle-free.</p>
<p>Any assistance you can offer is greatly appreciated.</p>

            The hanging at startup problem is definitely indicative of a larger problem.<br />
<br />
Under your circumstances, I would highly recommend that you completely reinstall Windows on your machine.&nbsp; Most HP/Compaq machines have a recovery partition that will reinstall Windows back to the "as-purchased" condition.&nbsp; To access this, when you boot and
 the first HP or Compaq splash screen pops up, you should see at the bottom of the screen a key to press that will put you into the Recovery mode.&nbsp; Press this key quickly as you won't have much time.&nbsp; Follow the prompts to completely clean your hard drive and
 re-install Windows.&nbsp; (Make sure you back up any needed files first).&nbsp; If you can't locate this key, then connect to the HP website and download the manual for your specific computer model.<br />
<br />
If you can't reinstall Windows, then try a System Restore to a point in time before you had your startup-hanging problem.<br />

 had nothing to do with their software although the download process failed a number of times&nbsp;on-line&nbsp;and I had the update sent to me on disc, which then worked. &nbsp; I have not attempted any further software updates. &nbsp; Any help.

            What happens if you put the update CD in? Since you want the program try this first. If that doesn't work, check in Startup (see below) and if there is nothing there, then you can use the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility. Or uninstall/reinstall the GPS
 program and its update. Maybe the update didn't take well.<br />
<br />
<span>To manage Startup - Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]
</span><span>and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.</span>

            I resolved this issue by searching for msi installer in the registry using regedit I found a reference to gpsindic8tor.msi&nbsp;sitting in the startup folder. My PC has three account users and the problem was in the account of a secondary user account and not
 my own from where the main gpsindic8tor was installed and working properley.&nbsp;As I did not take notes as I was doing it I cannot repeat the process on the page here. As usual going into the Registry comes with an extreme caution. Hope this helps to move things
 forward for you.

 suggestions on how to fix this? Thanks.

<p>Hallo!</p>
<p>Leider besitze ich keinen PayPal Account und kann die da keine pers칬nlichen Erfahrungen schildern. Daf칲r habe ich aber nen Link f칲r dich.
</p>
<p>Der Link verweist auf einen Thread innerhalb des Forums in dem es ebenfalls um die Bezahlung per PayPal geht.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/de-de/das_deutschsprachige_xbox_live_forum/f/37/t/10375.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../10375.aspx</a></p>
<p>Nach allem was ich dort und in anderen Seiten gelesen habe soll es aber momentan eh noch ziemliche Probleme mit der neuen Bezahlungsmethode geben. &nbsp;Am besten also warten bis es mehr Informationen gibt was man nun wirklich alles per PayPal bezahlen kann und
 wann es auch ohne Probleme funktioniert.</p>

<p>I don't think so. At least as far as official bundles and stuff go right now. There may already be custom controller and console skins and stuff you can buy to put on your console or controller though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gearbox might be selling stickers too probably.&nbsp;</p>

            I haven't seen anything. There may be some sort of like sweepstakes for a custom console or something closer to its release. That's just stuff you gotta keep your eyes open for.&nbsp;

            I have not heard of any Borderlands 3 and Xbox bundle yet. We do have until September until the game releases so you never know! I would like to see this. I think it would definitely make for some cool skins and designs!

            Im sure there may have been some ideas thrown to Microsoft to create a custom XBOX 1 for Borderlands 3 but I don't think that will be likely. Your best bet is to have someone make a custom one for you or make one yourself if you are brave enough but like
 others have stated, most game inspired consoles are given away through sweepstakes or made a couple times a year with very highly anticipated games that are exclusive to the console.

<p>Men en del av mangelen er f칮lgende:Lage eget emblem og Double Xp weekend.Dette var sammenlignet med black ops.Sorry om jeg laget uro.Noen av dere tar sikkert dette som en un칮dvendig tr친d.Ha en god kveld da.Skrevet:01:58 i 2011 osv osv.See ya :)</p>

<p>MW2 har jo f친tt best tilbakemeldinger p친 multiplayer oppsettet sitt enn ka black ops har f친tt. Tror MW2 overlever uten 친 kunne mekke eget emblem, dessuten er det s친 lett 친 levle opp i MW2 at du har ikkje behov for dobbel xp i helgene.

<p>Vell, n친 er jo Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 et spill fra 2009, mens Black Ops er fra 2010 (og er det sist lanserte CoD spillet). Ergo er det naturlig at du ikke finner enkelte funksjoner i MW2 som befinner seg i "oppf칮lgeren" (Black Ops). Husk ogs친 at
 Activision pr칮ver 친 ha fokus p친 det aktuelle spillet, og derfor finner du begivenheter som Double XP p친 BO isteden for MW2. Dette fokuset vil senere i 친r bli flyttet til Moder Warfare 3.</p>

<h2>            Now that Minecraft is 10 years old, what is your favorite Minecraft memory&#63;</h2>
                    I've been playing since 2010 (started on PC and got it again on Xbox in 2015) and my favorite memory is when someone put it on the school computers and during classes in the computer labs we would have LAN parties. Someone also downloaded some hunger games
 maps and the winner of the match got to be the game master of the next game. It was a ton of fun and it became a pretty popular thing at the school that spanned across all social groups and helped a lot of people become friends.

            I don't have a Minecraft memory. I don't play the game, I have neither the patience or imagination to play that game. Although I am in awe of some of the creations that other gamers come up with. The hours they must spend creating them is amazing.

            I actually never got into Minecraft, but my favorite memories of the game are seeing my nephew so absorbed into it. Right now, he enjoys Mario, Fortnite, and Minecraft. If you got him anything of those, he'd be happy; he even has a Minecraft zombie sweater.

<p>I played with some friends one time, and at the time I had been goofing off learning how redstone works. So i build a giant mansion with a bunch of hidden doors. The trick to the doors was unless you placed a switch or button in exactly the right spot they
 wouldnt open. They were always hidden with something out of place. A different color block, an odd flower where you wouldnt expect, a dog sittimg somewhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I hid a bunch of goodies everywhere and set them loose. The only rule was no destroying any walls to find things and anyone who found me in my hidden basement would get any item they wanted. Of course the winner asked for a bucket. Nobody knew what for,
 until he started dropping lava on peoples houses. It was a good time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My most fond Minecraft memory was when a friend and I were adventuring and charting maps just to see what we could see. We found ourselves in a savannah biome at night and all of a sudden the stars disappeared and there was nothing to be heard but our own
 footsteps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an eerie experience for a game that you expect to mostly just be cheery. We ended up making our own story about the experience and it became a kind of Bermuda Triangle in our Minecraft world. We erected a monument to our adventure and have passed
 the tales down from player to player and it gives most people a good spook when told around a campfire at night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's always funny to look back at the first time we realized that savannahs act the same as a desert during the rain.</p>

<p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specified blue screen error code means that your computer has shutdown suddenly to protect itself from data loss. This can be attributed to issues with the drivers installed on your device and/or hardware failure. In terms of hardware failure, this can
 be associated with hard drive issues, random-access memory (RAM) not responding, and/or motherboard (mobo) related issues. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The last changes made/activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>If you've added/removed/changed hardware components of your device prior to the issue.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Updating Windows usually resolves this type of error when the cause is software related. If you're using Windows 10 version 1709, the latest build is 16299.214 and includes improvements and fixes for known issues from previous iterations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that you already have the latest build of 1709 and/or using version 1703 (build 15063.877) or 1607 (build 143.93.2034), we'd recommend performing a system restore to further isolate your concern. Performing this will
 revert your device to an earlier point in time. This usually removes <span>
apps, drivers, and updates installed on your device after the stated date of the restore point. To do this, you can perform the steps posted in the Restore from a system restore point section of this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to complete any of the processes stated above due to the blue screen error, we'd recommend running Windows 10 in safe mode to allow you to complete the steps.
<span>To do this, you perform the steps posted on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: There are two options available to enable safe mode on your device. You can choose which best suites the situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows failed to start&#34; error. My &#47;sfc results</h2>
                    For the past month, whenever I first bootup my Acer laptop in the morning, I receive the error "Windws failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause."<br />
<br />
I posted before and someone suggested that I run System File Checker. I did that. The results are below.<br />
<br />
I've only had the laptop for about two months. It was working perfectly, then one day, I started to receive this error.
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of that changed was perhaps an automatic update of a program that may have caused a file in Windows to become corrupt. Besides that, I don't know what else could have happened.<br />
<br />
Someone below suggested that I run the System File Checker. The results showed the following:<br />

The last line in the results says that all files were repaired. Though it indicated that the files were successfully repaired, I'm still having the same problem at bootup.<br />
<br />
What else, if anything, can I do at this point? It's getting frustrating to have to turn the computer off and then back on every morning when I boot up my system.<br />

Thank you for your help and suggestions.<br />

I have Acer Aspire 7741Z.<br />
<br />
Those&nbsp;" Factory Default Backup " discs are&nbsp;your <strong>recovery</strong> discs. They are used to&nbsp;restore your computer to factory settings.... the way it was out of the box. You will lose all your personal files and programs you have installed&nbsp;if you run the

Repair disk is just one disk. I had to create one after I bought the computer. It is used to repair your system, &nbsp;but still keep all your personal files and programs.

            Hi lindawilson1940 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Regarding the question - <em>'how to delete remnants'...</em></p>
<p>You should be able to get rid of the remnants of old OS's if you do a <em>full</em> format of the HDD at the beginning of the Win10 install process.</p>
<p>If you are not using the HDD as a Windows drive at the moment you can also do a reformat via Windows
<em>Disk Management</em>. </p>
<p>Note that doing a full reformat can take a very long time on a large capacity HDD. Not so long on an SSD.</p>
<p>I generally go with a quick format, which does the job well enough.<br />

            Hi Linda
<br />
<br />Honestly your best option is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 to give you a clean and resposive system . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything&nbsp;!
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Click this link:&nbsp;
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes:&nbsp;
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot&nbsp;
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot&nbsp;
<br />3. If Available enable CSM&nbsp;
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot&nbsp;
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order&nbsp;
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            <p>You don't load the key into the BIOS for Windows 7, this technology was only introduced with Windows 8 and can only be implemented by the system builder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a standard retail Windows 7 upgrade disk during installation it would have asked you to enter the key during setup. If you opted to skip this during setup the system should ask you to authenticate within&nbsp; a few days of completing setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to bring up the authentication dialogue manually before then right click on Computer and select Properties, the link to auhentication is at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OEM Windows 7 disks from large system manufacturers have&nbsp;a key integrated on the DVD not in the BIOS although they run a check to make sure the disk is being used on the right system so a Dell disk should not work on HP and so on.</p>

<br />
You need to manually enter the product key for retail licenses such as WIndows 7 Home Premium which is what you have. If its an OEM System Builder Home Premium disc, you need to enter it manually also.

<p>I'm assuming you are attempting to log into the "built in" Administrator account. If so, you will have to contact the place where the computer came from, perhaps they have set some kind of password at installation time, something like "Admin" of "administrator"
 or something obvious.<br />
<br />
Some dealers may do this, many do not.<br />
<br />
Without the built in administrator password there's not much you can do.<br />
<br />
The built-in Administrator account is hidden from Welcome Screen when a user account with Administrator privileges exists and enabled. Perhaps the password you're resetting is from the user account.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            windows 8&#58; internet disconnects while in fullscreen</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some reason whenever I play a video game, or do anything that involves me doing full screen my internet disconnects after about 10 minutes. Whenever it happens if I just go right back to desktop it immediately fixes itself, but then does it again 10
 minutes later. I'm sick and tired of it happening to me while online. I have done all the necessary updates for my computer, but it hasn't helped.</div>
<div>Computer info:</div>
<div>AMD six-core FX-6120 processor</div>
<div>10 gb RAM</div>
<div>AMD Radeon HD 7450 graphics card</div>
<div>windows 8</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Someone please help. I don't know what else to do.</div>
                </div>

<p><font color="#000000"><font><br />
</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The connection troubleshooter doesn't help because it thinks that the internet is still connected even when it's down during a game.</font></p>

                    I am currently using my home computer to ask this question, but my laptop, with all of my work files on it, is locked to me.&nbsp; I cannot, for the life of me, remember my password for the account, and I never set a reset disk (how wonderfully brilliant of
 me).&nbsp; Anyway, I was just wondering if there is ANY WAY I can get back into my account.&nbsp; Obviously, since this is work related, I need an answer ASAP, and any help you guys can offer is very much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            wedge mouse problem with rigth click, scroll, bluetooth connection</h2>
                    <p>Hey</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have Microsoft Wegde Mouse. I use Windows 8 Pro x64</p>
<p>I have driver 2.0.162 already installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that vertical scroll doesn't work as fast as it should be in every program (in some is really slowly), and in some is to fast.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it starts to scroll when I touch it few times. (in Start menu, horizontal scrolling works well).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that when I want to scroll up, it doesn't recognize that and still start to scroll down...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that when I want to make a context menu it behave as left click! which is really annoying.</p>
<p>settings, for right click is set as default (to right click). Sometimes it Works, sometimes not...
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I notice problems when I have connected my Mouse, and I want to use also BT A2DP connection to my Sony Audio, Audio stream is losing it for a while, and start to work fine when Wedge Mouse is switched off. I used Intel Drivers for Centrino N-6235 and
 Generic Microsoft Drivers (with MS drivers, remote control via BT started to work).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any driver update? Please!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Andrzej,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to know that you have chosen Windows 8 for your computer and thank you for providing us an opportunity to assist you on this issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, it seems that the Microsoft Wedge Mouse does not scroll properly with all the applications and also the right click function does not
 work as it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you have already installed the driver version: 2.0.162 which is the latest one for the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it seems to be a conflicting issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any conflicting mouse software installed in the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I noticed when installing that there was a wanring that Bluetooth connections can interfere with one another and with other Wi-Fi functions. So far I've had no ill-effects but further down the line who knows...<br />

<p>Hey</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have Microsoft Wegde Mouse. I use Windows 8 Pro x64</p>
<p>I have driver 2.0.162 already installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that vertical scroll doesn't work as fast as it should be in every program (in some is really slowly), and in some is to fast.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it starts to scroll when I touch it few times. (in Start menu, horizontal scrolling works well).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that when I want to scroll up, it doesn't recognize that and still start to scroll down...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that when I want to make a context menu it behave as left click! which is really annoying.</p>
<p>settings, for right click is set as default (to right click). Sometimes it Works, sometimes not...
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I notice problems when I have connected my Mouse, and I want to use also BT A2DP connection to my Sony Audio, Audio stream is losing it for a while, and start to work fine when Wedge Mouse is switched off. I used Intel Drivers for Centrino N-6235 and
 Generic Microsoft Drivers (with MS drivers, remote control via BT started to work).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any driver update? Please!</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm having similar issues with my Sony duo 11 (also has an intel centrino advanced 6235) with win 8 pro 64. In my case I have a bluetooth mouse and I notice that when the mouse is on the bluetooth audio (I have a bluetooth receiver Xantech 725) cuts on/off(choppy)
 every few seconds.</p>
<p>When I turn the bluetooth mouse, everything works fine. I have the latest drivers from the Sony site. So there seems to be a bluetooth bug in either windows 8 or the Intel Centrino driver.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can MS invetigate this in their labs and fix it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nick.</p>

            You are right, that Bluetooth can interference with WIFI (they both work on same frequences), but I think that is not the problem. Wireless card have option in it's driver for support compatibility with BT that should not cause any problem.<br />
<br />
Before I posted this problem here I had some conversation at Intel's hardware forum, and I did what some users recommened. I uninstalled Intel's software for Bluetooth (that supports BT version 4.0 and can cause problem, and problem with WIFI..).<br />
<br />
So now I have generic Microsoft drivers for BT stack.<br />

            <p>I am having the same issue on Windows 8 Pro x64. My mouse arrived today and I have installed the Mouse &amp; Keyboard center. Also have an Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6250 providing Bluetooth 3.0+EDR using the latest supplied driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click will either do a right click, do "Go back" or do a left click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizontal scroll works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vertical scroll does not work consistently. Often it will either scroll at one line per second or not respond at all. Turning off Vertical Flick does not improve or resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My previous mouse (Logitech M555b) does not have this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have any previous mouse / input device software installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so far quite disappointed in this product having these issues. It's quite evident that so far it's not fully compatible with Windows 8, despite being designed for it.</p>

            I am having the exact same issues as others, and please don't give me any **** about a clean boot.  Right click behaves as a left click.  You have to click at least 4 or 5 times before it registers as a right-click.  Playing a game with this mouse will simply drive you insane.  The scroll is pathetic.  I think that this is a firmware issue and I'm feeling ripped off for this expensive, mouse that does not work.

            I'm having&nbsp;similar symptoms with my Wedge Mouse on Surface RT.&nbsp; The right and left mouse click detection is sporadic enough to make using the mouse very annoying.&nbsp; I've tried adjusting my finger position to tap as close to the right and left edge as possible,
 but it's still hit or miss.&nbsp; This is very frustrating as I really like the device.&nbsp; I'm hoping there is something that can be done on the firmware/software side to fix these issues.

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I found this page searching for "wedge mouse right click" as I was having the same right click problems. I've since found that if I click near the right edge of the mouse it registers a left click, but if I click in the middle of the right side it seems
 to always register a right click. Not ideal, but I'm hoping I'll get used to that for right clicking! Hope it helps</div>

            I was thinking which one bt mouse to choose. I always had very good experience with Logitech equipment such as mouses and keyboards... and I think this problems is hanging here for so long, and problems with mouse still exists... that I got conclusion
 the best way is to return this mouse to Microsoft, get refund and buy new one Logitech....<br />
