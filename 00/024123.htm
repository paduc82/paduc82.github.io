<h2>            Email - Changing Primary Alias - What happens to former primary alias&#63;</h2>
                    Several months ago, I wanted to make a new primary alias (log-in address) for my Hotmail account (now Outlook), and then delete the former primary alias. But that option was not available. Yesterday, I looked at the section about "create alias," and it
 seems possible now. Is it true, that I can create a new alias, make it my primary alias (log-in address), and then delete the former primary alias (log-in address)? If so, what happens to the mail sent to my former primary/log-in address, after I've deleted
 it? I have hesitated to create a whole new account, simply because there is so much involved with doing all that. I would rather, for simplicity, keep my current account and make a new primary/log-in address, delete my former primary/log-in address, and never
 receive mail from people who send to my former primary (and secondary) aliases. Does the mail sent to the former address go into the junk folder, or does it never arrive at all in my account? What I would like even more is an onli

            I've had the same log-in address (now called "primary alias") before aliases were available. Through many years, too many people now have my primary address/alias. I have many blocked addresses/domains on my blocked list. But I still receive too much junk
 mail. II deal with various and particular types of email senders, and it becomes necessary occasionally to stop a lot of mail, by deleting an alias. If I cannot change the primary alias and delete the former primary, then I will need to create a whole new
 account. I don't know how to state my original issue any clearer, without being more wordy. My concern is not merely about how many 'secondary' aliases I can have, but whether I can completely delete a former 'primary' alias and retain the account. If I cannot,
 then I must create a new account. Do you know the answer concerning deleting a former primary alias (as I mentioned in my original post)? Thanks.

            I read the page at the link you gave. It states, "You can sign in to your account with any alias," which seems different from just a few months ago. It used to be that the 'primary' alias had to be the log-in address. It also states that any alias deleted
 becomes available to anyone else after 30 days. So, it would seem that all mail sent to a deleted alias will no longer reach the account. And any alias can be designated as the 'primary'&nbsp;and that the primary&nbsp;can be reassigned as often as&nbsp;twice a week. So,
 if a person can log in with any alias (all using the same password), then what's the significance of having/designating any alias as the 'primary'?

            On Hotmail/Outlook, since any alias can be designated as the 'primary'&nbsp;and that the primary&nbsp;can be reassigned as often as&nbsp;twice a week, and a person can log in with any alias (all using the same password), then what's the significance of having/designating
 any alias as the 'primary' on Hotmail/Outlook? It seems that the Hotmail/Outlook email account is no longer tied solely to the original primary (log-in/sign-in) email address, but to the overall account (name of account holder and other personal account info,
 and password), so that the original primary address/alias&nbsp;can be&nbsp;deleted, after a different primary alias has been designated. The reason I'm explaining all this is because the options seem to be different from how they were a few months ago. At that time,
 when I explained (as I have in my above posts) what I wish to do, an MS tech suggested I start an entirely new email account, because the original primary address/alias could not be totally deleted (disassociat

                    I am trying to install Office 365 Home Premuim. I have received the message "We found a pre-release or Beta version of an Office product on your computer and can't install because of it". I've looked via the Control Panel at 'Programs and Features' but

            No, the autoConfigDB.xml file is for POP and IMAP accounts only.<br />
    <br />
    Exchange users should use Autodiscover, which must be enabled by
    your Exchange administrator. If that is not available then I have an
    Outlook Exchange setup script here that you can configure and
    deploy. It will assist an Exchange user with the setup of his
    account when Autodiscover is not available.<br />

            <p>Shift return inserts a line break which means the content of both lines are in the same paragraph.</p>

<h2>            Word to pdf&#58; Images disappear.</h2>
                    I use Microsoft Office 2011 on Mac OSX 10.7.3 .While converting a Word document to pdf , the images don't get saved in the pdf version. The images don't even show in the print-preview. Both my 'Drawing objects' and 'Print background colors and images'
 boxes are checked.
<div>How do I fix this? </div>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would imagine there is an issue with the printer software. If you are not seeing a preview of the doc with images when you go to print, that is a typical sign of printer issues.</p>
<p>First thing, make sure Office is up to date. Current version is 14.2.3</p>
<p>Then go to this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads#macos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/downloads#macos</a></p>
<p>There is an OS update 10.7.4 and plenty of printer software updates (based on your printer - you may need to check with manufacturer).</p>
<p>Once everything is updated, re-boot and try again.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<h2>            mass upgrading lumia 640&#39;s to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anybody know of a way to mass upgrade lumia's from windows 8.1 to 10?(preferably with an sd card)</p>
<p>Right now we have to upgrade a lot of lumia 640's and it's proving very difficult to do it reliably through the regular updating mechanism(lots of errors and connection losses resulting in having to start the download over).</p>

 updates are dependent on different factors like device variant, region, and operator approval. The best option to do is to install the Upgrade Advisor app in all Lumia 640s that you have. This app will do the checking and updating once the Windows 10 Mobile
 upgrade is available for the phones. For the complete info, please visit this link:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi poochini21,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion is exactly what we were doing but since the downloads of the updates are too instable we can't upgrade phones reliably and it takes too long, in the meantime most devices are upgraded and we have since been buying 640 phones that have windows
 10 installed beforehand. So for us the issue is resolved for now .</p>

            Wow I guess the problem is either with the Mogul or Sprint becuase I am using a Mogul Sprint Official Rom? I am getting my Touch and Diamond back from service today I will try it on those to see if it works. You might want to email&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and
 let them know they sent me a file to get the error logs from my phone.

<h2>            Recover&#47;Retrieve a deleted conversation from Nokia E6</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a new Nokia E6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By mistake my sis deleted a text convesation which I had with my friend using the regular sms methodology and not using the whatsapp software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below mentioned solutions are already been tried and tested, however the effort went in vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>FExplorer
<ul>
<li>I downloaded FExplorer for Symbian 4 and above phones and installed it on my phones memory.</li><li>Opened the C:</li><li>Opened 'System' folder</li><li>Could not locate 'Mail' folder</li></ul>
</li><li><span>Mini Tool Power Data Recovery</span></li></ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Tried to retrieve data using 'Mini Tool Power Data Recovery' tool to retrieve data</li><li>After connecting my phone as a mass storage, it showed only 2 drives
<ul>
<li>Memory Card</li><li>Internal Memory (8GB)</li></ul>
</li><li>It did not showcase the Flash Memory of 260MB</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>So, none of the two above highlighted solutions worked out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can any one please show some guided path on how to Recover/Retrieve a deleted conversation from Nokia E6?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to hear from you all experts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can understand it may be important for you to retrieve these conversations but unless you made a backup using

<h2>            Nokia 6300 problem</h2>
                    I connected it up to the Computer, to download some media.<br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden it flashed a couple of times and turned off. I tried to turn it back on again, and it just flashes and turns off.<br />
I tried connecting back to the computer and the computer came up "new hardware found". Nokia, USB rom.<br />
<br />
Is it completely dead or what??<br />
<br />

            It looks like the phone has crashed for some reason.<br />
<br />
Firstly you could try the three finger reset.<br />
Which is turn the phone on.<br />
Pressing and holding these following buttons in this order:<br />
1) <font color="green">Call <font color="black">button.<br />
2) Number 3<br />
3) *<br />
Until the Nokia hands come together.<br />
The let go and hopefully the phone will start as normal.</font></font><br />
Doing this will erase any information you have on the phone though.<br />
<br />
If that doesnt work, then its off to a Nokia Care Point.<br />

            Sorry, adamf's solution won't work. The hard reset is only available for Symbian S60 models. All you can do is giving it to a Nokia Care Point or an authorized repairer.

            <p>Hi Ruby,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good heavens!&nbsp; You have quite a few issues here - but the two that stand out to me is that you were AND still are infected by at least the two you mentioned and quite probably more.&nbsp; The other (which was caused later but easy to resolve) is that you can
 only have ONE AV program that offers real-time protection (even if you disable tat in one of them) installed at the same time on the same operating system on the computer.&nbsp; You need to uninstall and use the removal tool on Avira since MSE is installed.&nbsp; If
 you are using Malwarebytes PRO (not the free version) then it too must be properly removed (but we can put the free one on - and almost certainly will).&nbsp; There may be other issues and we'll check for them as we go along, but I think the above along with an
 uninstall/re-install of MSE will do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, first we need to get rid of the conflicting programs because they can interfere with an effective and accurate scan from any other program (and we'll be using a few).&nbsp; The appropriate removal tools are in the following section on removing conflicting
 programs (along with how to check for any others that may exist without your awareness).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>************************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>Do
 not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed (and of course it will have), restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>*****************************************************************************</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>First, try the following programs (all free and you need not install Avast or any of them once installed) if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a> and then run a full ESET online scan:<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>.
 Also try Microsoft Safety Scanner:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>, TDSSKiller:
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>, and Hitman Pro Trial:<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused
 by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they don't work, try Microsoft Defender Offline. The best tutorial is here:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html</a>.
 Use the method that will work on your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For support from Microsoft, you can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will lead to the paid support options if you
 are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*******************************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once your system is clean, then let's make sure MSE is fine by starting from scratch with it (in case the infection pre-dated installation or affected the program that's installed).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version is behind this, so you may need to focus more of the second
 link with the Mr Fixit and manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAP and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the infection,
 but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAP database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve all the problem. If not, then post back with any that remain.&nbsp; If we can, we'll deal with them knowing we can rule out everything you've already done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that still doesn't work, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Builds 10525, ..., 10158&#58;  Desktop Background Slideshow Album Location Warning &#40;FIXED w&#47; Build 10532&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Under Settings | Personalization | Background | Choose Albums for Your Slideshow, if the album you're choosing for your slideshow is on a Network Attached Storage device (NAS), browsing to it and saying "Choose this Folder" does nothing. &nbsp;Moving that folder
 from the NAS to a local drive and doing the same thing works fine. &nbsp;If the user chooses such a NAS location, they should get a warning just like they get if when choosing a Lockscreen slideshow location. &nbsp;There, it says "The [foldername] folder isn't supported
 because of its location. &nbsp;Please choose another folder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;If you do choose a network location for this option, it appears to work (the first picture will show up on the Desktop). &nbsp;But, it really doesn't. &nbsp;Right-clicking on the Desktop and selecting "Next Desktop Background" will do nothing.</p>

            Funny note, specifying a network location in Win7 or Win8.1 and then upgrading to 10 allows it to work fine. Just don't try changing it.<br />
<br />
Wonder what could be learned from that.

            It looks like this is fixed with (at least) Build 10532. &nbsp;Desktop Slideshows seem to work from files on a NAS. &nbsp;The one odd thing I'm seeing is that from the default location (the Pictures directory), on my system "Next Desktop Background" doesn't work.
 &nbsp;But, if I choose a sub-folder from that same directory, it works. &nbsp;It might have something to do with what's in that directory on my system. &nbsp;I'll look into that and start another thread if I have to.

<h2>            Unspecified MAPI failures since upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Configuration before upgrade:&nbsp; Windows 8.0 64-bit, Office Home &amp; Student 2010, Windows Live Essentials 2012 (Mail).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Procedure:&nbsp; Create or edit a document with&nbsp;Word 2010 or Excel 2010, Save &amp; Send, Send Using E-mail, Send as PDF.&nbsp; Document is sent without any problem, this configuration has worked fine for more then 12 months.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 applied when made available via Windows Update service.&nbsp; Major problems&nbsp;resulted - perhaps associated with incompatible version of Dataram RamDisk, configured to hold&nbsp;temporary files in memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean rebuild from Windows 8.0, applied Windows
 8.1 upgrade successfully without incident or error.&nbsp; Removed the default Mail/People applications, then&nbsp;loaded&nbsp;Office Home &amp; Student 2013 and Windows Live Essentials 2012 Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything worked&nbsp;except ... cannot share/send documents from Word 2013 or Excel
 2013.&nbsp; Error message from Word 2013:&nbsp;'Word couldn't send mail&nbsp;because of MAPI failure "Unspecified Error".&nbsp; Error message from Excel 2013: 'General mail failure.&nbsp; Quit Microsoft Excel, restart the mail system, and try again.'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Removed Office Home &amp; Student 2013, loaded Office Home &amp; Student 2010.&nbsp; Same errors occur when attempting to share/send a document from an Office application to a mail recipient.&nbsp; Same documents can be attached to a message created in Windows Live Essentials
 2012 Mail application and successfully send to recipients.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No&nbsp;ram disk in use&nbsp;with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Obvious difference between the current non-function configuration&nbsp;and the previous functioning configuration&nbsp;is&nbsp;Windows (8.1 versus 8.0).&nbsp; All Microsoft licenses are legal and&nbsp;registered.&nbsp; Previous configuration worked
 fine with or without Dataram RamDisk.</p>

    <title>Student Progress Database Application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maneesh massey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Student Progress Database Application</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I want to make an application for keeping track of students’ progress marks each month of the year using Access 2010. Suppose I have 10 literacy centers in 10 different locations each with 35-40 students enrolled. I want to generate a monthly Access<span>&nbsp;
</span>report showing the progress of each student in each of the subjects taught.
</p>
<p>I have designed forms for entering details of each center, instructor and student saved in separate tables. All I need to do is find a way to generate month-wise students’ progress reports for each of the 10 literacy centers to be handed over to the center
 manager. </p>
<p>What would be the best way this could be done using Access 2010?</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry,, but that is not a properly normalized structure. You need more tables and some changes:</p>
<p>tblCenterdetails: Rename the ID field as CenterCode, remove TotalStudents since that should be calculated not stored. Add a Teachers table and remove all the teacher info and add a foreign key for Teacher ID. This is assuming that there is only one teacher
 to a center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblStudents: People names should be broken out into their components, at least First and Last. Class should not be in this table as it can be derived from other tables. Don't store Age, store date of birth and calculate Age. Remove the father, mother, brother
 and sister fields. Add a table for family members:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblFamilyMembers</p>
<p>FamilyMemberID (PK Autonumber), StudentID (FK), MemberTypeID (FK), MemberFirst, MemberLast</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>tluMemberType: MemberTypeID (PK Autonumber), MemberType (Mother, Father, brother, sister etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblStudentProgress, is almost all wrong. It should be:</p>
<p>StudentProgessID (PK Autonumber), StudentID (FK) CourseID (FK), Grade, GradeDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCourse: CourseID (PK Autonumber), CourseName</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a structure like that you should be able to create a report card report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, this is a homework assignment, correct?</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions on improving the table. Let me make the changes to the tables according to the suggestions and get back to you.</p>
<p>And no, this is not a homework assignment. This is actually a production application I am designing for managing our education centers.</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Here I am with the corrections. I've got a screenshot with the changes. Please see the structure below. I did not properly understand the tblTeachers very well. You stated above to add a FK for the TeacherID, but where is the FK that should be joined to
 this PK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66c76d5f-7528-4655-8c3e-242e42cef473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66c76d5f-7528-4655-8c3e-242e42cef473" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly have a look and suggest changes, if any.</p>

            <p>Ok, A FK correspomds to the PK in the parent table. So the ID field in tblTeacher should be TeacherID. If each center has a specific teacher then TeacherID goes as a foreign key in the Center table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are Boys and girls in the Center table? If that's a total by gender that shouldn't be stored either. Again its a calculated value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your also missing the Course table that links to the CourseID in the Student progress table.

            <p>OK, there might need to be some tweaks here and there, but this is much better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you start with a query of tblStudentProgress. Filter that query for the month you want. Sort by Student, and Course. That should give you the data to feed your report. Check the data to see if it is what you want. If it is, then start adding additional
 tables to get the more meaningful data. Add the Student table (joined on StudentID) to get the Student name, the Course table to get the course name, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have this query resulting in all the data values you want in your report, then use that query as the source of your report. use the Report Wizard. Group the report on Center and Student. The report should be what you need.</p>

            <p>I’m sorry Scott, but this was not what I was looking for.<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason is I have a lot of students enrolled in each education center, average 35 in each center and there are around 40 centers spread out in geographical locations. 35 students
 x 40 centers = 1400 entries each month per center. That’s a lot of manual labor. What I was looking for was a way to store students marks in the datasheet view for each month. Then have a combo box on the form to filter the datasheet for the current month
 or the previous month and basing my report on that month, print out a report. This would allow me to pre-enter marks of each student for each month and just filter the month and print out the report. This can easily be done in Excel, but I am looking for a
 way to do the same in Access instead otherwise my database application has no use. Is there a way to achieve this functionality in Access 2010?</p>

            <p>Access is a relational database. Data needs to be stored so it follows the relational model. Don't confuse data storage with presentation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What manual labor are you referring to? You have to enter the data, and you need to enter the data in properly designed tables. Once the data is entered. Then you can easily produce a report with the click of a button. Using the methods I described.

</p><p>I solved my dilemma by adding&nbsp;"Outlook.live.com"&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Internet Options/Security/Pop-up Blocker/Exceptions so I&nbsp;can now have:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Hide the reading pane"</li><li>"Type in a new item"</li></ol>
<p>and the New Button works ie. a pop-up, new composition window appears.&nbsp; Of course this means that I will be subjected to pop-ups by Outlook.live.com but I'll deal with that later....&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, but I do not want to change my primary e-mail address.&nbsp; I want my primary e-mail address to come up in the "manage how people find me in Skype" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three separate e-mail addresses listed as I have my personal one (primary) and two others related to volunteer work which I do.&nbsp; It is one of those which keeps coming up in the "manage how people find me in Skype box" and it is not the one which most
 of my contacts know and neither is it my primary address.<br />
<br />
For now I have removed those two and will see how I get on.&nbsp; I had hoped that my mobile number would pop up as an option too.&nbsp; That is a&nbsp;verified number (and has been for quite some time).</p>

<p>Thank you Joseph, but I don't think you have quite got my problem.&nbsp;I don't want to change my primary e-mail or my mobile number in my profile.&nbsp; They are fine as they are and have been for several years.<br />
<br />
I am unable to alter the "change how people find me on Skype" option in Windows 10. It keeps picking up on random aliases which don't even feature in my Skype profile, aliases which I use merely for e-mail to make my admin easier.&nbsp; My day-to-day main e-mail
 address is the one I want to use for Skype, as indeed it is the one I use for the majority of my e-mails, the one I use to log in to Skype (although I also use my screen name) and the one I have had for some 10 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attach a couple of screenshots which I hope may help describe my issue. The first is from Classic Skype on Windows 7 (version 7.40.0.104) and the second is from Skype for Windows 10 (version 12.1803.279.0)</p>

<p>No @Bottlecap22, the problem was not resolved, although having said that, I went through to the techie people but denied access to the technician who wanted to take control of my computer as Skype&nbsp;is working, and this is an annoying niggle.&nbsp; I was worried
 that he might interfere with something that is otherwise working perfectly well.</p>

</p><p>What makes me wonder is that forum moderators post ineffective answers. It seems they do not understand the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once more - Skype for Windows 10 app version 12.1807.264.0 has uneditable dialog box under Settings -&gt;&nbsp;Manage How People Find Me on Skype. I can not add any phone numer or modify shown e-mail address. By the way - it's one of my aliases - looks like the

<p>
</p><p>May I ask forum moderators to provide the screenshot from <span>Skype for Windows 10 app version 12.1807.264.0 and

<p>Well, all the answers from Microsoft agents have been so incredibly useless!! </p>
<p>Why didn't they at least try to understand the problem... Or, if they did, why didn't they just say frankly stg. like "We are sorry, but this part of the app is broken and we are not about to do anything about that in the next year." ?</p>

    <title>SharePoint online Guest Access &#47; Links within document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian morrall  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint online Guest Access &#47; Links within document</h2>
                    <p>From my organisation's main parent site, within the 'Documents' folder, I have set up around 100 sub-folders, each one a premises that we look after, and within those folders another file structure in order to store&nbsp;documents specific to that site.
</p>
<p>I have no trouble giving the sites 'guest' access links to their folder so that they can view the documents and add ones themselves - which is brilliant (now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT - as the file structures are so large, I have produced individual Excel sheets listing all the documents and I (from my system) have linked them to the folder where they are stored (it is filed within the individual site's folder structure). I can click
 on the link (within the document) and I am taken straight to the folder, great. Unfortunately these links do not work once I send the access to the sites, the links are visible but a pop-up basically says 'link address may be invalid, or you do not have permission
 to open it' (which means they have to search through the folders to find the documents manually).</p>
<p>Therefore, I assume that because I set up the links it is only letting me access them on the computer I set them up on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kind of thought that if we were all using the same file - albeit on the internet - that the folders would always be in the same place, so the links would continue to work no matter which computer you accessed them from? I notice from a few other questions
 that something happens to the links when you share them, but there may be a way to change this? This is an example of the last part of one of the links I can access from the Excel document within the site (sub) 'parent' folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>....folderid=141b4e04ada6b485aaa3f7409e778c18b&amp;authkey=AQvov5IvprmbRI6APwS2ZGA&amp;expiration=2019-02-03T14%3a00%3a23.000Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice to save me having to visit each site to edit the links on their system, would be gratefully received.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Brian,<br />
<br />
Glad to hear that it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the expiration time of the guest link in SharePoint Online site, we can't set a value more than 730. Given this, I suggest you submit feedback to
<a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Online uservoice</a> which is the best way to perfect our products and services. Many features have been developed or upgraded directly from customers' ideas. We appreciate your understanding.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're happy with this, you may also choose OneDrive for Business to store your folders. The reason? OneDrive for Business provides us with a choice to set the expiration date to anoymous access links to "Never". We can go to OneDrive for Business admin
 center &gt; Sharing, there you will see an option "Anoymous Access Links", change the value to Never.</p>

<p>Thanks James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does appear that something may have happened, and now I can edit the documents with Excel (Office) then as long as I save and close that, and re-open the Excel document within Excel Online, I can add my links which work both online (for those I am sharing
 with) and also for me if I reopen the document in (Office) Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure why there is a difference - would have thought a link was a link - especially since the changes in permissions and the way the link appears to be generated?</p>
<p>Probably the main issue I have now is that the links I create can only be 'open' for up to 2 years, so quite concerned that in a couple of years I will be having to create another 10,000 or so new ones? Although it is fairly obvious in the thread of the
 link, the date of 'expiration' is part of the code - I have tried changing the year and currently the link still continues to work (hope that I haven't jinxed that now).</p>
<p>To be honest, there have been a lot of changes to SharePoint over the last 4 or 5 months, most of them being a positive step, but as ever I am slightly worried that Microsoft might change their minds and I will be back to square -1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure that I have a lot to learn, and expect I have probably missed something quite obvious, but I really find some of the 'help' topics to be either too generalised or too specific for my level of understanding (they were just bringing the BBC computers
 when I was just leaving school!) If only I had the time, I would like to get my head around all the other apps built into O365 - although I am chuffed to say I managed to get a 'Flow' to work (more by luck than judgement!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking into this for me.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are several ways for you to automatically set a subject to a new email using an Outlook app. One way to do this is by using Quick Steps in Outlook. To get started, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Home</strong> tab, click <strong>Create New</strong> in the Quick Steps box.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddca6260-bacc-4fdd-8e2c-95f1ae02587b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddca6260-bacc-4fdd-8e2c-95f1ae02587b" /></a></li><li>In the pop-up window, create a name for your Quick Step.</li><li>Click <strong>Choose an Action</strong>, then select <strong>New Message</strong> in the Respond section from the drop down list.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8daf3b3b-340d-4862-b1cb-eafe804d2b0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8daf3b3b-340d-4862-b1cb-eafe804d2b0f" /></a></li><li>Click <strong>Show Options</strong> to expand the preset message option.</li><li>Enter your desired Subject in the box provided.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/090d10fd-96f7-4524-9581-26538985706d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/090d10fd-96f7-4524-9581-26538985706d" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Once done, click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the following steps and want to create a new message, just click the Quick Step Name that you created inside the Quick Step Box.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that works for you.</p>

<h2>            My music won&#39;t download&#33; What is error C101A3FF&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought an album from the market place and when I tried to download it it gave me the error C101A3FF. Then it tried to make me repurchase the music. Does anyone know what that means? And how I can get my music or at least my points back?

            <p>Hello ValerieM0526,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear you had an issue with purchasing an album.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing I would recommend doing, would be to check the <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Billing</a> website to make sure that the points were actually consumed in the transaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the points were consumed, and you are still being prompted to purchase the music.&nbsp; Then you will need to
<a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/contactsupport.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a> for your region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the points were not consumed, then you will need to try the purchase again.&nbsp; If you still get the same error message, then
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">there are a few troubleshooting steps that you can try</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Ka.</p>
