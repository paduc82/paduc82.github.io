<p>ok so here are two videos that i made more than 12 hours apart.</p>
<p>1st:<strong>[Mod Edit] -&nbsp;Video deleted due to inappropriate language in video</strong></p>
<p>2nd:&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Edit] -&nbsp;Video deleted due to inappropriate language in video</strong></p>

<p>alright so i got suspended from XBL on the 23/11 UNTIL the 6th of december. I got no reason as to why i was banned other than a very vague list of things. I tried to post on the forums and inbox a moderator about 6 times in all and got no reply or anything
 and that was between the period of 23rd and today.</p>
<p>SO this morning on the 6th i tried to get onto XBL and hey surprise surprise i was STILL suspended which pissed me off. fair enough, so i went to work and got home about 20 min ago at 715ish PM and though ill play some xbox. So went to log in and BAM still
<strong>[removed] &nbsp;</strong>suspended, its 6th here AND 6th in redmond wa where the XBL HQ is, so why am i still suspended. if i am still suspended tomorrow i WILL be taking legal action because they 1- didnt tell me why i was suspended, 2-kept me suspended
 beyond the date given for end of suspension which is against their own guide lines. if anyone else had the same problem stand up to the moderators and microsoft, all they do is abuse their power, i mean did you know if you get banned you loose ALL your dlc,
 and it is against the terms of use to create another account to bypass a ban or suspension, so in other words if you get banned forever and you create a new xbl account they WILL ban the new account AND the console you play on. this is a disgusting abuse of
 power and their terms and conditions.</p>
<p>i would like to apologize for my poor grammar and punctuation as i am very pissed off about this situation.</p>

<p>to explain why you were not unbanned by 12:19 on the day of the 6th,</p>
<p>you are only unbanned around the same time as you were banned in the first place.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>so if you were banned at 10 p.m on the 5th you will not be unbanned till 10.pm on the 6th (24 hour ban),not at the stroke of midnight on the day.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>considering your language on both your post and your video,i would guess its some form of communication issue.</p>

<br />
And like stated above, given the language of both of your Videos it's probably a good thing you were Banned. Too bad it wasn't permanent. Sorry but you'll find no sympathy here.<br />
<br />
Edit- Oh look, you're a Cheater according to <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?Gamertag=krypticslaughtr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>the reason i was swearing is because i was pissed off for not &nbsp;getting any reply posting 6 times in a week and have NO responses, meaning that microsoft know that their mods are banning people unfairly. for example heres a transcript of one such conversation..</p>
<p>Please wait for an agent to respond. You are currently '1' in the queue</p>
<p>Privacy Statement </p>
<p>You are now chatting with 'Jeremy'.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Jeremy. Please give me a moment to review your question.</p>
<p>pasha: just to add the that i am VERY angry at the service right now</p>
<p>Jeremy: Hi Pasha!</p>
<p>Jeremy: I understand you're having difficulty accessing your gamertag even though it was already past the suspension date of the account, is this correct?</p>
<p>pasha: yes</p>
<p>pasha: 19 hours past the end of suspension</p>
<p>Jeremy: Thanks for confirming.</p>
<p>pasha: and i got NO reasons, NO replys, just vague crap in an email as to why i was banned, NO mod is replying to me as ive been trying to get info as to why this happened since 23rd of nov.</p>
<p>Jeremy: What date was the suspension supposed to end?</p>
<p>pasha: and no time zone to which the ban was set to</p>
<p>pasha: UNTIL the 6th/12/12</p>
<p>Jeremy: Just a heads up, banned accounts can only be accessed by our Enforcement team. This is for privacy and security purposes. As far as I know, suspension will last after the date indicated. If the date indicated is 12/06/2012, then the suspension will
 be lifted by end of day. This would be by midnight of the same date in your own local time.</p>
<p>pasha: no it said UNTIL which mean up to the point of, it should be ended now. This is against your guidelines, you are lying to your customers. If it says UNTIL it should end on THAT EXACT DAY, if it ends on the next day that would be "suspension ends on
 7th"</p>
<p>pasha: and i STILL have no reason as to why I was suspended in the first place. I want a reason and EVIDENCE to back that reason up.</p>
<p>pasha: Your services and "enforcement team" is SUB PAR to what it should be. They abuse their power and ban people for no reason without any evidence, and you guys are no help whats so ever. I am VERY angry at your lack of better services and treatment of
 customers</p>
<p>Jeremy: I understand how frustrating this can be for you, Pasha. Let me assure you that even our Enforcement team will never ban a gamertag without solid evidence. To prevent other players from circumventing the violation, specific reason for the ban is
 not given out.</p>
<p>Jeremy: It could just be a technical delay, Pasha. Have you tried redownloading your gamertag on your console?</p>
<p>pasha: They banned MinnesotaBurns for HELPING root the people that ARE hacking and breaking the terms and conditions, he got banned for harassment, laundering, stalking, threatening etc etc and got banned on multiple accounts and on his system and all he
 did was talk and convince them to admit they were hacking etc</p>
<p>pasha: Yes, I am over these excuses and lack of responses and crap. I want to talk to the exact person who suspended me or another mod DIRECTLY and I want all me points put back and "cheater" status removed or I WILL take legal action and I have proof of
 your activities and access to a good lawyer. If everything gets returned to the way it was before the suspension I will forget about everything that happened.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Per our Terms of Use, a player is prohibited from campaigning against other players. If this MinnesotaBurns found out that there are hackers, all he has to do is report the activities to our Enformcent team so that it can be investigated. Announcing
 it to the world online will affect the other player's reputation and that is against the Live Terms of Use.</p>
<p>pasha: not to mention I have people that WILL back me as this is not the first time this has happened. A major news network covered a story exactly the same as this and they tried to contact microsoft and the mods and got NO reply too.</p>
<p>pasha: He does report them, and he even tells them that hes recording etc</p>
<p>Jeremy: I understand.</p>
<p>pasha: As for the whole reporting thing, it does absolutely nothing I have reported countless hackers etc and nothing happened to them. What you are doing is STEALING peoples money by not even allowing transfers of content or membership onto a new account,
 also the rule that says you cannot create another account to bypass a ban or suspension is a load of crap. If a person gets banned and they create a new gold account to play again and they yet again get banned you think it is fair? NO, it just proves that
 you are stealing peoples money in ways that bypass conventional and typical stealing</p>
<p>pasha: Alright let me put this into a perspective you will understand, say you bought your kid or family member a brand new xbox and live to go with it and a few games and accessories that cost you over $700 EASILY and after a few weeks of playing they get
 banned and labeled a cheater etc, would you be happy?</p>
<p>pasha: And when they go to create a new account to play again, even just with school friends etc and they get banned again and their console gets banned would you really like that</p>
<p>pasha: $700 plus dollars down the drain and the kid has a near useless console.</p>
<p>Jeremy: I wouldn't be, Pasha. I understand your side of things here. All I'm saying is our Enforcement team will not arbitrarily ban accounts without solid evidence of a violation. We do have legal aspects to consider.</p>
<p>pasha: ok what about this story? <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,500824,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.foxnews.com/.../0,2933,500824,00.html</a></p>
<p>pasha: a *** got banned because a group of ignorant pigs reported her for her sexual orientation</p>
<p>pasha: how is that a violation or fair</p>
<p>Jeremy: How about we work with your own gamertag first, Pasha? Please go to Settings, Storage, Gamer Profile, select your gamertag and select "Delete Profile Only. After that, go to Social and Download Profile. This may help you regain access to the gamertag
 today.</p>
<p>pasha: I already did that, you asked me before already. Stop avoiding my questions</p>
<p>pasha: oh and what about all those people who got banned just because some stores released halo 4 early breaking the street date. How is that fair?</p>
<p>pasha: oh heres another story</p>
<p>pasha: <a href="http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2011/10/microsoft_has_robbed_my_child.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blogs.seattleweekly.com/.../microsoft_has_robbed_my_child.php</a></p>
<p>Jeremy: We looked into those accounts that were affected by the early release od pre-ordered Halo 4 copies.</p>
<p>pasha: now is THAT fair, the 13 year old got banned because of microsofts fault and couldnt get the ban reversed</p>
<p>Jeremy: I really do not have access to watching videos here in my end, Pasha. I do not have the authority to judge a ban as fair or unfair. All I can say is that if an account is banned, then there's a solid evidence of a violation of our Terms od Use. As
 you may know, owners of the account do have the right to challenge the ban legally.</p>
<p>pasha: Well how could you prove that they DIDNT just pirate it etc? what did you go to their house and inspect their console etc?</p>
<p>pasha: you cant prove they did or didnt, my point is you are banning people for no reason WITHOUT evidence.</p>
<p>pasha: Ok well im challenging mine, give me a sufficient reason as to why I was suspended and what proof you have.</p>
<p>pasha: You won't be able to sign in to Xbox LIVE until 6/12/2012. there you go, and hey guess what its the 6th now and i CANT sign in.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Only our Enforcement team can do that for us. Please go to www.xbox.com/forums and inquire about the ban on your account.</p>
<p>pasha: I ALREADY DID 6 TIMES, noone replies at all.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Was the posts you made successfully displayed on the forums or not?</p>
<p>pasha: no, it said they had to be approved. just put me through to someone that CAN do something about the ban</p>
<p>Jeremy: It could be you included personal information on your posts. For security reasons our Enforcement will not approved posts that includes sensitive information.</p>
<p>pasha: btw thanks for making me lose my account completely by suggesting to delete it, really helpful.</p>
<p>Jeremy: I'm sorry but only our Enforcement team can handle banned accounts, Pasha. No other department has access to it.</p>
<p>pasha: i included NO personal info just asking why i was banned.</p>
<p>pasha: WELL PUT ME THROUGH TO THEM</p>
<p>Jeremy: Our Enforcement team cannot be reached via chat or phone. You can only get in touch with this department via forums.</p>
<p>pasha: well why not</p>
<p>pasha: that just seems a little strange to me.</p>
<p>pasha: that they only seem to want to talk to those that they know wont take any action against their bans etc</p>
<p>Jeremy: Look at it this way, reasons for ban is not readily given out because if it is, other players will know what to look out for and will possibly find a way to work around it. If this happens, the integrity of Live server as a whole will be compromised.</p>
<p>pasha: I DONT CARE, I just want to know the reason I was banned and reset and for it to be undone and all forgotten about. Stop giving me excuses and trying to hide stuff, im not stupid.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Sorry if I made that impression on you, Pasha. I'm trying to do my best here to help you given the limitations imposed upon me by Microsoft regarding banned accounts.</p>
<p>Jeremy: To clarify further, if the ban says until 12/06/2012, all you have to do is wait until it is fully lifted. There is no way for us to determine what time exactly the ban will be lifted. Most likely it will be after midnight on 12/06/2012, because
 if you think about it, the word "Until" means while it is still 12/06/2012, the ban will still be in effect.</p>
<p>Jeremy: Looking at it another, the ban will only be lifted when it's no longer 12/06/2012. This points out that you will gain access to the account right after 12/06/2012, so first thing 12/07/2012.</p>
<p>Jeremy: I have not heard from you for a while. &nbsp;Do you still need assistance? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeremy: I have not heard from you for a while. &nbsp;Do you still need assistance? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeremy: Since I haven't heard from you in a while, I'm going to close this chat session. If you still need help, please contact Xbox Support again.</p>
<p>Jeremy: You may call our phone support group regarding your plan to legally dispute the ban, Pasha. Phone number to call is (02) 8031-8186 (if you are in Sydney) or 1 (800) 555 741.</p>

<p>Wow, what a whiny little brat you are. First off, you posted in the wrong place and you called the wrong people. And then you get mad when no one is able to assist you? If you were a little smarter, you wouldn't have had that problem. The policy enforcement
 team doesn't ban people for no reason.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Someone filed a complaint against you. Given your posts here I can only assume it was because of rampant douchebaggery. At which point the Policy Enforcement Team investigated the claim, likely by viewing how you play online and interact with other players
 and they witnessed said douchebaggery for themselves. Thus you were banned.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>My only complaint is that you were not banned for a longer time. A ban from the forums would be nice too.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even though you might get this message, you can always run Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>

<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

            Hi Frankie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.   
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />Servers are overloaded lately so you may get a Try Back later error message.  So you can wait and try back in a day or two.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having surface pro 3 , but I am having trouble changing the BIOS settings. I can not change the TPM settings, Secure Boot Control, Administrator Password, or the Configure Alternate System Boot Order. Everything is grayed out, unable to navigate/click
 those options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only able to click on Device Information, and Advance Device Security. Even in the Advance Device Security option, everything is grayed out. I am trying to change these settings, So I can boot from a usb device, but I can only currently boot from the
 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the volume up &amp; volume down buttons with no luck. I even tried resetting my device with no luck. I also tried resetting/ cleaning the TPM, but nothing. I get the message, "Unable to reset". So, I am trying to reset my device using usb. I looked all
 over, but can no find a proper answer to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me out here? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Philippe, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A forced shutdown might help resolve the issue. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.</span></li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, use this two-button shutdown process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After you forced shutdown your device, access UEFI again and try to enable the cameras.

<p>Please consider that THERE IS A PASSWORD NEEDED. I can enter the bios without entering anything but it severely limits what I can do to nothing. Is there a way to reset this bios password?</p>

 the speakers even though my headphones are plugged in. I've also tried re-downloading the Realtek HD Audio Driver and still nothing

    <title>File mover program other than File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arizona willie  say:</h3>
<h2>            File mover program other than File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Windows 10 Pro on a new m.2 hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for some unknown reason, many directories that Windows creates are marked READ ONLY and if I unmark them and it goes through the process of unmarking all the files below the directory level ( or says it does ) but then immediately the directory is marked
 READ ONLY AGAIN and I am unable to copy / paste or drag / drop into those directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However programs ARE able to write to the Documents directory, and presumably, the others as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with 3 Microsoft techs and no one has been able to figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem may be with File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed Windows in order to be sure there were no corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another good ( hopefully free ) program that does what File Explorer does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to see if the directories are showing up as READ ONLY for some other file handling program.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you make any changes to the permission settings recently?</p>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p><span>As an initial troubleshooting step, I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if you are able to take the full control of the folder or files.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the file or folder, and then click Properties.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> <strong>tab</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Group</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>user</strong> <strong>
names</strong>, click your name to see the permissions you have.</li><li>The permissions for the selected user or group are shown in the lower portion of the properties dialog box.</li><li>Assign yourself “<strong>Full control</strong>” permission by checking the box for “Allow” for Full Control and check if you can access the drive.</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">follow the below steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Type UAC or User Account Access on the search bar.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. From UAC window, I suggest you to bring down the level to default and check if it helps.

            <p>I spent most of the day yesterday with 3 Microsoft technicians and none of them could solve the issue. We've been through the ownership routine many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I believe the problem lies completely with File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the directories such as Documents are marked READ ONLY ... programs write to the directory with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot use File Explorer to copy / paste to those directories that File Explorer sees as READ ONLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tomorrow I have an appointment with a Microsoft Engineer who will be calling to see if &lt; he &gt; can figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since programs can write to those directories, obviously they are NOT &lt; read only &gt; but they are as far as Microsoft Explorer is concerned so that's why I'm looking for another program that will copy / paste files. I want to see if those directorys show
 up marked READ ONLY to that program too.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check out Total Commander.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not concerned with changing file permissions too much right now. Went through all that stuff with 3 Microsoft technicians all day yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs can write to those directories even though Microsoft Explorer thinks the directories are marked READ ONLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously they are NOT &lt; read only &gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm looking for another file handling program to see if IT will see those directories marked READ ONLY too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what happened to Microsoft Explorer. It had worked and I had moved some files from the directories on my old hard drive but suddenly I wasn't able to anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have completely re-installed Windows 10 Pro over the top of the first installation ( at the direction of the technicians ) and it didn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only installed one new program " FileSeek " from Binary Fortress but they are a known and reputable company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did a boot time virus scan with Avast Premier this morning --- not one corrupted file according to that.</p>

            <p>Can you move files between folders on your (C:) drive or is that gimped too?</p>
<p>Have you tried uninstalling 'FileSeek'?</p>
<p>Have you run System File Check or some troubleshooter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing some directories and folders from 'read only' and they reverted but the files themselves didn't, well not right away. Either with or without 'read only' I could still move them. So it's a puzzler...</p>

            <p>A Microsoft " engineer " told me it is NORMAL for directories to be marked READ ONLY!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>News to me. I don't remember seeing them marked READ ONLY before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we were able to copy paste some files between drives when he called so .... it seems as though perhaps something one of the 3 techs did the day before may have taken affect overnight while the computer was off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting didn't fix it but a cold boot may have. Time will tell.</p>

<h2>            Xbox live stealing my money</h2>
                    
<p>So I decided that I would check my bank statements today and its crazy because to my discovery i found out that microsoft xbox live here is taking my money and it looks like they are double charging me here and there and on top of that I recently canceled
 my monthly subscription fee and they charge me once again so I log in to see if they gave me another month of gold since they charged and GUESS WHAT!?! No gold and there's still an option to renew? I really hate calling the number because last time I did they
 called me a liar even though my bank statements clearly show they are charging me more than they should be......</p>

<p>Whats going on xbox live? I knew you guys were money hungry but not enough to steal from a loyal customer who's been on gold since my teenage years(with multiple accounts) &nbsp;and im an adult now....*** i dont even want to mention how many poorly designed xbox
 360's i went through and stuck around with the xbox name but after this I don't know if I can trust this company....Playstation4 might be calling my name</p>

<p>Well I called the number and guess what?!? I'm the liar even though my bank statements clearly show they double charged and the lady on the phone even read off one of the double charges and then told me &nbsp;they wouldn't refund. Oh the funny thing to so eeveryone
 remember this JUST BECAUSE YOU CANCEL AUTO-RENEW YOU DONT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION lol I dont get that at all what the heck is the point of giving me the option to cancel&nbsp;</p>
<p>last thing I even told them that if you weren't going to refund me at least give me the months of gold you double charged me for and nope so i asked for the supervisor and she said no there isn't anyone to transfer you to&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            When i press Caps Lock in any game it makes it windowed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So i have had this problem for a while now and it starts to get really ennoying. Basically what happens is that when i am in any fullscreen game everytime i press capslock it makes it windowed. I think its because of the Caps lock osd that shows up when
 pressing capslock and the osd only shows up in fullscreen.</p>

 most Windows user problems, the technical ways aren't the solving their problems. The problem 90% of the time is simple and if the simple way don't work, really its pretty easy to just clean install your OS.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#47;Open license</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 5 Windows 10 Pro Open License and we used it for upgrade of all the 5 Windows XP Pro computers. My questions is how can I remove/transfer the license. We are no longer use these computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked from the VLSC site that still 5/50 and we only purchased 5 licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            DHCP is not a type of 'traffic.' It's a method for assigning dynamic IP addresses to devices on a network.

            i do agree DHCP is method of assigning ip and that is not working once we enable firewall setting "allow unicast response" is my problem.
