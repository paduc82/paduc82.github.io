    <title>Adding second toolbar to my windows 7 ultimate desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding second toolbar to my windows 7 ultimate desktop</h2>
                    
<p>HI there</p>
<p>I've recently migrated from Windows XP. Love Windows 7, but there's one feature from XP I'd like to restore but can't work out how.</p>
<p>At present, I have a 'autohide' toolbar at the bottom of my desktop view, showing current apps so I can switch betweeen them at will.</p>
<p>With XP I also had, on the left of my desktop, a second toolbar (or should I use a different term for this?) in which I lodged shortcuts for my most commonly used apps and files/folders --about 20 of them. I'd just flick my mouse cursor to the right, the
 toolbar would pop up, and I'd select the app or folder I wanted.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can do this with Windows 7? When I go down to the app toolbar and select properties, it asks me to select or make new toolbar. When I do that, the new toolbar simply gets added as a button to the existing one. It doesn't seem possible to
 split or hive it off so that it can exist autonomously, at the side of the screen. Is there a simple way to make this happen? And believe me, I need 'simple' .....</p>
<p>thanks Anthony</p>

            This feature was deprecated in Windows XP, and discontinued entirely in Windows Vista. It remains gone in Windows 7. The new and more efficient way is to pin items to the taskbar. For example, if you need to access a folder, just drag it to the taskbar
 where it will pin inside the Explorer item. Then you can right-click (or drag-up) the Explorer icon any time you want instant access to that folder again. If you absolutely need a toolbar elsewhere, try RocketDock. It's free, and can be skinned to work just
 like the toolbars of old. (I really think you'll like the Jump lists and the less cluttered screen it gives you, but I've used Rocket Dock myself in the past and think you'll find it gives you what you're looking for).

            Yes, I did and I was told to post my issue back here....so at this point I've given up on anyone having an answer to this issue.&nbsp; I am going to go with the answer that my companies network team blocked the use of TFTP even though I have rights.

The fact that you can get an account suspended without any facts or transcripts of why is completely absurd ! This is amazingly very Trump of you microsoft !

I'm not saying that there aren't people that&nbsp;go over the line with their words and behavior, but there is a fine line between simple trash talk, and crazy threat making bullying nut-jobs with swastika pics. The fact that microsoft does not make the gestapo of enforcement available for question or discussion says plenty about the company itself.

<h2>            Vertical kick stand without loosing horizontal</h2>
                    <p>I was thinking this while using my original Surface Pro today, but it would apply to the whole Surface line. I'd like to be able to stand my Surface up vertically (since there's no Surface Mini to buy...hint, hint MS) when reading articles or sometimes internet.
 This seems easy enough to accomplish. Instead of the kickstand having edges flush with the sides of the devices, simply taper, curve, or give it a shape that would allow it to be stood up on a flat surface with the kick stand out at 90 degrees. Seems like
 a simple change right? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, I've got a Dremel and a Surface Pro (original) that's out of warranty anyway. Perhaps I'll give it a try, but I'd rather have a professionally designed one. Well, what I'd really like to have is a Surface Mini, but if history foretells the future
 if I hold my breath in waiting on MS I might suffocate...One can dream though. :)
</p>

<p>what 360 are you playing on and does it have a hard drive inside (slim) or on (fat) if not you need a hard drive in order to even PLAY the old games on a 360. &nbsp;If you DO have a hard drive did it come with the console or did you buy it later on, if so chances

<p>How big is the drive? &nbsp;If the drive is less than 250GB, then it is likely you have a fake drive. Fake drives do not have the emulation software to play original xbox games. &nbsp;If it is 250GB and is an official drive then it could just be a problem with the
 xbox dashboard software. &nbsp;To fix it then you should follow these instructions <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971875/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Hi, Samio123,</p>

            <p>Just to follow up, are you still having an issue on Microsoft designer keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, we would suggest to you to check Power Management in the Device Manager and you should enable
<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>. To do this kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand the <strong>Keyboards</strong>, right-click the device which you are having the issue and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Power Management</strong> tab to view&nbsp;<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.</strong>
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persists you can run the troubleshooter for Hardware and Devices in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Weather gadget doesn&#39;t show current weather information</h2>
                    For some reason a few months ago the Windows 7 weather gadget will not show the current weather information. It pulls the current temp, and the 3 day&nbsp;forecast but it will not show the current conditions outside.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even when you click on the location and it takes you to the msn website it says 'Not Available'. I have tired from my computer, my work computer, and my lappy and they all say the same thing for my location which is: Winnipeg, MB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a link to the msn page which says 'Not&nbsp;Available' under the temp:&nbsp;<a href="http://local.msn.com/worldweather.aspx?eid=36640&amp;q=Winnipeg-CAN&amp;src=Windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://local.msn.com/worldweather.aspx?eid=36640&amp;amp;q=Winnipeg-CAN&amp;amp;src=Windows7</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a screenshot of how it displays on my desktop:&nbsp;<a href="http://screensnapr.com/v/qPA0yn.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://screensnapr.com/v/qPA0yn.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But if I type in a different location it works fine it seems to be just a problem with my location (Winnipeg, MB).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-any ideas? I think it's a feed error that no one has ever reported as it's been like this for&nbsp;at least&nbsp;3-4 months.</div>

 needs to be fixed by Microsoft or am I just missing something? Help please...

            <p>There are other weather gadgets which do a better job. This one..</p>
<p>WeatherCenter.. <a href="http://weathercenter.narod2.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://weathercenter.narod2.ru/</a></p>
<p>can pick up weather info from a variety of sources, so if your area is not covered too well by one, you can set Weather Centre to pick up from a source that will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to admit that I don't understand Adrian or anybody wanting to stay with a gadget which does not work too well for their needs. It is not as if both gadgets have to be run simultaneously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another.. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Waether info is obtained from these sources..</p>
<p>weather.com - accuweather.com - wunderground.com - msn.com - theweathernetwork.com - weatherbug.com - weather.gov (US only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of weather gadgets are tied to one of the above sources. Some are better for Europe and the rest of the world, one of them only works for the US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in Canada, theweathernewtwork.com works best. But, like the reviewer of one fo the gadgets pointed out, he doesn't like the type where they have to flip out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I use the gadget&nbsp;from the first link I gave you, combined with theweathernetork.com as the source..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try out the top gadget and set it for&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the weather sources until you find the one which works best for you, and then either stay with the gadget or look for the gadget tied to the&nbsp;best weather&nbsp;source for your area.. &nbsp;</p>

            I guess I just thought the default gadget in Windows 7 would actually work correctly.&nbsp; I apparently have too much faith in Microsoft/MSN.&nbsp; I added another gadget that seems to be working now, and have uninstalled the default one.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion!

            <p>I am late to this party but I have the answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it&nbsp;http://forums.techguy.org/windows-7/1142347-win-7-weather-desktop-gadget.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially it says the fix is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Go to "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Services\Cache"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right Click "Config.xml" and choose Edit (the file opens in Notepad)</span></p>
<p><span>At the top, click on File and then Save.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After 20 seconds, restart the gadget. (Or you can restart your computer)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have confirmed this works. &nbsp;My computer had both of these issues. &nbsp;I don't know why it happened. &nbsp;Initially, I had the issue that is happening in this thread. &nbsp;So, I removed and then reopened the gadget and then it
 wouldn't work at all - the second issue "cannot connect to service." &nbsp;Both of these issues are fixed using the method described above.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I want to mention that you should NOT delete the Config.xml file. &nbsp;I tried that too but Windows does not re-create the file - even after a reboot. (I made a copy of it before I deleted it.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Config.xml is missing (or you've deleted it), it's a text file and I've copied and pasted its contents below. &nbsp;You can re-create it using a copy and paste of the lines between the dashes at the top and bottom (but
 not the dashes themselves) into Notepad and then saving it as Config.xml and placing it in the folder specified in the path</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Services\Cache"</span></p>

<p><span>What went wrong with your system for you to need to do a system restore? I believe you may need to manually restore the latest
 DirectX and drivers ... Hardware issues can cause freezing, black screens and other errors. Also, your drivers should always be kept up to date. Try the following steps one at a time to try and resolve the issue. I hope this helps. Please post back if you
 have any questions! :-)</span></p>
<p><span>1. Update DirectX and your Chipset, Sound, &amp;Video Drivers: For all Video / DirectX / Game and Hardware Issues, I have a</span></p>
<p><span>Checklist of Solutions at:
<a href="http://nibblesnbitsvideo.tk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://NibblesNbitsVideo.tk</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>2. Dust your fans, vents and components using a 1/4" paintbrush and a hose vacuum. Use compressed air for hard to reach places.
 Set a housefan to blow cold air into your case to expose an over heating issue.. If it works add more fans or replace defective ones.</span></p>
<p><span>3. A faulty power supply can cause STOP errors, random reboots, and black screen lockups. One way to test for that is to check
 the wattage sticker on your power supply and then calculate your need (Min. 350 for gaming)</span></p>
<p><span>4. Test your RAM using:

<p>Dear Johann Eva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Before, I answer your questions as best that I can, I want to address earlier problems that may have been due to registry issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I did the update to Windows 10 version 1709, I would get I message during shutdown that other users were on my computer when none were. More recently, my computer restarts after I use the shutdown button. I have checked my power settings; and they
 are set correctly. This problem appeared after installation of the April Critical Updates. Explanation and resolution of these problems has not been satisfactory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confess to using Advanced SystemCare 11.3 Registry Clean. I do not go in and personally edit the Registry myself. I have run
<strong>scannow&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth.
</span></strong><span>Both give a clean bill of health.</span></p>
<p>Before I send all the information regarding "<span>The password notification DLL DPPassFilter failed to load with error 126", I'd like to address the first error, Volmgr, in the Event Viewer log, figuring that errors may have
 a cumulative effect. I asked for help earlier on this and got no response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my system specifications:</p>

<p>Dear Johann Eva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can anticipate quite a bit of work here if this course of action is successful. My wife uses this computer. I have set up a true system Administrator Account and a guest account. I presume the process you suggest would have to be repeated for these additional
 accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I use the same passwords for these new accounts? I ask because these passwords are tied to our Microsoft Accounts. Or do I need to set up new Microsoft Accounts as well? Or how do I transfer the old Microsoft Accounts to the new user accounts I set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in copying personal files to a new account... This seems like a good opportunity for mistakes where things get lost. Are there straightforward instructions for doing this with certainty?</p>

<h2>            Can Windows XP backup utility be used to create full system image&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Windows Xp backup for new drive upgrade.</p>
<p>I want to get a new bigger internal hard drive.&nbsp; However the thought of trying to reinstall all my programs and settings have discouraged me in doing so. My Mac is great in that it allows me to back up my whole system with time machine on an external hard
 drive, and I can just put everything back even if I accidentally erase my entire machine.</p>
<p>Can Window xp backup wizard do the same?</p>
<p>Under the backup wizard tool there seems to be a selection that says "All information on this computer".&nbsp; So once I replace my old internal drive with the new and improved, can I just stick in my external drive into the USB port and reinstall everything
 as is?&nbsp; is this possible?</p>
<p>I realized with technical stuff you just cant assume anything and things just go wrong or you need something extra...</p>

Hi BlueFairy,</p>
<p>This is not the feature in Windows XP. However you may find this feature in Windows 7.<br />

            <p>I’m assuming you are talking about two separate accounts as the same account can’t be logged in on two consoles at the same time. Try running a network test to make sure you aren’t getting any NAT type errors on either of these consoles. You can do this by going to settings, then network, network settings, then press A on “Detailed network statistics”.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Joisephine 
<br />
<br />Where exactly are you downloading these folders from, is that from the cloud or some other source
<br />
<br />On the source of your folders, are those folders named correctly and when you download them , they are changing somehow to numbers?
<br />
<br />A screenshot of those folders with numbers on them would also help to understand the problem . .

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was wondering if it is possible to do voice chat with a friend that's playing xbox while your on the computer? Is this possible to do without having your friend quit what they're playing to chat with you?&nbsp;Since microsoft bought skype I thought they would
 have some way to talk to a friend that's playing xbox while your using skype on the computer to talk to them.</p>

<p>I've tried doing that with my friend but we wound up just using skype on two different computers while one of us played Xbox. Maybe they will add something like that in though in the future. that would be cool.</p>

<p>You can sort of do it but I don't think you will be able to do anything other than play a game on the PC. Simply install a Games For Windows Live game on your PC. Age Of Empires Online and Tinker are free. Log into it with your xbox live account. You can
 then see what friends are online and what they are doing. Also send message and of course you can talk to them via privet chat (not party chat).
</p>
<p>Am unsure if you can then simply minimize the PC game and carry on with what ever you are doing on your PC.</p>

<h2>            Media Streaming help&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Currently running a windows 10 machine with 2 internal drives. My secondary drive will be used to store all my media. I have joined my machine to the homegroup, shared all files, folders, and drives. I see the xbox one on the PC and can even play remotely.
 I see the computer on my xbox one using Media Player. I cannot access my files or see the secondary drive. The only way I can access my videos or media files is if they are collected on the primary on the default folder locations. Can anyone give some insite
 on what I need to setup or adjust?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>Near the top, find Organize -&gt; Manage Libraries -&gt; Video/Music/Pictures/etc.</p>
<p>In each one you need to add the location(s) where you store media (i.e. folders on your secondary drive).</p>
<p>Under the Stream menu find the option to allow streaming to devices. Maybe under "More streaming options?"</p>
<p>You'll see the xbox one hopefully and it should be allowed as a streaming device.
</p>
<p>It sounds like it already sees your PC so hopefully just setting up the libraries will solve your problem.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download and install Mozilla Firefox, or any higher version of windows&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Iam currently using the old version of Internet Explorer which is Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP. But most sites such as youtube don't support this browser anymore. So I constantly try to upgrade my browser to Mozzila or&nbsp; a higher version of Internet
 Explorer. But after every download is complete i keep recieving the same message from Microsoft before i am able to run it. The message tells me 'the publisher is unknown" and then after that the only thing it offers for me to do is close the program. I dont
 know how to fix this and i desperately want to start using better sites again. I cant use any of the messengers properly and not even Facebook is working well. Someone PLLLZZZ help!! :'(</p>
