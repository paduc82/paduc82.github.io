<h2>            Support Chat Window Does Not Initialize in IE</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As crazy as it sounds, for me to connect to a MS Support Chat session, I have to use Chrome (or any other browser than IE, I'm sure!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 2 with 8.1 Update 1 installed and when I use Desktop IE, I make sure I disable my popup blocker.&nbsp; When I click through the Support options then eventually click on "Start Chat", the Chat window opens but with the message "Chat not initialized"
 inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But even when I switch to Modern UI IE, which has no plugins, meaning that it is "clean," I get the exact same issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone ever seen this issue or have an idea as to what I could try to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try using the Developer Tools, Network capture tool to restate these symptoms in terms of host names and HTTP responses at least please.&nbsp;&nbsp; (F12, Ctrl-4, F5).</p>

    <title>Someone trying to hack my Gmail account by creating Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Someone trying to hack my Gmail account by creating Microsoft account using my Google account name</h2>
                    <p><br />
I think someone is trying to hack my Google account somehow by creating a Microsoft account using my Google email account name.&nbsp; Last week I received a 'Verify Your Email address' from Microsoft accounts.&nbsp; I thought is was superstitious because I did not think
 you could create a Microsoft account using a different sites email address - but apparently YOU CAN! :-(&nbsp; The email looked like this;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Microsoft account<br />
Verify your email address<br />
To finish setting up this Microsoft account, we just need to make sure this email address is yours.<br />
Verify &lt;my name&gt;@gmail.com<br />
If you didn't make this request, click here to cancel.<br />
Thanks,<br />
The Microsoft account team</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ignored it and did not do anything.&nbsp; I never clicked Verify.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then this morning on got three emails in a row from Microsoft Account Team</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Microsoft account password change - where they change their password.<br />
2) Microsoft account security info confirmation - where they added an alternate Gmail address &lt;my name&gt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; very similar to my primary Gmail address
<br />
3) Microsoft account security confirmation - where they renamed the account (below).</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Microsoft account security confirmation<br />
Your Microsoft account has been renamed. We just wanted to check with you that it's okay.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Old account name: &lt;my name&gt;@gmail.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; New account name: &lt;my name&gt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">If this is correct, you don't need to do anything.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">If this is incorrect, please follow these steps:<br />
1. Reset your password by going to <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/password/reset</a><br />
2. Rename your account by going to <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/</a></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Thanks,<br />
The Microsoft account team</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very concerning for a couple reasons.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. It appears someone was able to setup a new MICROSOFT account using my GOOGLE account name<br />
2. A week later it&nbsp; (without every verifying they controlled MY Gmail account - I never clicked Verify) it appears they were able to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - change their password<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - add a different but very similar alternate email address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - AND rename the account!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I be sure they are not somehow trying to backdoor into my Google account?</p>

            <p>I had the same, in fact I didn't notice the emails from MS (maybe I ignored them thinking they were spam or phishing).&nbsp; The fake account ran for a few years and seems to have spewed out a lot of spam.&nbsp; I even had an old friend block my emails (he messaged
 me to tell me about it) due to the spam.&nbsp; It only stopped when I realised this as a friend using Hotmail told me my name appears on Hotmail as Katie Lopez or something.&nbsp; I'm an English guy with a name nothing like that by the way.&nbsp; Anyway, it stopped because
 I went to Microsoft, logged in using the Forgot Password settings and set some tough password plus two-step verification.&nbsp; I also changed my Google login, of course.&nbsp; In fact the password was immediately (within a few minutes) reset by someone on the other
 side of the world (not sure how), so I had to go through the process a second time.&nbsp; After that I seem to be in control of this, though microsoft's security portal shows people trying to hack into the account a few times per day, almost always originating
 in the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm shocked at how Microsoft enabled someone to send emails looking like they were from my Gmail account without any input from me.</p>

            <p>I strongly encourage you to reset the password on your primary account <em>and</em> the secondary one as well - even if they are not yours, even especially if they are not yours. You should always reclaim any accounts that are linked to an existing account
 that you care about - even if they are accounts you don't want (like the Ashley Madison account someone thoughtfully opened using my email. No cheating for you, pal.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>. Accounts linked to your Gmail account might not be a problem - or someone might manage to convince someone else that they are you. If you control all accounts connected to it, that can't happen. If this causes the secondary account problems, too bad. They
 know darn well this isn't their account that they're using; they're just being either lazy, incompetent, or malicious, none of which deserve any consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get control of accounts using your Gmail address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the usual password reset process for your primary (Gmail) account at microsoft.com to ensure that you control it.</li><li>If a secondary account has been created, log out of your primary account and do a password reset for the "new" account as well.</li></ol>
<p>I was an early Gmail user and have a first-last@gmail address, so every clueless git who has the same name as me tries to use that and succeeds in creating an account. The original login to a Microsoft account doesn't require that the original mail account
 be accessible (I believe there's an "escape hatch" to enable the account if the primary login can't be used), so this is how the alternates get set up even if you don't acknowledge the account creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, enable 2-factor authentication for <em>both</em> accounts to ensure that you've locked both of them up tight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to me today with my actual Microsoft account and I immediately took the new account over. &nbsp;I've had this happen enough at this point to that I no longer care if I've inconvenienced people who can't be bothered to do things properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet deleted the one laptop on the account created today as this will break their Office 365 trial account. I am tempted, though, believe me.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem so did live chat with Microsoft help and found out that if a non-server email account is used to access any random Microsoft-based program (x-box, word, etc.) the account is created but there is no inbox or outbox since it is a non-Microsoft
 account. So either you used a Microsoft service with your gmail account and forgot about it or somebody used your gmail account to use a Microsoft service. They were not able to access any of your emails nor send any emails in your name.</p>

<p>I had the same issue today (received same emails on Gmail box). Someone created&nbsp;Microsoft account with my Gmail login, then changed the login by adding the number on the end. So now this new MS account is verified based on my Gmail&nbsp;account. I already take
 back control on my Gmail, but I cannot take control on this new MS account ( because it now refers to this Gmail&nbsp;account with added number). I already changed all passwords and set two-step ver. Is it possible to force MS to delete this account which was verified
 by fraud?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too had the above issue so I checked out your link. It isn't helpful because it isn't a tech support scam so we don't have any of the info MS asks for in the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened for us is even though MS is asking to verify the gmail account by sending an email with a link to verify it, it doesn't seem to matter. We don't click verify but yet the MS account is still created with the gmail account.</p>

                    <p>Is anyone seeing an issue with Outlook 2016, build 1705 build 8201.2025 where printing emails the Outlook field names:</p>
<ul>
<li>User name</li><li>From</li><li>Sent</li><li>To</li><li>CC</li><li>Subject</li><li>Attachment</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>are printing so small as to be unreadable. The values (the email address it is from, the sent time, etc) are fine, but you cannot tell what they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It even shows this in the print preview window&nbsp;<em>before</em> printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THis is not happening in version 1705, build 8117.1000 (fast ring), nor was it happening on the previous slow ring build. It is only happening on the most recent "current channel/slow ring" build released last week.</p>

            Hi S1dewinder,<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the fix will be in the next update version 16.0.8201.2075 currently scheduled for 6/5. Thanks for your time and waiting.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Nokia N97 WLAN problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Came to add my 2nd Wireless LAN connection into the destinations system. Already added one Wireless LAN (which is now priority 1 in the Internet destination). when I added a 2nd wireless LAN connection it added it to a new 'Uncategorized' destination which
 it created automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fine I thought, so I selected this destination, and then selected the access point, and used the 'move' command to move it over to the Internet destination. It then told me that it was going to delete the 'uncategorized' destination as it was no longer in
 use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely the new access point did not appear in the Internet destination. So I tried to re-add the WLAN, and now everytime I do so the 'settings' application crashes :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone managed to add 2 WLAN entries to the same destination yet or had this problem and knows how to work around it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I solved this problem by the way (there is a bug in the firmware). The wireless point did not intially have internet access, hence why it was put into a new uncategorized destination. The bug exists if you switch an access point (which it things doesn't
 have internet access) into the Internet destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only thing you can do to fix your phone then is the full reset using the # code.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Automatically forward or bcc a sent email to another address - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automatically forward or bcc a sent email to another address</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to figure out a way to automatically forward any sent mail to another email address in Outlook for Mac. &nbsp;I've tried creating a rule for all Outgoing mail to send to a specified email address, but it simply doesn't work. &nbsp;I'm wondering if I'm missing
 a step or if it's just a bug. &nbsp;I don't want the other email address to show up as a cc and I don't want to bcc my own email, it has to be a different email address.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi sdbyrd,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I mentioned,&nbsp;</span><span>outgoing rules are not&nbsp;</span><span>applicable for Exchange accounts, but for IMAP and POP accounts. So, it depends on what type of account you are using.&nbsp;</span>That
 you mentioned how to accomplish your requirement for exchange account, regarding this, you just can use cc or Bcc to meet your requirement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can use IMAP or POP to configure your Exchange account, but we don't recommend it since if you are using IMAP, the calendar and contacts won't sync between Exchange server and outlook client, and if you are using POP,&nbsp;all of the messages are
 downloaded from the server and saved in the current computer or device, and then you cannot access these emails with any other computer or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<p><span>Thanks,</span><br />

            its internet security 2015 but that's not the reason behind not being installed on this computer. As I said it is because of RunDLL and the antivirus has requirement of windows8. I can guess it supports KIS 2015

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for MAC version 15.14.2 still getting error &#34;connection to server failed or was dropped&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems to get email from the webserver of the company I work for. It always appears the message mentioned in title. The server uses SSL(995) to connect, it was working fine until the security update from September 15th. Do you know how can I
 fix this?</p>
<p>Have to mention that the server has an unsigned security certificate, it requested to accept it on the first time I configured it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help</p>
<p>

    <title>Keeping a Text Box Invisible until Hovering over a Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keeping a Text Box Invisible until Hovering over a Word</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to keep a text box INVISIBLE until the cursor hovers over a certain part of a paragraph? When the cursor points to the right place (in this case, a word that will be highlighted), the text box appears? Would I have to use SmartArt for this,
 or would configuring a regular text box work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first my plan was to insert a hyperlink. I wanted to use the Screentip function to give&nbsp;more about a word --&nbsp;hover over the word and get&nbsp;its defintion (in another language).&nbsp;But I learned one can't format Screentip text boxes.&nbsp;The frame is too small and
 too hard to read. But the idea of a hyperlink and a text box is what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somone told me there's a way to do the same thing with an ordinary&nbsp;text box, linking it to a word, but I can't figure out how to HIDE the box UNTIL I put the cursor over a word. I want to anchor the box to&nbsp;the word but have it remain invisible UNTIL one
 hovers the cusor near it. The great thing about text boxes is they're formattable -- you can make them big and colorful. But I don't want them visible until asked for. I&nbsp;suppose there's a fancy way to create a hyperlink to a "frame," keeping the frames invisible.
 But I'm not very technical, I need something rather simple. It would be simplest to "hide" a text box until the cursor hovers in the right place!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Megan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in this thread and we are glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To achieve your goal that let some teachers from math department assign some assignments to your classes, please add them into your class notebook to do that. You can check this article to do so:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-or-remove-co-teachers-in-class-notebook-for-onenote-fdcb870b-49a7-4a14-9ea6-d817f88026f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add
 or remove co-teachers in Class Notebook for OneNote</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not your scenario, please share with me more info about that:</p>
<p>1. The detailed version number of your OS(Click Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK) and Office(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information).</p>
<p>2. Detailed steps about your goal.</p>
<p>

    <title>Macro or code to copy data in a column to the last row of data in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greendriver lv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro or code to copy data in a column to the last row of data in adjacent columns</h2>
                    
<p>I paste a variable number of rows of data in columns C:E in a report.&nbsp; In column B, I have a formula that I need to appear in every row for the pasted C:E data.&nbsp; Right now, I just drag it down but that's a pain with huge quantities of cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to the problem (otherwise I'd just double-click the cell to auto-fill), Column C does not consistently have data in it, while D:E do.&nbsp; I need the formula in B to appear even in those rows where C is blank.</p>
<p>So, can I code a macro to copy/paste a formula to the very last occupied row of data even when there's blank cells adjacent?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

 couldn't&nbsp;re-use it so apparently&nbsp;MS agreed that it&nbsp;was in fact my password.&nbsp; So why did I have to reset?&nbsp; &nbsp;As I said, this has happened three times and is a big pain.&nbsp; Please don't tell me I must be using the wrong password.&nbsp; I keep good notes.</p>

<p>Thanks, but what (if anything) did you do to fix my problem, and what caused it in the first place.&nbsp; And do you still want me to reset my password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, after getting your first message I logged in but was not required to reset the password as on previous attempts so I didn't do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm hoping that the problem does not recur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I got to the login MS asked which account I wanted to use, business or personal, which confused me because I don't have a business MS account -- and don't have any need for one.</p>

<p>No need to reset the password if you're not experiencing an issue with login.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite Symbian Belle Refresh being out for quite a while, I cannot seem to download it. My phone says the current version (111.030.0609) is the most recent version. Eventhough the nokia website says there should be a new version (<strong>111.040.1511</strong>)&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/962C575E-95C5-4A79-9619-BDED589B0B86">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Software-Updates/Nokia-Belle-Refresh-update-just-launched/td-p/1534746</a>
 and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/nl-nl/support/product/e7-00/." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/nl-nl/support/product/e7-00/.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem via Nokia Suite, it also says I have the latest version. (111.030.0609)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know why?</p>

<p>As this device 059F3W6: RM-626 Vodafone_NL_DG_V1 then I doubt very much whether Vodafone has any interest in supporting device that it no longer markets unfortunately. Whilst Nokia can offer networks updated firmware it is up to the network whether they
 decide to test it and sanction it's release, which obviously utilises resources for little commercial return.</p>

            <p>My logic is, you put the SD card and you get error. You remove the SD card and you don't get the error.</p>

<p>To me, it clearly looks like an issue with a SD card. If you insist it is not, obviously, it is your choice man :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;update n this: as hotmail was my primary account on windows phone, I had to rebuild the phone. Not good at all from a user point of view. I wonder about the specific reasons for NOT having any way out but resetting the phone completely - in case the primary
 account is not working on a specific device anymore.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Android Reply CC Recipient missing</h2>
                    <p>Dear Outlook for Android Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptom:</p>
<p>On Outlook for Android, When I reply to an email which has both TO and CC recipients, when I click Edit Recipient, all recipient in TO is still there, but all recipient in CC is deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround i now have to manually type recipient in cc manually, before sending the message out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help to fix this bug soon, will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook version, 3.0.8</p>
<p>Abdroid version 8.0.0</p>

            Hello Prapan,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />This is a strange issue, this should happen. I also have android and outlook app but mine is working fine. could you please try to remove the app and install it again, then configure your account again?
<br />
<br />if, you have another device, with outlook app installed, please check if, you reproduce the issue on other hand held device to isolate if, the issue is only mobile app
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<p>What is your outlook version? If not same as mine 3.0.8 which is just released on Feb 1st 2019. Then you are not having comparable app version, please upgrade, then you will be in the same boat as mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way i have tried on my another android device, got same problem.</p>

<p>Now i found more detail on the symptom. The email recipient in CC is, in the backend still exist. They are just not visible in user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i found is, when i manually typed the recipient in cc, after sent email out i check email in sent item, i found that it show duplicate recipient in cc.</p>

<p>I also confirm that this is a problem of a recent update of Android app, most probably.&nbsp; Tested with Android phones of 3 users, all of them experiencing the same issue, even if using the other email account from a different server.&nbsp; Apple IOS app works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As explained, when you hit 'Reply All', the recipients that were cc'ed in the original email, do not show in the user interface but they do get the email but when you check the 'Sent' folder it shows the recipients that were not visible in the user interface.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand Excel chart is not updating the newly added data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you with Excel chart update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method: 1</b></p>
<p>Click on the chart, once you find the source file information you can try to extend the&nbsp;blue line by draging it using the mouse which would show the weeks data on the PowerPoint chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method: 2</b></p>
<p>You may refer the section â€˜Change the cell range that a chart is based onâ€™ and check if it helps:</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Chart are normally not dynamic as you enter data, unless you did look for that solution earlier.<br />

<h2>            Key Assignments</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to automate or otherwise automatically assign macros/commands/styles to specific keys?</p>
<p>I regularly use about 30 such assignments, and when "repair" is needed, the assignments are commonly erased. Setting each assignment individually is a tedious process.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be most welcome.</p>

            <p>You can write a macro that contains KeyBindings.Add statements, one for each of the shortcuts you want. Each statement associates a shortcut key combination with a built-in command, a macro, or another kind of action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following example is reproduced from&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/pwgerman/49a8f1a9a69c6b0d86eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gist.github.com/pwgerman/49a8f1a9a69c6b0d86eb</a>. You'll have to replace the shortcuts (in the BuildKeyCode
 function calls) and the commands with your items.</p>
