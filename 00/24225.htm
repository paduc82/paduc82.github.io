<h2>            Excel is crashing using ADO object</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an excel file that is containing a macro to update some sheets of the workbook using another excel file and a connection to a old database file in dBase IV (by ODBC). The connection to the database is working perfectly without any issue. But the
 problem begins when trying to execute the command :</p>
<p>Set cmdplanning = New ADODB.Command</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>cmdplanning.Execute</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel is crashing completly and gives that message </p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Faulting application name: EXCEL.EXE, version: 14.0.6126.5003, time stamp: 0x505b0834</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is strange is that the macro sometimes run perfectly and sometimes not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help me ?</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;think I found the solution. It may be to change the "Collating Sequence" in the options of the ODBC link from "ASCII" to "International".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In test, it's working, I'll see tomorrow if it's working on end users' computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm sorry I take so long to confirm, but the test on end users' computers was postponed.</p>
<p>It's working on their computers as well. So this is the solution for my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 CAN&#39;T Connect to 2 Different Exchange Servers running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryceusr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 CAN&#39;T Connect to 2 Different Exchange Servers running Exchange 2010&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So I own a few different companies and have a bunch of exchange email accounts running on different servers. All my servers are running Exchange 2010. My computers are all running Windows 7 and Office 2010. I upgraded from Office 2007 to Office 2010 because
 everywhere I looked online (&lt;joke&gt; so I didn't waste my money &lt;/joke&gt;) made it seem so simple to add multiple exchange accounts and then have all of them display in one profile to easily access all your mail, contacts, calendars, tasks, etc in one place.</p>
<p>So here's the deal: I can add multiple Exchange accounts from 1 server without a problem. I can also add Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail accounts as well without a problem (all of which can be done just as easily with 2007). All of these accounts show up just like
 all the screen shots and tutorials online when you search for multiple email accounts in Outlook 2010. The problem is that I when I go through and add an exchange account from a different server than my first exchange account/server, it shows up in File&gt;Info&gt;Account
 Information as being added and configured/connecting/etc; but the mailbox, calendar, contacts, tasks, etc do NOT show up for my 2nd Exchange server account. If I make my 2nd Exchange account/server the default, then it messes up the data file for my original
 exchange account on my 1st Excahnge account/server.</p>
<p>There is NOTHING anywhere online for this. I have looked at over 50 tutorials, forums, etc in the last 2 days with NOT success whatsoever.</p>
<p>Any ideas on this? Am I the only one who needs to sync multiple email exchange accounts from more than one server??? Isn't this what Microsoft marketed as being "one of the best new features of Outlook 2010"??? (along with the "cool ribbons")...</p>
<p>Now it looks like I've wasted a few hundred bucks and the last 2 days, just to downgrade back to Office 2007.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>All right, so I figured it out all on my own. I GOT IT TO WORK!!!! It is actually possible to sync multiple Exchange Accounts on the same server, or multiple servers. But apparently
 it is </span><strong><span>NOT</span></strong><span> possible to sync with multiple Exchange Accounts with
 the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>SAME NAME&nbsp;IN YOUR&nbsp;Exchange Profile</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>(set
 up by the admin on the Exchange Server WHEN IT WAS CREATED). Here is what the problem was:</span></p>
<p><span>For ease of following this for anyone else who may have this problem, here is the way&nbsp;my accounts were&nbsp;before (obviously not with my real information):</span></p>
<p><span>Exchange Server #1:<br />
Domain: mail.ExchangeServer1.com<br />
Exchange Profile Name: </span><strong><span>John H Doe</span></strong><span><br />
Email <span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><br />
<br />
Exchange Server #2:<br />
Domain: mail.ExchangeServer2.com<br />
Exchange Profile Name: </span><strong><span>John H Doe</span></strong><span><br />
Email: <span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></p>
<p><span>It was getting messed up because Outlook 2010 apparently tracks the Exchange Email Account by the "hard coded" account name in the User Profile (which is set up by the admin, in
 this case me, AT THE TIME the Exchange User/Mailbox is set up. Despite changing every possible field that has your name in it, you CAN NOT change this once it is created on the Exchange Server, believe me, I tried everything.</span></p>
<p><span>So I picked the smaller of my two email accounts (in this case it was<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>),
 and backed up EVERYTHING locally on my machine (I just created folders to drag the emails into, then exported all the calendar, contacts, tasks, etc). Then I logged on to Exchange Server #2 and DELETED that Exchange Account (Start&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server
 2010&gt;Exchange Management Console)&nbsp;AND the USER account (Start&gt;Administrative Tools&gt;Server Manager). Depending on your settings, you may not find the User Account after you delete it from the Exchange Server, so if you don‚Äôt see it in the Server Manager after,
 don‚Äôt worry about it.</span></p>
<p><span>After I deleted the Exchange Account/User Account, I went back to my Exchange Management Console and ‚Äúre-created‚Äù my Exchange Account<em>again</em> with the following settings
 (notice it is identical to the one above except I just have my first initial and no middle initial):</span></p>
<p><span>Exchange Server #2:<br />
Domain: mail.ExchangeServer2.com<br />
Profile Name: </span><strong><span>J Doe</span></strong><span><br />
Email: <span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once it was set up on my Exchange Server, I then changed my name right back to John Doe (because J Doe is hardcoded just as a ‚Äúinternal reference by Microsoft‚Äù).</span></p>
<p><span>I went back to my computer, deleted my existing ‚ÄúMail Profile‚Äù (Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Mail&gt;Show Profiles&gt;Remove). Once I had a clean slate, I created a ‚ÄúNew Profile‚Äù and added all
 my mailboxes in there. </span></p>
<p><span>I started Outlook on my local computer, logged on, and all my emails, contacts, tasks, calendar, etc pulled down from Exchange Server #1. I then ‚Äúimported‚Äù all my contacts, calendar
 and tasks from my CSV files on my local computer for my ‚Äúnew‚Äù/Exchange Server #2 email account. I just dragged the emails back into the folders in my email and they all synced back to my Exchange Server #2. So everything is back the way it was before ‚Äúexactly‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>It now displays, syncs, and sends/receives with my Exchange Server #1 (all my various email accounts added), my Exchange Server #2 (all my various email accounts added), my Gmail,
 my Yahoo Mail and my Hotmail.</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to change your ‚Äúdisplay name‚Äù on the Exchange Server, and all that stuff in your profile, so it has all the information you actually want to show at this point. It
 can even be IDENTICAL to your previous settings and not mess it up because the hard coded ‚Äúprofile name‚Äù can‚Äôt be changed.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download audio files since last update.</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to share audio files the way we did before this version?</p>
<p>Or are these files saved somewhere in a folder? There's no download button and audio files like WAV or MP3 doesn¬¥t appear on the Downloads folder. I can only play them and "Like" them, which is useless, Skype is supposed to be a useful tool for communication
 and sharing. If I want to "Like" something then I use Facebook, not Skype.</p>

    <title>Why no Format Painter keyboard shortcut in Powerpoint for Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why no Format Painter keyboard shortcut in Powerpoint for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook / Word / Excel for Mac all have the same keyboard shortcut for copy and pasting format (Cmd+Shift+C and Cmd+Shift+V).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Powerpoint for Mac not have this shortcut?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot think of a reason why it wouldn't be present other than simply being overlooked, as the format painter functionality is there in the app and other other Office apps have this. The inability to quickly copy and paste formats to ensure consistency
 is a huge drain on productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone from MSFT please explain why Cmd+Shift+C and Cmd+Shift+V to copy/paste formats is not in Powerpoint for Mac? I have been asking in every available channel for over a year now and no response!</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, the Format Painter keyboard shortcut (Command+Shift+C and Command+Shift+V) is not available in PowerPoint 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is a good idea,</p>
<p>Users can use the keyboard shortcut to save time instead of selecting content then clicking the button to do the format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you post this good idea to <a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288925-powerpoint-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The keystrokes work for copy/paste formatting of <em>Shapes</em> but not for selected text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for <em>why</em> it hasn't been implemented: Nobody here (or any public forum) can answer questions of that nature. Developers spend virtually no time in such venues &amp; more rarely do they provide any explanations for software design. Anyone other than

<p>Not a criticism, but part of the problem with UserVoice is that many folks don't bother to search &amp; vote for existing suggestions. Instead they jump right in with a new posting. As a result there may be 20 similar suggestions/requests which water down the
 impact &amp; further cause votes to be scattered across the multiple postings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As John indicated, that venue does work, it is monitored, &amp; Office 2016 is loaded with results from those postings even if there is no direct response.</p>

            Just to note that I searched and voted for every single suggestion on this topic. I really would just like a comment from MSFT on the issue and so I am trying every available approach. May not sound like a big deal but when you spend almost all your working
 time merging PPT files and have to adjust the formatting for consistency, not having this shortcut (which used to be present in the 2011 version, and which is present in every other Office for Mac app) gets real old real fast.&nbsp;

    <title>Settings and Control Panel - a confusing combination - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> Êû‰êison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Settings and Control Panel - a confusing combination</h2>
                    <p>"Settings" and Control Panel are still in Windows 10 which makes one or the other redundant although they serve the same purpose of configuring the settings of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Settings" has got some items that you can find in Control Panel. There are items that you can only find in "Settings" or in the Control Panel and this makes it so confusing. Sometimes, it's very frustrating when we can't find all you need in one place.
 I think this is one of the factors why people don't like the previous Windows version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have we not learned anything from that mistake?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users don't need to remember which place to go if Windows has only one place for all of the configurations.

<h2>            Office 2010 wont accept product key</h2>
                    I am working for an IT Company that is dealing with an end user. Their trail period ended and they need to activate Office. They are getting the error (Unlicensed Product) at the top of every Office 2010 program which renders them unable to use them. I
 went into Control Panel&gt;Microsoft Office 2010&gt;Change&gt;Entered product key. It said that it was valid. It loaded through the whole process and said to restart any Office programs for it it complete. I did that and got the same error at the top. I have tried
 this multiple times with whole computer restarts in between. This is all on an XP machine.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome Microsoft Office Community and thank you for posting your query.<br />
<br />
I would require additional information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) Which edition of Office suite are you working on?<br />
2) Is this issue experienced on multiple computers?<br />
3) Did you try activating the Office suite? If no refer to the following article for instructions on how to activate volume edition of Office 2010 and verify the result:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/activate-volume-editions-of-office-HA010381834.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/outlook-help/activate-volume-editions-of-office-HA010381834.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If the issue is experienced on a single computer, you may uninstall and re-install the Office suite with full version product key and verify the result.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>For issues related Office Volume Activation, you may also post your query in the following TechNet forum for better suggestion:</span><br />

            1) It is Office 2010 Professional Plus.<br />
2) I have not tried it on multiple computers because I need it on this specific computer.<br />
3) There is no MAK Key, this is a single version of Office with one product key.<br />
<br />
Would you be able to provide me with a correct link to download Office 2010 Professional Plus and let me input the Product Key that way?<br />
<br />

This is the screen that I am able to get to after I input the product key. Then it states that it was successful and that I need to restart any open Office programs that I have for it to complete. I do that and still have the same error of unlicensed product.<br />

<h2>            Prevent Win 10 build 10166 from auto updating graphics driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia graphics driver 353.30 isn't working properly&nbsp;on my system. Version 352.84 is working fine but Win10 (10166) keeps updating to the newer version. How can I prevent Win10 from updating the driver?
</p>
<p>THX!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's important, here my problem with the driver:</p>
<p>With version 353.30 adjusting desktop size and position while in Full HD 1920x1080 over HDMI isn't possible anymore. When trying to adjust, the system changes the res to 1440x900. The problem occurs with a connection via HDMI to a Samsung TV which needs
 adjustment, otherwise are parts of the desktop missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>Felix</p>

            <p>OK, I did a little more digging and found a note on how to do&nbsp;create reverse&nbsp;using compatibility mode in 2010:</p>
<p><span>This is done by combining features that are are available in the different Versions of word 97-2003 vs 2007 vs 2010. In 2010, the ‚ÄúFlip Horizontal‚Äù
 does not appear to work </span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>File tab / Options command / Save option / Save Files in this format: 97-2003 or 2007, OK to save the change. In the window title bar, you will see&nbsp;the new default
 name , ie&nbsp;"Document7 [Compatibility Mode]"</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>(still in Word 2010) Insert tab / Text group / WordArt drop down. Notice that it shows the Word 2003 (or 2007)&nbsp;WordArt Styles&nbsp;options</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>select any WordArt Style formatting option
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert your text
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>with focus still on the WordArt: WordArt Tools Format conditional tab / Arrange group / Rotate ddl / Flip horizontal</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Your text is now backwards
</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the WordArt, copy to clipboard
</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Paste into your 2010 formatted document
</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the WordArt, you can select the "Edit Text" option (in your 2010 formatted doc) and change the text!</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the WordArt object and the WordArt Tools Format contextual tab. You will notice that only the 97-2003 WordArt Styles are still available BUT you
 also have a bunch of the 2010 effects also, such as Shadow Effect, 3-D Effects</span></p>
<p><span>THIS IS SO
</span><b><span>COOL</span></b><span>!!!</span><span> I didn‚Äôt realize we had this much flexibility.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Word 2010 to print a &#35;10 envelope on my Epson NS530 printer</h2>
                    Using a #10 envelope I am forced to load it into the paper tray in the center of the tray, where the guides close in on the envelope.&nbsp; When the printer prints however, it prints the addresses (return &amp; send to) as though it was printing on a full sheet
 of paper, missing virtually all of the envelope.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have followed the instructions listed for envelope printing, but the issue remains. I see no settings that I think might resolve the problem ... perhaps someone can help.<br />

            Thanks again ... perhaps this approach would have worked, but I'm not too experienced with messing around with some of the internal / driver?? files so I was ready to give it a try, but then thought of one other approach.&nbsp; The printer can be operated in
 either a USB connected or wireless fashion and I found at times the wireless operation was sometimes a bit slow so I wound up connecting via the USB port for more responsiveness.&nbsp; I wondered if I tried the wireless mode if things would change so I just ran
 the envelope through again (in the wireless mode) and SUCCESS!!!<br />
Thanks again, really, but as a relative novice I think I'll avoid the file changing ... and the possibility of screwing things up and make a note to use this alternative connect method.

<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We understand your frustraion of receiving junk emails.&nbsp; Please be informed that we are aware that&nbsp;most of the&nbsp;users&nbsp;are&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;this and our Product Engineers are working a fix on it.&nbsp; In the meantime, to block these people from sending any messages
 to you, you can modify your block sender's list or make a rule that all of the messages that come from this sender be automatically deleted.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>You can modify your <b>Block Senders List</b> settings.</span></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Sign into your account .</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Click on the <b>Gear Icon </b>(located on the upper right corner of your screen, besides your namen) then
<b>More mail settings</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>From the&nbsp;Outlook Options screen under the category ‚Äú<b>Preventing junk email‚Äù</b>, click
<b>Safe and blocked senders</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Click <b>Blocked senders</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>In the Blocked senders list, add the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the ‚Äú@‚Äù sign, such as hotmail.com) that you now want to block mail from.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>You can also Create a rule to permanently delete those messages:</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Sign into your account .</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><span>Click on the <b>Gear Icon </b>(located on the upper right corner of your screen, besides your namen) then
<b>More mail settings</b>.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span>From the&nbsp;Outlook Options screen under the category <b>Customizing Outlook</b>. Choose
<span><strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><font><font color="#000000">4. </font>Click <strong><span>New</span></strong> button.
</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><font>5. Under Step 1: Which messages do you want this rule to apply to?, on the first box with dropdown list, select<strong><span>Sender's address
</span></strong>and on the second box with dropdown list, select<strong><span>is.</span></strong>
</font></span></p>
<p><font><span>6. </span><span>On the third box, type sender's email address.<strong><span>
</span></strong>You may select any option that you want to use in first, second and third box depending on your preference.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span>7. </span></font><span><font>Under Step 2: What action do you want to apply?, select
<strong><span>Delete these messages.</span></strong></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><span>8<strong>. </strong></span></font></span><span><font>Click on
<strong><span>Save </span></strong>button. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span><span>I hope these helps.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you."</span></p>

<h2>            Access 2007, one column to multiple column</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I have a database with 3 tables, staff, courses and students. one column in staff (staff ID) needs to be linked to 3 columns in the courses table (staff 1 ID, staff 2 ID and staff 3 ID). however when entering data into the courses table from the staff
 form (via the + icon at the left of the table) it enter the same staff ID into all 3 columns, I need it to be entered only into 1, I also need all 3 staff ID columns to link to the relevant staff member.</div>
<div>How do I do this? Please help this is part of my final uni assignment and I'm really new to access, I usually use SQL but we have to use access for this module.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <blockquote>.......therefore by the process of normalisation we end up with staff 1, staff 2 and staff 3 columns on the courses table</blockquote>
<br />
Quite the opposite I'm afraid; First Normal Form (1NF) requires that you store only one value of each attribute in each row.&nbsp; Sometimes this is misinterpreted as meaning more than one value in a single column in each row; that's not the case, storing values
 in multiple columns representing multiple instances of the same attribute is barred.&nbsp; The formal definition is:<br />
<br />
First Normal Form: <i>A relvar is in 1NF if and only if, in every legal value of that relvar, every tuple contains exactly one value for each attribute.</i><br />
<br />
Loosely speaking, in the language of the relational model, a <i>relvar </i>(relation variable) equates to a table, a
<i>tuple </i>to a row (record) and an <i>attribute </i>to a column (field). <br />
<br />
The many-to-many relationship type between course and staff is modelled by a table which resolves the relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; So the tables, in outline, are:<br />
<br />
Staff<br />
....StaffID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
Courses<br />
....CourseID (PK)<br />
....CourseName<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
and to model the relationship type<br />
<br />
StaffCourses<br />
....StaffID (FK)<br />
....CourseID (FK)<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
The last table might have other columns representing attributes of a staff member's relationship with a course, e.g. each staff member could have different date ranges in StartDate and EndDate columns, representing when they teach the course.<br />
<br />
Similarly there is a many-to-many relationship type between students and courses, so the tables are:<br />
<br />
Students<br />
....StudentID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
and to model the relationship type with courses:<br />
<br />
StudentCourses<br />
....StudentID (FK)<br />
....CourseID (FK)<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
However, this assumes that each student registered for a course can be taught by each member of staff who teaches the course.&nbsp; It's possible a student may be taught by only one or two of the staff in question, in which case the table would be:<br />
<br />
StudentCourses<br />
....StudentID (FK)<br />
....CourseID (FK)<br />
....StaffID (FK)<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
In the last scenario the table is modelling a ternary (3-way) relationship type rather than a binary (2-way) relationship type.<br />
<br />
For data entry in each case use a form in single form view with a subform in continuous forms view.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this sort of many-to-many relationship type as SudentCourses.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo shows various ways of representing this in a form, but in your case use the conventional form/subform example as your model.&nbsp; My demo does not include staff, but you'd do the same for courses, using a courses form with a staff subform based
 on the StaffCourses table within it.<br />

    <title>Excel having phantom cell from another excel sheet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel having phantom cell from another excel sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a .xlsb excel file, whenever we try to edit the excel worksheet there will be phantom cells at the bottom of the excel sheet. After going to another excel sheet and going back to the original one that we are working on the phantom cell will disappear.
 We&nbsp;have tested the excel sheet on several&nbsp;window 8&nbsp;laptop with excel 2013 but the issue occurred on all the laptop. When we tried it on a window 7&nbsp;laptop with excel 2007 the issue did not appear. I have attached the screenshots at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I check if this is a known bug for excel 2013 and also if there is any way to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! :)</p>

<p>The excel file contains alot of worksheets and formulas in it. Does this means that i will need to convert all the worksheet in it into word document first then convert them into word 2016 mode and copy it back to the excel file?</p>

</p><p>Sorry instead of Word I wanted to mention Excel,&nbsp;you can convert Excel files the same way as Word. Open Excel file and follow&nbsp;the&nbsp;steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>File</strong> tab. </li><li>Do one of the following:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>To convert the document without saving a copy, click <strong>Info</strong>, and then click
<strong>Convert</strong>.</li><li>To create a new copy of the document in Excel 2016 mode, click <strong>Save As</strong> and then choose the location and the folder where you want to save the new copy. Type a new name for the document in the
<strong>File name</strong> box, and click <strong>Word Document</strong> in the <strong>
Save as type</strong> list. Make sure the box next to <strong>Maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word</strong> is unchecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> cruickshs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Radio in Offline Mode &#40;E71&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Any had any success with using radio in offline mode?<br />
<br />
States network connection unavailable and gives no option.<br />
<br />
I don't want to use the visual radio, just the ordinary FM radio. Incidentally, no RDS, although spec indicates it supports RDS.<br />
<br />
Is there an alternative radio application which does not require network connection?<br />
<br />
Regards,
                </div>

            Hi<br />
<br />
The FM radio will be unable to work in offline mode, since the phone switches off all the antennae in the phone. This includes the 2G and 3G antennae, WLAN, bluetooth and the radio.<br />
<br />
I guess this is to prevent RF interference, especially when flying, seeing that offline mode is usually labeled "Flight mode" on S40 Nokias.

<p>It works !!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to have a Nokia Xpress Music 5800, which would allow me to listen to FM radio both online and offline. Whenever I switched to offline mode while listening to the radio, the system would ask me if I want to keep listening to the radio in offline mode.
 I would choose yes, and the radio would keep playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have a Nokia E71-1, although the user manual says it's possible to listen to the FM radio in offline mode, I don't seem to be able to make it work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody has any idea? I would rather avoid installing additional apps such as the profile scheduler, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Marlysee</p>

<p>Hello, I am frustrated by this 'feature'. There are no technical reasons why it has been imlemented, as radio on other phones is usuable in offline mode. The issue is in software, with the Visual Radio, and could easily be changed in a firmware update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have experimented and not been able to circumvent this feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet radio works, but requires a wifi signal. Radio would be really useful sometimes, in locations where offline mode is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Agreed - the sort of information needed is e.g. what steps have you tried so far? For example have you set up media streaming in wmp ? (top left next to 'organize') - this should take you to Control Panel as in the screenshot below. Inset is the 'Cast to...'
 command that you should then see in WMP (in this case showing my Marantz). We need to know what to look for. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>The relevant information is that after some email exchanges with Sonos (the maker of my WiFi speaker) they have confirmed that their speaker canNOT be used to reproduce the output of the sound card-- it can only stream certain kinds of media, such as songs
 stored as MP3 files on my disk, or music from services like Spotify. &nbsp;So knowledge of Windows is, unfortunately, not enough...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have returned the speaker to its maker.</p>
<p>As an aside-- Before I read your response I had visited the same menus you indicated should be helpful in accomplishing it, but it failed. &nbsp;Perhaps your Marantz is a more sensible device than the Sonos Play:5, which only cost me $650, after all... ;-)</p>

            <p>The Marantz is a streaming amp so it covers all bases... CD - usb sticks - streaming - airplay, and a direct link to Spotify (although I find streaming 'Spotify' via Airplay much simpler) I even have my old vinyl and cassettes playable through its Aux input!
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;also have a TDK 'bluetooth' speaker which cost the princely sum of ¬£20 (about 30$ then...) and it sounds perfectly good for streaming radio programs or background music to the next room. It's just a case of finding what suits your needs, so it sounds like
 ditching the Sonos was a good choice. - Best, Ric.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 on Mac Tasks pane is empty</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I have been using Outlook 365 on my mac for the past year with an Exchange Email account with no issues. Recently, I performed a SSD upgrade on my Mac and after migrating and re-syncing all of my data and apps I noticed that Outlook has returned
 with Tasks not working. I have tried and noticed the following things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If I create a task (with or without a reminder/ due date set) the task appears synced to my Reminders App. The reminder works and alerts me through Outlook of the event, but the event does not appear in Outlook Tasks (this pertains to an event being created
 through Outlook).</p>
<p>- If I flag an email it no longer appears in my Tasks Pane. I have checked and unchecked the "Flagged Items" box.
</p>
<p>- I have taken my account off line and back online with no change.</p>
<p>- I have deleted and re-linked my Exchange account with no change.</p>
<p>- I have searched through all of the settings in Outlook and have found nothing that indicated a setting had been turned off.
</p>
<p>- I created a new List in my Reminders App and the list appeared in Outlook Tasks, but nothing I added to the list appeared.
</p>
<p>- All of the similar posts I see online about this issue either pertain to an older version of Outlook in which the menus and options don't align with my version or they pertain to Windows in which the menus and options don't align with mine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seems that the issue has little to nothing to do with syncing to Apple and that it is internal to Outlook itself. Does anyone have experience with this issue on Outlook 365 on Mac that can assist?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tested on Outlook for Mac 16.25 (19051201), which is the latest update for Outlook for Mac, but I have no such issue as you. Based on your scenario, I'd like to confirm whether your Outlook for Mac is up to date, if not, please update it for better
 using experience. Click <strong>Help &gt; Check For Updates</strong> in the top menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, from your scenario, the profile might be corrupted, I recommend you can also try to create a new profile for work, for detailed steps, please follow below:</p>
<p>1. From <strong>Finder</strong> tab, select to open <strong>Applications</strong> folder.</p>
<p>2. Ctrl+Click or right-click Microsoft Outlook and select <strong>Show Package Contents</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Open <strong>Contents &gt; Shared Support</strong> and launch <strong>Outlook Profile Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Select <strong>create a new profile</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order to avoid data loss, please don't delete the previous profile.</p>

<h2>            W10 does not recognise USB WiFi on start up and crashes on scan</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running W! build 14316rs1-release160402-2217</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this release I had problems with W10 disconnecting my Wi-Fi adaptor. It is a Netgear WNDA3100v2 with software version 2.2.0.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with this version it does not recognise it at all on start up at all. I Have to unplug the adaptor (I get the disconnect sound so I know it is being seen by windows) and replace it when it then recognises it straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This version also crashes with error Fault in non paged area: Eraserutilrebootdrv.sys whenever I try to scan with Norton IS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

Have you checked with &nbsp;Netgear&nbsp; for a updated drive, also have you tried removing Norton and see what happens as we have been advised about using 3rd party Virus/Malware on BETA test software.

            Driver 2.2.0.5 supports Windows 10. Try uninstalling the drivers then re-installing to see if that fixes the problem.

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very first thing you should do is uninstalling Norton AV. Running 3rd party AV software is more or less in-compatible with the Fast Ring Insider builds. There is nothing wrong with Norton AV but all good AV's are by their very nature very system intrusive.
 These bits are hot of the press and you simply cannot expect Norton to keep up with it.</p>

            <p>When I upgraded to Windows 10 on my first computer none of my desktop files returned plus all of the music I had loaded on itunes was gone. &nbsp;After about a week the desktop and music files magically returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded my 2nd computer I had a very difficult time getting my wifi to work. &nbsp;After numerous phone calls and a great amount of effort I finally got it to work. &nbsp;Then after about a week Windows 10 no longer would recognize my wifi and would not display
 any wifi's in the area. &nbsp;I spent a considerable amount of time trying to get things back but finally gave up in disgust. &nbsp;I recovered Windows 7 and everything worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have Windows 10 on my other computer but I haven't found anything on Windows 10 that I really want. &nbsp;I use my computers for business and I can't afford the down time trying to figure things out. &nbsp;I'm very happy with windows 7.</p>

            <p>Good to hear those pesky neighbors can be of some help sometimes |--). However I suspect they are also the problem. You might try tweaking your Wifi-router to transmit on a different channel. The trouble you describe is often caused by one or more of your
 neighbors transmitting on 'your' channel, causing W10 to become 'confused' at times. There is alas no good way of selecting the right channel. Just select a different channel and give it plenty of time to see whether this solves the issue</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have unistalled the Wi-Fi and re-installed. Problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled NIS but the pc will not let me turn on Defender. I have tried via All Settings -Security- turn on defender box but nothing happens. I have also tried via control panel but get told defender is turned off via group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have put back Norton as at least it is giving some protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BTW I have W10 on my work pcs as well but not on insider. They all work fine but thanks for the rant anyway)</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think&nbsp;that it is better to forego 3rd party AV in fast ring preview builds. But since you can't get WD to run, you're right in turning it back on again. As for your USB-Wifi stick not working, have you checked the manufacturers site for updated drivers?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the Device Manager? Does it show it at all? If so, what does it say about it's status?</p>
<p>When you say you re-installed it, does that mean you used a CD that came with the stick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if you post the make and model some other Insider can at least tell you whether it should work or not..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I check device manager it shows and identifies the Netgear device but with a yellow warning sign.&nbsp; It shows working after I remove and replace the stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think my neighbour's Wi-Fi or my channel makes any difference as it does not get as far as connecting with my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I un-installed and re-installed using the latest installer and drivers from the Netgear web site</p>

<p>Apologies for that, should have checked before I posted that. My (weak) excuse is that I am following many threads and I simply don't always remember all the details (old brains).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are running the latest drivers and furthermore, the <a href="http://www.netgear.com/support/product/WNDA3100v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Netgear support page</a> does say it should work under W10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Agreed, it's not a Wifi setup problem as the Device Manager shows the warning sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only suggest you post the question in the Netgear community (open the site above, click Download and you will see a 'Ask the community' button). But let us not forget that this is beta software you are running and not all problems can be solved. Hopefully
 a next flight will solve it.</p>
