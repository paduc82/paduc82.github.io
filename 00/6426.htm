<h2>            Microsoft Office Internal Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company is having a complex problem with our SharePoint services.&nbsp; We use an old version of SharePoint (2003), and we are able to make it work despite it being out of date.&nbsp; What our problem is that the SharePoint isn't allowing everyone at our company
 to edit the data that is within the it's data list sheets, however a sixth of our company is able to manipulate the data as it was a few days ago.&nbsp; We have discovered that it "might" have to do something with SharePoint Export Database Launcher and SharePoint
 Spreadsheet Launcher internet explorer add-ons.&nbsp; The ones that are working is version: 16.0.93330.2014 while everyone else has version: 16.0.10228.20051.&nbsp; I believe it was updated during a windows update that Microsoft does (not sure how two computers were
 missed during that), but does anyone know where I can download the 16.0.933330.2014 version and if it requires a special way to install?&nbsp; Because copying and pasting didn't work and I can't seem to find it anywhere to download.&nbsp; Even on the Microsoft site.</p>

            Hello. It is not clear if WMDC is supported in Win8. I haven't seen any official announcement by Microsoft. &nbsp;Also, what version of Outlook are you using? Users have not been able to sync with Outlook 2013.&nbsp;

            <p>All the&nbsp;windows installer mentioned is that WMDC&nbsp; "Reinstall it in Windows 8". It did not say it was "Not compatible" or "Upgrade available". So I believe that with a reinstallation it would be compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well it is for all other application but not for my Outlook 2012</p>

            <p>I don't think WMDC is your problem.&nbsp; It's syncing files, browser bookmarks, etc.&nbsp;just fine. The problem is it can't sync with&nbsp;Outlook.&nbsp; There's no such thing as "Oitlook 2012"&nbsp;so you're&nbsp;probably using the new Outlook 2013 Preview, which in my, and other's
 experiences, is completely *incompatible* with WMDC and simply will not sync with it, period.&nbsp; If you are using Outlook 2010, keep in mind that only the 32-bit version is compatible with WMDC, the 64-bit version is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplest workaround, of course, is not&nbsp;to sync your contacts and calendar data with WMDC, but sync it directly with Live/Hotmail, and setup Outlook 2013 to do the same, simply by&nbsp;adding your Live/Hotmail account to OL 2013. You can still&nbsp;use WMDC for
 file sync,&nbsp;browser favorites, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using OL2010 64-bit, you can also sync with Live/Hotmail, but you'll have to install the "Outlook Connector" to&nbsp;add Live/Hotmail sync support to Outlook. This support was built in (finally!) to 2013.</p>

            <p>Yes my mistake it is outlook 2010 32 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole thing is now broken but I guess someone will come up with an answer one day as Microsoft is like many other major company&nbsp;say that "They don't need to offer support as their products&nbsp;are perfect and nothing goes wrong"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In theory, then, you should be able to sync with that Outlook version, but honestly, I&nbsp;haven't tried it personally. (I'm testing the Win8/Office 2013&nbsp;previews in a virtual machine on my Win7 PC.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the "support" ship has sailed on WMDC. It hasn't been updated since 2007.&nbsp; Reinstalling WMDC might help since you're running 2010, but I'm getting pragmatic on my old age. The path of least resistance is to sync via Live/Hotmail.&nbsp; Create the same
 account in both Outlook and the phone (in the phone's Activesync app, setup the Live account with m.hotmail.com as the server, and add that same account to Outlook using the Outlook connector) and sync via Live/Hotmail.</p>

            Hello. Windows Mobile is not obsolete...just different. Windows Mobile still has alot of features that Windows Phone still doesn't have just because of the locked-down nature of the WP architecture. Just because it isn't updated anymore on the consumer
 side, it still exists on some enterprise devices (e.g. bar code readers). The only reason to look for a new phone is when you lose a needed functionality. Maybe you have reached that point with the USB Outlook sync.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've worked with a couple of people on the Win 8 WMDC sync but they never updated their status whether it worked or not. Since you are only having trouble with the Outlook stuff, I am inclined to believe it should work with Outlook 2010 32-bit. In Outlook
 2013, they messed with the default sync paths so I can see why that doesn't work. When the Outlook sync options are greyed out, it usually means 1) You need to repair your Outlook installation; 2) You need to repair your .pst file (scanpst.exe) or possibly
 make a new one; 3) your partnership is now broken on the PC side since you uninstalled WMDC. As for "3", you need to delete the broken partnership off the phone. This can be done by a hard reset or go to Start&gt;programs&gt;activesync&gt;menu&gt;options. Select the PC
 partnership and delete. Before you do this, backup your PIM info with the free program
<a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PIMBackup</a>. Deleting partnerships can sometimes delete PIM info from the phone. Now when you plug in the phone, you should be allowed to make a new partnership and select your Outlook sync options. No guarantees!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had completely broken the connection so the phone was not recognised. I found the sync partner on the phone and deleted it the I was able to make a new connection. Now I am back to where I was. Everything works apart from Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error I get is ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchange ActiveSync encountered an error. If this condition persists, please contact your System administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realise this error has nothing to do with exchange but anyway I don't use exchange. When I view the synchronisation conflicts it says there are no conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My net book is the workaround but I would prefer to sync from my main computer. At my age I need my phone to tell me what to do :)</p>

            Hello. Yes, that error has nothing to do with exchange but it is still indicating a communication problem with Outlook. Unfortunately, OS upgrades are not very friendly with existing apps. &nbsp;Did you try the repair of Outlook or maybe uninstall/reinstall?&nbsp;

 ID (or at least eh ID I thought it was doesn't work!!) &nbsp;- is there any way I could trace this?? Needs to be done by the end of the month. Thanks</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 Bug&#63; 3D Surface plot axis &#34;floor crosses at&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick at acertara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 Bug&#63; 3D Surface plot axis &#34;floor crosses at&#34; settings resets when file is saved and re-opened</h2>
                    <div><b>System Setup</b></div>
<div>Office 2010 Standard Edition</div>
<div>Windows 7 Professional - 64-bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem</b></div>
<div>When creating a 3D surface plot in Excel 2010 the 'crossing' of the axis floor defaults to at '0'. Changing this by editing the axis 'Floor crosses at' successfully moves the floor (see second image in the screen). However, once the file is saved and re-opened
 the the axis floor is reset to being placed at 0 but the 'ticks' for the floor remain at the newly set location. Please see the screenshot below for details:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://goo.gl/pHEPX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Screenshot of the bug</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried the same set up in Excel 2003 and the problem did not exist.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Bug Reporting</b></div>
<div>This seems like a bug, especially because of the 'ticks' and 'floor' become mismatched. Something I doubt is supposed to ever happen in Excel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could not find a way to submit bugs for Office 2010, only complaints from other people about the fact there was no streamlined bug reporting process. This seemed like my best option. However, if anyone knows of the best way to file a bug with Microsoft
 for Office 2010, please let me know.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Nick</div>

            <p>Nick: I have reported this problem to MS on your behalf. It also happens in Excel 2013. Here is another strange oddity: I restored the chart to its correct form (make Floor Automatic then make it -20); click on chart to select; used Copy As Picture; pasted
 it on a new sheet: The Floor is at zero with ticks at -20 again!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought other might like to see the charts we are talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>best wishes from Nova Scotia (Eh!)</p>

            I should have also noted that Access is not Excel on steriods.&nbsp; Having that many fields in one table defeats the purpose of using a database.&nbsp; Perhaps if you explain what you are doing we can offer a solution more suited to your needs...

            <p>Sounds like somewhere during your steps you ended up corrupting your mail profile. Use the Mail applet in Control Panel to recreate it.<br />

            And when you use the new empty pst-file, does it work correctly then?<br />
If it works now, connect your original pst-file and set it as the default (restart Outlook and then disconnect the other one). Does the Address Book display your Contacts folder correctly now?

            We selected the pst file during manual profile creation of a new profile and new pst. We check the contacts is empty. Enter a test contacts entry. But the address book is still empty. Check the Contacts &gt; folder property &gt; Outlook Address Books - the check
 mark is still gray out in: [ ] Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book.
<div><br />
<div>Roady, we (and other support stuff, both here and others in the East Coast office agree, too) think you suspect corrupt profile is probably down the wrong path. We think the problem is created by moving the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>outlook.pst

            1. Well, we moved this outlook.pst to another computer (same Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits SP1, Microsoft Outlook 2010 Professional Plus, SP1).
<div><br />
<div>Before moving outlook.pst: This computer Outlook 2010 was working fine with full address book and contacts information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After moving outlook.pst: now the contacts information are correct. But the Address Book is empty. The Outlook Address Book option "Show this folder as an email address book" is gray out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. we moved this outlook.pst to third computer (same Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bits SP1, Microsoft Outlook 2007).</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>After moving outlook.pst: This computer Outlook 2007 IS working fine with full address book and contacts information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Moving this Outlook 2007 outlook.pst file back to Outlook 2010 did not fix the empty address book problem.</div>

            <p>Hello jgy2001,</p>
<p>You can try the following and see if that corrects the problem.</p>
<p>Your problem may be that you do not have the Outlook Address Book service.</p>
<p>Here are the instructions to add the Outlook Address Book service.<br />
Outlook 2010 <br />
1. Click on the File menu, click on Account Settings<br />
2. In the Account Settings dialog click on the Address Books tab <br />
3. Click on the New or Add button.<br />
4. In the Add Account dialog box click Additional Address Books, click Next<br />
5. Click to select Outlook Address Book click Next. <br />
You’ll be prompted that you must close and restart Outlook for changes to take effect.<br />
Press OK and close and restart Outlook. <br />
The service is now added. <br />
Once the service is added the option "Show this folder as an email address book" should no longer be greyed out.<br />
To turn on this service <br />
1. Right click on the Contacts folder that you want displayed in the Address Book.
<br />
2. Click to select the Outlook Address Book tab<br />
3. Click to enable the option "Show this folder as an email address book"<br />
Note: You will need to repeat the instructions to "Show this folder as an email address book" for each contacts folders.<br />
If after completing these instructions you still cannot add your Contacts folder to the Address Book then creating a new profile is recommended.</p>

            Dear Tammy, thank you for your reply.
<div>Yes, I have both removed and created new Outlook address book.</div>
<div>After I removed the Outlook Address book. I click new, select Additional Address Books, Next, Outlook Address Book, Next, I will get a message dialog:</div>
<div>Microsoft Outlook: This account or directory type already exists and cannot be specified twice.</div>
<div>Obviously, this is incorrect, because, the address book has already been removed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click the contacts, right click, property, Contacts properties, Outlook Address Book, the [ ] show this folder as an e-mail address book is gray out and disabled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I have created new profile in control panel too. Same empty Outlook address book.</div>

            <p>Hello jgy2001,</p>
<p>Ok, lets try this.</p>
<p>Create a new profile and a new database. </p>
<p>In the database make a couple of contacts just to populate it. Note: The contact must have a email address or a fax number so show in the address book.</p>
<p>The rename the following hidden files on your system.</p>
<p>Extend.dat<br />
outcmd.dat<br />
frmcache.dat<br />
If you are having trouble with the location of the files here is where you will usually find them.<br />
outcmd.dat is: C:\Users\&lt;User Name&gt;\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook<br />
extend.dat is: C:\Users\&lt;User name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook<br />
frmcache.dat is: C:\Users\&lt;User name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Forms<br />
Once you restart the Outlook, new .dat files will be created.<br />
<br />
See if this new crispy clean profile works.</p>
<p>If it does then you will need to then open your old datafile and try dragging some of the contacts into the new one and see if it holds up.</p>

    <title>Problem with truncated Outlook Contact Notes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with truncated Outlook Contact Notes</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,<br />
<br />
I use Outlook.com for my e-mails, contacts, and calendar. The problem with using Outlook online is with&nbsp;the&nbsp;contact&nbsp;truncating the notes section. The truncating seems to take place at about 495 characters (80 words, 500 characters with no spaces, 570 characters
 with spaces).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from truncating the text it also takes away all the text formatting and puts all the text on a continues line. An example is shown below:<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I type:</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; Important dates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>A) 2nd October&nbsp;1994<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>B) 15th January 1989<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>C) 29th October 1998<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Outlook.com reformats the notes to look like:</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Important datesA) 2nd October&nbsp;1994B) 15th January 1989C) 29th October 1998</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting on the Outlook.com that sets the Notes section within Contacts to a richer text format?<br />
<br />
I hope you can help!<br />
Colin</p>

    <title>Install Windows 10 on a clean blank drive to get the best - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitcs0ke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows 10 on a clean blank drive to get the best experience&#33;</h2>
                    <p>From Everything I have read here on the forum, Installing Windows 10 on a clean blank drive is your best option</p>
<p>to have the best experience testing Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that users who are (Dual Booting) or Going the (Virtual Machine) route and last but not lest</p>
<p>THE WORST WAY (updating over Windows 7 or 8) are not having a good experience!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are people here on the forum who have become Tech Savvy with all the ups and downs
</p>
<p>using virtual machine and dual booting and have spent lots of time perfecting the techniques of setting</p>
<p>up and running these machines and are not having any problems, but the inexperienced techie who decided</p>
<p>now is the time to do some of these things will probably have a Painful Learning Experience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there are the Upgraders!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its just my opinion but that has to be THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY to try Windows 10!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did not read all the info at the Windows 10 website and prepare yourself with restore, backups</p>
<p>Images, or clones of your system, you are in trouble the instant you hit the Enter Key!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSTALL WINDOWS 10 on a CLEAN DISK DRIVE FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE!!!!!</p>
<p>Its so easy to do, its more trouble free!! If you get into trouble or create a mess its a easy fix!!!</p>
<p>AND YOU DON'T LOSE ANY THING IMPORTANT!!! You just format the mess away and install again.</p>
<p>Hard drives are cheap! all you need is something like a 160 GB, you can buy them all day on Amazon for $20.00&nbsp;</p>
<p>or under.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only have one computer and you still want to try Windows 10 without losing anything and be safe.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Here is what you can do. Open your computer and unplug your MAIN hard drive! install a second hard drive and plug it up.</p>
<p>Leave your main hard drive unplugged! Install Windows 10 on the second hard drive and ENJOY.</p>
<p>When you need to go back to your old system, just unplug the Windows 10 drive and plug up and boot to your</p>
<p>old system drive and you are back in business. Easiest Dual Boot Out there!!</p>

            <p>While I agree completely with this in theory, the reality can sometimes be a bit different. When I first installed Windows 10, it was an upgrade over Windows 8.1. After the upgrade everything worked except some graphical problems that eventually turned out
 to be something corrupted somewhere in the graphics subsystems of Windows. To resolve this I blew everything away and did a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the clean install, my fingerprint reader software no longer recognizes the presence of the reader, even though Windows does. I also cannot get alternate language proofing tools to work with Office 365. My initial graphics issues have also returned
 after updating to the latest graphics drivers. There is also one unidentified device on my machine that I have not been able to track down a driver for. All of these problems did not exist when I had done an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the moral of the story is there can be times when a clean install introduce unique problems when working with beta software. I fully expect these issues to be resolved, but just wanted to comment that the 'experience' can vary even when doing a clean
 install.</p>

<h3> lefty11  say:</h3>
<h2>            SHA-1 hash not correct</h2>
                    <p>Just signed up for TP last night and downloaded WindowsTechnicalPreview-x64-EN-US.iso. Once finished,&nbsp; ran hashes with "MD5 &amp; SHA Checksum Utility 2.1" (from Download.com - have used before...works) and Microsoft's fciv command line utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of the SHA-1 hashes I ran match the SHA-1 on the W10-TP website - the generated hashes did match each other. Tried downloading the iso again and rehashing, but results were the same: no match with website's info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else get something similar?</p>

            <p>If the checksum failed you have to try download it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: be sure you have the correct checksum (for that ISO) to compare to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded build 9879 Enterprise edition and the checksum agreed, so the download does work.</p>

<h2>            adding a pre-existing work Outlook email account to my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I need to access my employers Outlook email on my personal laptop (that I have to use at work). &nbsp;I work for a doctor and am supposed to have access to the email for patient requests, scheduling, etc.</p>
<p>Do I have to "add on" or download anything to my laptop, or is there a way to just go to Outlook and log in with the</p>
<p>ID and password he has provided me? &nbsp;I do not want his email being added to my own personal Outlook account (Microsoft 2013).</p>
<p>I am not tech savvy &amp; this is a very small practice, so there's no IT department to ask!</p>
<p>Thank you so much :)</p>

<h2>            OK&#33; Microsoft I am Done Using Windows 10 Mobile.</h2>
                    Ok! Microsoft now we are DONE. <br />
It's been really hard to digest that there will be no future builds for older Windows Phones. I am using Lumia 535 and now on the 15063.2 build and now you are saying that we are don't eligble for the CREATORS UPDATE. It's really saddening me. When you dont
 want to put the Creators Update on older Windows Phones then there was no need to push us on the Insider Program. We have Installed every builds since Aniversary Update and after all that you are saying that We Are Not Eligble. Please, for the Insiders you
 can push the Creators Update only on older phones. That's all I can say.

 KB/S and less whether I use Google Chrome or Internet Explorer , can you give a solution for this please ? yes I know about using torrent but not all files are torrents some of them must be downloaded through direct not an option and I tried those steps to

<p>Disable : Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly</p>
<p>Enable : Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic</p>
<p>

<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center

<br />Open App &amp; browser control

<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />If you have a VPN enabled, disable it.
<br />
<br />Disable the Windows Firewall then try connecting.
<br />
<br />If the connection is slow, remove any special bundled software that came with the motherboard.
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the internet....You get what you pay for.... free software is often useless or contains features to motivate you to purchase the full version. Have you tried the software vendors support website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please include links to problem websites or links to software vendor websites (we have no idea what 'Direct downloader' is or who makes it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All web browsers (IE, Edge, chrome, FX) now have built-in download managers, that will use your current connection for downloading files instead of a third-party proxy or mirror server on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already purchased the paid for version of their 'Direct download' software, make sure you have chosen a mirror that is in close proximity to the country where you live... Some countries may have restrictions on what you can download and from
 where or do not use high speed (fibre) internet connections yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            I just purchased office 2011 for the Mac and installed it and I am getting this message or a message saying my login information is not correct every 5 minutes! &nbsp;While I am getting emails in and out.....THIS HAS GOT TO BE FIXED! &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am using google mail - could it be something on their end that has changed?</div>

            This problem never seems to go away. &nbsp;Sometimes it won't do it for a week or two, then it happens every day multiple times per day. &nbsp;Neither MS nor Apple seem to care very much. &nbsp;I also use gmail and Outlook. &nbsp;I'm at a loss, the patches don't seem to&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;solve
 the problem.

            I installed MS Office 2011 yesterday, get the repeated message today, and I am unable to open Outlook to do the logging in the prior post. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;I'm new to Mac. If this were windows I'd go into task manager and stop the outlook process.

<h2>            Median formula returning 0 in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am entering the below formula to essentially calculate a median while excluding some outlier values, but this formula returns 0 for all instances when I'm certain the result should not be zero. Below is my formula, which I adapted to try to complete this
 more complex problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>=MEDIAN(IF((Data_Granular!$C$2:$C$284332=$C49)*(Data_Granular!$A$2:$A$284332=$D$44)*(Data_Granular!$W$2:$W$284332&lt;&gt;"12/31/9999")*(Data_Granular!$W$2:$W$284332&lt;&gt;"1/1/9999")=1, Data_Granular!$X$2:$X$284332))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula works fine for me and if it's not for you then I suggest you evaluate it to see what's going wrong. Shorten the formula to something like below (now 27 rows) and on the formulas tab click evaluate formula and you'll see which column(s) aren't
 evaluating as you expect. Column W looks strange to me &lt;g&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Still nothing. I get the same result: 0. I tried shortening the formula as well to no avail. Not sure if it is the date format column W that is messing with this, although I can't really think of why it would.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the snip below, I get the median of the numbers in what is now column L because I hid some columns to make the snip clearer. The rows that meet the condition are 4,5,6 &amp; 7 and the median of those numbers is 3.5</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 is slow, stalls, freezes, mouse stops working</h2>
                    <p><span>Has Microsoft Sabotaged Internet Explorer 11 when running under Windows 10. IE 11 Stalls, Freezes, Mouse seems to go to la la land Msn.com goes Ape.</span><span> It is just so bad and if I typed what I think of it, you would through me out of the USA.
 Runs so slow you want to through a Brick at the System. Tried to update it and was informed this is greatest and best they can do. When I run MSN as home page under MS Edge it seems things seem to work just fine. I guess Edge is IE’s replacement but they don’t
 want to say it. </span><span>Make it bad and drive the users off of it, they did that in the 90’s with Windows 3.1 with the blue screen of **** drive everybody to buy Windows 95. Windows 3.1 worked great until they released a patch and after that, it only
 worked with will with MS Products. They did not release file handler for none MS Products until max file handlers reached, then death!! It did two things, Trained People to buy only MS Products and move to WIN 95.</span></p>

            <p>Hi James,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is this issue occurs in Microsoft Account or Local Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some troubleshooting steps that you can try to resolve this problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Open Internet Explorer in No Add-on mode and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps to open Internet Explorer in No Add-on Mode.<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + R”.<br />
b. Type “iexplore –extoff” without quotes in the Run Window and hit enter.<br />
c. Now the Internet Explorer will open in No Add-on mode. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Restart the computer in safe mode and test, if the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot and check.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start the computer in safe mode</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode
 you're using.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue resolves perform a clean boot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Put the computer into clean boot state.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot
</p>
<p>troubleshooting"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also perform Internet Explore Performance Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Right click on Start button.</p>
<p>2. Select Control Panel.</p>
<p>3. Select Troubleshooting.</p>
<p>4. Select Internet Explorer Performance.</p>
<p>5. Refer the link below for more information.<br />

            <p>I have a dual boot setup, and this morning I went into Windows 8.1 instead of 10. The NASCAR Mobile app would launch and crash whenever I tried it. It was working fine for me yesterday in 10, and that was even after installing the updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it may not
 be the 10 update doing this, but something in the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I just tried the app again, still in 8.1, and it's still crashing.</p>
