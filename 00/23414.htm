    <title>Excel VBA file Open Date Data fault - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel VBA file Open Date Data fault</h2>
                    <p>I have a txt data file which i am opening with an Excel 2016 VBA macro, then manipulate the data with the Macro and graph, however, it appears that there is a difference between opening the file manually and through a Macro, which alters only parts of one
 of my columns of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i open manually, via delimited, then with only Space and Consecutive delimiters, My date column appears to be fine and all data is in one format. When i open using a Macro (One i created and also one recorded for testing), my data appears to change
 certain parts of my date column, which then then creates varying dates between america and English date formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've inspected the raw file and my code and can't see why. Below is part of the rows where the issue occurs and below that is what happens when opening file via code. As you can see, What should read 12th Nov, reads December 11. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>00:08:05 13-11-15 S1:1 &nbsp; -22.58 &nbsp; &nbsp; 28.9 &nbsp; &nbsp; 33.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;445.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>23:59:39 12-11-15 S1:1 &nbsp; -22.55 &nbsp; &nbsp; 27.6 &nbsp; &nbsp; 33.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;427.0 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a9ccde0-fb2f-45fa-937e-461afd1fee0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a9ccde0-fb2f-45fa-937e-461afd1fee0d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, when opening manually, via excel, this doesn't seem to occur, but from my macro (Recorded and written), the issue happens. I have islated my code, to be sure, and it is definitely during the opening of the file. Below is the code I am using
 to open the file: -</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>fileToOpen = Application.GetOpenFilename()</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; If fileToOpen &lt;&gt; False Then</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Application.ScreenUpdating = False</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Workbooks.OpenText Filename:=fileToOpen, DataType:=xlDelimited, ConsecutiveDelimiter:=True, Tab:=False, comma:=False, semicolon:=False, Space:=True</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;myFileName = ActiveCell.Worksheet.Name</em></strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</em></strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense, and any help would be great, as I can't isolate what is causing this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>After days of searching I have found the reason as how I can stop the date being interpreted in 2 different formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the reason was due to&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">VBA using the default local of USA,( even if you are in a different&nbsp;locale) with all the formatting set to it(date separators, decimal separators).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I needed to add the local settings to the formatting when opening the file.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<pre><p><code><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)">local</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 51, 54, 1)">:=</span><span style="color: rgba(125, 39, 39, 1)">True</span></code></p></pre>

    <title>Lost Windows 8.1 when Installing Windows 10 Pro p&#35;r Insider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcmass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Windows 8.1 when Installing Windows 10 Pro p&#35;r Insider Preview or Professional</h2>
                    <p>As I had posted earlier, due to a hanging installation when DELL's Backup and Restore took over the boot sequence, not allowing the installation of Pro (Insider), I was forced to format my hard drive and do a clean install. I do have my original Windows
 8 disk with the info to install, but I cannot believe there is no one out there that lost their Windows 7. 8 , or 8.1 when installing Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I had just finished watching an hour on the Fundamentals for Windows 10 which covered the goal of NOT doing a clean format and retaining your applications, settings, data, etc. I wanted to install Windows 10 Enterprise on my computer that had already gotten
 Window 10 Pro only to find that I could not do it without losing all the testing applications, drivers, work that I had done to try Windows 10 and give it a workout. It is a gem, but I still cannot install the Enterprise Edition and retain the work.
</p>
<p>Was this not one of the goals? Making things easier...</p>
<p>If I did not have the ability to reinstall 8.1, I would lose the opportunity to upgrade to Windows 10. Not what I had intended when running the preview.</p>
<p>Need we wait for the release date to get 10 Enterprise as an upgrade from 10 Pro?</p>
<p>Without the registered 8.1 installation material, up the creek without even a hint of a paddle.</p>
<p>BTW, the tech that tried to help me get things running properly was helpful but I ended up doing the work myself. Successfully, I might add. His offer to have me bring the computer to the MS Store for repair was fair, except I do not have that much money
 to spare. (And I enjoy the challenge. Once.)</p>
<p>I find that I must skip the installation of Enterprise until it is ready.</p>

<p>And it is not like it was in fine print. However, not everyone does as they're told and quite a number will have lost their upgradeable Windows 7/8/8.1 and the link could help set things right. I bought my DELL with Windows 8 on board, but their (DELL's)
 Backup and Restore program misbehaved during the Windows 10 installation wrecking havoc with the boot (looped to restore, reboot, restore, reboot, etc.) forcing me to format the drive and going into POST to set the bios, bypassing the loop and doing a clean
 install. Just because I was tired and should have waited to do the install, I assume the liability and am happy I had the DVD with the Windows 8 and install code. There but for the hand of God, go I...</p>
<p>It still took me quite a while to find most, not all, the software I lost and am doing&nbsp; my best to get replacements.&nbsp; No matter how many times you do your backups, something gets lost when you do a clean installation. I took this as an opportunity to get
 the 30 day trial software while I located my versions. Corel is good for that as well as others, but my Dragon Naturally Speaking V12 is gone and I did not have the online backup. However I am working with Cortana and speech recognition as a workaround.
</p>
<p>Without windows.old I cannot go back to the way it was.</p>
<p>I am now using Office 2016 to test both the Offic as well as the Windows 10. I have a subscription that I can use and have One Drive with my data. Office 365 is easily downloaded when I need it.</p>
<p>Other utilities and programs I found useful can wait until the final version is on the computer and I do not need to get them all at once.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions are appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It was an internet connection problem. As you rightly suggested, it was a WiFi connection that I was using. I switched to a SIM card based connection, and the upload successfully downloaded and installed. Thank you so much for your help. You almost held
 my hand through the whole conversation. God Bless You.</p>

<p>I have given you the full message. When I am on MS Word, I get a dialogue box saying updates are available. When I tell it to go ahead and download the updates, I see a page which tells me that the updates will install in the background and I can continue
 with whatever I am doing. After some time, a new popup tells me that the download could not be continued and says the error code is 12007-28.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 2013 which I purchased in Saudi Arabia on a discounted rate since the purchase follows an arrangement that my Ministry of Health has with Microsoft for bulk purchases. The copy is genuine and registered to my name. I have Windows OS 8.1 on
 my laptop. I also have an older MS Office 2007 which I am scared to remove since the 2013 is new. Also, Office Picture Manager is something I really need from the older MS Office. I might as well tell you that both versions are running perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please confirm if you have Office 2013 Professional Plus bought on the "Home Use Program" or one of the Office 365 bundles? I'm guessing you have Pro Plus.&nbsp; 365 has slightly different "issues"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now that we have the full error message text (in the other reply &lt;grin&gt; ) we have something to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has nothing to do with having a "legal copy" or "registration/activation".&nbsp; The problem is with Windows Update or your internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, go into Control Panel &gt; Windows Update &gt; View Update History.&nbsp; Look for recent updates with status other than "successful".&nbsp; That is almost certainly the cause of the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click on the row to expand it.&nbsp; There should be a bit more of an explanation, plus a link to more information about the error.&nbsp; If you don't understand it, report the error code and message text back here for more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part of the message is hinting there is a problem with your internet connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is NOT what you think, it is NOT saying you don't have ANY internet connection, it is just saying that "Office" does not "like" something about your internet connection.&nbsp; Sometimes Office 2013/365 gives this sort of "connection" message when you are trying
 to download from a corporate network that has a "Proxy" server.&nbsp; Office 365 just doesn't "like" proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try going to another place to do the downloads, ie home or a friends place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reported cause for the connection message is using a wireless / wifi / "Verizon Jetpack" wireless connection.&nbsp; Simply changing to a different internet connection, such as a wired connection has been reported to fix the problem.

<h2>            Windows Defender How to Activate</h2>
                    How do I activate Windows Defender? It says that the app is turned off by group policy but I can't find any other antivirus/ antimalware applications besides Windows Firewall. It says I need to enable the program via group policy. I'm also the administrator
 and I also don't have "gpedit.msc". Please help, thank you.&nbsp;

Thanks for your reply, but it's not the answer for my question.

<div>It is Font size for Datasheet, but it's not effect to design view.</div>

            I think I'm out of my depth on this one, but the only place I can think of that would affect that is the Windows Display settings for medium and large fonts.&nbsp; but that would affect most everything on your computer, not just Access' table design window.

 goes for 3dMark FireStrike in full screen. Then, I played Shadow or mordor in full screen same problem. I have installed Windows 10 10041 using ISO image on my laptop MSI GT60 Dominator Pro with optimus technology.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find advanced search function in Outlook email anymore</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Outlook's last upgrade, I am unable to find the advanced search function. I need to search something by DATE, and am only able to type in PEOPLE and SUBJECTS into the search box. There is no longer an advanced search function. What happened to
 it? I have tried to find a drop-down menu for this function. Can someone please tell me where it is?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something so basic should be attached to the search bar, but it's not.</p>

            <p>In outlook mail, advanced search is only available after you specify what you want to do an advanced search on.&nbsp; For example if you want to search a date range type "dates" in search (see snip)</p>

At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.

<h2>            uservoice.com</h2>
                    <p>I had a question on Outlook Mac and found someone had similar question. &nbsp;In a reply from a MS employee, it suggested we go to a uservioce.com side to give feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The terms of service of this site are totally unacceptable!!!!! &nbsp;They reserve the right to look at basically everything I have done on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would Microsoft direct customers to such a site to collect feedback on their product - surely you have enough technical talent and tools to handle this in house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, the feature I wanted to vote for was to allow deleting emails in Outlook for Mac by group (sender, date etc...) same as in Outlook for Windows. &nbsp;I find this a very useful feature to delete messages from senders that I might have whitelisted
 domain (microsoft.com or oracle.com) but for every business related message, I get hundreds of marketing type announcements. &nbsp;In outlook for mac - when you group by sender and collapse all messages, you can not click on the group heading and delete (or move
 to a folder) - you have to select all the messages within the group to delete or move in blocks.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;KJonsson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support and it is my honor to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I totally understand your concern. Secondly, I should say I would like to help you meet your requirement. If I am not able to do so, you can go on contacting our dedicated Outlook 2016 for Mac support channel for further assistance. You can refer
 to the screenshot at the end of my reply to find the dedicated support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Via your description, I understand that you want to bulk delete the unwanted messages in Outlook 2016 for Mac. Given the situation, I suggest you move these unwanted emails into a folder firstly and then choose to clear the folder so that these emails can
 be deleted. About moving the emails into a folder in Outlook 2016 for Mac, my thought is that you can create a rule (maybe, you need to create more than one rule) based on the email's sender for example. For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-rule-in-outlook-for-mac-c8fde328-de0d-4579-abc4-564cc8922f71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-rule-in-outlook-for-mac-c8fde328-de0d-4579-abc4-564cc8922f71</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above method doesn't work for you, you are welcome to contact our professional Outlook 2016 for Mac support as the following. Thanks</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc6e230-8b9f-4879-9444-f58351ad9d39?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc6e230-8b9f-4879-9444-f58351ad9d39?upload=true" /></a></p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Recall message feature works only for Microsoft Exchange Server account in Outlook 2013. So this feature does not applies to both POP3 and IMAP accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about this, refer to the article given below. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Regarding ‘To set alarm’, there is no such option available to achieve this feature in Outlook 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, reply and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>ok there has been alot of reports about this with the battery been either loose or faulty</p>
<p>if this is just happening now and you have the phone a while try a reset back up all your data first</p>
<p>the code is</p>
<p>Full Reset: *#7370#, 12345 and then Yes.<br />
<br />
Soft Reset: *#7780#, 12345 and then Yes. (Also works on Nokia S40 phones as a full reset)</p>
<p>if its&nbsp; a new phone bring it back to the shop or a nokia care centre in both instances new or used if the shop will not entertain you</p>

<br />To help with this question, a higher level of support is required, with access to account details (which we, as independent consultants, don't have for security and privacy reasons). 
<br />
<br />I recommend that you start a chat with a live specialized Skype support agent. 
<br />
<br />To do so please: 
<br />- Click here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/s...</a>
<br />- Select issue "Account Profile and Signin"
<br />- A new page will automatically open 
<br />- Then click on chat.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<h3> lynne rosner  say:</h3>
<h2>            I no longer have voice to text on lumina 735 since upgrading to Windows 10 yesterday.</h2>
                    <p>I was sent an email offering me the option of upgrading to Windows 10 three days ago. Since the upgrade I lost the microphone icon on my screen keyboard area that allowed for voice to text feature. I also lost the feature that announced my incoming texts
 by name and offered me the options to read , reply, and ignore, from rooms away too. &nbsp;I can live without these "handy" things but will regret opting for the Windows 10 upgrade that antiquated my phones use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have a fix for getting my voice text back, please. It alleviates the burden of typing with arthritic devices, my hands. Thank you.</p>

            Same problem for me with Astra GTC's Navi 600 system. I can receive calls, initiate them via the handset, load all my contacts, even send and receive texts via handsfree. The only thing it won't do is initiate a call via voice or using the Navi 600 phone
 controls.

<h2>            Lumia 920 not recognized by computer. &#42;Update&#42;</h2>
                    A day ago, my Lumia 920 showed up just fine, but now it simply doesnt get recognized by the computer(new USB cable, tried on several computers with the same outcome).<br />
<br />
It repeats the sound that is played when a USB device is connected. A "warning" message shows up, stating "The USB device is not recognized" (or similar).<br />
<br />
Have uninstalled bot the WP desktop app, reset the phone, started it when connected to the laptop etc. No luck so far.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Now I cant even uninstall the Windows Phone app from my laptop. <br />
<br />
*Update: One of the USB ports at least charges the phone now, but I cant access it and the "Windows does not recognize this device.." message still pops up.&nbsp; No clue whats going on :/<br />

My laptop is W7.<br />

Spoke to Nokia - they told me to give the phone back to the store and they will "investigate" and if needed, repair/replace the phone.<br />

<h3> dissertationaficionado  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 page view</h2>
                    I like the 2 page view of Word on Windows - it automatically adjusts to less margins &amp; adjusts font size so it is still readable in full screen 2 page views (Yes, the page numbers numbers increase in this viewing mode, but returns to normal when switched
 back to print layout) . I am trying to see whether I can do same thing with Word on Mac, but the close I can get is Focus View with 2 page view - which doesn't adjust the margins or the font size. Is this something doable in Word for Mac, or only possible
 in Word for Windows?

            No, Mac Word does not have the same [Reading Layout] View as its Windows counterpart. The program for the Windows/Mac platforms is comparable &amp; compatible but they do not share the exact same feature set.<br />

<p>Yes. Click on settings, then choose an account, and then click on "change mailbox sync settings". Then choose"any time". Remember to click "save" after having changed the setting.</p>

<h2>            Add Gmail account to Outlook for Office &#40;Mac&#41; -- difficulty</h2>
                    I have configured Outlook successfully with three IMAP accounts and a POP3 account
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>One personal Gmail account works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added a work account with a different domain name which is a Gmail-hosted domain, using the port settings recommended, and this is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a further Gmail work account (using the same work domain name) which I am unable to add. I have used exactly the same port settings, SSL etc. The password is correct and I can access via webmail and via Apple Mail and Windows 10 Mail. It is just
 Outlook which I am finding hard to configure correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, Outlook for Windows is giving me the same problem on another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The configuration I am using is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>INCOMING</p>
<p>imap.gmail.com</p>
<p>Port 993</p>
<p>Requires SSL - on</p>
<p>
</p><p>OUTGOING</p>
<p>smtp.gmail.com</p>
<p>Port 465</p>
<p>Requires SSL - on</p>
<p>Requires authentication - yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password (checked several times) is correct!</p>

            The settings described looks fine for the account to be setup in outlook. Not sure the reason why your are not able to add this account when it works with other apps. To test the issue, try adding the account as pop type.

    <title>How does MS delete data from OneDrive if subscription expires&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How does MS delete data from OneDrive if subscription expires&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a question about OneDrive data?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A subscription plan gives u 1TB of cloud space and a free usage gives you 5GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for example u wish to end the subscription but have used up more than the 5GB, how does this exactly work?<br />
<br />
Is there a grace period so u can move data?</p>
<p>How do servers decide what to delete if u dont move in time?</p>
<p>Is it just random data deleted until below 5GB?<br />
<br />
Regards</p>
<p />

            Hi StumfSlo,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Your OneDrive account will be frozen if you exceed your OneDrive storage limit for more than three months. So you have a grace period of 90 days. 
<br />
<br />AFTER 90 DAYS - You have two options to bring your account back into good standing:
<br />a. Choose Get 1 TB (1024 GB) of OneDrive storage with Office 365 and buy an Office 365 subscription - <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-US/plans/</a>
<br />b. Choose Unfreeze your account to temporarily access your files. You'll have 30 days to remove enough files to be within your storage limit. Your files will be read-only, but you can download or delete files to get back under your storage limit. If you don't remove enough files within 30 days, your account will be frozen once more and you won't be able to unfreeze it again. 
<br />
<br />When unfreezing your account, most accounts are restored within 24 hours.
<br />
<br />Reference - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-does-it-mean-when-your-onedrive-account-is-frozen-5e76147b-b7d5-4bcb-ba28-b91e3eb636b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-d...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Clean Desktop</h2>
                    <p>To the programers and any one else interested!<br />
They say that what goes around will come around again.<br />
Windows 8 &amp; 10 remind me of Windows 3, no not the same but reminds of it&nbsp; with all the Icons if you remember the start menu was all Icons.<br />
I like Icons and use them on the quick launch and quick start on the start menu.&nbsp; I also like a clean desktop.&nbsp; Why have the beautiful pictures on the desktop if they are covered with Icons?<br />
I know I am in a minority as most people do not take the time to clean up the desktop and allow all of the Icons to be put there.&nbsp; Most of the programs that you install if you do a custom and sometimes in normal install you are given the option of placing a
 Icon on the desktop.&nbsp; <br />
Thank, for reading this.&nbsp; I have include 2 pictures of my Windows XP desktop and start menu.<br />
I am also running Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9879 and like what I've seen so far,&nbsp; Don't know yet If I will be able to clean up the desktop.&nbsp; The start menu is a start!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the comment. I am using a start menu with Windows 8.1, But still have the Icon on the right of the start menu. My desktop is not to cluttered. But I would appreciate more details from you on the subject.</p>

            <p>I personally do not do this, but I was showing it to someone the other day just to show a little customization trick.&nbsp; You can do this all the way back to
<em>Windows 95 Desktop Enhancement Update</em> sometime in 1996, when the Taskbar gained the ability to show toolbars like the Quick Launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start menu in Windows 8 is full screen, but the actual structure isn't changed in the file system. You can open a folder explorer and browse the files normally, and put that on your taskbar for a popup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I don't do this, but here's one option:</em></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95bbe307-f545-427b-84fe-54f0bb87f8e9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or another thing you can do is set your Start screen to open up to the "all programs" menu first, so you can see the same organizational structure as above, but all folders expanded out at once:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I don't do this either, but it's another option:</em></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e810806-411f-4b5d-bb88-e37f0713178a" /></p>
<p>This skips straight to the same organization structure as Windows 95-7, just listed all out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 95-7 had an area at the top or left of the Start menu where you could pin your favorite things. Shortcuts to folders, places, sites. By default things like your email and browser were pinned there (carefully following the user's defaults for those
 to avoid further antitrust complaints).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 still promotes the option to pin your favorite things to the Start screen. By default that's the first screen you see, followed by an arrow to see "all program" (just like Windows 7, just full-screen).&nbsp;

            Thanks for the quick reply, I use the quick launch and the 1 click on the start menu.&nbsp; I was not aware of the way you described using the folder explorer.&nbsp; Windows has many different ways to do things and I am constant learning new tricks.&nbsp; Thanks to You
 and many on the Microsoft community sights.
