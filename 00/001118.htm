    <title>Running 2 Excel VBA macros simultaneously on the same machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markelkjaer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running 2 Excel VBA macros simultaneously on the same machine</h2>
                    <p>All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a web-scraping program to extract data back to an Excel sheet, using VBA coding through Excel. I have to do this for several different macros in different workbooks. Some of these macros can take several hours to run: up to 8 hours in some cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to speed things up I need to run 2 excel macros in separate workbooks simultaneously, but if my understanding is correct this is not possible as Excel (VBA) is not multi-threading? The Web-scraping program is capable of running multiple times simultaneously
 on the one machine on a single user license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The web scraping program is relatively expensive hence the option of buying a second license of the web-scraping program is not my preferred option. Is it possible to install 2 separate Excel 2013 licenses on the same machine and if so would it then be possible
 to run a VBA script from each of these separate licenses or would the fact that VBA is not multi-threading still be an issue under this scenario?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if I bought a second laptop with Excel 2013 installed on it and linked it to the first laptop would this possibly overcome the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other solutions please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>AFAIK you are correct in saying that VBA is does not support multi-threading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now - it could be possible to install a second licensed copy of Excel on the same physical hardware - but in order to use it separately you'd need to set up a Virtual Machine: and that means not only getting an added license for Excel/Office but also another
 for the operating system to use on the VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion the most robust VM hosting software is probably from VMWare.&nbsp; They offer several options for a desktop system:<br />
VMWare Player - a free VM tool - and pretty darned good - actually supports 64-bit Windows better than the last time I looked at Microsoft's own Virtual PC (which I'm not certain can be used on Windows 8, I think you have to move to the not-free HyperV software
 for that - but I could be totally wrong).</p>
<p>VMWare Player Plus - not free but does have support and probably some extra features, and</p>
<p>VMWare Workstation - again not free, but an outstanding product (I have a couple of machines using it to create and manage&nbsp;VMs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your buy-in costs are going to the the cost of your VM 'host/tool', an operating system license and a license for either stand-alone Excel or Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download page for their products (including the free Player) is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads</a></p>
<p>Home page is at <a href="https://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.vmware.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another product to look at would be VirtualBox <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.virtualbox.org/</a> which again I know absolutely nothing about, cannot personally vouch for, but was recommended along with VMWare's Player as options in another discussion I found here:<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c07d4fb8-e0ab-4d01-8a37-e10f0c9ed825/virtual-pc-in-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c07d4fb8-e0ab-4d01-8a37-e10f0c9ed825/virtual-pc-in-windows-8</a></p>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply. Before I invest any time or money pursuing your solution do you think there is any merit in the following "solution";</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all my macro workbooks and web-scraping program on my main laptop. If I network my second laptop (VPN) to the main laptop I can open the macro Excel sheet on the second laptop. However, when I run the macro on the second laptop it will not start/initiate
 the web-scraping program as it is on the main laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to initiate the web-scraping program on the main laptop from the second laptop and if so then write the data back to the second laptop? Or do you think I would need to get a Network license for the web-scraping program to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this is a bit of an open-ended question but do you think in principal this might work?</p>
<p>

            <p>Mark,&nbsp; I just don't know enough about either the webscraper program or how your macros interact with it to give you an intelligent answer on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have an additional thought about this overnight.&nbsp; Earlier I had been thinking in terms of licenses for the same version of Excel.&nbsp; But then I thought about a setup just like I have on this very machine:&nbsp; multiple versions of Excel on the same system.&nbsp;
 I have Excel 2003, 2010 and 2013 all installed on this computer and can run them all at the same time if I actually need to - although I haven't ever run more than 2 versions at the same time as best as I can recall.&nbsp; So I can open Excel 2010 and run one Excel
 file, and open Excel 2013 and run a different file.&nbsp; Actually I could probably open the same file in both, but one would become a "Read Only" copy.&nbsp; However, if I had 2 copies of a file, say WB1.xlsm and WB2.xlsm then I could have both running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The secret to success in installing multiple versions of Office/Excel is to start with the oldest version.&nbsp; Get it installed and set up, then install the next version making sure you do not "upgrade" the previous version so that it gets installed in separate
 folders and has separate Registry entries.&nbsp; You end up with a folder structure similar to what I've shown in the graphic below from my system.&nbsp; So if you could get or have a license for Office/Excel 2010, you could uninstall 2013, then install 2010 followed
 by 2013 again and give that a try.</p>

    <title>Cannot install PC Suite on XP SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sasbif  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install PC Suite on XP SP3</h2>
                    Hi all ;)<br />
<br />
After having my company notebook refreshed (via an image), I was in the process of setting up all the litte tools I need to actually "work". One of those is the Nokia PC Suite.<br />
<br />
I downloaded <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_PC_Suite_rel_7_0_8_2_ger_web.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this file</a> and started it.<br />
<br />
It would download an available newer version (7.0.9.1 iirc). Done that, the installation would restart.<br />
<br />
After about 73% of the installation process, it quitted with the error message seen in
<a href="http://www.dropfiles.net//files/2684/PC%20Suite%20kann%20nicht%20installiert%20werden.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this screenshot</a>.<br />
<br />
Is says: While trying to open the file C:\WINDOWS\Installer\Nokia_PC_Suite.msi a network error occured.<br />
<br />
And yes, that file does not exist, neither before nor while nor after any installation attempt.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Could the image have a previous install of PCS on it. Or maybe an old .msi index lingering in it from a removed install?

    <title>Office for Mac - Fonts not displaying correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam_730  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office for Mac - Fonts not displaying correctly</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.2, and then at more or less the same time Microsoft released a raft of updates for all its Office software (Office for Mac 2016, including Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Outlook, OneNote etc.) &nbsp;Word and Powerpoint
 say they are now on version 16.9 (180116).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that, post these updates, fonts are not displaying correctly on the screen in either Word or Powerpoint. &nbsp;The font is correctly identified in the font dropdown box, but on-screen the font does not display properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in the screenshot from Powerpoint below, the word "BroadREACH" is supposed to be in the font Bebas Neue (and it identifies as such in the font dropdown), but on-screen it is not displaying correctly and is giving a mix of capitals and lowercase
 letters:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48008466-1d86-4265-8c35-cdf1b830aefd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48008466-1d86-4265-8c35-cdf1b830aefd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To demonstrate my point, here is a screenshot when the same slide is opened in Keynote (which is not giving any issues):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b843f939-8fac-4884-beed-2ab4085fd882?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b843f939-8fac-4884-beed-2ab4085fd882?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar issue is happening in Word, in which even standard fonts (Helvetica) are showing up as what looks more like Calibri.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a couple of things already:</p>
<ul>
<li>uninstalling and reinstalling fonts;</li><li>running Font Book to check that all fonts are present and enabled;</li><li>restarting in Safe Mode (problem persists);</li><li>uninstalling and reinstalling Powerpoint.</li></ul>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated. &nbsp;I am posting this in a &nbsp;Microsoft forum because it seems to me the problem is Microsoft related (Keynote is not giving the same problem).</p>

<p>Search other forum messages for similar font topics.&nbsp; There are replies that explain the problem and suggest things to do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bug, MS is aware of it but until they fix it, the best workaround is to install a pre-update version of Office.&nbsp; Again, other posts on the forum include suggestions for how to do this.&nbsp; Look for posts by Matt from Singapore.</p>

            Hello. Here is what I would do. I would create a lookup table. In my screenshot, the table is D1 to E6. I would use Index and Match to return the number for each name. See the formula I used in cell A2.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18fe1a3e-d748-49ec-b5d0-f21d874eb5c6?upload=true" />

            <p>Hello Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no direct option to edit or add the new fields to the existing default ‘New Contact’ in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may create your own contact form and add /edit the required fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more information about customizing the form, you may post your query in the Microsoft Programming Forum link mentioned below for better suggestions:</p>

                    <p>I cannot find the Tools menu to turn pop up blocker on or off in internet explorer 11 using Windows 8.1. &nbsp; We have looked everywhere and cannot find it.&nbsp; A website requires that we turn pop up block on to be able to access their website and it is an important

<p>I would find it via the Command bar's Tools menu.&nbsp; Also, as a keyboard user,&nbsp;via Alt-T P.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as a MUF IE user, you might instead go into W8's Search Settings and look for Pop-Up Blocker.&nbsp; E.g. press Win-w Po Bl&nbsp; and Enter (since it matches something useful at the first item).&nbsp; Apparently your ultimate destination will be Internet Options,

<h2>            Information sur l&#39;autonomie du Nokia Lumia 800</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia a publié la déclaration suivante qui répond&nbsp;à quelques questions de&nbsp;nos&nbsp;utilisateurs&nbsp;concernant l'autonomie de leurs produits Nokia Lumia :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Nous avons pris connaissance du fait que certaines personnes étaient préoccupées par l'autonomie de la batterie du Nokia Lumia 800. Nos premières enquêtes nous indiquent que la majorité des gens profite pleinement de l'expérience du Nokia Lumia 800 sans
 aucun souci. Une mise à jour logicielle disponible début Décembre inclura des améliorations pour la gestion de l'énergie, et une deuxième mise à jour logicielle disponible début Janvier apportera des améliorations supplémentaires pour la durée de vie et le
 chargement de la batterie. Ces deux mises à jour sont planifiées et seront disponibles via Zune. Nous conseillons à ceux qui ont toujours des interrogations de contacter leur représentant local Nokia Care dès qu'ils le souhaitent.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nokia dispose également d'un support d'information déjà disponible concernant l'optimisation de la durée de vie de la batterie en général:<br />
</strong><br />
Pour un conseil général sur la consommation de l'énergie, merci de vous rendre:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Si vous utilisez un chargeur Nokia que vous possédiez pour un autre mobile, il est possible qu'il ne soit pas aussi efficace que celui fourni avec votre mobile Lumia. Nokia recommende que le chargeur correcte soit utilisé:<br />

<p>bonjour, et merci.</p>
<p>merci pour cette liste d'astuces plus funky les unes que les autres.</p>
<p>merci de nous proposer un smartphone, qui pour pouvoir l'utiliser une journée entiere, nous devons le configurer comme un Nokia 8210 ou presque, car vous ne nous avez pas proposé de mettre l'ecran en monochrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Si je prends un Lumia 800 et =&gt;je desactive la 3G</p>
<p>je ne me sert pas du Blootooth</p>
<p>je banni la Wi-Fi</p>
<p>je ne reléve pas mes mails,</p>
<p>je ne prens pas de photos avec flash</p>
<p>je ne poste rien sur Facebook,</p>
<p>je ne tweet pas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pourriez vous nous indiquer ce qui reste de smart pour ce phone s'il vous plait?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bonjour sirocco12001,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nous ne vous disons pas de ne pas utiliser toutes ces fonctions qui font effectivement de votre mobile un smartphone, mais dans ce cas ne vous attendez pas à avoir une grosse autonomie, car techniquement, c'est impossible avec la technologie actuelle de
 batterie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donc ce post s'adressait plus aux personnes utilisant le Lumia en tant que téléphone(et oui ça existe :)&nbsp; ) et qui souhaitaient gagner en durée de batterie.</p>

<p>vous n'avez de connexions de données ou wifi, qui se feraient pour certaines applications en arrière plan(email/facebook/twitter/météo/Le Monde....)?</p>
<p>Si vous suivez toutes les recommandations citées plus haut, vous en restez au même point?</p>

            Balivernes : ma femme a un iPhone 4 qui tient très bien la charge. La technologie existe donc.Mon lumia perd 25% de batterie en 4h sans l'utiliser (pas de wifi, pas de musique, pas de tâches automatiques pas de localisation, écran verouillé et éteint),
 tandis que l'iPhone de ma femme perd 10% (mêmes conditions)..

<p>Bonjour Gregala,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>donc d'après ce que vous dites, 25% en 4h toute connectivité coupée(wifi/connexion de données/pas d'appli en arrière plan..), ça fait 20h d'autonomie en veille totale, votre Lumia a donc un problème, et je vous conseille une prise en charge SAV.</p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Je suis dans le même cas et j'hésite à ramener mon portable au sav car j'ai l'impression que c'est une généralité sur le Lumia 800. Même après MàJ le portable tient 12h max sans rien faire dessus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Si je peux me permettre&nbsp;une sugestion aux développeurs de nokia, il serai bien de faire fonctionner le réveil avec le portable éteint&nbsp;cela éviterai de le laisser allumé toute la nuit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Autre problème rencontré : mon portable se bloque fréquemment&nbsp;lors des appels et se coupe en affichant un logo de batterie faible&nbsp;au milieu de l'écran&nbsp;alors que la plupart du temps la batterie est chargée à plus de 50%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Est-ce que ce défaut est aussi fréquemment&nbsp;rencontré par les autres utilisateurs??</p>
        </p>

            Même problème pour moi, mon nokia s'est coupé 2 fois avec batterie faible apparaissantquand je le redémarre une première fois. Après le second démarrage je constate qu'il reste de la batterie (45 ou 60% les deux fois où ça m'est arrivé)

<h2>            Preventing the Closing of Access Using the outer &#34;X&#34; Control</h2>
                    I've created an App in Access 2013 (incorporating ADO - if it matters) and I have created buttons on my Startup Form to Close the DB and Quit&nbsp;Access.&nbsp; So I need to prevent the user from mistakenly clicking the "Outer X (closing Access)" versus the "Inner
 X"(Closing the Window/Table).&nbsp; I find articles on achieving this in Access 2003; 2007, but not 2013.&nbsp; Is there a Difference I need to consider?&nbsp; Thanks in Advance...&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim May

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The F4 key repeats the last formatting change you made. You can tweak this to your need. First apply the cell color on a cell yourself. Then select other cells where you need to apply this formatting and press F4. You can also access the color palette for
 fill color by the Alt key sequence Alt+H+H and then use the arrow keys or the mouse to select a color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helped.</p>
<p>Regards.<br />

<h3> kerrynhiggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Emails disappear after downloading</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Win7 machine on which I have installed Office 2010, incl. Outlook 2010.
</p>
<p>I have used Outlook 2007 for years without incident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I allowed the system to find and configure my email accounts (2). Emails could be sent and received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could see the emails downloading but they never turned up in my Inbox. Any of them. Likewise, the emails were sent, but did not display in the Sent items folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for my own name in&nbsp;"all mail"&nbsp;(which all emails include), I get a list of all emails and I am then able to drag the missing emails into my Inbox. So far they have stayed there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is not terribly convenient and I would like to know how I can get an Inbox like I had in Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new installation, no rules etc. I have tried your tip to Run, /cleanview etc. This does not change anything though I see that it has solved some&nbsp;people's problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please note that one of my accounts has been set up as POP3 and the other as IMAP. Neither was configured as "Microsoft Exchange" but as internet email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you possibly help?</p>

            Reset view from the View tab when you are looking at the Inbox. That should reset to default view for the folder having issue. The other best option would be to create a new outlook profile.

</p><p>If the emails are found in a search then they are downloading to a data file, check that you don't have two sets of Personal Folders.</p>

 Data file" (main heading of mailbox) for my specific types of email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to make them all exist under one active mailbox, I would be grateful to know.&nbsp; I'd also love to know why this version of Outlook made Outlook Data file my main heading -- or if I did something to muck it up?</p>

            <p>The mailboxes for your accounts are on the servers. Outlook accesses those mailboxes and places mail in data files on the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only if you use all POP accounts can you have all your mail delivered to a single data file and Inbox folder in that data file. All other account types require their own folder sets/data files. This is not an Outlook limitation, but the result of the mail
 protocols used for the accounts.</p>

            No, this is not my problem. My first attempt (see original posts and replies)&nbsp;was with 2x&nbsp;POP accounts and the same thing occurred, emails disappearing, only accessible by "Search". Thanks for trying.

</p><p>As I noted above, when I search for my own name in "all mail", I get a list of all emails and I am then able to drag the missing emails into my Inbox. The folder title (at top of page) is All Mail Items, Outlook Data File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder list has Inbox but nothing goes into it. Mail can be found in the 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** folders showing at the bottom of the folder list. As noted, there are 4 of these. Two POP from initial adding of accounts. These were removed and I got my accounts a second time (1xPOP; 1xIMAP). This gives me 4 inboxes under accounts but
 the only way I can get anything into the master Inbox at top of folder tree, is by dragging it there from the All Mail Items search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem for me now is not that the mail isn't there, as you note. It's that I don;t get it into the main Inbox.</p>

            If Search shows them in Inbox, then that's where they are. Either you have a view of your Inbox hiding them from you (and that can't happen by accident) or you have more than one Inbox (because you have more than one account) and they're in the other Inbox,
 not the one you're examining.

<h2>            Visio 2013 does not start</h2>
                    A few months ago I installed and used Visio 2013 on this Win7/32 desktop. I haven't used Visio for about a month and now it refuses to start. There has been a lot of small changes to my setup since then(many updates). I have Office 2010 also, it happily
 co-existed before and still runs today.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Clicking on the Start-menu --&gt; Visio, or double-clicking a Visio drawing, it starts and then exits without any window.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried quick repair and it says Click-to-Run has stopped working. I tried online repair, and uninstall, both fail. I tried re-installing from&nbsp;officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com and it also fails. I tried running from a command line visio.exe /safe but still
 nothing.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried these things in safe-mode, no changes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool 1.1 and it reports no problems.</div>
                </div>

            <p>The only error messages I got were very uninformative like "Something went wrong." and "Sorry, we ran into a problem." The event viewer is also as useless in this matter.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The kb290301 link couldn't uninstall without a product key, I'm not sure where I find that since I am not installing from a disk, I bought it from Amazon and got the install from the Microsoft website and registered online. When trying to debug "install"
 it says We did not detect any problems ....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I finally was able to uninstall Visio, Microsoft Office Service service was disabled and I fixed that now. I changed Windows Installer Properties service from Manual&nbsp;to Automatic as well. I also&nbsp;checked the registry and removed any abandoned Visio keys.</p>

 in the microsoft works word processor and therefore all of the files I transferred are .wmp format. My new laptop has microsoft word 2010 but it can't view the .wmp files. Is there a document viewer or converter I can use? I don't want to buy microsoft works,
 it's pointless when my new computer has microsoft word. Thanks for any advice!</p>

    <title>Default From address in Outlook Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exaspersync  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default From address in Outlook Mail</h2>
                    I have Office 365 Business Premium with a primary email address (
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">PII masked by moderator</span>) and have connected another (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) email address which is also on the Office 365 email service. Connecting the two appears to be the only way to synchronise my 950 XL email, people,
 calendar tasks (why the **** isn't it all together like Outlook on iPhone/Android?) with the browser based Office 365 on a desktop or laptop. As far as I'm aware, Outlook 2016 no longer syncs with anything, so I am forced to use the limited and slow browser
 pages. After weeks of grappling with BT and Office 365 email, I now have it configured to do most things I need. However, there is one HUGE problem: Neither the W10M Outlook Mail app, nor the Office 365 browser version will allow me to send an email From my
 normal address or anything other than the primary address. Surely there is a way to do this? With Outlook desktop, I can select from any number of addresses, providing they have been set up under Accounts.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Exaspersync,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From my experience, we can send emails from the primary email address in the Outlook mail app of Windows 10 Mobile, but can't change the primary account to send emails via a connected account. However, we can send emails from both the primary account
 and the connected account. To send via a connected account,&nbsp; please refer to the following steps to change the sender’s email address in OWA:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>) and create a new email.</span></li><li><span>Click “<strong>…</strong>” &gt; <strong>Show From</strong> &gt; right click your Office 365 account &gt;
<strong>Remove</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type the email address you want to send from in the <strong>From</strong> field.</span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><span>According to your description, I’d like to confirm whether you have two <strong>
Office 365 accounts</strong> A and B, A has been added as a connected account on another account B. You log into account B in OWA and want to send emails from account A.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If yes, based on my test, it is feasible to change the email address of the sender before sending in OWA by referring the steps above, but recipients will see
<strong>B on behalf of A</strong> in the sender field. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If that is not your case, please provide the information below to better understand your situation:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The steps about how your Office 365 accounts (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) is connected to another Office 365 account.</span></li><li><span><del>Regarding “<em>Neither the W10M Outlook Mail app</em>”, do you mean Outlook client or Outlook mail application in a windows phone?</del></span></li><li><span>More detailed information about the issue/question you encountered.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your speedy response.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I recently moved the hosting of my domain to BT. &nbsp;Their web hosting package includes 10 or 20 POP3 e-mail addresses. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when signing me up, BT did not tell me that the email service was provided by Microsoft. &nbsp;Due to deficiencies in the BT/MS
 interface my email addresses were not activated on the MS side for two weeks! &nbsp;To further complicate matters, Microsoft's silly use of email addresses for Windows ID (why?) meant that after transferring my domain I have two identical email addresses in the
 Microsoft system - my original Windows ID and the new BT hosted Office 365 email address. &nbsp;Your systems constantly get confused. &nbsp;</li><li>Anyway, as I wanted to sync with my 950XL and everyone has gone cloud cuckoo, causing MS to abandon nice simple things like Outlook ActiveSync, I very reluctantly decided to subscribe to Office 365 Business Premium, which I arranged through BT. &nbsp;Their sales
 chappie said that if I attached the O365 subscription to my normal domain email (now served by MS), I would have to buy another subscription every time I added an email address to my domain - absolutely ridiculous - who dreamt up this O365 nonsense! &nbsp;So the
 the BT chap advised me to set up a .onmicrosoft account/email and attach the subscription to that, which would allow me to install the Office software on various devices. &nbsp;Having done so, it seems to me that syncing does not work unless I use the primary account/email
 (the one with useless .onmicrosoft &nbsp;address). &nbsp;</li><li>I logon to this .onmicrosoft account and connect my normal domain address (just a O365 POP3, not O365 Business Premium). &nbsp;</li><li>After several hard resets on my 950XL, I managed to get my domain address as the primary account and added the .onmicrosoft account as an email account. &nbsp;This seems to sync People and Email, but I have yet to test Calendar and Tasks. &nbsp;</li><li>To avoid confusion I shall refer to device-resident apps &amp; applications as programs, and browser based stuff as web pages. &nbsp;</li><li>With regard to programs, we can exclude from our discussion Outlook 2016 (desktop) as this does not sync and Modern Apps Microsoft People 10.0.11902.0 and Mail etc. as these have no functionality. &nbsp;</li><li>On Windows 10 Mobile (950XL) we are talking about Outlook Mail 17.7167.40728.0. - this
<strong>does not allow email From my domain email</strong> if I set it up with the .onmicrosoft account, but if I set it up with my domain account People does not sync. &nbsp;</li><li>Although I have a Display Dock, functionality of the Windows 10 Mobile programs is very restricted. &nbsp;For example, People cannot import a csv file, so I am forced to use the Office 365 web pages on full blown Windows 10 as well. &nbsp;</li><li>Using the web pages Mail and with regard to your advice, I have already tried removing the From address and typing another one, but I get
<strong>"Error: You don't have permission to send messages from this mailbox.". &nbsp;This means that if I have received an email addressed to my domain, I cannot even reply using that same domain - daft!</strong></li></ul>
<p>Thanks<br />

<li><span>Do you have two email systems, one is from “BT” that you can send emails via the POP3 accounts and the other one is Office 365 that you can send emails with from @xxxx<strong>.onmicrosoft.com</strong> domain?</span></li><li><span>Please provide the detailed steps about how you connect the two email systems.</span></li><li><span>Did you add both Office 365 account and POP3 account in Outlook for windows phone app? If yes, when you send emails, you can specify the email address of the senders.</span></li><li><span>Do you add a custom domain in your Office 365 Business Premium plan?</span></li><li><span>Contact the admin of “BT” to check if the email service of your POP3 account is OK so that you can send emails successfully.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>In additional, if you want to send emails from the POP3 accounts in Office 365 via the steps I mentioned above, you need to add the POP3 account as a connected account firstly. To do this, please refer to the article below:</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I might have pinpointed, but not solved the problem. &nbsp;When I added *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to the Connected accounts, it said it was sending a verification e-mail but this never arrived. &nbsp;If I go back into Connected accounts the Incoming server is set up, but there
 is no mention of the Outgoing server, so presumably the smtp.office365.com is only set up when the verification email is answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select "Resend verification e-mail", I get the following error message, and I have tried connecting other e-mail addresses with same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb18f045-5add-4ae4-819f-cd25c43c3464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb18f045-5add-4ae4-819f-cd25c43c3464" /></a></p>
<p>This message does not appear when I initially Connect an email account, only when I attempt to resend. &nbsp;This is a crazy circular argument as I cannot follow instructions without receiving the verification message, which always fails to send!</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated. &nbsp;I am running out of patience and will soon have to cancel the subscription and revert back to Office 2010.</p>

            <p>Miraculously, this problem with the Office 365 web "App" has corrected itself. &nbsp;Today, I tried yet again to resend the verification e-mail and incredibly it worked on both accounts that I had set up previously and the verification worked immediately. &nbsp;I
 then added two more accounts and that worked as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only guess that the publicised Azure outages in recent days had something to do with it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can now send e-mails from any of my accounts and I can even set my main address as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still keen to know whether my problem was caused by the Azure outage or perhaps Microsoft's merge/migration of email services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you could ask your developers to iron out the bugs in the error reporting when users connect accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, referring back to my original post, I was mildly astonished to see that the four letter name for the place where the Devil lives was replaced by asterisks. &nbsp;This suggests that I used an Anglo-Saxon swear word - something I never do online.</p>

<h3> d_watson  say:</h3>
<h2>            this computer only</h2>
                    <p>Under OL10, I had a local .PST that was the classic "Outlook Data File" but had no accounts using it. All it had was local Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks items. Journal is still there, but I don't use it. All the IMAP and POP accounts had their own .PSTs
 but were used just for mail. (Way back in OL2k, and for many moons afterward,&nbsp;this one .PST had all the accounts dumping mail into it and I was not using IMAP. About six months back I converted to use IMAP wherever possible and this lead to a while bunch of
 separate .PSTs. So I just went with the flow and made the one remaining POP account its own .PST as well.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under OL13, come to notice that the default email account is now showing, under its folders, Calendar (This computer only), Contacts (This computer only), Notes (This computer only), and Tasks (This computer only) folders. I'm inferring this means these
 are in the local .PST for the IMAP account and do not involve the IMAP in any way. Don't think OL10 ever indicated that it was willing to store these non-mail items in the local .PST associated with the default (IMAP) account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this mean I can move the Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks items into the IMAP account's .PST and be done with the classic Outlook Data File .PST and have those "IMAP" (but not really) folders be the default stores for such items? Any downsides to doing
 so?</p>

            <p>IMAP no longer uses a pst - it uses an offline folder (ost). As a result, non-mail items can be stored in the imap data file.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can move calendar, contacts etc to the imap ost file - but one big word of warning - the ost file can only be opened by the account that created it. This means you should export the 'this computer only' folder on a regular basis to back them up.
 Never remove the imap account or delete the imap ost file without first exporting these special folders.&nbsp;&nbsp; That pretty much covers the downsides...&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the reply. Let me make sure I understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you raise with .OST is that the Windows user account that created it is the only one that can open it? No ability like with the .PST files to restore them on, say, another system or a reloaded system and open them from Outlook and get at the items
 stored in them. Also, it will be "poof! gone!" if I ever delete the IMAP email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That seems like a considerably risky downside...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTOH, the default account's root folder is now the only one that shows Outlook Today and the Outlook Data File .PST root folder cannot be set to show home page. :(</p>

            In a minute I'll tell you how to uninstall Word if that's what you really want to do, but first let me tell you why it probably won't do any good if you then reinstall it.<br />
<br />
Most problems described as "Word stopped working" arise from one of three sources: add-ins that are damaged or meant for a different Word version; a damaged Normal.dotm template; or damaged or missing registry entries. Uninstalling and then reinstalling Word
 does nothing to change any of these. After the reinstallation, the same problem will still be there.<br />
<br />
Instead, use the procedures in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</a> to find the cause and fix it.<br />
<br />
If you're just determined to remove Word, here are the steps:<br />
<ul>
<li>In the Control Panel, go to Add and Remove Programs.</li><li>Select the Office 2010 item and click the Change button.</li><li>Accept the "Add or Remove Features" option and click Continue.</li><li>In the list of features, click Microsoft Word and choose "Not Available".</li><li>Click the Continue button and answer any prompts.<br />
</li></ul>

<h3> fred.ahrens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font weight in Outlook 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way for Outlook 2011 on Mac to determine not only fonts but there weight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i´m, trying to achive is, that every mail, i start to write uses Arial Light. In die font options i only say "use arial".</p>
<p>There is no Option to select the Light weight. or the bold or any other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for now i created a workaround with signatures. i formated steh standard signature in light leaving first 5 lines blank.</p>
<p>when i open up a new e mail first line still writes the arial regular. but using the seconde (which seems to be part of the singature then)</p>
<p>light ist already formated. but this is not what a programm, which calls it self a business programm, should be able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>pls tell me how to set a light font in outlook as the standard font.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Version 15.32 problems in Mojave</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13 inch, early 2015) running MacOS 10.14.2.&nbsp; The Word version is 15.32.&nbsp; Word takes ages (minutes) to open a document (whether I try to open it from Finder or from within Word).&nbsp; Once open, it works
 ok, although I'm subject to the spinning beachball more often than I would like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue now is that when I boot my laptop in safe mode, Word works absolutely fine.&nbsp; So what do I do next to find out and cure the specific problem?&nbsp; A simple and patient explanation would be very much appreciated; I'm not strong on manipulating the Mac
 OS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

    <title>Uneven margins when printed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chartaft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uneven margins when printed</h2>
                    I recently acquired MS 2016 and create posters for our non-profit on my Mac OS High Sierra.&nbsp; Margins are all set at 1 inch but when I print, the side margins are uneven.&nbsp; Top margins measure 1/4 inch.&nbsp; Left margin is 1/2 inch while the right margin is
 about an 1/8 inch. Poster document margins look right in preview, but print out uneven.&nbsp; I'm at a loss!&nbsp; I've checked within the document going to Format&gt;Document and also File&gt;page setup.&nbsp; What am I missing???

<p>Printing anomalies typically are the result of update issues to one or more of the 3 components of the printing process:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The operating system - Confirm that it is fully updated,</li><li>The software you're using - Verify by going to <strong>Help&gt; Check for Updates</strong>, &amp;</li><li>The driver software for the printer - Visit the mfr's site to see if there is a more current driver and/or firmware update for your specific model.</li></ol>
<p>If the document looks correct when displayed in Word as well as in the Quick Preview in the Print dialog the issue most likely is with the latter. Word simply sends the data to the printer...It's up to the print subsystem to determine what it does with that

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>

                    Right. When I got up this morning, I said "Good Morning" to Cortana. She showed the words, but she didn't say it. She said something a whole lot different. When I said "Good Morning" to her, she would talk about alarms, or is you were sad. She is supposed
 to say "Good Morning" to me when I said "Good Morning" to her. This is the first time she did this. Help? Anyone? Please!
