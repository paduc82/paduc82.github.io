<h2>            nokia e72 battery draining problem</h2>
                    Ive been having this problem for over 3 months now. It all started one day when I normally charged my phone and when i took it off, it was extremely hot. After that, whenever i fully charge the phone, it would barely stay on for 15 minutes. I do not use
 it at all, when I do, the battery goes from fully charged to one bar and then battery empty. I have tried everything, changing the battery, changing the chargers, charging from both of the places (mini usb and the small pin). Any suggestions?

<p>If your phone doesn't have the latest Firmware, update it thru' <a href="http://www.nokia.com/in-en/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a>&nbsp;. Keep the charger connected if and when you do it so that the phone doesn't switch OFF during the process because of the problem in subject. Also keep in mind that the phone will switch OFF and ON on its own during the update so don't worry
 and do not use or disconnect the phone till the update is over.</p>
<p>If problem remains, you need to get the device checked by a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care</a>&nbsp;technician for any Harware issues..</p>

<p>Whilst you would be prompted to backup device by using Nokia Suite, I might suggest that you try "hard reset" to return device to "Out of box" state by keying in *#7370# followed by 12345 (default Nokia lock code unless altered by user). Try using E72 without
 restoring any settings and see if any difference to outcome.</p>

<h2>            Office 2019 Home &#38; Student - One-time purchase - privacy question</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop and bought Office 2019 Home &amp; Student (one-time purchase) for the new machine. I bought it on Amazon and didn't immediately download it because at that time the new laptop hadn't arrived. Now it's here, but I have NOT yet installed
 Office because the more I read, I now have serious concerns about privacy in installing/using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 2-3 days reinstalling &amp; configuring Windows 10 on the new machine, getting it the way I wanted it, locking down security &amp; privacy, and deliberately using a local account for both the Admin and Standard user accounts. I have zero interest in using
 online apps or cloud storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was dismayed to learn that I couldn't even download Office 2019 without creating &amp; signing into a MS account. But I went ahead &amp; signed in &amp; downloaded the offline installer - something I always prefer to do. I understand that as part of the installation
 process I will have to sign in again so that the product can be activated. Fair enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT I have seen a number of references to the MS account info being embedded in every Office application, which leads to a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does this mean that my account info (an email address) is embedded somewhere in the metadata of every single file I create? Because that's a huge, involuntary breach of privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Does the use of the MS account undo all the work I've done in configuring the machine to use purely local accounts - IE does the MS account somehow take over as a device sign-in to Windows? Or will it harass me to make that swap?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What exactly is the MS account used for in the One-Time Purchase product, post installation and activation? What control do I have over any potential sharing of info or other monitoring which might result from this enforced account usage? IE if I have
 Windows locked down in Settings &gt; Privacy will that be overridden by Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I don't want my Office apps going out onto the internet at all, aside from occasional updates. Is there any instance in which this would happen, aside from updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) How do Office updates work? Do they rely purely on the Windows Update process, or do they have a separate, independent process of their own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I realize many people will read this and think I'm making a fuss over nothing, but I'm dead serious about it. I've been a loyal Office user for around a quarter century now, and suddenly I'm researching Libre Office... I don't want to be driven
 from the fold after all these years, and I really would like to be able to use what I've paid for, so I really hope you've got good news for me. I can't find answers to any of these questions on the web, so it wouldn't hurt to have the info out there &amp; available
 for all to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>TM</p>

            Hi TekMuse
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />1) Does this mean that my account info (an email address) is embedded somewhere in the metadata of every single file I create? Because that's a huge, involuntary breach of privacy.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is not at all embedded in the file. What downloading using a Microsoft Account offers is the ability to save your files to OneDrive if you want an easy way to deactivate the suite and transfer it to another computer if you want. 
<br />
<br />2) Does the use of the MS account undo all the work I've done in configuring the machine to use purely local accounts - IE does the MS account somehow take over as a device sign-in to Windows? Or will it harass me to make that swap?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it is completely optional and using it to download Office is not gonna convert/switch your local account to Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />3) What exactly is the MS account used for in the One-Time Purchase product, post installation and activation? What control do I have over any potential sharing of info or other monitoring which might result from this enforced account usage? IE if I have
<br />Windows locked down in Settings &gt; Privacy will that be overridden by Office?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Its use for verification and tying your license to your account, so activation and managing the license, such as deactivation and transfer easier. Yes, you could use it to easily save your files to OneDrive if you want, but this is completely optional. 
<br />
<br />4) I don't want my Office apps going out onto the internet at all, aside from occasional updates. Is there any instance in which this would happen, aside from updates?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, outside of installing updates and if you need to verify account in case there is an issue with activation. 
<br />
<br />5) How do Office updates work? Do they rely purely on the Windows Update process, or do they have a separate, independent process of their own?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Office updates are independent of Windows 10. You can install them from within any Office app by clicking File &gt; Accounts.

<p>Andre, thanks for your response, it is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I'd still like to get a response from someone at Microsoft as to what *does* get embedded in files created by Office apps which are linked to this MS account, and how/where the MS account is referenced on the hard drive of my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) If the update process for Office is completely separate, then what are my options for controlling when/if updates are downloaded &amp; applied?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional question:</p>
<p>If I go create a brand new email address somewhere to be used solely for this MS account, add it to the MS account and make it the primary, can I then completely remove the existing email address and have no further reference to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            See the screenshot below of what is typically included with a Word file when you save it and share it.
<br />
<br />Click the File menu &gt; Info &gt; Properties for details. 
<br />
<br />Updates for Office are not granular, but you can review your Update history from File menu &gt; Account tab
<br />
<br />There you can view the history or disable updates. 
<br />
<br />You can set up the new account as a connected account, in fact, you don't even  need to use a Microsoft Account at all.<br /><a href="https://directly-static.s3.amazonaws.com/attachments/microsoft-community/images/microsoft-community-3072391-1554222908711.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIDWNCANEJGMPSSOA&amp;Expires=1555518972&amp;Signature=6UZpMNkhsKt9MA9RhCNDwsM4ja4%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Attachment: file properties Word.jpg</a>

<p>Andre, thank you again for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) So the Office updates CAN be disabled if need be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Re: embedded account info in files, I still want confirmation from Microsoft on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Re: completely replacing existing email address with a new one in the MS account, I'm still not sure if you're saying yes, that can be done. My aim would be to replace the existing email and then completely remove it from the MS account.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Privacy in Windows / Office is tricky.&nbsp; Setting up Windows to avoid OneDrive is a good start.&nbsp; Buying One-time payment Office rather then Office 365 is another good step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Windows 10 and Office 2016/2019 have been set up to treat OneDrive as the primary location to save files. It takes some effort to break them of that habit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2010 the Office license was primarily linked to the hardware it was installed on.&nbsp; The email account is required to link your Office 2019 / 2016 / 365 license to your email account.&nbsp; After Office 2019 is activated and installed on your computer, you no
 longer have to log in to the email account in Office. I never do. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No you cannot (easily) change the email account that your Office license is linked to. I have seen mentions of an "alias" process (basically what you described) to change your email account, but I have not tested it personally.&nbsp; Basically, when MS designed
 it's ID system and linked Office licenses to it, apparently then never considered the possibility of someone wanting to change their email account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not you cannot disable Office updates. They are independent of Windows update, so those blocking techniques won't work.&nbsp; Office update is run through the "Click to Run" environment that Office runs inside of.
</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>I have not seen confirmation one way or the other that your email account is not embedded in your files. I don't think it is.&nbsp; You could check for yourself.&nbsp; Save a file to OneDrive, then "unzip" it.&nbsp; Just rename the file to add the ".ZIP"&nbsp; suffix to the
 end of the file. Then you can navigate through the various sub files and folders that create the file to see if you can find your email address embedded in any of them.</p>

</span><span>If you plan to share an electronic copy of a Microsoft Word document with clients or colleagues, it is a good idea to review the document for hidden data or personal information that might be stored in the document itself or in the
 document properties (metadata). Because this hidden information can reveal details about your organization or about the document itself that you might not want to share publicly, you might want to remove this hidden information before you share the document
 with other people.<br />

</span><span>Microsoft Office saves hidden metadata in your Office documents, including how long you’ve been working on them, the name of everyone who’s worked on the document, when the document was created, and even previous versions of the document.<br />
<br />
Before you publish Office documents publicly or send them to someone, you’ll probably want to check what hidden information the document contains and remove the sensitive data. This metadata can infringe on your privacy or be potentially embarrassing.</span></p>

It’s a hidden ‘feature’ in Office 2016 for Windows desktop (Office 365 subscribers).<br />

<p>Hi Rohn007 - wow, thanks for such an extensive response! It took a while to work my way through that lot, and it wasn't exactly reassuring - but it's always better to know than not to know. You're a star for providing all that info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think all of this underscores the need for an official Microsoft response:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does the MS account email address get saved to the file's metadata, and can it be removed by running Inspect Document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is there ANY way to control when Office updates are downloaded &amp; installed, or at least a way to defer them as we can with Automatic Updates in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Can the original MS account email address be changed and all traces of it removed, after adding another account and making it the primary?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, Rohn007, I'm sure many people learned a thing or two from your reading list!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say, but 99.99999% of the questions here NEVER get an "Official" reply from MS. Once in a 'blue moon', someone more than the MS Support staffers we see here provide a reply.&nbsp; Maybe once or twice a year we see a "Project Manager" or trouble shooting
 staffer post to this forum.&nbsp; It is very rare.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, keep looking for existing documentation from MS that has the answers to your questions, because there is no reason to think you will hear from anyone in MS other than MS Support staff ...

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>For anyone asking the same sort of questions, here are at least some answers and more definite info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The MS account email will only be stored in the file's metadata (as far as I know) if you use that email as your Windows sign-in account I.E. use all the cloud-based stuff that they're pushing so hard these days. If you use a purely local account for
 Windows (I.E. the account is local to your computer only) and are signed out of your MS account online, then the file shouldn't have any trace of the email address. The file will have Author (Windows username) and other info (quite a lot of info) on the file,
 but anything that Inspect Document picks up can be cleaned out before you save. Alternatively you can run Inspect Document before you email the file to anyone.</p>
<p>I have no idea if there's anything else buried so deep in the file that Inspect Document doesn't show it, and MS isn't telling!&nbsp;
<span>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>
<p>Moral of the story:</p>
<p>Become better acquainted with Inspect Document (see link below) and when you install Office, click File &gt; Options and go through every single blessed one to config things the way YOU want.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-hidden-data-and-personal-information-by-inspecting-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-356b7b5d-77af-44fe-a07f-9aa4d085966f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-hidden-data-and-personal-information-by-inspecting-documents-presentations-or-workbooks-356b7b5d-77af-44fe-a07f-9aa4d085966f</a></p>
<p>Also Google it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Andre is correct, you can actually disable updates for Office 2019, and doing so in one program takes effect in them all. Click on File &gt; Account to enable/disable. This is also where you can check whether or not you are signed in to your MS account online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Yes, you can change/remove the email assocated with your MS account, but it's important to do it right... otherwise you might lose access to stuff afterwards. Follow the procedure in this article (it worked fine for me):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/microsoft-account-change-email-phone-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12407/microsoft-account-change-email-phone-number</a></p>
<p>Pay attention to the section towards the bottom titled "I want to completely remove an email address or phone number" and note the warnings in the yellow box - if you have any MS service which is registered to the address you're about to remove, manually
 update that service with an alternative, alias email first! </p>
<p>

<h2>            N95-8GB Spiderman III movie</h2>
                    Hi, my N95-8GB came with the full Spiderman III move in dcf format.<br />
Unfortunately I had to format the mass storage and put back the dcf file from a backup I made, but now I can not play the movie anymore and the message "no activation key" is shown. Is there a way to get the dcf back activated?

            If you don't have a back-up of your device. The only way is to get the movie (DVD or AVI), and copy it to your device.

<p>Hi Sheryl</p>
<p>The Runtime allows a user to use any elements of Access that you allow them to except for design elements. If you allow them access to the Nav pane, then can see and open tables, queries, forms, reports, etc. They can't go into Desgin mode of most objects
 though.</p>

            No.<br />
I've solved this problem myself.<br />
I upload mp3's to the phone with names: 1.mp3 2.mp3 3.mp3 4.mp3 etc. Later I update the music library. Next step is deleting all mp3 from phone and upload mp3 with normal names.

            Hi, I had this problem too. It started, when I uploaded some *.m4a files to my MicroSD card and when I started updating the media library. From this moment on the phone kept resetting.<br />
<br />
I solved this by formatting the MicrSD card, it was rather hard, because I had only few seconds before the phone resetted :-) But it worked.<br />
<br />
I guess the problem is in some audio filenames as somebody mentioned above, but I am not sure.

            Now I realize that my MicroSD card was totally full, maybe this was the problem, some other people mentioned this on Czech phorum - [Moderator note: link to non-English site removed]<br />

            I also have this problem. Phones4u denied they sold any phone with a generic fault. From this forum it seems they are definately wrong.<br />
<br />
I just can't be bothered to go into a care centre to get a line a lies about how I am doing something wrong. They said I needed a nokia card. I got one and it still did not work. They suck.<br />
<br />
It is not on when you invest 60 pounds in a phone that has these functions and they turn out not to work. They should automatically refund you if a forum has been shown to demonstrate a fault is common.<br />
<br />
I will not be buying nokia again. The ringer is also very quiet and does not wake me when someone calls. My cheap nokia had a deafening ring. They concentrate on all these frills and miss the basics.<br />
I hope the iPhone torpedos them out of the water!

<h2>            Contacts in Outlook will not display in the &#34;To...&#34; window</h2>
                    
<p>My Contacts can be found in Outlook 2010's Contact tab, but they will not populate the dialogue box that arise in response to my pressing the "To..." button when creating a new email message. The search box comes up, but it does not list any contact so that
 I could simply click on the desired existing contacts.</p>
<p>Also, no contact information is listed in the "Windows Contact" program (i.e., C:\Users\[my name]\Contacts). How can I export en mass the information in my Outlook Contacts folder to my Windows contact folder, and would this help the above issue?</p>

<p>Check if the contacts are listed in the contacts folder within Outlook.</p>
<p>If yes, then this issue could occur if your contact folder is not marked for use with your address book.</p>

<p>If you have Contacts in the Contacts folder but they are not accessible when you click on the To button, check these settings:</p>
<p>Make sure the Contact folder is enabled as an email address book. Right click the Contacts folder, choose Properties then Outlook Address Book. Is the box to enable as email address book is checked?</p>
<p>If this is grayed out, you'll need to make a new profile as you can't add the Outlook Address Book service in Outlook 2007 or 2010.</p>

<strong>Office Configuration Analyzer Tool </strong>(<strong>OffCAT</strong>) to identify the sources of this issue about sending an email message and to obtain resources on how to resolve them. Here's how to use the
<strong>OffCAT</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <strong>OffCAT </strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></em>.</li><li>After installing <strong>OffCAT</strong>, run a scan of your Outlook configuration. Note that, when OffCAT starts, it automatically checks for the list of latest known issues. Make sure that you let this process finish so that the scan of your Office program
 uses the latest issues list.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>I want to scan </strong>page, click <strong>Outlook</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that Outlook is running. Then, click <strong>Scan</strong>.</li><li>After scanning, review the scan results.</li><li>On the <strong>All issues </strong>tab, click the <strong>Filter </strong>control. If you do not see an
<strong>All</strong> <strong>issues </strong>tab in the scan results, <strong>OffCAT
</strong>did not detect an "<strong>Warning</strong>" or "<strong>Critical</strong>" known issues types.</li><li>Clear the <strong>Select All </strong>box.</li><li>Select all the following symptoms that applies to your issue, then click <strong>
OK</strong>. The following screenshot shows some of these symptoms:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5635ea9-d8c1-4a61-b93d-cf118e71598c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5635ea9-d8c1-4a61-b93d-cf118e71598c" /></a><br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not see any of these symptoms in the <strong>
Filter </strong>list, <strong>OffCAT </strong>did not detect any known issues for send/receive problems.</li></ul>
</li><li>The first issue that involves one of the select symptoms is displayed and expanded to show you more information about the issue. Click the
<strong>Click here to see possible online solutions to this issue </strong>link to open the article that contains information about a resolution.</li><li>Follow the resolution steps that are provided in the topic.</li><li>Repeat steps 9 &amp; 10 for all other issues that are listed in the filtered report.</li><li>Test Outlook to determine whether the send/receive problems still occur.</li></ol>

<p>It could be that the recipient's email address is incorrect or that an Outlook configuration is incorrectly set. For us to isolate the issue in sending an email through Outlook 2016, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to send email messages to other recipients aside from the one that you have posted on the screenshot?</li><li>Have you checked if the email address of the recipient is correct?</li></ol>

    <title>Password Incorrect in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhauerj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password Incorrect in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I have a OneNote file on OneDrive with several sections and one password-protected section.</p>
<p>Everything worked fine until yesterday, when I suddenly got the error message "Password is Incorrect" and I could no longer open the password protected section.</p>
<p>I get the same error message when trying to access the section from other two other computers (Win 7, Win 10).</p>
<p>I am absolutely certain that I enter the correct password.</p>
<p>Please advise!</p>

<p>Yes, I have tried to copy/paste and type the correct password on 3 different computers, both with Win 7 and with Win 10, with the same result (incorrect password error message).</p>
<p>And yes, I have tried to open the OneNote section online with 4 different browsers (Edge, IE, Firefox, Chrome) without success.</p>
<p>All other sections in this OneNote file open just fine.</p>

            <p>Maybe it is bug in processing keyboard input when configured 2 or more languages. Try switch keyboard to another language and type password again. I can solve the same problem with next steps:</p>
<p>1) the original password was&nbsp;set on English keyboard input</p>
<p>2) when I have typed password I had error: password incorrect</p>
<p>3) use mouse to switch to another keyboard</p>
<p>4) type the same password on another language: success</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I sure that password was set on English keyboard.</p>

<p>me too; I opened another question that sounds exactly the same.&nbsp; this tool has become more and more unreliable and I am beginning to consider changing to another solution (evernote?)&nbsp; that will work correctly.&nbsp; I see from the number of questions in the forum
 that you and I are not alone in this issue.&nbsp; Based on the responses Microsoft seems completely unaware of this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My feedback to MS - look at the growing frequency of this issue and stop suggesting we are entering the wrong password.&nbsp; After an hour this morning I was finally able to access the protected page but now without a lot of frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>OneDrive &#43; Family Room Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sauron za  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive &#43; Family Room Sharing</h2>
                    <p>I recently switched from an iPhone 5S to the Lumia 830.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used Photostream Sharing quite heavily in our family having recently had a baby and I therefore wanted to replicate the same thing with the new phone using OneDrive between my Lumia and my wife's iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Photostream your photos automatically upload and if you then choose to share them it simply creates a symbolic link of sorts to that photo in the shred folder without needing to upload it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive seems a bit dumb in this regard and there is no way to "re-share" my already uploaded camera roll in Windows Phone 8.1. Instead I need to re-upload all the photos I would like to share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only is it a waste of time, bandwidth and OneDrive space but it's horribly inefficient and cumbersome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am am I doing something wrong here? Or is this a limitation that might be fixed in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was really expecting Microsoft to be better at this with its more open approach to cloud storage.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If all you want to do is share the photos you take on your phone with your wife (or anyone else you choose), you can do this without be required to upload the photos a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go log into your OneDrive account from a computer and share the Camera Roll folder with anyone you choose by clicking in the upper right hand corner of the folder tile (when you move your&nbsp;cursor up there, a small white checkmark box will appear). After you
 click in the checkmark box, select the&nbsp;"Share" option in the black menu bar that runs across the top of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional photo folders that are stored on your OneDrive account, you can share those folders too.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I don't want to share the entire Camera Roll and that also defeats the entire purpose of having the Family Room feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suspected some options might be available on PC but again that's a bit silly if I take pictures on my phone.

Also why doesn't this website have a WP compatible mobile view?</p>

            <p>I see they've basically sorted this out with "Albums" but on iOS only at this point which is a bit strange.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Hopefully it comes across to WP quickly and gets incorporated in the default Room sharing system.</p>

<h2>            How to move a shared OneNote Notebook from OneDrive to SharePoint while preserving links to Notebook content&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>My company has some shared OneNote Notebooks, currently stored on OneDrive, that we need to move to SharePoint. To minimize disruption, we'd like to arrange it so that any existing links to paragraphs, pages, and sections in the current Notebooks will still
 work after the move. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tested that hasn't worked:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use OneNote's built in "Change location" feature (see screenshot below)</li><li>Create new Notebook and move content section by section (which is <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-a-onenote-for-windows-notebook-that-you-ve-shared-with-others-56c7659e-1850-49a6-8874-e2db6b440cd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft's recommended method</a> for moving a shared Notebook)</li></ul>
<p>I'm stumped. This seems technically impossible, but if we can find a way to do it, it would create a lot less of a headache for us and our hundreds of users who rely on these shared Notebooks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the notebooks are in your OneDrive for business, you can move the notebook in OneDrive Online: Sign in to Portal:&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portal.office.com</a>, &gt; click OneDrive icon &gt; find the notebooks
 &gt; click Actions &gt; Move to &gt; you will see a list of the SharePoint site you have access to &gt; Choose the SharePoint site and select a location.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5834bcfb-b178-4a90-93d7-cac9b4c2c0f6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5834bcfb-b178-4a90-93d7-cac9b4c2c0f6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the notebooks are in your personal OneDrive, this solution will not work. There are no channel to migrate data from personal account to business account. You will need to do it manually. Sorry about all the inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>I tested this method yesterday. As far as moving the Notebook went, it worked seamlessly; however, it did not meet our other requirement of preserving pre-existing links to the Notebook.</p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links to the notebook will change. The links to OneDrive and links to SharePoint are different. I forgot to mention this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<span>pre-existing links to the Notebook will not work, but other users can still access the notebook if you share it, assuming your main purpose&nbsp;is to share the notebook with others. You can share it again with all the
 user in SharePoint or OneDrive. You can also add users to the SharePoint site and they will have access to notebooks too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Alex</span></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you; it is our intent to share the new or moved Notebook from SharePoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've found in my own tests: it's actually possible to use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-a-onenote-for-windows-notebook-that-you-ve-shared-with-others-56c7659e-1850-49a6-8874-e2db6b440cd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft's recommended method</a> for moving a shared Notebook from OneDrive to SharePoint (move Notebook contents, one section at a time) and do it in such a way that some pre-existing links actually still work.
<strong>This was very exciting to discover</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The key I found is this: if I move sections from a OneDrive-based Notebook to a SharePoint-based Notebook, and the end-user already has the SharePoint-based Notebook open in OneNote 2016,
<em>and</em> the end-user allows that SharePoint-based Notebook to fully sync before they do anything else,
<em>then</em> some pre-existing links (that still point to the old OneDrive-based Notebook) will still work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Across several tests, what I consistently found is that pre-existing links to paragraphs and pages still work, though pre-existing links to sections do not. I can't even think of a hypothesis for this discrepancy, but I'm very happy to find that there's
 a way to do what I want while preserving at least some links. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have anything to add to what I've discovered or anything else I should be aware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nathan</p>

<p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During my tests, I move the notebooks and get the worming that some features will lost and the links to the Notebook does not work after it was moved. I missed the section and pages part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I Know, If I share the whole notebook with a user, the link will contain&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://&lt;organization&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/&lt;email address&gt;, which means the notebook saved in OneDrive for business.
</p>
<p>Links from SharePoint usually start with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://&lt;organization&gt;.sharepoint.com/sites/&lt;site name&gt;/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links to sections and pages contains the same part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can make this work, that would be a very good solution.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware of the differing root paths for OneDrive-based Notebooks and SharePoint-based Notebooks; that's why I was so surprised that this worked. Apparently OneNote has the "smarts" to reroute links when content is moved from one Notebook to another (AND
 the user already has both Notebooks open in OneNote 2016 at the time of the move).

<p>Hi&nbsp;Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. If you have the links, I suggest you check it in browser too(right click the section or page and copy link). It is possible that the changes hasn't synced to the client. If the links still working, that's a good news for both of
 us, but I did not find any documentation to explain this.</p>

    <title>Incoming email delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ayumi2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming email delay</h2>
                    <p>All the email accounts I've added to Outlook.com have incoming email delays on my LAPTOP/DESKTOP computers. All emails don't reach the inbox for about half an hour and this is quite frustrating as I'm using these email accounts for work. (my own @hotmail.com
 email account has no problems as messages are received instantly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried many things to fix and understand the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've contacted the email/host service provider and everything works fine on their end. Even using their hosted Webmail service, the email is received instantly in Webmail whereas in Outlook.com (on my laptop/desktop) I'm still waiting to receive the same
 email&nbsp;</li><li>I've used the Outlook Application on iPad and it works perfectly, email is also received instantly whereas in&nbsp;Outlook.com (on my laptop/desktop) I'm still waiting to receive the same email&nbsp;</li><li>I've tried removing and adding the same email accounts again but it doesn't work</li><li>Also important to know is that I encounter the SAME problem on my Android cell phone. The Outlook application on my Android cell phone also experiences incoming email delays</li><li>I've been sending simple test emails (with no photos no attachments) and it doesn't make a difference. Incoming email is still delayed on laptop/desktop/android</li><li>I've tried different browsers and it doesn't work</li></ul>
<p>I'm nearly convinced it's something that needs to be addressed by Microsoft/Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>The delay is unbearable for work purposes. If nothing can be fixed, I will have to find a solution in another email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>This is most likely an image file--a photo taken by a Nikon camera The file extension would likely be .jpg.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Nikon digital cameras comply with the "Design Rule for Camera File Systems" Rules (DCFS). This is an industry standard set of guidelines that govern many aspects of digital camera operation.<br />
<br />
One of the guidelines is for the file and folder structure of saved images. According to the Rules Nikon digital images will begin with "DSCN" which stands for "Digital Still Camera - Nikon."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I found this by googling for "DSCN," which also turns up many other similar answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Microsoft Office Picture Manager, you can open the file in that and print directly from it. Or you can insert the photo into a Word document and print that. If you are the owner of the camera that took the photo, it may well have come with photo
 editing software that would allow you to print it, or there may be free software available that would do the job.</p>

    <title>Office 365 cutover migration with Azure Connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephensheridan- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 cutover migration with Azure Connect</h2>
                    
<p>HI All,</p>
<p>I need help migrating to office 365.&nbsp; I currently have a exchange 2010 environment with 30 users.&nbsp; I was planning to do a cut over migration to move these mailboxes to the cloud, however, during testing I have&nbsp;"jumped the gun and installed and activated&nbsp;Azure
 AD Connect and synced my users AD accounts to office 365.</p>
<p>Further reading has revealed that you cannot perform cut over migrations with AD connect already in place, so,&nbsp;I have two options.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Carry on and do a hybrid migration</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;deactivate / uninstall azure connect and&nbsp;continue with the cut over migration</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of the complexity of hybrid migrations and would prefer to stick with the cutover migration.&nbsp; Would anyone know how to revert my tenant back to a condition where I could attempt a cut over migration again?</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. By default, it will take 72 hours after deactivating.</p>
<p><em>Question 1: After it's disabled, will the synced accounts be automatically removed or is it just a matter of deleting them?</em></p>
<p>The answer is no. The user shows Synced from Active Directory will be changed to in cloud. You can just delete them manually.</p>
<p><em>Question 2: Also, when re-enabling AD Connect, is it just the SMTP address match, which syncs the AD and azure accounts together or do I need to watch out for anything else?</em></p>
<p>They will use SMTP address match to sync automatically. You only need to make sure the SMTP addresses are same between account in AD and cloud.</p>
<p><em>Question 3: Finally, the cutover migration will sync quite a few mailboxes that will not be required.&nbsp; Is it better to remove these accounts before re-enabling Azure Connect, or after?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>You need to do it before re-enabling Azure Connect. If you sync them to cloud and assign the licenses, the mailboxes will appear again. So you don’t need to do it.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

                    <p>I have a single sim 950 XL bought from Amazon, I think it is a Hong Kong variant. It picked up a new&nbsp;firmware and is now stuck in airplane mode ( won't/can't toggle off ). Tried everything for many hours&nbsp;including Device Recovery
 Tool and many re-sets&nbsp;to no avail, just restarts in airplane mode.&nbsp;I am in the U.S. and with T-Mobile&nbsp; , it worked great till the firmware update when a message said 'sim settings have changed and needs to reboot' That was it...
