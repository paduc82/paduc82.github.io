<h2>            Image Click counter macro</h2>
                    <p>hi im new to the macro environment and i want to create a<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;counter to tell me how many times people selected each of the images that i'm going to have in total, lets say &nbsp;that
 there is 3 images that links to 3 different slides and 1 person clicks the first one, another person clicks the last one and so on. i want to record how many people choose the first image, the second one and the third one and so on, its like doing count= count
 +1 and lets say that at the end of the month i want to know how many people pick the image 1 in total, image 2 in total and image 3 in total, i tried doin this code&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
Sub contador()<br />
Dim cont As Integer<br />
Dim cont1 As Integer<br />
cont = 0<br />
cont1 = cont + 1<br />
MsgBox (cont1)<br />
End Sub<br />
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1de1be33-aaa4-473e-93a3-10dcd9f16bc6" /></p>
<p>but wen i add msgbox (cont1) it only keeps showing me the first click every time insted of showing me the count of the next time is selected, here is a image i know that, i think that becouse i have the msgbox it only shows me that same number so i tried
 to make another macro that can show me the total of times insted of show in it every time.</p>

            <p>Not sure I understand why you think you need several macros. At most you need one for each shape and maybe one to read the tags. You could actually do this with just one macro that checked which shape was clicked but that might be too complex at this stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem one though is you cannot have a hyperlink on a shape AND a run macro action. It's one or the other so your macro will need to BOTH increment the tag counter AND jump to the correct slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lets look at the macro for Image1 ((assuming it hyperlinks to slide 10)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Image1()<br />
Dim iCount As Integer ' this will be zero at this time<br />
'If the tag exists set iCount to its value otherwise leave iCount=0<br />
If ActivePresentation.Tags("Image1") &lt;&gt; "" Then iCount = Val(ActivePresentation.Tags("Image1"))<br />
'update the tag<br />
ActivePresentation.Tags.Add "Image1", CStr(iCount + 1)<br />
SlideShowWindows(1).View.GotoSlide 10<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to write a similar macro for Image2 and Image3 just changing the names where they appear and the hyperlink slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To read the tag count</strong></p>
<p>
Sub recoverData()<br />
MsgBox "Image1 clicks " &amp; vbTab &amp; ActivePresentation.Tags("Image1") &amp; vbCrLf _<br />
&amp; "Image2 clicks " &amp; vbTab &amp; ActivePresentation.Tags("Image2") &amp; vbCrLf _<br />

<h3> kirrintilbrook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook asking for google sign in using gmail account</h2>
                    Why is Outlook asking me to sign into Google and allow access to apps offline EVERY SINGLE TIME I open, send or delete an email from my gmail account? Is this from a recent update? It is such a timewaster! How can this be fixed so it remembers that I have
 given access instead of asking every 20 secs! So annoying!!

            Hi 
<br />I had problems with my password also the best thing to do is use a gmail application password. 
<br /><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1858...</a>
<br />First get the gmail application password then follow the document below to change in outlook.

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this didn't work! I have deleted my gmail account from Outlook and am using the normal Gmail application but I prefer the format of Outlook. Hopefully I can get it sorted so that I can reinstall it!</p>

            Whoops sorry I posted In the incorrect question. 
<br />Have you tried to re-add your gmail with the application password? I had to remove the account and re-add it with the application password. I know its frustrating when I re-added it worked.

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope, that didn't work either. Just trying to set up the account in Outlook I had to login to my Google account 4 times!! Then I set up the app password and went back into Outlook and deleted 1 email and had to sign in again, then again the next time I opened
 an email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works on my phone but not on my PC so not sure what the issue is there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            Hi Kirrin,
<br />Give the below a try. Possibly could be some other extension or add in causing the problem. 
<br />Start outlook In Safe Mode
<br />Open Outlook in safe mode and then try to attach an attachment: 
<br />1. Close Outlook. 
<br />2. Press the windows key + R on the keyboard to open the Run window. 
<br />3. In Run window and type outlook /safe (space between 'outlook' and '/'.) 
<br />If you are able to work with Outlook without any problem then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Outlook, click on File &lt;Options&lt; Add-ins. 
<br />2. Under Manage select COM Add-ins. 
<br />3. Click on GO options beside Manage, uncheck all the add-ins and click Ok. 
<br />4. Try to open Outlook and check if it works fine. 
<br />Then add the COM back in one by one to figure out which one is causing the problem. 
<br />
<br />If It still is not working
<br />Make sure updates have been installed. 
<br />Try repairing Outlook

<br />
<br />If the issue persists then then create a new email profile

            I hope this is okay to ask? I'm having a similar issue for the second time within the past year. Is it possible to remove the Gmail account and replace it with an email account not associated with Gmail? My Gmail address is my startup account for my current
 MS account on my laptop.&nbsp;

<p>I have been having this issue on my home PC for approx the last week (Since around Monday 20th May 2019). I hadn't changed or updated any setting as far as I am aware.<br />
My laptop's are also both Windows 10 and are on the Same latest Build as Outlook (Office 365 Pro Plus) Version 1904 (Build 11601.20320 Click-to-run monthly channel) - they do not have this issue - It is just on GMail IMAP account - other IMAP accounts are fine
 0 I know this as I removed the GMail and had no problems. So it's frustrating that it can't be anything changed at GMail - otherwise my 2 other laptops would also be affected. Presumably if it was an application password at GMail needed the other laptops wouldn't
 be "working" either.<br />
Things I have tried - which have not worked -<br />
Making sure I am on latest build.<br />
Repairing Outlook<br />
Using "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365"<br />
Ensuring I have the same account setting as other "working" laptops.</p>
<p>Disabling all COM-addIns.<br />
Removing my profile and re-adding. Only when adding GMail last did the issue re-appear.<br />
Revoking the permissions for Outlook in Google (<code> https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</code> ) - Interestingly when Re-adding, The permissions in Google have now been changed to "" from "Microsoft Outlook" to "Microsoft AppsAnd Services"
 - and now when I get the problem, I don't get it asking for off-line permission, I have to re-authenitace for "Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail" - and "See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly
 available"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting Outlook in Safe-Mode does resolve the problem though - so persumably it is something other than a COM-AddIn causing the problem. I just don't know what to try next.<br />
also, trying Outlook and the GMail acconut on a different user on the same machine works.</p>
<p>Given that Safe-Mode works, and a different user on the machine works and that what is being asked for by Google has changed since permissions have been renewed, it does make me think that a token for Google somewhere is either not being updated or can't
 be stored - making it seem more likely (to me at least) that the issue lies in the &lt;user&gt;/appData folder somewhere. In fat thinking about it now - this issue started after my PC suddenly restarted when my son was playing a game - I probably had Outlook open
 at the time - which further suggests that the filesystem has got corrupted somewhere - although running an errro cehck on the Hard Drive found no errors. Wondering if some file shas been set as read-only, or similar. I don't have tim to cehck now, but I'm
 going to try and uninstall Office, then ensure I clear out the &lt;appdata&gt;\Roaming\Microsoft\Outlook folder - unless anyone has any better suggestions?<br />
<br />

<p>I have finally got this sorted. I'm not sure whether it's a co-inceidence or not, but my Organisation switched on Multi-Factore Authentication, and then my other machines satrted running into the same problem.<br />
Just Updating Office didnt work, so on each machine, I removed my Gmail account, un-installed Office 365, then re-installed again. I then added my GMail account with the "new" method of adding - as per -
<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-gmail-account-to-outlook-70191667-9c52-4581-990e-e30318c2c081<br />
<br />
Now, about 24 hours on, I haven't had any problems. I did notice, that in the Advanced Tab for "Internet Email Settings" there is now a type of encryption for both Incoming and Outgoing connections - whereas there used to be just the one for Ougtoing (I think).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps everyone.</p>

            Give it a try. The initial installation of 365 is just enough of a stub to start loading the rest of the program when you start it for real.&nbsp; It is probably faster than a normal install.&nbsp; Very different process.<br />

Yea they sure aren't making anything easy for IT guys anymore. All these changes for the worst. I cant even get trial keys for Office 2010 anymore to get by a few days while I wait for the key to be shipped. So got to temporarily install our pro plus version then uninstall and re-install home and business. Microsoft ftw!! 



I just about to try this Office 2013 install that you are describing, let me see how much this is going to **** me off.

            we sorted it today. &nbsp;we&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;one of the licenses to a machine. &nbsp;you can then login to the online portal and in there you can download the office 2013 Home &amp; Business media for backup and offline install. you need a license to access this portal.
<div>We have 20 x pc's to install and the customer only has a standard ADSL line so waiting for th CTR would take an while. &nbsp;this way I can burn several copies of the media and have about 5 machines installing at once from DVD or server. &nbsp;hope this helps someone</div>

            <p>Be careful, this will not work, and you will get burned.&nbsp; The software you D/L from Office365 has a hook in it and you have to be logged into 365 to run it.&nbsp; This way, Microsoft keeps people from signing up for a month, cancel and keeping the $450 Pro Plus
 edition of the software.&nbsp; O365 OFFICE PRO PLUS MUST PHONE HOME every time to work.&nbsp; ( I think..)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Jimminey Crickets sake, why cant MS just make the Media available like Quickbooks does.&nbsp; Why have to fuss around looking for a DVD or wait for 2 hours to D/L D/L D/L when you have the $KEY CODE$ in your hand????????</p>

            hi , no we didnt download the office pro plus that comes wiht office 365 E3
<div><br />
<div>the media is for office 2013 home and business, we downloaded it and then installed it to one machine with no LAN cable quickly, it installed and asked for the key, it will probs need to activte but i havnt done any more with it today.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the downlaod is called HomeBusinessRetail and is 2.1gb</div>
<div><br />
<div>i dont think they want us to have the media for offline install. yes i agree that other vendors provide the media easily and you have to license it</div>

            just to add its an ISO that comes down, not an installer like in office 2010 where you could imstall from hard disk (direct)
<div><br />
<div>you either burn to disk or mount the iso with 3rd party sw such as virtual clonedrive (free) and run the setup, hope this helps. &nbsp;</div>
<div>we should be installing to 20 new machines over the next 2 days - (1 engineer &amp; 1 x broadband)</div>

<br />
Actually no, as I understand it. <br />
<br />
In "developed" countries the 2013 retail license no longer includes a disk, nor the other important user rights formerly associated with the retail license. It has been "improved" into a product key card only.<br />

    <title>Is Windows Update Broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave dorshimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Windows Update Broken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Build 9926 of the Techincal preview for Win10 and for some reason Windows update seems to be having seizures and won't update the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a clean load on a dedicated machine that meets all the requirements for the OS so there are no carryover&nbsp;issues with upgrade from another version, but for some reason I seem to be hung up at "Downloading updates 45%", which is actually an improvement
 over yesterday (3/19/15) where is stayed at 0% for around 10 hours before I shut the machine off for the night.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Or are the Microsoft servers just getting pounded by all the testers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dave D.</p>

    <title>Onenote cannot connect to onedrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Onenote cannot connect to onedrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi forum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Onenote: I can see my notebooks in Onenote online and they are visible in Onedrive. However when I try to link to them from Onenote on a Windows PC, I cannot sign in to onedrive. After filling in my credentials, the sign in sign pops up again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to open the file from Onedrive (open with onenote) I get an error message, firstly a security warning 'this location might be unsafe'. When continuing 'yes' and giving my credentials again, it gives the next error message 'this location cannot
 being opened. It might not exist or you are not authorized to open. Contact the owner.... '. (A long address starting with https//d.docs.live.net/.....).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried several options with credentials manager, repair, reset, re-installation, but perhaps it has to deal with the laptop I use. On my former laptop it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong and who has an answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is highly appreciated!</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t edit this docx file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t edit this docx file</h2>
                    <p>I need to edit a Word doc on the Mac. &nbsp;Probably not important, but the docx file is embedded in a pptx deck.</p>
<p>I need to change one word in the docx file, but I cannot. &nbsp;The docx has question/answer pairs. &nbsp;I need to change a word in one of the questions.</p>
<p>The answer 'field' says 'click here to enter text' and when you click in the answer field, and start typing, the 'click here to enter text' text dissappears.</p>
<p>Not only can I not edit the question text, whenever I click in the question text, the focus automatically goes to the answer field. &nbsp;If I try to change text via Find/Replace, I see that the Replace option is grayed out.</p>
<p>How can I edit this docx file?</p>

            <p>Hi DrGaryG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting back with additional details about the issue.&nbsp;Just to verify, when you said that you're using IE11 but you don't get Outlook mail through the browser, where exactly are you trying to view&nbsp;your&nbsp;emails? To clarify this, we'd really appreciate
 it if you'll give us the screenshot of where you're accessing your emails in the private message area that I created for security reasons. To view it, just click on the "<strong>You have a private reply to this message</strong>" link above your post and make
 sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would also help us have a better understanding of the issue so we can give you an accurate resolution&nbsp;if you'll get back to us with the answers to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are the contacts trying to send you emails? Is it via web browser, via mail client, or via mobile device?</li><li>When was the last time that you have received a non-garbled email from AOL users?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made to your account prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<ul>
<li>When in windowed mode the entire game is not in the window. It is pushed down by a black space.
<ul>
<li>It only works inside full screen mode.
<ul>
<li>I'm then unable to use the Windows game recorder.</li></ul>

            There were some stated&nbsp;issues about games in full-screen mode.&nbsp; Also both AMD and NVIDIA have more recent Windows 10 video drivers available that would be worth trying.

<br />
<br />Right click that image and choose Wrap Text - Behind Text
<br />
<br />Than you will be able to move that image around the page and resize it to your preferred size, so your text also fits on the same page . ..

<p>Hi&nbsp;<strong>Rezaul</strong>,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<br />
To isolate your concern, we'd like to know if this issue with opening an <strong>
xlsm</strong> file format only happens to a certain document or it happens to any other documents you have. Also, do you own the specific file or was it shared only to you?&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, I'd recommend&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>installing the latest Office updates</strong></span></a></span>.

 in safe mode</strong></a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to check if a certain add-in is causing the issue.

            Why don't you just try it? Many pages at Microsoft haven't been updated for Windows 8.1, but anything that works with Windows 7 will probably work with Windows 8.1 as well.

            <p>Word viewer is working on windows 8.1, I have experienced, but it is like office 2003, the style is odd. But there is a nice app for view word files, "Word Viewer" in the app store.</p>

            <p>thanks for your suggestion. I have favorable and unfavorable experience with this.&nbsp; First, after installing the app I went to my email and clicked on the attachment.&nbsp; The word Viewer app then showed a message that said it could not open the document in something
 called snap mode!!!&nbsp; Essentially it needed a full page to open the document.&nbsp; What I ended up having to do was save the attachment in the email to a hard drive folder.&nbsp; Then exit email and open the word viewer app--then search for the file on the hard drive
 and then it opened it just fine.&nbsp; I would have hoped that just clicking on the attachment in email would enable the app to just oipen the document in a full page and then I could close the document and be back in mail after reading it.&nbsp; Do you know if there
 is something I need to do to ebable this to work? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Even though on the MS download center it says word viewer replaces all earlier versions of word viewer--when I tried to use it for my email attachment, it showed that it could not open the document without me having to download a compatipility&nbsp; package.&nbsp;
 As it turns out the word viewer in the MS app store works without&nbsp; any other downloads required.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion though .</p>

<h2>            Missed conversation email from Skype for Business freezes Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever a user misses a conversation on Skype for Business, the generated email with that conversation, makes Outlook non-responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to restart Outlook, won't work, unless I log into the outlook.office365.com web-based email address and delete that specific auto-generated email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">several users </span>where I work, BUT not to all.<br />
</p>
<p>Happened on Windows 7, with Outlook 2016 updated to the latest version, version 1803 (build 9126.2275)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas why this happens? Is there any solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Hello Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened from the version 170x (don't recall exactly). It happened after a clean fresh install of Office 2016. Happens aprox. once a week, depends on how often people are using Skype for Business that week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that once the 'freeze' happens, I can only enter via web-mail and delete the email causing the issue. I can't enter Outlook and disable any plug-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not know about the SaRA tool, I'll try it on another issue I have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. I'll keep this post updated later on.</p>

    <title>How to sum every 4th cell in a column of numbers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to sum every 4th cell in a column of numbers&#63;</h2>
                    Suppose that A1:A100 is a column of numbers.&nbsp; How can I sum A1, A5, A9 etc, i.e. every 4th cell?<br />
<br />
For example, if A1 contains 1 and A2 contains =A1*10 copied down through A15, the sum of every 4th cell is 1000100010001.<br />
<br />
I tried the following, to no avail:<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT(INDEX(A1:A15,4*ROW($1:$4)-3))<br />
<br />
The problem is:&nbsp; in that context, ROW($1:$4) returns a single value (1) instead of the intended array {1,2,3,4}.&nbsp; I've run into that problem before and I think someone suggested an "obvious" remedy.&nbsp; But I've forgotten what that is.<br />
<br />
I also tried the following less-desirable alternative (because it is volatile), again to no avail:<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT(OFFSET(A1,4*(ROW($1:$4)-1),0))<br />
<br />
In that context, ROW($1:$4) does return the array {1,2,3,4} and the expression is reduced to OFFSET(A1,{0,4,8,12},0) as intended.&nbsp; But that returns an array of #VALUE errors.<br />
<br />
How can I correct the OFFSET-based expression?<br />
<br />
How can I coerce ROW($1:$4) to consistently return an intended array in both (any) context?<br />

<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
For my purposes, that should be SUMPRODUCT(--(MOD(ROW(A1:A100)<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">-1</span>, 4)=0), A1:A100) since I want to start with A1.<br />
<br />
And for posterity, ROW(1:100) also works.&nbsp; That eliminates the illusion that the MOD expression's correctness depends on the fact that the range to select from (A1:A100) starts in row 1.<br />

<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>Although you may have taken all the necessary precautions to prevent your phone from any liquid damage.
</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>The fact that you sometimes confined yourself within certain areas with different temperature variations,could result your unit being affected by water.Please note that this doesn't mean that you must have dropped
 the unit in any form of liquid. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>This could have occurred whilst outdoors on a rainy or&nbsp;cold day and didn't provide adequate protection&nbsp;required to&nbsp;your device.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>Because your unit has incurred water damage this will normally void your warranty
</span></font><span>conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span>Should you wish to have your phone repaired then you could be charged for any service brought forward.</span></font></p>

<h2>            Loan Amortization schedule with 2 pymt amounts and unknown interest rate</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create an amortization schedule on an Excel workbook where the interest rate is unknown and the lender will not provide it(already a done deal for someone else).</p>
<p>Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Loan Amt. $149,775.</p>
<p>payments:&nbsp; 66</p>
<p>1st 6 @ $99</p>
<p>Next 60 @ $3,259.00</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up an amortization schedule plugging in different interest rates with fixed payments, but either the principle does not tie out or there is a balance at the end of the 66 payments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; When I plug in 9.21%, I get 0 at the end of 66.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>(monthly it is 9.21% / 12)</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if the equations for month 61 is correct.&nbsp; Your balance jumps back up from 6383 to 16,025, when the value should continue to decrease. &nbsp;(should be around 3,162)</p>
<p>The equation I gave seems to be correct at about 9.21%</p>

<h2>            Nokia social 1.5.215 has serious bug&#33;</h2>
                    I posed this query to Nokia employee skyee and Svi on this forum. Is anyone else facing the same thing? Here is what I asked them- Please refer to this thread. discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/ Phone-Applications/quot-Your-access- to-the-service-has-expired-quot/m-
 p/1326217. Even I am facing the same issue. When you launch social, you get all activity page. If you try to select any one of your accounts, it says "your service has expired. To update service countact your operator". What does that mean? I tried using the
 separate Facebook app installed by this social 1.5.215. It in fact should give me my Facebook account while it leads me to the same all activity page. So is the case with twitter app. I installed the older 1.3.237 which is working just fine.Thinking that the
 problem will be solved, I installed the 1.5 version again from software update client on my phone. But it was same again. Either the update available on Nokia servers has developed some glitch or the update itself has

            Has anyone else observed this? If you regularly use the social app you should find this problem. I have now installed the older version 1.3.237. And waiting for the reply from the Nokia employees.

            Even I had been using this since I installed it shortly after belle. I realised this issue only yesterday. To give an idea this is what happens-<br />
1. When you launch social you are taken to all activity page where you get all your Facebook and twitter feeds in one place.<br />
2. Now if you want to use Facebook only so as to check notifications etc. what you do is to select options and tap your Facebook account. This is when you get the message that "your subscription to the service has expired. To update service contact your operator".
 I can in anyway access all activity page.<br />
3. Okay, I try to open Facebook thru the separate Facebook app that is installed by social 1.5.215. This again opens all activity page instead of Facebook. Same is the case with twitter app.<br />
So I Cant say social is not working at all. It is working, but has bugs at least some of us because there are three posts in this forum including mine regarding this issue.

<br />
From: skyee Sent: 1:14 PM Hi! Just checking the thread in a second, but<br />
one question first: Have you set the date<br />
&amp; time of your phone correctly? We<br />
normally see those error messages if<br />
those settings are not correct.

            One more update there- I Cant upload<br />
images from gallery using share online<br />
button. I get either "image not<br />
supported" or "feature not supported"<br />
message. Seems like the same problem<br />
as has been the case with version 1.5.214. But I am using version 1.5.215<br />
which is the latest one. By the way, I am<br />
now using the older 1.3.237 and the<br />
share online feature works just fine.

<p>Hi timkamat, Yes I have followed exactly what you wrote &amp; I have no problems, FB &amp; twitter open normally from the all activity page.</p>
<p>If you add the <u>fb summary widget</u> to the homescreen that should take you to FB, do you still get the message then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw no problems uploading photos either. I would've thought that you'd get an image not supported error message if the file type wasn't suitable for use on fb, say .tif.</p>

            Oh my God! I went thru hell because of this social. Unable to solve the problem by any means I did a 3 finger reset. In fact I had done this before when my phone was on Anna. I lost maps, store and a few apps.but all these could be got back via software
 update menu where I could all the updates. I thought same would happen with belle, but that was not to be. There was no way getting them back. I lost a whole lot of apps. I had to go all the way to Nokia care centre travelling 30km! I got the firmware reinstalled
 and all was well. And thank God again, I am still under warranty.

<h2>            mac word document_new&#40;&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am wonder why the below code related to <b>Document_New()</b> is not working on the mac word 2011, it is successfully working on the word 2010<br />
<br />
<b>Code:</b><br />
<br />
<i>Private Sub Document_New()<br />
MsgBox "test message box"<br />
End Sub</i><br />
<br />
I am just expecting a pop up whenever I open the template, but somehow the above code is not working in mac. Later on I wanted to replace MsgBox with user defined forms. But as, this simple MsgBox itself is not working, I am not able proceed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please, let me know possible work around.<br />
<br />
Thank you !!<br />

I have tried the above code, and put AutoNew and AutoOpen in my code and it still does not working.
<br />
<br />
Below are the exact steps, I am following !! <br />
<br />
1. I have created test.dotm template<br />
2. I went to Tools &gt; Macro &gt; Visual Basic editor<br />
3. Double clicked on ThisDocument<br />
4. In the code window pasted the above code suggested by you <br />
5. save the document, closed it and re-opend it, still the MsgBox "Test" is not popped up<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
Please let me know the possible workaround, <br />
Sorry to bother you again, I am new to the mac plugin thing <br />
<br />

            The <i>Document_New</i> syntax does not work on the Mac. The simplest version that works on my Mac is this:
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub AutoNew()</div>
<div>MsgBox "test message box"</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, it has to be stored in the template on which the new document is based. In general, that would be Normal.dotm. So just open the editor and paste the code, then test by doing Cmd N.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you open the template (via the Open menu) where your macro is stored, the macro won't execute. You have to create a document based on that template, which you do by double-clicking on the template, for instance.</div>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply,<br />
I had tried the same thing, I have created one .dotm templates and tried both the method 1. Document_New() and 2. AutoNew(). and I am also opening it by double click only.<br />
<br />
But nothing is happening, I am stuck with this simple things, later on I am planning t replace this simple message box with some user generated forms, But this simple thing is restricting me<br />
<br />
Please, let me know some workaround, I am novice to this mac plugin developing thing&nbsp;

            So I guess I'd never actually tested the double-click method—it does not work here either, counterintuitive as that is.
<div><br />
<div>What <u>does</u> work here is this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Place the template in the "My Templates" folder (that is, /Users/YOUR_NAME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates).&nbsp;If you create a new document and save it as .dotm, Word will select that folder for you.</li><li>Use <i>File &gt; Open &gt; New from Template</i>&nbsp;(Cmd Shift P).</li><li>Select the "My Templates" category and double click on your template.</li></ol>
<div>And of course, if you store the macro in Normal.dotm, it will work with the regular
<i>File &gt; New Blank Document </i>menu option (Cmd N).</div>

<br />
<div>Document_New works on my machines and on machines where my customers use products of mine. The code I shared is what allows it to work... at least in my small world of experience.</div>

            Sorry, Rich, should have said "my Mac" in both instances.
<div><br />
<div>And you are right, it does work, but only if properly placed in the "This Document" component. Just like you said! Ah, who reads instructions nowadays, uh?</div>

            Thank you Rich !!<br />
<br />
The code suggested&nbsp; by you is working, And for the mac the template need to be in My Template folder only, And one can not open that template just by double clicking it. On the other hand in PC that is not the case, one can put template at any location and
 can open it by double clicking it. <br />

            Your original code will run when the document is saved as .docm or .dotm when double-clicked in Finder if you turn the document in to a Stationery pad file.
<div><br />
<div>To turn the file into a Stationery pad file:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Save and then close your document.</li><li>In Finder, right click and choose Get Info</li><li>In the General section of the Get Info dialog click the check box for Stationary Pad.</li></ol>
