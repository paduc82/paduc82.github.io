<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update - can no longer Run as Administrator</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my main Windows 10 PC to Creators Update. Since then, "Run as Administrator" no longer works for most programs. It always worked previously in the Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sole user of this PC, and my account has Administrator privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the Windows key and start typing the name of a program, e.g. "Command" or "cmd" (for Command Prompt), and right-click on it in the search results, "Run as Administrator" appears as one of the options. But choosing "Run as Administrator" does absolutely
 nothing. There is no UAC prompt, and the program does not launch at all. I've also tried using Shift-Ctrl-Enter on the search result, which
<em>should</em> do the same thing as "Run as Administrator", but get the same result, e.g. nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing goes for Windows Powershell, and ANY other programs for which "Run as Administrator" is an option. These programs DO run if I attempt to launch them normally (without "Run as Administrator"), just not with elevated rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem also happens when I browse through the Start Menu, right-click a program, and choose "More &gt; Run as Administrator" from the context menu. And, it happens right-clicking ANY program shortcut, on the Desktop or anywhere on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I CAN get a program to run as Administrator <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
IF</span> I right-click a shortcut to it, select Properties, Shortcut tab, Advanced, and check "Run as Administrator" (and click on all the "Okay" buttons to save the change). THEN, double-clicking the shortcut will give me a UAC prompt, and if I click yes,
 launches the program with elevated rights.&nbsp; I can also locate the actual .exe file on disk, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator", and it will work as expected. But the first workaround would require me to create additional shortcuts for every program
 which I might want to run elevated, and the second is too cumbersome to do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possibly-related problem is that on the Quick Access menu (right-click on the Start button), most of the tools will not launch. This includes Event Viewer, Device Manager, Disk Management, Computer Management, Command Prompt, Command Prompt (Admin), Task
 Manager, and File Explorer. (all the ones which ultimately open Settings pages, on the other hand, DO work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to try fixing this, I've tried "sfc /scannow" (which finds no integrity violations), "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" (which also finds nothing wrong), disabling UAC (no effect). I've also tried making a new user account with admin rights,
 but it had the same problem. I've even gone so far as to do a "repair install" of Windows 10 from a Creators Update ISO image, following this tutorial (<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html</a>).
 Again, no dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen posts from other users who have the same or similar problems with Creators Update. In particular,
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/cant-run-powershell-or-cmdexe-as-administrator/735d8a8e-2647-4265-a9fd-33b67f603c12">
this post</a> is nearly identical to the problem I'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creators Update has otherwise been working well, but this one issue is really annoying to a power user like me. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Actually, I discovered that the problem was caused by a shell extension installed along with one of my major application programs. Disabling this extension cleared up the "Run as Administrator" issue AND the non-functional Quick Access menu. Apparently,
 the upgrade to Creators Update munged up this extension, and it was interfering with the normal shell functions. (I was able to re-enable the extension afterwards, which must have properly re-registered it, as everything still worked afterwards.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has this problem, I recommend getting the tool <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ShellExView</a> and use it to find the troublesome shell extension. Basically, you check the "Options/Hide all Microsoft extensions" setting, then sort by the Type column so all Context Menu items are grouped together. Then, it's a matter of disabling them
 in small groups, then restarting the PC and testing, until you find the extension causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shell extensions can do so many useful things, but sometimes they break. *shrug*</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The printer spooler is most likely&nbsp;loading drivers&nbsp; or other print software and hitting memory corruption which causes the service to stop on initialization.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b><br />
Method 1: </b>You can run this tool which should clean stuff out of the registry to allow the spooler service to get started. &nbsp;Once done, reinstall the the Windows 7 driver for the printer device.<br />
Here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>Also, check the dependencies of the Print Spooler. &nbsp;<br />
a. In Services, right-click on&nbsp;<strong>Print Spooler&nbsp;</strong>and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Dependencies&nbsp;</strong>tab. The first box lists all of the system services that must be running for Print Spooler to start. These are the&nbsp;<strong>dependencies</strong>.<br />
c. Make a note of each service, click OK and then start each service upon which Print Spooler is dependent, if the service is not already started. If a service was not started, right-click it, click Properties and then confirm that the&nbsp;<strong>Startup type
 is Automatic.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Hope this helps. &nbsp;If the issue persists, please reply, we will be happy to help you.</p>

            In the account settings of the Mail app, where it displays the incoming and outgoing servers; uncheck ALL boxes you see on the page and double check the port number for the outgoing mail server.&nbsp; Then try to send emails.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work you can either setup the accounts with the Outlook.com web site and use the web browser or you can wait for the Windows 8.1 Preview which will have the Preview version of Outlook RT.&nbsp; In fact, that would give a good test for Outlook RT.<br />

            You can try for some alternate apps in the Store.&nbsp; That is the only place you can get software for the RT models.&nbsp; If your particular setup is and "Intranet" and is not on the Internet, then Outlook.com won't work because you will have a closed loop system.<br />
<br />
BUT if you do have regular Internet access then Outlook.com will be the only other option at the moment unless there is something in the Store.&nbsp; There are quite a few programs in the Store that might do the job.<br />
<br />
Outlook RT will be included in the Windows 8.1 Preview which is a beta open to the public and it will be available sometime on or after the 26th.&nbsp; The final release may come out in October from the last word I had heard but may come out sooner.&nbsp; The actual
 release date of the final version is still unknown at this time.<br />
<br />
Now you can use the Outlook.com web site as a temporary fix until you can find something else.&nbsp; the Mail app in Windows 8 has been a disaster since the day it was created.&nbsp; Some people actually like it, I call it the "thing".&nbsp; I don't class it as an email program
 myself.<br />

            Not really.&nbsp; I didn't look for them myself but others have here on the forum.&nbsp; What you can do is a search on the forum for "IMAP" and or "POP3" (both use a similar system setup) and there are a few threads that mentioned some apps.&nbsp; Those cost money and
 they might not actually work the way you think.<br />
<br />
Outlook.com became a "backup" plan for those with the Surface RT tablets since they cannot install regular programs.&nbsp; The Mail app should have at least functioned and chances are that it is the port number that maybe throwing it off.<br />
<br />
Currently I am on a Linux system right now and doing upgrades and updates to it but will be back on a Windows machine later today and will scan around to see what I can find in the Store.<br />
<br />
If you don't come up with anything yourself, keep an eye on this thread and what I can find, I will post the name of the program so that you can do a search on the Store and it should take you to it.<br />
<br />
The Windows 8.1 Preview will be out day after tomorrow sometime but you may not want to chance a "beta" in a company wide setup though.&nbsp; It would be the only way to get Outlook RT before the final release.<br />
<br />
We all hammered Microsoft in not getting it out and knew that this was going to happen.&nbsp; They had it but wouldn't release it since May or June last year.<br />

            <p>I thought to do a check with my RT for an email program in the Store but looks like nothing of any use for IMAP email.&nbsp; POP3 Email was the only program I could find and was the one recommended by others but it only does POP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would still say (as a temporary fix) to try Outlook.com.&nbsp; For the RT, that or a different web based email system such as Yahoo or GMail may do it as well.&nbsp; Can't say for sure on the last two but do know that Outlook.com can do POP3 and IMAP setups (for
 receive) and uses its own server for sending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see if you can hold off until on or after the 26th and try the Windows 8.1 Preview on at least one tablet to see if the Outlook RT will work right.&nbsp; Do note that it and the system is a beta and has to be replaced with the final release later on this
 year.&nbsp; It will at least get you functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the beta will work.&nbsp; I am planning on installing it on my RT that I am on now and pretty much expect that Outlook RT will run fine with no problems.</p>

            I can say for sure that if you download and install Windows 8.1 Preview on your tablets, your problems will be solved. &nbsp;It comes with Outlook RT and it works perfect!
<div><br />
<div>It does take a while for the download and installation process. &nbsp;If an update does not come across for installation in Windows Update, you will have to go to http://www.microsoft.com and in the section of "Exploring", click on Windows. &nbsp;On that web page,
 scroll down until you see the message regarding Windows 8.1 Preview and click on it. &nbsp;Then, go ahead and click the button to download the update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That will be a Windows Update to add the Preview to the Store and not the update itself. &nbsp;This will be a multi-step process. &nbsp;After you install that update and the machine reboots, you will see a banner across the START screen leading you to install the
 Windows 8.1 Preview, do that and it takes you to the Store and then you tell it to install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It does take a while for the download and installation and do not touch the tablet during the whole process unless you are prompted to do so.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After the whole thing is setup, you will find Outlook RT and there you should be able to setup your IMAP email system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do remember that this is a Preview (beta) and not the final release. &nbsp;Later this year like around October, you will need to do this again for the final version.</div>

<p>The IR receiver/blaster is a SMK RX6000 and the blaster does work properly.&nbsp; The receiver lights up when the remote is used but nothing happens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have removed the unit&nbsp;and reinstalled and the driver is reinstalled.&nbsp; I have checked for an updated driver but none is found.</p>
<p>I updated my motherboard drivers too, to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; SMK is no help.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas out there ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>So iv'e had my account for around 8 years and forget my password too often and iv'e moved twice since creating it. &nbsp;I cant receive emails on the one that's linked to my account and i cant remember my security question so i used the "I cant use these options"
 link. &nbsp; Every time i try to reset my password after answering a bunch of questions the email i get says follow the steps, so step 1 is "Click Here" and it takes me right back to where i started by making me choose between "I forgot my password" "I know my
 password but cant log in" etc... So it just loops every time. The account recovery request issue number is 63400709. Can any admins help me please?</p>

            I have a 10 year old dell Inspiron laptop I bought back in 2002, it's resolution is 800X600, the same as yours except with an aspect of 4:3, yours is wider,
<div>My computer is still running on xp, however I use an extended monitor with a resolution of 1366X968, the resolution on your computer is not "low", it is just a strange aspect with a ratio of 1.7, which I have never seen before. It's probably not that your
 computer has a low res, but the aspect dimensions is confusing the program itself. Try using an extended monitor, or changing your resolution to something more suitable, like try 800X600, or any other 4:3 aspect. Tell me if you can do either of those.</div>

<p><br />
Do you have a second monitor (or is one being sensed)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you could see if switching to it would change your symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. press Win-P&nbsp; CursorUp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW I had that symptom just today when I was experimenting using that command at the login prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 So looks like Windows can get confused by multi-monitor setup in various states.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. what might be happening is an unused&nbsp;VGA port being set to a low-res state&nbsp;as some kind of default for booting but being sensed by an app because the&nbsp; Second Screen setting
 is invalidly set to be using it (e.g. in Extend or Duplicate mode).&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting out of those shared modes into the appropriate one or the other would at least make it clear that your change of screen resolution was being applied to the thing which was causing
 the message.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

            We do by extended monitor mean another monitor outside from the computer. Like the similar reference term, extended hard drive, we mean another monitor that can display images seperate from the computer, but before you go off buying new monitors there
 may be something you could try to see if it is in fact a problem with your actual resolution then with the computer (or apps) itself. First off, look at the back (or sides) of the computer, check for any vga, dvi, or hdmi output ports on the computer. If you
 need any reference, here are some links to google:<br />

<div>If you see any of the above ports on your laptop, then you will be able to use this to output video to another screen that has proper resolution settings for the applications you are using..</div>
<div>Most tv's nowadays have an HDMI in OR a VGA-in.</div>
<div>That means you can use a male to male HDMI cable or a male to male vga cable to connect your laptop to a television screen. Sounds complicated, its really &nbsp;not</div>
<div>First check the ports, and get back to me what ports you have, if you have none then we will have to try a different approach, which means we would have to look into more complicated stuff, like drivers and icky system settings.</div>

 works fine. I have been able to get some photos transferred from phone to computer using LG Bridge, but it desn't seem to find them all. There are other file transfer tasks I need to undertake as well. What am I doing wrong??</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Hardware issue such as USB connector is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. Since you also mentioned the issue occur on any computer, the issue is more likely to caused by a defective hardware. This

</a></strong>suggests that using another USB connector may help resolve the issue. Follow the recommendations given by both
<strong>BulldogXX </strong>and <strong>Robert Aldwinckle on forums</strong>.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and the model number of the router that you use?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Why exactly do you want to increase MTU?</p>
<p><span>The MTU is the size of the largest packet that can be transmitted over the underlying network, including the
 size of the transport header. The MTU is configured separately for each interface.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,By the way the link it was very useful.</p>
<p>Why exactly do you want to increase MTU?</p>
<p>I thought is possible to increase a internet download speed by increasing or decreasing MTU on a router.But i just guessing i have no idea is possible doing that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By decreasing the MTU size, it needs more packet deliver to my computer and it because of that is take more time to download a file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what that means fragmented.a packet?</p>
        </p>

<p>Okay, so i've had this problem ever since playing this game on my Xbox One. I've already tried using port forwarding earlier this morning and that still doesn't fix the problem. It always kicks me to the main menu displaying ''you must have an active network

<p>Any idea what the problem is perhaps or any way to fix it?</p>

<p>Any sort of help is appreciated here!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do your apps work just fine and it is just multiplayer games? If so, follow these steps.</p>
<p>Go to Settings &gt; Network Settings &gt; Advanced Settings.</p>
<p>Go down to Alternate MAC Address and Clear the Alternate Mac Address if one is set.</p>
<p>This is a known issue that happened after the update with some consoles getting an alternate MAC Address set without ever changing the setting. Once you clear it out, you should be able to connect to multiplayer games again.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard issue with Win10 update</h2>
                    I tried a post before and got an answer that I tried out. &nbsp;I was told to go ahead and run the troubleshooter and see if that started my keyboard. &nbsp;If that didn't work, run the device manager to delete the driver. &nbsp;I had already installed the latest version
 of the keyboard driver. &nbsp;None of this worked to get the keyboard to work. &nbsp;Previously I had been on the chat line for over six hours. Does anyone have any ideas? &nbsp;Better yet is there going to be a patch, fix or update to fix this? &nbsp;I have to go back to Win7
 again because a laptop without a keyboard just doesn't work for me. &nbsp;And every time I repeat this upgrade it's just about an all day thing between the upgrade and troubleshooting so I won't be doing that anytime soon again.

                    <strong>Original title:</strong> Game Installing&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I've had this game that I'm trying to install for sometime. It's called "Spore Galactic Adventures." I have installed it to my windows 10 hp laptop, but it won't launch the game. I can clearly see the game shortcut on my desktop, but every time I click on
 it, it does nothing. Just the loading icon by my curser for about a second, and nothing. What do I need to do??? Help???</p>

<p>Hi Jarah,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the <span>Spore Galactic Adventures game fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the game is incompatible on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to <strong>reinstall the Spore Galactic Adventures game in Compatibility mode
</strong>and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>compatibility mode </strong>is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. Follow below
 steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Download </strong>the setup file of the game and save it on your local disk.<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Right click on the setup file of the game and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Place a check mark next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select operating system from the
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop&nbsp;down list.<br />
<strong>5. </strong>Let the game <strong>install </strong>and then check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>

            <p>hi there</p>
<p>if doesnt work even with compatibilty it means you have to download update for the game. windows 10 cant do more about it.</p>
<p>i google it and it is very old game and it has problems with windows 7 too i dont think windows can do better.</p>
<p>try to contact provider of the game maybe you can find answers there</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes that is the latest version. You probably can't find much on it because it was muchly a behind the scenes update that didn't bring any new features to the Xbox.
</p>
<p>Even during the preview of it there wasn't much in the way of information for it. Basically there were a few tweaks, mainly for the Xbox to PC streaming.</p>

<p>9/9/2015</p>
<p>New or updated features</p>
<p>Stability and performance update</p>
<p>The update provides a few minor fixes that address an in game audio issue.</p>
<p>^According to the Xbox support website, that was the latest version that came out this month. My current Xbox One OS 6.2.13332.0 (xb_rel_1508.150903-2141) fre is a higher version than that which I downloaded on 9/14/15. I did find out my OS version matches
 a previously released preview OS. I'm just hoping my Xbox One is not downloading preview updates instead of the stable updates by accident since I'm not a preview member.</p>

            Hi Mohammad 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Reinstall Store
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter  
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />2. As a last resort, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />Any special type of OS you use, like Windows 10 Education where the ISO file might be programmed as such that doesn't contain Store?

            Hi Mohammad
<br />
<br />The Enterprise LTSC version is Windows 10 is a special version of Windows 10, that is a volume licence only meant to be used by companies and organisations, not the private user
<br />
<br />The LTSC version does not have the Store App, or any other Microsoft app installed and those cannot be installed into that version
<br />
<br />The LTSC version does not receive Windows Updates like the normal consumer version either
<br />
<br />If you do not work for an organisation that supplied that version and that re-arm the activation on that version of Windows, you will need to install the version of Windows 10 that should be installed on your PC, because the activation on that version will expire . . .
