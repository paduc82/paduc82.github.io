<h2>            Headphones &#47; Stereo Mix not appearing in Playback &#47; Recording Devices despite clicking &#39;Show all disabled devices&#39;</h2>
                    Hi, I run Windows 7 on a Macbook Pro, and I find that my headphones aren't working even when plugged in but my speakers are - I can't find the 'headphones' option in playback devices or 'Stereo Mix' option in recording devices even when I click 'Show all
 disabled devices' and 'show all disconnected devices'. I experienced this problem before, except that it could be solved with the simple click of a button as the 'headphones' option was there. Any ideas how to make it appear?

<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 has turned my Lenovo IdeaCentre A720 27&#34; touchscreen all in one PC into a useless scrap.</h2>
                    I'm flying on a broom furious right now 😠 .&nbsp;After upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1 I have problems with Bluetooth, HP All in one printer, HL-DT-ST BDDVDRW CA40N device isn't working at all - not recognized. Even DTSOFT Virtual CdRom Device has the same problem.
 It seems like lot of drivers for obviously pre-installed hardware that used to work with Windows 8 are not working with 8.1 upgrade. It's a massive downgrade for my PC. And whatever happens insurance is useless, as Microsoft has turned it into a piece of s**t
 with their "upgrade". I spend money on a good gadget and Microsoft turns it into a scrap in no time. This is outrageous. Is anyone having same problems with Windows 8.1? Any solutions? Or is the only way for me to sell my new scrap and switch to Apple?&nbsp;

            Hardware&nbsp;and software updates to be compatible with Windows 8.1 are the responsibility of the Manufacturer of that product not Microsoft's. So your issue is one for them not Microsoft. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance&nbsp; post and we
 will be glad to help you.

            I would like to see for example working Fix It program on new version of Windows , or having an option to run older driver version without taking All In One PC apart or buying new hardware for it with every Windows "upgrade" .
<div>Before Windows 8.1 happened, I used to be promoting windows 8 , running on my nice and (fairly) new Lenovo A720, now i have to shut up, and if they ask anything - there's no way to fix these problems yet.&nbsp;</div>

</p><p>I had issues with my upgrade so I installed a Clean full Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't use the touchscreen often so I didn't notice the the touch was not working till last night (02/19/14).&nbsp; I searched for answers and didn't find any resolution.&nbsp; I ended up downloading
 the Video driver from the Lenovo website (which I had already installed), I selected Clean Install when asked, rebooted.&nbsp; The touchscreen is now working perfectly.&nbsp; Don't know what happened between the first driver install to make it not work but it's working
 great now.</p>

            hardware, Device, Software issues you have are not the&nbsp;Responsibility of Microsoft&nbsp;; they are the responsibility 0f the respective Hardware, Device, or software Manufacturer. It is their responsibility to see that their product works with Windows 8.0/8.1
 period. So they are the ones to be upset with. Hope this helps and if you need&nbsp; any further&nbsp;assistance please post and we will be glad to assist you.

<p>&nbsp;Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
I’d suggest you to temporarily disable your security firewall software and restart your computer to check if Windows detects your Network card.<br />
</p>
<p>Wi‑Fi Sense is available on Windows 10, but not on earlier versions of Windows. Wi‑Fi Sense connects you to Wi‑Fi networks around you. It can do these things for you to get you Internet access:
</p>
<div>&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/wi-fi-sense-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/wi-fi-sense-faq</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Also see: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/connectivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Since there is some information coming for your Network Adapter to be compatible with Windows 10, which you can view in Windows 10 Compatibility&nbsp; center, Refer the below link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home</span></a></p>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I’d suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps below.<br />
<br />
Click on Start Orb and type Device Manager, hit enter to open it.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, click on “View” menu and select “Show Hidden Devices”.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, scroll down to locate “Network Adapters”.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Network Adapters category, check if your Network Adapter is listed.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, right click on it and select “Update Driver Software” to update drivers and follow the instructions on wizard.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot your computer and check.<br />
If the Network Adapter is not listed in Network Adapters category in Device Manager, please click the Action menu in Device manager, and then click Scan for hardware changes.<br />
If you see a message saying that Windows has to install driver software for your unknown device, click Locate and install driver software (recommended).<br />
If the device driver is installed and working properly, you have resolved the problem. If the device is installed but isn't working properly, go to "Use Windows Update to find a device driver."<br />

            <p><span>Similar problem with Wireless connecting but continually dropping connection under Windows 10. Generally worked flawlessly under previous Windows 8.1 for quite some time.<br />
<br />
Noticed a couple new Win10 things;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>NIC Drivers changed from Win8.1 v15.10.3.2 Win10 v15.16.0.2<br />
Is this correct and/or the problem?</span></li><li><span>Under "Device Manager -&gt; Network Adapters" the NIC is listed as "Intel Centrino Wireless N-2230 #2"<br />
Why the "#2" suffix? Is that correct and/or a problem?</span></li></ol>
<p>So far at least, network connection under Win10 works fine when cabled to the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We acknowledge your experience on not being able to access your other computer remotely and for us to give you an effective resolution, can you confirm if you have tried to remove the devices and try to set up the Remote Desktop Connection again? To do so,
 kindly refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ff521c86-2803-4bc0-a5da-7df445788eb9/how-to-use-remote-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> and see if it helps. We would also suggest making sure that there are no pending updates for both of the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you have other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Yes, I have tried connecting to my work PC remotely using RDP for several different devices, including other Windows 10 PCs, my Mac, and iOS devices. All seem to connect but I get only a black screen and the remote desktop never appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted and set up new connections on the clients that are trying to connect remotely to my work desktop, all meet the same result.&nbsp; Prior to the Windows 10 Creators update I was able to connect remotely from all client devices from both inside and
 outside our domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,<br />
<br />
Since you are able to connect your devices to the remote PC but still having the same issue, kindly try changing the Display Configuration. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the black <strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> window (to select it) and press
<strong>Ctrl key + Alt key + Del key</strong> to bring up the Windows Security screen and select
<strong>Log Off,</strong> then log back in.</li><li>Start a new RDP client on your desktop but before you click <strong>Connect</strong>, click the
<strong>Show Options</strong> link.</li><li>Click the <strong>Display</strong> tab and set the <strong>Display Configuration</strong> to a lower resolution</li></ol>
<p><br />
If the issue persists, kindly post your query to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Search/en-US/Technet?query=Remote%20Desktop%20Protocol%20Windows%2010&amp;beta=0&amp;ac=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet</a> for more advanced troubleshooting. <br />
<br />
Should you have further queries, feel free to post it. </p>

<p>I have tried changing resolutions for the RDP connection on the client.&nbsp; No matter what version of Windows or Mac RDP AND not matter what resolution I attempt to use, I cannot complete the login to my remote PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RDP window appears to configure &amp; set up the connection, the widow is only black (no desktop appears) and the full connection to the remote computer is never completed.&nbsp; I have had someone attempt to remote to my desktop PC while I was sitting in front
 of the desktop and I can see that a full connection never completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this issue began immediately after completing the upgrade to the Windows 10 Creators Edition.</p>

<p>Greg, glad to see I am not alone. I also can remote to my Home RDP server (also has the Creator's update) no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO a couple questions to see if three is any commonality:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are your Office RDP servers joined to a domain?</p>
<p>2. Do your office RDP servers have multiple displays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the only differences I see between the systems that work and the systems that do not.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Having done a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro on a SSD Disk 1 to start as C:<br />
</span></span><span><span>This installation has added a partition on the HDD Disk 0 (F :) of 100 MB "Reserved by the system," and this has got to drive letter D:<br />
</span></span><span><span>I can‘t access to view the content of this partition, but believes that this caused that I can no longer boot HDD Disk 0 with the drive letter F: (bootmanager is missing)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>I also have another SSD as Disk 2 (E:) that has no extra partition after Windows 10 Pro installation - but not even this disk I can boot from, not even if I temporarily turn the first SSD Disk 1 C: off (bootmanager is missing).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>Something must have happened that makes me not able to boot as I want and could before.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>1 Anyone having ideas on how to best address this?<br />
</span></span><span><span>2 Can I safely remove the 100MB partition named “Reserved by the system”?<br />
</span></span><span><span>3 Are there any smart utilities that that can help me to see the contents of Hidden and/or Reserved partitions?<br />
</span></span><span><span>4 Is there a smart and easy way to change the boot order when and if I sort out the problems above?<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>P.S. </span></span><span><span>As you might have guessed, I am not primarily interested in suggestions like “a clean reinstallation” where the content in total or partially might disappear.<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First you should check is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Timeout</span> setting in the boot tab of the msconfig. Some of the builds I have had in the past set it to 0 and that makes your computer boot to whatever is the default with no time
 to make a choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second with Dual Boot you might have to turn off <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Fast Start</span> so your system will use the conventional boot system.</p>
<p>So you might try this first by going to Control Panel and Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Power Options</span> then up near the left top Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Choose what the power buttons do</span>. On the next screen Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Change settings that are currently unavailable</span> then you can uncheck <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Turn on fast start (recommended)</span> and Click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Save changes</span> at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>If this helps you will have to remember to make this change every time a new build is installed because it defaults to Fast start on the new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third You could try EasyBCD from NeoSmart. If you go to the link below you can scroll down to the bottom of the page and download the free version for non commercial use. Read all of the Documentation files they have and decide for yourself if it is worth
 while.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What my boot order looks like with EasyBCD The 2 win 10 are on one drive but on separate partitions</p>
<p>and the win 7 is on it's own drive.</p>

            <p>Do not touch the System reserved partition (BTW it should not have a drive letter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into the BIOS and check the boot order. First should be the DVD drive and second the drive which has the system reserved partition. On booting, a list of the OS's on the computer should be viewable and from which the required OS can be selected. If this
 is not the case then the boot manager(s) need repairing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For W10, go to Update and Security/ Backup and select the link 'Go to Backup and restore (Windows 7)'. On the left side of that page is 'Create a system repair disc'.&nbsp; Create the repair disc on a DVD disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the disc in the DVD drive, reboot into the repair disc and you should be able to repair the boot managers for the other drives (exact details are a distant memory).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the drive letter from the system reserved partition, open disc management and right click on the System reserved partition. Select 'change drive letter and paths' and click on 'Remove'.</p>

<h2>            Liferame3 won&#39;t load on my Asus laptop - Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an Asus Laptop....17" model R700VJ....my webcam doesn't work.&nbsp; I have/put Lifeframe as a tile on my Windows 8 Start screen so it's there.&nbsp; I also checked my device manager and it shows I have the webcam (USB 2.0&nbsp;HD UVC Webcam).&nbsp;&nbsp;I checked
 to make sure I have the most up to date drivers installed and I do...when I try to open Lifeframe3 I just get the picture of the app as it tries to open, and the blue swirl of death.....nothing else happens.&nbsp; When I right click it says the program to see what's
 going on it has a message that the program&nbsp;is not responding and to close it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions to fix. or an explan. of why a brand new computer and OS will not open preinstalled webcam software/stuff?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>From the issue description, it appears that you are having trouble with your webcam and/ or your software. Please answer the following questions so that I could assist you further:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</li><li>Was this computer software and webcam working before on the same new laptop?</li><li>Are you receiving any error messages?</li><li>Do you have a parallel operating system installed?</li></ol>
<p>Try the below steps and get back to me with the results:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows key on your keyboard( Alternatively, you can either move your mouse to any right corner of your screen and move down and click 'Start' or you can even use the Windows+ C key combination to activate the Charms bar and then either click
 on start or use your keyboard to do the same)</li><li>Type in 'Programs and Features' without the quotes( there is no box, just type).</li><li>Click on 'Settings in the right pane of the new search window.</li><li>Now, either press enter or use your mouse( or touch pad) to click on the only item in the left pane, 'Programs and Features' without the quotes.</li><li>A list of programs installed on your PC will be populated in a new window.</li><li><strong>Warning- Attempt the next step only if you have an installation media available for your webcam.</strong></li><li>Find your webcam software in the list if present and click on 'Uninstall/ Change'. Agree to whatever confirmations required.</li><li>Insert your webcam software installation media and install it as per a manual provided or following the on- screen instructions, if any.</li><li>Try running your webcam and software.

<h2>            Microsoft Account Ban</h2>
                    <p>My account was banned for a second time as soon as it come off a ban of 7 days. Mind you I'm all for the bans when they're just. My ban happened while I was on Netflix yet I violated the terms because someone reported me? Call support for help all they do is refer me to a stupid questionnaire which you can't successfully submit. Not logically anyways. Only answer I got after 3 hours is anybody else will refer you to a website. Where is the customer service? Microsoft is **** ****. Unjust Bans for anybody! No help, **** you guys!</p>

            <p>If you're&nbsp; having trouble with the questionnaire, read through the code of conduct. The questionnaire is really easy. But that is the only way you can contact the enforcement team regarding your suspension. Investigations do take time, so the suspension would not have been for something you did the same time it was enforced. The action could have taken place week's before.</p>

            <p><em>A common misconception is that a certain number of reports will result in an automatic suspension. According to the myth, even if you haven’t done anything wrong someone can get you suspended by encouraging players to file many complaints. This is completely untrue.</em></p><p><em>XBLPET investigates complaints and takes each report into consideration when making an enforcement decision, but a certain volume or frequency of complaints doesn’t guarantee a suspension. We take an evidence-based approach to enforcement and take numerous factors into account when considering issuing a suspension. The context around the content or activity is particularly essential and drives our decision-making process. Simply put, there is no magic formula that instantly results in a suspension.</em></p><p><em>Despite what some may claim, XBLPET will <strong>never</strong> ever ban anyone “for no reason”.

            Hi Dennis
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Check if you can then install it.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a repair upgrade:

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Boot from a Vista DVD or Recovery Disk (can be a friend's copy as they are not copy protected).<br />
<br />
Command Prompt<br />
<br />
<br />
CHKDSK /f /r<br />
<br />
How to use the Command Prompt<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial147.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial147.html</a><br />
<br />
Running from the DVD command prompt often works when it will not otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Xbox app party buzzing PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gookus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox app party buzzing PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    My Xbox app on PC is making a weird buzzing noise that is audible throughout the whole party. Friends I talk too say that the buzzing is very loud to the point where they cant hear anything but buzzing. The buzzing stops when I mute myself or leave the
 party. Weird because when I talk on discord, it sounds totally normal and I am told my mic on discord 'sounds amazing.' I have tried everything. I changed the bit rate on my recording setting numerous times to see which one works, unfortunately, none did anything.
 I have Astro a10's. Help would be appreciated!&nbsp;

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing a buzzing sound that is coming from your headset, but only within a party through the Xbox app on your Windows PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be due to the current network status being detected through the app, we suggest to attempt uninstalling and installing the Xbox app.</p>

<p><span><span>4. Hit Enter.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X turned itself off, won&#39;t turn back on</h2>
                    <p>Been playing Skate 3 on my new One X when suddenly it turned itself off and won't turn on anymore. Controller just keeps blinking, and when I&nbsp;try to boot up with the power button on the console, all I&nbsp;get is a chirp and the power button lighting up for a second. Tried the obvious, like unplugging the console, etc. but nothing worked. Is my console fried?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Actually, I found that every time I play a 4k game (Forza 7) my circuit breaker would trip. I played Destiny 2 and watch TV&nbsp;with no issues. There is no way I am going to run power from a different room or add a circuit&nbsp;just to play video games.&nbsp; I am running a&nbsp;LG&nbsp;OLED&nbsp;65",&nbsp;the XBox One X, my Xfinity X1 box and a Sonos Playbar on the same surge protector. On the same circuit I&nbsp;also I have 2 lights, a controller charger and a small 3 gallon aquarium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Resetting&#47;Repairing&#47;Reinstalling Winsock2 &#47; Testing for corruption</h2>
                    I've recently run into a bad virus which (I believe) has corrupted my Winsock2.&nbsp; In old versions of Windows, you could easily delete the Winsock files from the registry, reboot and reinstall from the inf folder.&nbsp; However, this does not appear to be the
 same with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
My questions:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; How do you test to determine if Winsock2 is corrupt? In XP, there was a NetDiag command, which no longer works in Win 7.<br />
2.&nbsp; Are there third-party programs for fixing Winsock2 in Win 7?<br />
3.&nbsp; Will running a "netsh winsock reset" command reset both Winsock AND Winsock2?&nbsp; If not, is there an alternative method to resetting only Winsock2?<br />
4.&nbsp; Are there registry settings listed anywhere on the web for what Winsock2 registry settings SHOULD look like?<br />
5.&nbsp; Is there a means of completely reinstalling Winsock2 in Win 7?<br />
<br />
If you could answer any (or all ;-) of these, I would be deeply indebted.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Bill

<p><span><span>Hi sumdimguy,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the first question, about determining if Winsock 2 and Winsock is corrupt: In the below article:
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259</a> (Refer the section “<span>Manual steps to determine whether the Winsock2 key is corrupted for Windows Vista users”. The steps are the same for Windows 7)</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>To reset Winsock2, from the same link above, the next step which has
<strong>Manual steps to recover from Winsock2 corruption for Windows Vista users(Holds good for Windows 7)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For your third question: Yes the command will reset both Winsock and Winsock2</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Here is the location of the registry of Winsock and Winsock2:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>Important: The instructions below contain steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry
 incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information view the article:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></span></a></p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock2</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Resetting will delete the Winsock and recreates, which actually is reinstalling it completely.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I was told my winsock was bad by Mozy support. I found this post looking for a method to repair it.</p>
<p>You refer to the Vista section as the same as Windows 7 in <strong><span>811259.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>I did a "</strong><span>netsh winsock reset" and it said it worked.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;I checked using the 811259 procedure and under the Protocol in the referenced KB article,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the first 8 of the headings but none of the ones referencing "netbios".&nbsp; Is this
 OK?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Both my Windows 7 systems display the same under Protocol.</span></strong></p>

<p>Are you looking at step #3 of <em>Manual steps to determine whether the Winsock2 key is corrupted for Windows Vista users</em> ?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>If so, what you see is probably OK.&nbsp; My 64-bit Windows 7 system doesn't have the MSAFD NetBIOS entries, either.&nbsp; My 32-bit Windows 7 system does.</p>
<p>Note that the KB article doesn't apply to Windows 7.</p>

            Just wanted to note that my winsock become corrupted and prevented any connection to a network source.&nbsp; Not sure how this happened as I am free of trojans and virii but anyway, I ran the<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> command on my Windows 7 Home
 Premium 32-bit and after it finished and&nbsp;I restarted everything functioned perfectly as before the problem.

            <p>Ok, i have windows 7 ultimate and it is partitioned with my OSX on my macbook pro, I too have an issue with the Winsock corruption. It tells me that the registry keys are gone and now i cannot connect to any network application, i can however, connect to
 WiFi. I have followed the steps above, and even done the fix-it option that supposedly does it for you. No luck. I have run it throught the command prompt, (it being the commands) yet to my immense displeasure, the winsock issue is being very obstanent despite
 the&nbsp;command saying it was successful, when i reboot, it says cannot connect to the web or any network applications.&nbsp;so i have finally returned to the forums. i have no backup for this, as i have already filled around 15Tb full of data on my external hard drives
 and do not want to buy a new 2TB drive for my windows partition. this computer is for work and and for school, i hope you all can help</p>

            My major issue was due to a trojan that was infecting my system and i believe ad-aware may have been partly to blame as well. these are the steps i used;
<div><br />
<div>1) used rkill from cmd prompt to stop all running services</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) used tdsskiller to remove and repair system</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) used malwarebytes to remove additional virus traces</div>
<div><br />
<div>4) used norton antivirus just as a precautionary measure to make sure nothing was left!</div>
<div><br />
<div>i wasnt able to repair my winsock using the methods from the service rep because of the virus that i had. hope this helps, and be prepared for a lot of system restarts!! i sis all the above steps logged in through safemode with networking. and used advice
 from forums on each software services web page.</div>

            Same issue here.......definitely malware that breaks the Winsock and sometimes the firewall, leaving no ability to update windows either, as it halts the Windows Update service and prevents it from being started. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows display language won&#39;t change after windows 10 april update</h2>
                    <p>Today I updated my windows 10 using windows 10 upgrade assistant. After that I changed the windows display language to malayalam , just to see what it looks like. But, when I try to revert it back to English it won't let me due to the ui problem. There is
 no option to change the language in control panel. Please suggest any other method without reinstall or reset windows.&nbsp;</p>

 I used the program for about a week than the computer crashed with the ERROR CODE 1305 the computer is running again but the software will not run now. When I got the software I gave the information to the software company as to what my computer has&nbsp;for spec's

<p>
</p><p>I was hoping maybe someone can easily help out on this situation. I noticed on one computer running Windows 10 version 1703 the Computer Browser service is missing in the list of services. The computer is running Windows 10 Home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open services.msc, you'll see the Computer Browser service is not listed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can help me restore it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>WD My Book World Edition II Crashes on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> santiago f.d.  say:</h3>
<h2>            WD My Book World Edition II Crashes on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I recently bought a My Book World Edition II (white light) from Western Digital.<br />
The problem I'm having is that, I can upload to it large files and several transfers by FTP, or using Linux O.S., but with Windows 7 Pro 64bit I'm not able to transfer more than 100GB on a single upload (forget about making multiple uploads) because I'll hang
 and will stop responding.<br />
<br />
Why could this be happening, any possible solution?<br />
<br />
Some info where I'm running Win7 O.S. and LAN:<br />
-PC: 16GB DDR3 / Intel i7 4.5Ghz / 1TB 7200RPM 64MB Buffer SATA3 / Intel Gigabit LAN<br />
-LAN: CAT6 Cabling / Gigabit Router / Wireless N<br />
-O.S.: Windows 7 Pro 64bit (Up to date)<br />
<br />
I really need this working fine on windows, as I'm not able to be there on site to unplug and plug again power of NAS.<br />

            <p>Hi, Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1-I'm making transfers by copy-pasting from local HDD to NAS, using a NAS folder as network drive.</p>
<p>2-No additional software, the normal windows transfer</p>
<p>3-No encrypted, No protected.</p>
<p>4-After some Gigs transfered it says that cannot reach network destination, and looking at the NAS, pinging, or trying to access console from any other device conected to the LAN, shows that it's completly crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahora HDD errors, I took them out from the NAS to perform test and they are perfectly working.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MyBook World Ed II is no more than 1 month, as I change it for RMA due to high temps on the first one.</p>
<p>And I was hoping the transfer error was going to be solved with the new NAS, but no, temps were solved, but transfers are still failiing under windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Driver's on PC from WD, they just install one that came on a CD, but no update from it.</p>
<p>What I have updated recently, that didn't work, was the firmware of the NAS controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I don't understand is how is handling transfers or network windows, that makes the drive crashes, while on other O.S.&nbsp;or by FTP it works just perfect no matter the size of the files or the total transfer :S</p>

            <div>Hi again,</div>
<div><br />
<div>About the overclocking, yes, I'm doing it, but it's not a possible root cause, as it also happens on my other stock pc's on same LAN which some of them has AMD CPU's non O.C.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-on Minidump, there's nothing (I just clear it first, and make the HDD crash by transfering 450GB at once with normal windows transfer system). NAS has 2TB free.</div>
<div>Just in case you're expecting a BSOD, the PC continues working perfect, only network drives stop being accessible due to non responsive NAS.</div>
<div><br />
