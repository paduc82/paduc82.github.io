<h2>            unable to use hotspot after upgrading my windows phone &#40;nokia 735&#41; to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>internet sharing was working perfectly well with windows 8.1 on my nokia 735 phone. when i decided to upgrade to windows 10 , suprisingly hotspot was not working at all. can sb advice what should i do? i am desperate as i was using it a lot not having internet
 connection at home.</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that hotspot is working with my wife's iphone 4s (ios 8), while it is still not working with my ipad (1st generation on ios 5). The latter had no issue accessing the phone's hotspot before the upgrade.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

    <title>Controlling where an application is displayed using multiple monitors. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Controlling where an application is displayed using multiple monitors.</h2>
                    <p>I am running Widows 10 Pro, 64-bit with 3 monitors using an Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti graphics card and have an Intel 7i-4930K CPU with 32 gig of RAM. For the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties I have it configured so that it shows all taskbars on all displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior that currently exists is that if I launch an application from any monitor it opens on the one it was last open on. For example, if I have Notepad open on monitor 3, close it, launch the application from monitor 1 it actually opens on monitor
 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior I would like is for the application to open on the monitor I launch it from. For example, if I have Notepad open on monitor 3, close it, launch the application on monitor 1 it is displayed on monitor 1. It would be wonderful if I could launch
 Notepad on monitor 1 and have it display there, launch Notepad on monitor 2 and have it display there and finally launch Notepad on monitor 3 and have it display there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible and/or a setting I just am not aware of in Windows 10? Granted, Notepad is not the most exciting application but it was just an example. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick response. I believed I detailed my situation as clearly as I can. The information you sent was mostly on setting up the use of multiple display and did not address my scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 monitors that are functioning just as the information you sent describes. Please refer to my previous post for a description of the behavior I wish to have, which is not the default from what I've found. The last two links you sent were more at
 the development level, which I would rather not dive into as one specifically states it's not supported with WDDM...which I assume would cause problems down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a config option or even a registry setting that can be set to produce the behavior I'm looking for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for the quick response. Please let me know if I need to clarify anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>you are correct. it is currently not possible with native windows 10. There are 3rd party programs that do this but if you are like me you would want to see it native. I have an entry in the feedback tool (insider version) asking for this very feature. Windows
 should use each monitor as a separate workstation in many regards. Each should have a taskbar/startmenu which it does but not completely. The taskbars should have system tray's and should have different "pins". when launching a program from a workstation/monitor
 it should launch on that monitor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To expand i would also like to see application rules for ones launched via alternate means that dont conform to a particular monitor. For example starting a program via keyboard shortcuts or during startup. For example i may wish to set a rule that says
 notepad will always start on monitor x or that monitor x can only have y number of notepad instances before moving to the next monitor. I would also like this behavior to be extended to taskview but i wont squish the frog as it were.</p>

                    A message was in my junk mail which contained one of my passwords and was threatening for me to send $899 (said to call it a donation) or they would send fake porn (the said they had contrived) to everyone of my contacts.&nbsp; Another email showed a list of
 my contacts.&nbsp; All occurred after my requesting having my cell number changed in Outlook (30 day wait period).&nbsp; I block both senders and domains and never use public wifi.&nbsp; Does anyone know how this happens and what I should do?

<br />Delete it. Do not even think about paying it - it's all a lie. They got your address and password from some database that was hacked. If you are still using that password with that address anywhere (bank login etc), change it immediately.

<p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>I would like to suggest you following the steps below to identify this issue:</p>
<p>1. Please check if you have configured InfoPath Forms Services in SharePoint Online like this article describes:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Configure-InfoPath-Forms-Services-a8609546-c0d7-4956-81b6-08e93eb4b290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Configure-InfoPath-Forms-Services-a8609546-c0d7-4956-81b6-08e93eb4b290</span></a></p>
<p>2. To help you better, could you please still elaborator the issue with some pictures? To upload screenshots on the forum, you need to click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> under the replying box and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert Media.</strong></p>
<p>3. Does the issue occur to all users when accessing the site?</p>
<p>4. Does the issue happen with a different published form in SharePoint online site? it might be related to one specific InfoPath form.</p>
<p>5. Have you tried another site collection to see if there’s any improvement?</p>
<p>Please let us know the information above so we can move on.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April</p>

</p><p>I avoid contact with the Answer Desk as replies are often confusing or lack a professional response.&nbsp;On two occasions agents did not contact me as requested for the call back that I booked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I wrote the CEO of Microsoft Canada and had my request sent to Microsoft USA. It seems to be a faster and more efficient away to get answers to simple questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion all the same.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Auto Update on Office 2008 Mac broke my Excel. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Auto Update on Office 2008 Mac broke my Excel.</h2>
                    Got an auto update Microsoft window a few days ago. Said there was an update available for Excel. Update 15-41-??. I said OK and when it was done, my Excel was updated to Office 365 and now I can not save files or anything. It is trying to make me activate
 a 365 license. I just want my Excel Office 2008 back. Why would an update from Microsoft replace my Office 2008 Excel?

<p>I use Time Machine to backup my system. </p>
<p>If your wife has Time Machine backups just </p>
<p>- connect the backup media</p>
<p>- open Finder</p>
<p>- enter Time Machine</p>
<p>- pick a date from before the messed-up-update</p>
<p>- navigate to Applications/Microsoft Office 2008 folder</p>
<p>- right-click on Word application and select "Restore...to"</p>
<p>- select the same "real world" folder from the next view</p>
<p>- select replace from the next dialog</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me for both Excel and Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no Time Machine backups then the below link might help. This is an unaltered quote (from Jimmy Gordon MVP) from another post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an update from Microsoft.&nbsp; It is not a scam. It is a faulty version of AutoUpdate.</p>

            <p>didn't grab a screenshot last night, but they generally tell me that the security certificates have expired or are not up to date and the website is dangerous or people might be trying to capture my data.&nbsp; these are normal commercial websites I have gone
 to like the college website for my sons school, etc.&nbsp; even new websites would come up like this.&nbsp; it will give me the option to go to the website anyway, but not recommended.&nbsp; and yes, I've tried this with both IE and Google Chrome.&nbsp; I was thinking about resetting
 IE back to factory default and deleting Chrome and trying that, but wanting to see if anyone has any ideas first.&nbsp; this is my wife's laptop, and she would like to upgrade the OS, to possibly Windows10, but don't want to do it with this problem thinking it
 may inherit it in the new install.&nbsp; i'll grab a screenshot tonight and send a couple to see if that helps diagnose.&nbsp;

            To address your concern, please perform the following methods:<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
Make sure that the computer's date and time are correct. Having incorrect date and time may be one of the reason why you're getting security certificate error.<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
Install certificates. Please check the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/931850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to connect to my network using UMTS but I'm not getting any signals at all. Currently using Rogers in Canada, have a data plan in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edge/GSM works perfectly fine but when I switch to UMTS 3G it doesn't work at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the 5800's specs (which may vary by variant), it supports the following frequencies and data bearers (see below).&nbsp; Call Rogers and check with them if their 3G works with these specs...sounds like it doesn't.</p>

<p>Your 5800 has to support&nbsp; 850/1900 MHz. You might have the European/ Asian version with support for 900/2100 MHz. In that case your device is useless in USA and Canada for 3g networks.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>You mentioned that you have removed this ribbon option many times. Do you mean you remove it by using the following steps?<br />
1. Exit <strong>Outlook</strong>.<br />
2. Go to <strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>Starbucks for Outlook </strong>&gt; Click on <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
If not, please let us know the detailed steps you performed and then try to use the above steps.

Thanks,<br />

                    <strong><span>Hi...I am new to this, but I am having issues with syncing my new smartphone to my computer so that I can copy my music files and pictures to it. Everytime I try it keeps giving me an error message saying that there

 be no way to sync my phone with the USB? Oh, and before I forget...my phone is the Samsung Fascinate. If anyone has any help to offer or have gone through the same issue and got it to work, please let me know! This is very frustrating so any help would be
 greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone!</span></strong>

            Greetings Cassandra!<br />
<br />
Per my information, the Samsung Fascinate is an Android device, in which case we won't be able to assist you directly: we provide assistance for phones running Windows Mobile (now called Windows Phone).<br />
<br />
Therefore, you will need to ask this same question of Verizon Wireless (whom I understand to be the reseller of this particular model, or some Android forums (where ever they might be).<br />
<br />
If I am incorrect about the phone being Android based, please respond back and we'll try to assist you further.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, I wish you the bBest of luck in your endeavors!

<h2>            Mobile Edge crashes unexpectedly&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the CU for phone, browsing has become a real pain in the a**, the same applies to writing on this site, it is slower than ever! WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge after some time reloads EVERY page and to make it work again for a few minutes, I have to tap Home button. But Edge shuts down itself and there is a screen showing a "Loading..." after 6-7 seconds the home screen shows up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've performed a HARD reset after installing the CU... I've sent many logs to Feedback, Field Doctor, etc... What else can I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe old hardware related issues? Lumia 640 LTE.</p>

<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is normally resolved by using the Windows Device Recovery Tool on your phone.
<span>It'll install the latest version of Windows approved for your phone and remove everything else, including your apps, games, texts, call history, music, and photos.
</span><span><span>We suggest that you use it and check if the issue persists. </span>
</span><span><span><span>Please <strong><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up your stuff</a></span></span></strong> to avoid data loss.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you trying to say? That I have an unapproved W10 version? I thought the automated system for updates downloads you provide were an "official" one. So what the heck am I downloading when the system says that there is an available download? Faulty
 software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the only solution that solves everything? I thought it was a more practical OS...and now it seems that because a couple of bugs WDRT is required... It's really so practical! LMFAO!</p>

<p>The Windows Device Recovery Tool will revert your current operating system to the previous operating system approved for your phone. To troubleshoot the issue, we suggest that you use it and check if the issue persists. Upgrading your phone to Windows 10
 Mobile would be a great choice as it includes additional features and improvements. You can visit this

<h2>            15.41 Time New Roman quotation mark and apostrophe changed after update</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac-mso_o365b/word-replacing-times-new-roman-to-helvetica/dad215ae-dec9-46b3-8956-7b85b73e7fe4" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same issue. I updated to High Sierra last week, and quotation marks in the Times New Roman font suddenly started automatically changing to Helvetica. I could manually change them back to any font except TNR. Also, other sections of documents
 changed to Helvetica following quotation marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated Word to 15.41, which did eliminate the auto change to Helvetica. But, TNR's quotation marks and apostrophes are now straight instead of curly. There is some kind of change to the TNR font that no longer makes quotation marks curly. Or, there is
 an error in the software for High Sierra or Word that has not been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everywhere I've looked, the only solution has been to update to the latest version of Word, but that doesn't fix the change to the way TNR's quotation marks and apostrophes look. There is no fix that I've seen for getting TNR to look like it's supposed to.
 As a writer, this is a significant concern. I can't submit work that looks like it's in two different fonts.</p>

<p>I figured it out! For anyone who upgraded to High Sierra and is now having this weird Helvetica/Times New Roman issue, here is the solution:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure your version of Word is the latest (15.41).</li><li>Then, open a Word document, blank or existing, doesn't matter.</li><li>Go to Tools &gt; Auto-Correct &gt; AutoFormat as You Type.</li><li>Check the box in the Replace as You Type section for "Straight quotation marks"with "smart quotation marks."</li></ol>
<p>This will create curly quotation marks for TNR in Word.</p>

<div>Surface Pro 3 is positively, absolutely upgradeable to W10. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Surface RT, Surface 2, and Lumia 2520 (all ARM RT devices) won't be upgradeable</div>

            <p>Hi I have a Dell XPS 12 which is similar spec. I created a second partition and created a dual boot system, you get a nice option screen on booting to choose which system you want to use.
</p>
<p>Also use double driver to back up win 8 drivers and&nbsp;use them on new install is save a lot of time and frustration. system boots in about 10 sec or less from cold.</p>

            <p>Microsoft’s Surface range of tablets has posted its worst single quarter loss since its launch leaving analysts to question whether the fledgling slate is still a viable option for the company.</p>
<p>2.192 billion in surfice revenues, cost of revenue 2.8.72 billion, loss of 676 million</p>
<p>
</p><p>Analyst by Jackdaw Research, written by Jamie Hinks. No matter where you look the revenue loss in windows and devices are substantial, Microsoft made a huge mistake in windows 10. You should have polished off windows 8.1 and made some money. people were
 just starting to like it. Companies made hardware to work. </p>
<p>Tell your company not to buy right away, wait for a year after, 4 version is out.

<h2>            Font sizes constantly change in Internet Explorer as well as Google Chrome</h2>
                    Screen jumps around and my fonts keep changing whether it is in Microsoft Outlook or when I am on Facebook especially. Setting my fonts via the internet settings have not helped at all. Once I am into Facebook, the same keeps changing and I have to constantly
 reset. In fact, the size grew so much a few weeks ago, that my system shut down. I have the system cleaned but the issue with fonts still continues. I do not believe this to be a Facebook problem

<h3> asimon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you loop only specific slides on PowerPoint 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Is it possible to create a timed Loop for specific slides (i.e. Slides 1-3 out of 10) using PowerPoint 2010? I would like to Loop slides 1-3 for approximately 15 minutes and then show the rest of the slide show at my own pace.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would also be willing to use the Loop until I hit ESC.However, I don't want the screen to revert back to showing all the slides when I press ESC because this is for a professional presentation. Please advise.

<p>Hi Andrius,</p>
<p>To narrow down this issue, could you confirm the following?</p>
<p>1. Check if other users are experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>2. Do the affected user has Exchange Online license? Generally, if a user was not assigned Exchange license, it is not feasible to customize the static App Launcher and will not able to pin/unpin apps from the App Launcher. This limitation exists because
 customization information is saved to the user’s Exchange data store; users without an Exchange license do not have a location to save the customization information.</p>
<p>3. Try to access <a href="https://tenant.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://tenant.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx</a> and <a href="https://tenant-my.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://tenant-my.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx</a> to clear APP Launcher session caches. Please change the tenant to you tenant’s name. For example:
<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/clearlocalcache.aspx</a></p>
<p>4. Try another browser to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Please post back if you have any updates.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Spike</p>

<p>This does not work. DISM says it's missing a file. Well, that's Microsoft's fault, not mine. This computer has been getting Insider updates for months. Why would it quit now? No reason. Microsoft screwed up my computer. I haven't done anything to the system
 on this computer. It just decided to screw with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it tells me I have to reinstall. Ha! Bad update.</p>

Since we have Insiders who confirmed that they've successfully installed build 16184 when they performed system reset, we suggest you reset or reinstall the Windows via the recovery options we have on this

</p><p>It appears that the current preview build didn’t work for you. You can always go back to your previous build by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Recovery
</strong>&gt; <strong>Go back to an earlier build</strong>. Going back to an earlier build won’t remove you from the Insider Program.&nbsp; Also, please don't forget to let us know what you think about the new build via our

<p>Hi Everyone,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try clearing the system download folder by resetting the Windows Update components. Some folders that contains broken downloaded files from updates can also cause an issue with the installation of any new updates. This will not only clear the folders
 but will also re-register some components for the installation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed on resetting the Windows Update components, disable any third-party antivirus as it can interupt with the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Firewall</strong>. Then follow the steps below:</p>

 on the file by opening it using&nbsp;<strong>Notepad</strong>. I have no intension on harming your computer.

<p>I've tried all the fixes shown and still exactly the same.&nbsp; It looks like the download of the update is completing correctly, but when the update initializes it stops on 0% and throws the error.&nbsp; I've downloaded an iso for the insider upgrade and this installed
 correctly, but windows update still fails.... Can anyone suggest where I can look in the logs for the access denied error?&nbsp; If I can find the actual error then maybe I can fix it ?&nbsp; Alternatively does anyone have any experience using procmon to diagnose this
 type of error ?</p>

<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Office 365 Groups - reply from group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Groups - reply from group</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I was wondering if it is possible in office 365 groups to reply to emails/discussions as the group, for the group owners? For example, a staff member emails the group and can the group owner (moderator) reply from the group email address instead of as themselves.
 Acting as a sort of anonyms moderator?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be very useful</p>

<p>hi christopher,</p>
<p>1.right.<br />
2.do you mean like this?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=99bb8673-13a8-4191-8f1e-58d81ed35d78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d99bb8673-13a8-4191-8f1e-58d81ed35d78" /></a></p>
<p>after the creation and right click the group, it shows like this?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d706974c-f9a7-4d51-8888-9c3f6b578751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd706974c-f9a7-4d51-8888-9c3f6b578751" /></a></p>
<p>3.since the group name doesn’t match and the id(alias), the parameter i gave to you might be a little confusing. never mind, you can just run the command as below<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=bcd8387e-c68e-4cf7-bea3-d22d54a9e1de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dbcd8387e-c68e-4cf7-bea3-d22d54a9e1de" /></a><br />
then the email address should be shown as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>feel free to post back if you have any question about the issue.</p>

    <title>Remove style causes Word to crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swee&#39;pea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove style causes Word to crash</h2>
                    <p>Just discovered this community. Although it's some months later, I'm hoping this thread may still be active. Following the advice, I have tried several times 'right-clicking' the 'remove style ' option, however, this does NOT remove the style icon from the
 style bar...it remains annoyingly visible. What it does do is activate the 'Microsoft Word has encountered a problem...' window, and sends the info to Microsoft. &nbsp;This has happened around 10 times so far. &nbsp;There appears to be NO way that I can hide the unwanted
 style icons from view. It is most annoying as they selfishly poach a considerable amount of valuable room from the workspace with what are, in the main, redundant tools!! &nbsp;Mr Gates already has my money, unfortunately, but it is niggling points such as these
 that encourage me to defect entirely to Pages and give up on Microsoft altogether...

            No offense intended, but the procedure described in the post you jumped into works just fine :-) If right-clicking -- for whatever purpose -- causes Word to crash there is a system problem that needs to be resolved.<br />
<br />
Start with the basics:<br />
<ol>
<li>Make sure your installation of OS X is fully updated</li><li>Confirm that you have the latest Office updates applied -- v14.3.2 was published just yesterday</li><li>Run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions</li><li>Use Font Book to clear up any font issues: <a href="http://word.mvps.org/mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Font Weeding.</strong></a></li><li>Restart your Mac</li></ol>
<br />
If you continue to have the problem, create a new User Account to see if the same behavior occurs when logged in as that user. Reply here with your results &amp; any other details you can supply.<br />
<br />
As a side note: I appreciate your frustration but it does no good to make threats here. The community is manned by volunteer users assisting other users. None of us have any vested interest in what software you choose to use :-)<br />

            'Cyber Taz': Thank you for taking the time to respond to my query...I was somewhat perturbed by the 'threat' comment; not sure who might perceive my tongue-in-cheek comment as intimidating, but, hey....that's what makes us all individuals...no 'threat'
 against any person, organisation, software developer/retailer or any other parties intended, you have my assurance! &nbsp;
<div>So, to the issue in hand: my whole set up is just 3 weeks old and Office Student version was downloaded in-store (without CD) by the Apple Retail Outlet people. Everything is up-to-date, fonts weeded, no issues detected. I am also unable to initiate input
 in Word e-publisher and notebook views, or copy+paste this message into a blank Word document without crashing and receiving the error message, however, all my existing/transferred-in documents are Word and are editable. Installation issue, perhaps. Not sure
 how one is expected to re-install Office 11 without a CD, therefore will have to contact MS asap. I shall report findings here in the hope that others querying the 'remove the style icons from the gallery' issue may be enlightened further. &nbsp;</div>

            Hi Swee'Pea,
<div><br />
<div>My apologies of the advice was too harsh. I spend about 1/2 hr to 45 min every day trying to rescue new questions appended to old threads. I know I don't catch them all. I only check Word, Excel and PowerPoint forums. New questions appended in other forums
 pretty much are ignored altogether. I tried to come up with wording that works in all situations without going into a lot of detail. I'm never sure if my time would be better spent answering just the new questions. Bob and I have a system of sorts. He and
 others grab the new questions. I look at questions that have not had activity for 3 days and see what's up with them. So now I'm looking at your question. It's complicated. I know.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Troubleshooting your problem is going to be a process of elimination. You have taken steps to rule out updates and common installation problems. Bob suggested using
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>Disk Utility</b></a> to repair disk permissions. I will add a further suggestion to use Disk Utility to verify the startup volume.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>There is a web site you can use to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>download the Office installer</b></a>. We're not at the stage of completely removing Office 2011 yet, but if you want to download the installer and burn it to a DVD for future use, that would be fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bob recommended that you create a new user in your Mac OS System Preferences Accounts and try the same steps in Word.&nbsp;New user accounts generate a complete set of factory default preferences.&nbsp;The reason he suggested this is that if Word is OK in a new
 user account, it is likely that deleting preferences in your regular account will fix the crashing problem. If you then asked how to delete the preferences, we would tell you where to find out how to do it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So please try using Word in a fresh user account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, please copy the first 20-30 lines of any crash report you receive&nbsp;and paste them into a reply. There might be some information there that points to the cause of your crash.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to import your contacts from Yahoo.com account into your Outlook.com account and I'm here to assist you. Unfortunately, there is no way to import contacts from other domains to Outlook.com for now but there is a workaround for
 that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can sign in your account&nbsp;on the&nbsp;web mail and import contacts using CSV and you will have all the contacts you want from Yahoo to your Outlook account. However, you need to ask for support from Yahoo.com to make your contacts into a CSV file format so
 you can import it to your Outlook.com accout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Why do you believe it's hard?&nbsp; You need to transfer the contacts using a CSV, which is fairly easy and has been described already.&nbsp; To transfer the mail, install Windows Live Mail, connect to your Yahoo mailbox with an IMAP account, connect to your Outlook.com
 mailbox with DeltaSync (the default protocol WLM will choose when creating the account) and simply drag/drop the messages from one mailbox to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that if you transfer your Yahoo messages to Outlook.com, you won't be able to reply to them with your Yahoo address unless you set up the Yahoo address as a send-only account in Outlook.com.</p>
