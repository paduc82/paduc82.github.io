<h2>            Microsoft Access Database, Populating Table Columns from other tables</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill start by saying my entire experience with Access, totals one week of creating file after file to learn the basics.&nbsp; So my level of knowledge is non-existent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to create a Database that runs multiple tables, but populates information from a master table,&nbsp; and make the relationships as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Master Table&nbsp;- Used to input the primary Information, Columns as follows&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; LName/Section/Clerk/Issue/Assigned/Due Date/Overdue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want&nbsp;the Column "Section" to identify the&nbsp;issue the person has, and have it populate LName / Clerk Columns on a&nbsp; corresponding table , based on the Selector/Dropdown name used on the Master Table,&nbsp; the selectors/drop down being Receipts/Transfers/Travel/Separations/Pay/Personnel.&nbsp;
 I also will have additional fields on each of the tables being "fed" information, that will be unique to the table, here is the example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 1 - To identify people as Transfers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Columns:&nbsp; LName / Clerk/ Transfer Date / Screening ETC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be more fields, but you get the idea.&nbsp; Following are the names of other tables, but not the columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Table 2 - To identify people as Travel</p>
<p>Table 3 - To identify people as Receipts</p>
<p>Table 4 - To identify people as Separations</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;5 - To identify people as Pay</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;6 - To identify people as Personnel</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>
</p><p>need to know how to associate them (Relationships, I think) so they all populate from the Master Table, somewhat like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "Master Table;Section Column" Reads "Receipts/Transfers/Travel/Separations/Pay or Personnel" ; Populate column LNAME/Clerk of Table Receipts/Transfers/Travel/Separations/Pay/Personnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Master Table &gt; Column; Section =&nbsp;Receipts &gt; Populate/Duplicate from Master Table&nbsp;to Table Receipts&nbsp;&gt; Column: LName/Clerk</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I made this as clear as possible, I will be actively watching this post until 3PM EST for any assistance / questions and then tomorrow starting at 0730.&nbsp;Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>We need some more info here. We need to understand your table structure and what your application is supposed to do for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The foundation of an efficient database s a properly normalized table structure. You need to get that down before you start anything else. One of the main priciples of normalization is to reduce or eliminate redundancy. So, for example. The ONLY place you
 should have a LName field is in a table with people information. You should NOT be repeating it in other tables. In your people table you assign a PersonID to each individual and that ID becomes your foreing key to relate that person to child records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you describe above, it does not appear your tables are designed properly as there is too much redundancy. Your whole concept of a master table appears incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So show us your table strucutre and describe the app you are trying to create so we can help you.</p>

            <p>I am not sure what you are asking, as my own knowledge is so limited, but what I want to accomplish with the app is a Master Table I can use to print out a consolidated report, but still be able to print tasking lists per section or clerk, let me try to
 show what I want directly from what I already have created:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Master Tracker Entry, Table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column 1: ID (Unique to Master Tracker Entry)</p>
<p>Column 2: LName&nbsp; (Fully editable to type in Names)</p>
<p>Column 3: Section</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; LookUp Wizard Drop Down Selectors:&nbsp; Transfer, Travel, Receipts, Separations, Pay or&nbsp;Personnel</p>
<p>Column 4: Clerk</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LookUp Wizard Drop Down Selectors: Names of my Clerks</p>
<p>Column 5: Issue&nbsp; (Fully editable to type in exact issue notes)</p>
<p>Column 6: Assigned (DateTime)</p>
<p>Column 7: Due Date (DateTime)</p>
<p>Column 8: 10 Day Warning (DateTime)</p>
<p>Column 9: Overdue (DateTime)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the other worksheets to pull the information from LName and Clerk column, and have it populate on a different table, for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Receipts, Table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column 1: ID&nbsp; (Unique to Receipts Table)</p>
<p>Column 2: LName&nbsp; (Populated from Master Tracker Entry)</p>
<p>Column 3: Clerk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Populated from Master Tracker Entry)</p>
<p>Column 4: Check In Date (DateTime)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem I have is I only want certain entries from the Master Tracker Entry to be pulled to specific worksheets, based on the Master Tracker Entry Table, Column 3.&nbsp; So if you click the drop down and select "Receipts"&nbsp; It would then populate the LName
 and Clerk directly to the Receipts Table after the entry is completed on the Master Tracker Entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am doing this so specifically is that the reports I am required to run and submit to other entities aren't entitled to all the information, only to their specific area of information, So I figured this would be the easiest way to make a Master
 Tracker for my personnel and myself, while being able to run specific reports for these other entities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes it more clear of what I need.</p>

            <p>You need to rethink your design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a better understanding now, but I still need clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, what is the relationship between LName and Clerk? Second, in your "Master" table I'm guessing there can be multiple entries for the same or different combinations of LName and Clerk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Lookup fields on the table level is NOT recommended. they cause more problems than they are worth. Lookups should be don on the Form level using list controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said earlier the goal of normalization is to eliminate redundancy. You should not have data in more than one table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for producing reports, you produce reports from queries, you don't create other tables.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As my colleagues here have said, your design is incorrect. You're making some very common beginner's mistakes - not surprising, Access and relational databases are way more complicated than most Office apps! Having a lot of experience with Excel can actually
 get in the way - tables are NOT Workbooks, and you have to "unlearn" some things which are just done differently. In particular, you do not need to (indeed should not!) create new Tables just to generate Reports. Instead, data is stored in Tables; arranged
 and combined using Queries; and you then base your Reports on those Queries.</p>

            <p>To Scott: The relationship for the LName and Clerk is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>LName - Identifies the person that has the issue or action required</p>
<p>Clerk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Identifies the person I assigned to complete the issue or action</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am trying to find a reliable way that multiple personnel can access a this database and enter in issues as they come in, and then allows me to utilize some way of assigning it to a specific clerk, and it be viewable by personnel in my office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand its redundancy, I am just not sure of how else to make it work.&nbsp; As for the LookUp function, I am not sure what "Form level using list controls" but if you could explain it, I will convert my tables to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should data not be in more then one table?&nbsp; My guess is that it is because the Table should hold all the data and the reports or something like that will just read from that data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Producing reports from Queries is a great idea and I agree, but how can I create a master table to enter the data I need, when only certain items apply to certain sections?&nbsp; Meaning that the columns for Transfers are completely different from the Receipts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Vinson:&nbsp; I will gladly go through these tutorials and hope I find the answer.&nbsp; Perhaps there will be something in there that will allow me to get this going,&nbsp;&nbsp; With these Queries, is it possible to section off the Table I will use for data entry to have
 separate columns/entry blocks based on the the correlating issue?&nbsp; (Ex, If the issue is for a Transfer, can I make it so I can click Transfer and only have to enter in the data required for Transfers?</p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Because this is a fundamental principle of relational database design. The principles of designing relational databases were first put forth in the early 1970s. They have stood, largely unchanged
 since then. So they have&nbsp;stood&nbsp;the test of&nbsp;time. One of the reasons for this is to prevent update anomalies. Lets say a person changes their name. if you are storing the name in multiple tables you have to change it every place.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Users should never interface with tables directly. All interaction with data should be done on forms. Therefore, using lookup fields in tables can cause problems. If you want to do a lookup (and lookups
 are an important tool) then should be done on forms using list controls like comboboxes, listboxes and option groups.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Producing reports from Queries is a great idea"</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Its not just a great idea, its the only idea. In a relational database, reporting often requires the use of multiple tables (because data is stored in one table only). So queries are&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to
 reporting.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;how can I create a master table to enter the data I need, when only certain items apply to certain
 sections?&nbsp; Meaning that the columns for Transfers are completely different from the Receipts?"</strong></span></p>
<p>This is why we need to see your complete table structure and understand your application. Two possibilities come to mind. If you need to capture different data for Transfers than Receipts, then you may need to use at table in a one:one relationship. With
 a separate table for Transfer and a separate table for Receipts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But looking at your Master Table that would need to be changed:</p>
<p>Master Tracker Entry, Table</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column 1: <strong>Master</strong>ID (Unique to Master Tracker Entry)</p>
<p>Column 2: <strong>ReportedByID</strong> &nbsp;<em>Select from a table of people who will report issues</em></p>
<p>Column 3: Section<strong>ID </strong><em>This would pull the ID field from a Lookup table of Sections</em></p>
<p>Column 4: Clerk<strong>ID</strong> <em>Select from a table of clerks.</em><br />
Column 5: Issue&nbsp; (Fully editable to type in exact issue notes)</p>
<p>Column 6: Assigned (DateTime)</p>
<p>Column 7: Due Date (DateTime)</p>
<p><del>Column 8: 10 Day Warning (DateTime)</del></p>
<p><del>Column 9: Overdue (DateTime)</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You probably don't need 8 and 9 as they should be calculated according to your business rules. Fields 2-4 are&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Keys that relate back to other tables.&nbsp;</span></span><strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;If
 the issue is for a Transfer, can I make it so I can click Transfer and only have to enter in the data required for Transfers?"</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, definitely. If you select Transfer as the Section, you can make visible a subform for entering Transfer data, If a different Section value is selected then you make visible the appropriate subform.</p>

</p><p>Bear with me. &nbsp;Yes, I do have another active email address and that is what I want to change to because the one currently in my security profile is no longer active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that someone apparently hacked my email and has scheduled some sort of security change that is supposed to take place on 5/21/2014. &nbsp;For me to cancel that action, I apparently need a valid email address to send a 'security code' to. &nbsp;As I said,

<h2>            Windows Defender Offline fails when formating USB drive</h2>
                    I have attempted to use Windows Defender Offline by creating a USB drive. Everything works until it gets to step 3, reformatting drive, and then I receive an error that it cannot format the drive. I have used 5 different thumb drives and two different
 computers, all with the same issue. I'm using Windows 7. I have tried formatting the thumb drives using FAT, FAT32, and NTFS, and have tried running the file as Administrator, but no success.&nbsp;One error message I'm receiving regarding being unable to format
 the drive is, "Error: 0007-8004DD1D". Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Willie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the following will help: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html</a>.&nbsp; Specifically focus on step 6 and reasons why formatting may not work.&nbsp; If this occurs, format the USB drive manually with Windows (but remember it needs to be made bootable and
 not just normally formatted - so see <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/31541-windows-7-usb-dvd-download-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/31541-windows-7-usb-dvd-download-tool.html</a>&nbsp;for help)&nbsp;and then go through the creation process again and the program's formatting process should hopefully work this time.&nbsp; If not, then read on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following may also help: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline</a>. Also see the related links in that link and in those other links for additional information.&nbsp; To be honest, this probably won't help much and I'd skip it and move on and return
 only if all else fails to see if it adds anything of value before replying back here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that not every computer can boot to a USB drive.&nbsp; Are you absolutely positive that you BIOS permits this on those computers?&nbsp; I, for example, cannot do it on my Dell Inspiron E1705 Laptop running 32-bit Vista Business SP2 and the most recent A10
 BIOS (and have asked Dell and been told it will never be possible on this computer) - so I'm limited to using CD's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above doesn't help, see if you can create a Windows Defender Offline CD instead of a USB and see if that works as far as formatting and creating goes and then confirm that it actually works doing the boot and the scan.&nbsp; If so, then we've narrowed
 down the issue to involving&nbsp; USB drives and not the entire Windows Defender Offline program and process - and this information will help narrow down the potential issues considerably.&nbsp; The tutorial above describes this process as well in a different step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, let us know what happened or didn't happen so we can narrow down alternatives to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            No one would know exactly which factory phones comes from. If you are so worried, buy from an authorized store.

<h2>            Mail for Exchange 3.00.050 and roaming</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia N95 8GB. Recently I installed Mail for Exchange 3.00.050 and I use it to read my gmail account. In the settings I have selected 'Sync while roaming: NO'. In the built-in email client I have selected to only get mail from my own provider. I
 live in Holland, my provider is 'T-Mobile NL'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last weekend I was in Germany. While I was there, my phone was connected to provider 'T-Mobile D'. Because I was roaming, the built-in client did not get any mail during my stay in Germany. But to my surprise I&nbsp;heard the 'new mail' ringtone,&nbsp;telling me&nbsp;that
 new mail was received. It turned out that Mail for Exchange had connected to the internet and got new messeages from gmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is this possible? The setting was set to NO!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled Mail for Exchange by setting the schedule to manual, to avoid extra costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ie. roaming.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you get any answers to you problem?</p>
<p>I had similar surprise.</p>
<p>Set Synch. in roaming to "No" in my client 3.00.050 on my N93i.</p>
<p>During 1 week in Egypt had received no email but...</p>
<p>Got form my local operator invoice for around 500 euro.</p>
<p>After short investigation&nbsp; discovered that from 8:00 to 17:00 every 15 minutes got connected to internet every day. Each connection 1 Euro :)</p>
<p>I suspect that even if synch is set to "No" my mail for exchange connect to the server every 15 minutes according to its schedule and is not synchronizing data.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            But if you check SaveAS....&nbsp; You will see there is version to save with macros included .xlsm<br />
<br />
That means its macro enabled. <br />
<br />
Try saving in that format and see what happens.<br />

            Saving in XLSM or xls ought to work fine. Both VBA and XLM macros will work fine in either format. What does "don't work" mean? Do you get an error? which one? what happens?

            Even worse when saved as an .xlsm file. Even a macro that worked ‚Äî the Sheets("Hm") example ‚Äî now produces a runtime error. I also notice that the file size has shrunk from 14 mb down to 4 mb, &nbsp;a bit disturbing.
<div><br />
<div>When I referred earlier to macros not working I meant simply that they wouldn't run ‚Äî no error message, just nothing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And when I try to step into such macros (through the Macros‚Ä¶ dialog box) and click on a macro title the Create button activates. Not Run, Step Into or Edit. Excel seems to have killed off such macros, leaving only the macro titles.</div>

            If you had saved the file as xlsx, it would have deleted the macros. You can see if the macros are there by looking in the VB Editor. If you get a run time error are yu sure that the sheet is present and named "Hm" make sure the sheet name has no trailing
 blanks and is not hidden.<br />

            <div>Thanks for your suggestions Bob.</div>
<div><br />
Actually I saved the workbook as xlsm. Many macros are there. At least some are not. I haven't tested all yet so I'm not sure what proportion still work since upgrading yesterday to office 2011.
<div><br />
<div>I definitely have a sheet named Hm (macro runs), also the other sheet mentioned earlier, Cht (macro doesn't run). They have been there for more than a decade. The only change to the spreadsheet is that I saved it as xlsm so it would work with macros under
 office 2011 as per Phillip's suggestion. (Recall above the error messages when keeping the workbook as xls.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have also noticed that custom menus lost some of their menu items, if I have the terminology right, after converting to xlsm. Fortunately recreating them is relatively easy, and have done so. Still, it suggests something goes wrong under office 2011.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Shubham,<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand what you feel, and since you left your phone in the Nokia Care Center, they should take care and update you about the repair status of your phone. We suggest that you get in touch with them again for further assistance. Better if they can contact
 the shipment company just to find out why the phone is not yet delivered until now.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to get back to us for further assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Random English words in my document replaced by random codes</h2>
                    <p>I have a document that contains a novel I'm writing. The novel is largely in Dutch, but it contains some English, French, Latin and Gaelic phrases. All text in different languages is italicized. When I opened it today, some of the English words were replaced
 by weird codes. They are:</p>
<p>- 258ob</p>
<p>- e258at</p>
<p>- e258a</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you copy them, only the letters get copied, the numbers don't seem to exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is, when I re-opened the file for the third time, the codes were gone and everything was normal again. But the next day, it was back again, also in the French sections.</p>
<p>The document has a total of 861 pages and is 1,9 MB. Could it be that word can't handle a file that big? I can't imagine, but still...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>It happened between 8 and 15 November and according to the Microsoft website, there was an update released on the 7th, so if I did not install that right away, which is possible, it could be a consequence of the update.</span></p>

<h2>            Dialing out to 0845 using Skype for Business Cloud PBX</h2>
                    <p>We have domestic calling plan and are able to dial out 01/02/03 and 0800 numbers fine but have an issue with 0845 and 0871 numbers essentially premium rate numbers.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your situation, it is recommended to check that if you have successfully assigned the 0845 or 0871 number to the user. Generally, we can have 2 methods of having the phone numbers for Skype for Business Domestic calling, that is&nbsp;getting new numbers using
 the Skype for Business admin center (Microsoft) and porting or transferring your existing numbers from your current service provider or phone carrier to Office 365. Here is an article for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Skype-for-Business-phone-numbers-for-your-users-aa2ec464-3481-4bbb-8c14-e13e18093df5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Skype-for-Business-phone-numbers-for-your-users-aa2ec464-3481-4bbb-8c14-e13e18093df5</a>&nbsp;(You
 may re-perform to assign the numbers via the article).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<h2>            Alias - is it possible that my Alias is someone else&#39;s account&#33;</h2>
                    Is it possible that my Alias is someone else's account and we both are receiving each other's emails? I already had outlook.com account and created a hotmail alias. It was strange for me that I got hotmail alias as way back I tried to create an account
 with hotmail but could not get the username I wanted.<br />
After I created hotmail alias, I received few unwanted emails addressed to hotmail alias. Email's were not spams as I received bank account statement that was not mine. I verified senders email and that was authentic. After few days, I stopped receiving emails
 addressed to hotmail alias.<br />
Today I created new Twitter account and gave my hotmail alias as email address. After few hours, I went to outlook account to confirm Twitter registration. To my surprise, Twitter said account is already verified.<br />

            <p>@Microsoft - do you realize this is an extremely easy way to hack someone's email account? If you know their email address just add it as an alias and voila! you're receiving their email !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm this as I have the same issue. Added alias,&nbsp;immediately started receiving&nbsp;other people's email.&nbsp;It is from more than one person - that means some of these addresses&nbsp;are ALSO aliases!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure whether this works both ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So to summarize this is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- your primary&nbsp;address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>- you create alias&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>- you start receiving email messages&nbsp;addressed to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;obviously not intended for you</p>
<p>- *** Email address is removed for privacy *** could be used by&nbsp;many&nbsp;different people as it seems..</p>
<p>- email addressed to you under your *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;address is probably received by others (not confirmed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not sure if the messages you receive that are meant for other people are just copies or the intended recipient never actually&nbsp;gets the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@Microsoft - this is&nbsp;a security flaw that should be addressed from your side promptly as it's&nbsp;likely being exploited already.</p>

            <p>I have also the same problem...... I use one alias email of my live.com account but in outlook.com..</p>
<p>Eg I have an email account in live.com but have alias in outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the same way , I also get someone's email. The mails I get is genuine. He book cabs, ship something...</p>
<p>But I never respond to that mail nor research..</p>
<p>But my fear is , does he use my email too?</p>
<p>I use 2 step verification method, I hope he didn't use my mail, but there is something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported this problem to Microsoft but no replies...</p>
<p>This is a very serious issue but Microsoft didn't care about this severe bug...</p>

    <title>Outlook interface March 2018 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmiddleton_020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook interface March 2018</h2>
                    Suddenly my Outlook interface has changed so that I can n longer open an email on a new page but only on the right hand side. This is intolerable. I cannot read the emails particularly newsletters etc in the minute and narrow size alloted. How can I switch
 back to the former set up where the email opened on a second page. And why does Outlook insist on introducing changes that provide a worse format than the previous one.&nbsp;

<p>Yes, <em>(removed by moderator to protect your privacy)</em>. &nbsp;We first called for support around 11 am MST, we were put in the queue to talk to a technician. &nbsp;After waiting 2 1/2 hours, we called again on another phone and were into the queue again after
 being told that waiting for 2 1/2 hours was normal. &nbsp;After 4 1/2 hours on the original call and incredibly high levels of frustration at the lack of customer support or care, we began searching online for other venues for support from Microsoft. &nbsp;We found
 the answer desk and scheduled a call. &nbsp;We received a c all back within a couple minutes, where we expressed our frustration and were told they would transfer us directly to the right department. &nbsp;We told them we did not want to sit on hold again for hours,
 which they assured us would not happen, then promptly hung up or dropped our call. &nbsp;We scheduled another call, which again was returned promptly, and were eventually informed that apparently a technician had tried calling and emailing us, which frustrated
 us further as the issue we had was the email not working for the individual who had been on the phone for 4 1/2 hours. &nbsp;Calling the individual and leaving a message didn't help either, as they were on the phone in the queue. &nbsp;We did eventually connect with
 the guy after we finally got fed up and hung up after finding all of this out. &nbsp;In total, three of our key staff were out of commission for over 7 hours yesterday, which also caused issues with our clients and a host of other ripple effect problems. &nbsp;We still
 have work to do this morning to get it things straightened out. &nbsp;We are not happy and are in the process of soliciting proposals for a fixed server solution, as we cannot afford to have this happen again and have absolutely no trust in the technical support
 offered by Microsoft. &nbsp;We will in all likelihood be leaving Office 365 due to this experience.</p>

                    <p>Hello, <br />
<br />
Happy New Year's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a chart with data for 2 days: Nov 24 2014 and Jan 09 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Excel to generate a chart and it gives me includes 3 dates Nov 1, Dec 1 and Jan 1.&nbsp; The Dec 1 is blank so it looks like there was a drop to zero in revenue which looks really bad.&nbsp; There is no space between the data for Nov 24 and Jan 09.</p>
<p>The chart option I'm using is Clustered Bar in 3-D.&nbsp; I have similar issues with other chart options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried playing with the "Hidden and Empty Cells" option but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>I've tried adding another column in between but it just generate more empty spaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Simple fix is to switch the axis to Text only. &nbsp;The settings are different places depending on which version you're using but I think the easiest way to get there is right-clicking on the horizontal axis and selecting Format Axis. Under Axis Type, select
 Text and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel treats dates like snapshots on a continual timeline, as it should, but this causes issues at time. For many scenarios it's easier to treat the date as a text description.</p>

<p>Even if you had the IMEI your chances of tracking it successfully is practically nil. Best you could do with the IMEI is to get it blocked. Most stolen phones will have their sim removed, reset and sent to a foreign country as soon as they are stolen.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mac Air - When saving a Word file, it freezes briefly and then opens up Excel &#40;was completely freezing and shutting down before&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm working with a Word document and moving some images around within it, and yesterday when I tried to save it at any point, Word would freeze, try to open up excel automatically, and I'd lose any progress in my Word file because I would have no choice
 but to force close it. I ended up running CleanMyMac3 to scan/clean up unnecessary files, and now I can save my Word file, but it still freezes for a brief period while it opens up Excel. Any ideas what would cause this? How to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Edit</strong></em>: <em>Open XML may be tied to the issue as it was asking for permission yesterday and is also unresponsive at times (pops up) when Word is briefly frozen and Excel is opening.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
<p>Cole</p>

</p><p>About macro, we could click<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-run-edit-or-delete-a-macro-fc5fb55d-124d-4cc7-bae0-111c9c26e234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> View tab&gt;Macros&gt;View Macros</a> to see if there are some macros in this

<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned the behavior is related to the xml file in this Word document, you could contact other users. Check if they encounter the same behavior on their Mac or Windows devices with the same document. And then we can identify if it is only related
 to your Mac.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Groove Music crashes upon startup and is stuck in update queue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcrobertson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music crashes upon startup and is stuck in update queue</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to start Groove Music for the first time. However, upon doing so, I'm greeted with an error message that states: "This app can't open. Check the Windows Store for more info about Groove Music." After I click the link in the error message to
 go to the store, the store indicates that the Groove Music app encountered a problem and needs to be reinstalled to repair it. After re-installing the app, the error condition persists and Groove Music will not open. Furthermore, I noticed in the Downloads
 and Updates section of the Windows Store, the Groove Music app is stuck in the queue with slightly different error message that says: "Try that again. Something went wrong. The error code is 0x80070003, in case you need it." Trying again of course doesn't
 fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>SOLVED!!&nbsp; Here's what I did to correct the problem in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Back up any important documents such as certificate keys and other important stuff as&nbsp;THE FOLLOWING STEPS&nbsp;WILL DELETE ANY DATA NOT BACKED UP!</p>
<p>2. Create second computer account and assign it administrator access. Reboot.</p>
<p>3. Sign into this just created administrator account. Go to File Explorer.</p>
<p>4. In the left pane, right click on "This PC" and select "Properties"</p>
<p>5. In the left pane of the&nbsp;window that appears, select "Advanced system settings."</p>
<p>6. In the System Properties window that appears, click "Settings..." within the "User Profiles" frame.</p>
<p>7. Select the profile whose Groove Music app is not working and select delete.</p>
<p>8. Return to the File Explorer and in the left pane, right click on "This PC" and select "Manage"</p>
<p>9. Expand "Local Users and Groups" and click on "Users."</p>
<p>10. Right-click on the account whose Groove Music app is not working and select delete.</p>
<p>11. Click Start, then "Settings" and then select "Accounts"</p>
<p>12. In the left pane, select "Family &amp; other users".</p>
<p>13. There you can add back the recently deleted account.</p>
<p>14. Reboot and sign into the re-created account..&nbsp; Groove Music should now work.</p>

</p><p>You can also request a mod to move a thread to a different forum (useful when you are unsure of the language).&nbsp; On the blue ribbon at the top of the forum is a drop-down called "Participate."&nbsp; When you drop the menu down you will see "Community Participation
 Center."&nbsp; Click on the top (pinned) thread, "Moderation Requests - Week of...." and reply.&nbsp; You can also do this for posts that obviously are not Insider related.&nbsp; The mods request that when we do this, we do not also tell the OP to start a new thread elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this several time a day to route questions to other forums when they clearly aren't Insiders and the question obviously concerns regular Windows or some earlier version of Windows.&nbsp; You can tell a lot about a poster from his profile, which you can look
 at by clicking on his avatar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sharing all this because I am seriously considering quitting my forum activity after RS4 releases next month.&nbsp; I want to spend my free time on some other interests.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you would consider picking up helping route lost posters too?&nbsp; The mods value our help in uncluttering the Insider forums.&nbsp; They really do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; You can also request locking old threads on the CPC page. &nbsp;</p>
