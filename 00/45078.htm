    <title>laptop keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            laptop keyboard not working</h2>
                    I&nbsp;had the RC version of Windows working fine on my Asus Aspire 5670 laptop for several months.&nbsp; then about 2 weeks age, i installed a couple of windows updates and the laptop keyboard stopped woorking. no red bangs in deice manager, updating driver had
 no effect. keyboard works fine in bios as well as in safe mode.&nbsp; restore points had no effect. flashed the bios, still nothing.<br />
Since Windows 7 was released last week, i snagged a copy and did a clean install (formatting the system drive in advance) assuming that this would fix the problem - it did not! I had to use the on screen keyboard to enter&nbsp; the product key ;)<br />
any advice would be appreciated...

            I have found the solution to my problem. Its a Synaptic Touch Pad driver issue. If you have an Alienware m17x go to their Knowledge base and read article 6058 or 6059... Everyone else find the Synaptic driver or the Touch Pad driver for you touch pad and
 keyboard for the correct version of Windows and the 32bit or 64bit version... Be carefull, the Windows update may ask to update it... DON'T!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Family Safety - Block Apps &#38; Games</h2>
                    <p>This feature doesn't work at all!</p>
<ul>
<li>I went into "Manage Family Settings Online".</li><li>Clicked on the child account I wanted to manage.</li><li>Under Apps &amp; Games it showed a bunch of games he recently played, all with the option to "Block" to the right of each one.</li><li>I went through and clicked each one, so it read "Blocked" instead.</li><li>I had my child reboot his computer and sure enough he could <strong>still access</strong> those games.</li><li>I went back into the page where I blocked them all and they had all been reset so they displayed "Block" to the right again.</li></ul>
<p>Can someone please shed some light on this for me? I have a high school kid that needs his PC for homework but I don't want him tempted by all the games that have been installed.</p>

            Removing then adding the child back didn't work. The only part of family security that works for me is controlling screen time. Blocking apps doesn't work. Disappointed that you took away parental controls. Now it's affecting how/when my kids does his
 homework. :(

<p>Since this is two years old I assume this would have been resolved by now, but I'm having the same issue and don't see any documented solution. My son's account is on a Windows 10 machine. I followed all the correct procedures under 'Recent Activity' and
 block the apps, but without any special workarounds, he can still run the apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a weekly report that shows the amount of time he's running the apps. As the other user states, only the screen time limit works. Anyone find a solution to this? Removing, re-adding was tried some time ago to no avail. Is there a Windows 10 update that
 needs to be installed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Trying to go to power save mode only switches to login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ollim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to go to power save mode only switches to login screen</h2>
                    For some time I have the problem that when I click on 'sleep' in my Windows 7 installation it doesn't switch the computer off but only brings me to the login screen as if I just had clicked on 'lock'. The problem appeared just out of the blue to me, I
 didn't mess with the system (except for the automatic installation of updates). I looked through the system logs but couldn't find anything that gives me a clue (it looks like there are no interesting log messages generated on the failed sleep attempt). Neither
 chkdsk nor 'clean up' the system partition didn't help.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem appearing before under Vista which I could fix by reinstalling the system. But I'm getting sick of have to install things *again*, so I'm wondering if there is a way to the debug and fix this. Anyone an idea where to look?

            Hello OlliM,<br />
<br />
Ok, in that case follow the steps given below and hopefully one of the steps should fix the sleep mode issue :<br />
<br />
<strong>BEFORE STARTING:</strong> <br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest device drivers and BIOS installed for your motherboard<br />
.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> A out-of-date video driver or other drivers are sometimes the source of sleep mode problems. It is best to keep these up to date to resolve issues found with them. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP ONE:</strong> <br />
Check Your Mouse and Keyboard<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A wireless mouse and keyboard can cause your computer to wake up for no apparent reason, and to not wake up from sleep mode when you press a key or move the mouse. This may also cause your screen saver to not work to. If the computer is using an optical
 mouse, changes in light can cause the computer to wake. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a USB Mouse or Keyboard:</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Check the BIOS settings to make sure that you have a Legacy USB option enabled.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a Wireless Mouse or Keyboard:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Unplug the receiver on the back of the computer and test.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If sleep or hibernation works now, then try:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Download new drivers for you wireless mouse and test again with the receiver plugged in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> Always get your drivers from the source, never from Windows Updates. They do not work properly sometimes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Disable the wireless mouse and/or keyboard wake up option in Step Five below. If you have to disable both of them, then you can wake the computer up by pressing the power button on the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Time to get a new mouse and/or keyboard that is compatible with Windows7.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a Optical Mouse:</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Try not to have direct bright light shining on the sensor or moving around it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP TWO:</strong> <br />
Check Settings in Power Plan Options<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Power settings control the computer’s ability to go into and come out of sleep/standby mode. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open the Control Panel. (Classic View)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on the Power Options icon.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click on the Change plan settings link under your power plan. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click on Change advanced power settings. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click on Change settings that are currently unavailable. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> This will allow any Power Options that are grayed out to now work and not be grayed out.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Recommended Settings for Sleep -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> Sleep saves any open documents and programs to memory only, and then puts the computer into a low-power state.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WARNING: If you lose power to the computer, you will also lose what is in memory.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sub Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recommendation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard disk&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to at least 1 minute before the computer is set to sleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleep after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is for the computer. Set to at least 1 minute after Hard disk and Display is set to turn off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allow hybrid sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hibernate after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Never.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USB settings&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;USB selective suspend setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Disabled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power buttons and lid&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start menu power button&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Sleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI Express&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Link State Power Management&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off display after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to at least 1 minute before the computer is set to sleep. Usually set this as the same as the Hard drive is set to turn off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multimedia settings&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When sharing media&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to Allow the computer to sleep.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Recommended Settings for Hybrid Sleep -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE: </strong>Hybrid sleep saves your open documents and programs to memory and to the hard drive, and then puts the computer into a low-power state. After the Hibernate after time you set, it will then put the computer into hibernation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>WARNING:</strong> Use the same Recommended Settings for Sleep in step 6 above, except for these changes:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sub Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recommendation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allow hybrid sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to On.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hibernate after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set to at least 1 minute after the computer (Sleep after setting above) is set to sleep.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Recommended Settings for Hibernation -<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> Hibernation is a power-saving state that saves your open documents and programs to the hard drive and then turns off your computer. If Hibernate after is not listed, then make sure that you have the Hibernation File enabled or restored
 to. It is by default unless it was cleaned in Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>WARNING:</strong> Use the same Recommended Settings for Sleep in step 6 above, except for these changes:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sub Setting&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recommendation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sleep after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set it to Never.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allow hybrid sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set it to Never.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hibernate after&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set it to at least 1 minute after Hard disk and Display is set to turn off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power buttons and lid&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start menu power button&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set it to Hibernate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Click on OK to apply<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Just exit out the other windows.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power_options.jpgoptions-1.jpg<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Test sleep mode. If it is still not working correctly, then continue to the next step.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP THREE:</strong> <br />
Check Sleep State in BIOS<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure you have the latest Video drivers and BIOS for your motherboard. Read your motherboard manual to see if you have any jumpers or settings that sets different sleep voltages for USB. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In white line (Start Search) area, type cmd and press Enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In command prompt, type powercfg -a and press Enter. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> This will give you a report of the available sleep states for your computer and will attempt to report reasons why sleep states are unavailable. You will want to see if the ACPI S1 and/or S3 is listed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Restart the computer into the BIOS settings, and go into the Power Management section in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> Usually you will press the F2 or Delete key as soon as your computer starts booting to enter the BIOS.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Make sure ACPI mode: S3 or S1 is enabled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>WARNING:</strong> S1 (Sleep) and S3 (Hybrid deeper sleep). If you are running an incompatible video card, some or all of these states below may be unavailable. If one of the settings causes your computer to not wake back up afterwards, then reset
 the CMOS on the motherboard and restart the computer, or unplug the computer for a moment and plug it back in, and reset the BIOS back to the factory default settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Make sure Wake on Ring and Wake on Lan are disabled.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> This will help with keep the computer from waking up on it's on.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Save the BIOS setting changes and exit to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Test sleep mode. If this does not help, then move on to the next step.<br />
<br />
<strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER</strong> :<br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP FOUR:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This will give you a list of items that woke up the computer last that may help narrow down what is waking up the computer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In white line (Start Search) area, type cmd and press Enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In command prompt, type powercfg lastwake and press Enter. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> Notice that I had USB\ROOT\HUB listed. For me, this would be the USB wireless mouse. Your list results will vary of course.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP FIVE:</strong> <br />
To List, Enable, or Disable Device Names Currently Configured to Wake Up the System From any Sleep State<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This will show you a list of devices that are able to wake up your computer to help you narrow down a device that may be responsible for waking up your computer. It does not mean that these devices are the ones that woke up your computer though, just
 that they are able to. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open a elevated command prompt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. To List Devices that Can Wake Up the Computer -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) In the command prompt, copy and paste in bold: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powercfg -devicequery wake_armed and press Enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Go through the list of devices to see if you have one you do not want to wake up your system.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EX: A Network Device (Modem, Ethernet, etc.) or Wireless Mouse.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) If you found a device that may be causing the problem, then check with the STEP SIX section below first to see if you can disable a wake up option for the device in it's Power Management settings in Device Manager to test to see if that is it before
 proceding.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To Disable a Listed Device From Waking Up the Computer -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> Only do this step if you cannot do it from STEP SIX below using Device Manager instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) In the elevated command prompt, type below in bold and press Enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> WARNING:</strong> Be sure to write this device name down in case you want to be able to enable it again in step 4. Once you disable it, it will not be listed again in step 2A until enabled again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powercfg -devicedisablewake "exact name of device listed in step 2A"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> For example, if I wanted to disable the listed (step 2A) High Definition device (HDAC), then I would type powercfg -devicedisablewake "High Definition Audio Controller" and press enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. To Enable a Listed Device Again to Waking Up the Computer -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> Only do this step if you cannot do it from STEP SIX below using Device Manager instead, or you have done step 3 above with the device.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) In the elevated command prompt, type below in bold and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WARNING: Be sure to write this device name down in case you want to be able to enable it again in step 4. Once you disable it, it will not be listed again in step 2A until enabled again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powercfg -deviceenablewake "exact name of device listed in step 2A"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> For example, if I wanted to reenable the High Definition device (HDAC) that was disable and removed from the list in step 3, then I would type powercfg -deviceenablewake "High Definition Audio Controller" and press enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. When done, close the elevated command prompt, and test sleep mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP SIX:</strong> <br />
To Disable or Enable the "Allow this device to wake the computer" Option for a Device<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Check your Network device. Network activity can cause the network hardware to wake the computer, especially when the network is always on (like cable and DSL connections).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * High Definition Audio, if listed in STEP FIVE, may also rarely cause the computer to wake from sleep mode. You can disable (only option available) the device as a test in Device Manager to see before putting the computer to sleep. Just enable it again
 if it is not the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open the Control Panel. (Classic View)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on the Device Manager icon.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> You need to be in a Administrator account.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click on Continue in the UAC prompt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Open the device's list that you want to change. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EX: Network Devices<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Right click on the device name and click on Properties.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EX: Network Devices<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Click on the Power Management tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Uncheck Allow this device to wake the computer. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> To Enable it again, just check this instead. If you need to disable the wireless mouse and keyboard, then you can wake the computer by pressing the power button on the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. If listed, check Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE: </strong>This will turn the device off when the computer goes into sleep mode.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Click on the Advanced tab. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> NOTE:</strong> This is only for the Network device.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Check the boxed in red Property: items below to see if they are set to Disabled in the Value: area.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> This area may be different for your particular network device since it is based on the driver, but it should be similar. You will be looking for any Wake on type property options listed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Click on OK to apply and close properties window.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP SEVEN:</strong> <br />
Check the Screen Saver<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some screen savers can interfere with the computer’s ability to go into and come out of sleep/standby mode. Disabling or changing the screen saver may resolve the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In the Screen saver settings, select an alternate screen saver, or set it to None, then click on OK.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Test sleep mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP EIGHT:</strong> <br />
Check Startup Programs<br />
<strong>NOTE<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Many software components start up automatically with Vista and run in the background. Some of these programs may not be necessary, and can interfere with the sleep/standby mode. For troubleshooting purposes, use the following steps to prevent programs
 from starting up with Windows 7 to see if this is the issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you are having these problems, you can avoid from having to do this completely if you logoff and put the computer to sleep from within the logon screen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) In the white line (Start Search) area, type msconfig and press Enter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Go to step 3.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on All Programs, Administrative Tools, and System Configuration.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click on Continue in the UAC prompt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Under the General tab, dot Selective startup.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> When done with the test, dot Normal startup, to return to the default settings before the test, and click on OK.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Uncheck Load startup items and click on OK and restart the computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will get a notification that you made changes to the Startup programs in the bottom right Notification area. Just ignore it for now. It will go away when you put it back to Normal startup after you finish.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Test sleep mode.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. If unchecking (disabling) Load startup items fixed the sleep problem, then enable one startup item at a time and test to see if the problem occurs again. Continue enabling startup items, until you find the program that is causing the problem. Remove
 or update the problem program.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE:</strong> See Method One or Two here: How to Check and Change the Startup Programs in Vista<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) When done, change the setting back to Normal startup (step 4).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. If unchecking (disabling) Load startup items did not resolve the sleep problem, then set it back to Normal startup (Step 4) and go to the next step below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP NINE:</strong> <br />
Check Scheduled Tasks for Programs<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes a program will have something scheduled to run that will wake the computer up. Try turning them off temporarily to see if it resolves the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Check in the suspected program settings to see if there is a feature that may wake the computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> NOTE:</strong> Sometimes it can be the Auto-Update feature in the program.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Check Task Scheduler for items that are set to Wake-Up the computer to perform it's action.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Expand out the list in the left pane and click on the suspect item's folder. Double click on the task in the middle pane.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Click on the Conditions tab.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Uncheck the Wake the computer to run this task box.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Check Windows Automatic Updates settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP TEN:</strong> <br />
Windows Sidebar Gadget<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes a Windows Sidebar Gadget may cause the computer to not sleep on it's own. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Turn off Windows Sidebar as a test to see if your computer will enter sleep on it's own now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Sometimes, you may need to restart the computer afterwards as well.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If it does, then turn Windows Sidebar back on and turn off each Gadget one by one. Test sleep again after each one until you find the one causing the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP ELEVEN:</strong> <br />
Check Motherboard Jumpers<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A few motherboards have been reported has having jumpers on the board for certain functions (ex: USB device wake-up) that may need to be enabled or disabled. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Pull out or download your motherboard manual, and check for any such jumpers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If you have one that is related (ex: USB device wake-up), then test sleep mode inbetween toggling the jumper on and off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP TWELVE:</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Reset Print Spooler</strong> <br />
<strong><br />
NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This may help if your computer will sleep fine manually, but will not sleep automatically or not go to sleep at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Services, and temporaily Stop the Print Spooler service.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Open the Start Menu and type %WINDIR%\system32\spool\printers in the search line and press enter, then delete all files in this folder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In Services, Start the Print Spooler service. Close Services window.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the issue persists, the installed printer driver may not be compatible or corrupted. Check the printer manufacturer's website to download and install the latest Windows 7/Vista compatible driver for it. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>STEP THIRTEEN:</strong> <br />
Try System Restore<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If sleep/standby mode previously worked, attempt a system restore back to a time when it worked. If the problem has always existed, skip this step. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Save any open files and close all programs, then backup anything that you do not want to lose to be safe..<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. See: How to Do a System Restore in Windows 7 : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</a> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; NOTE:</strong> If System Restore resolves the problem, the problem is probably caused by software that was installed after the restore point date.<br />

<h2>            Unable to disable tapping option under mouse settings</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Need windows trackpad help&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Sorry for spelling errors if you read this you'll understand) So I woke up ready to watch some youtube videos and I turn on my computer and I'm using my mouse but I keep tapping my trackpad and it's acting like it's clicking when I do, but I turned off
 tapping long ago so I go to check the settings and to my surprise the synaptics trackpad is gone and instead there's something called "PS/2 Compatible Mouse" which I guess is substituting for my trackpad or something and I can't turn off tapping, also synaptics
 has seeme be fully deleted from my computer for no reason. this is messing up typing for me big time and my mouse goes everywhere and I accidentally tap and BAM now I'm typing over there... Someone help if you know anything about this.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8.1 automatically upgraded to Windows 10 and I would like to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardbwalker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 automatically upgraded to Windows 10 and I would like to stop the upgrade or rollback.</h2>
                    <p>Back on 13 March 2016 Windows 10 all of a sudden downloaded on my computer. I did not click for it to download, it just did it. Every time it came up to upgrade to Windows 10 I clicked right out of it because I DO NOT WANT IT. Way to many complaints from
 a large number of friends. To me it can't be good because why else would it be free. So I have not hit the button to have it finished and the upgrades done. The page just stays on the screen. I don't want to finish the upgrade so how do I get it all off? Or
 do I need to finish it and then go back to 8.1? But by finishing it, I'm afraid of having all the problems that others have had. So does anyone know my best option at getting rid of it without finishing the complete download and upgrade? I'm not a super computer
 person and some thing I'm not good at. So looking for help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing PIN doesn't really affect the speed of your computer when restarting. There's a possibility that it has a pending Windows Update. It's one of the possible causes and you can have it checked to make sure. Also, have you tried restarting your computer
 in multiple times like twice/thrice and see if it does the same thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update after restarting the computer. It would help us investigate the issue.</p>

<h2>            usb headphone call sound messed up once call connects</h2>
                    <p><span>using USB headphones on MacOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29) on Mac Book Pro 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>skype version 8.12.0.14</span></p>
<p><span>calling version 2017.24.10.66</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>sound preferences dialog shows usb headphones are active and that the mic is picking up my utterances.
</span></p>
<p><span>sound comes properly thru headphones during call setup.
<br />
<br />
once call connects, sound comes only through laptop built-in speakers, is very low volume, and volume control does not alter it.&nbsp; connecting and disconnecting headphones does not alter the situation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, removing the usb headphones and using only the built-in mic &amp; speakers works fine -- but is sub-optimal workaround in non-private working environment.

<p><span>Is there a fix for this or does one need to wait on a skype update?</span></p>

            <p>As far as I know, the latest versions of Movie Maker don't have a published COM interface that would allow them to be controlled via VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone directly involved on the Movie Maker team knows otherwise, please correct me, but I'm pretty sure that Movie Maker hasn't had a COM interface that would allow this for awhile.</p>

                    I am trying to run Task Scheduler and I get the error:<br />
mmc has detected an error in a snap-in and will unload it.<br />
<br />
I believe this has happened after the windows update SP2 install.<br />
<br />
The link is a post on vista forums with screen grabs:<br />
http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/143069-event-viewer-snap-errors.html<br />
<br />
I have tried restarting etc to no avail.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to re-install the MMC &amp; snap-ins?<br />
<br />
Otherwise I guess the next step is a Windows repair from the Vista disk?

Yup, unless you can fix it with system restore(start&gt;Control Panel\System and Maintenance\Backup and Restore Center\, and select 'repair windows using system restore' under tasks on the right hand side).<br />

                    <p>It would be awesome if you could design your own dream house and share it.</p>
<p>This could be done with a simple 3D editor where you can pick a 'background' and place your walls and rooms where you like. The app could even be in VR.</p>
<p>That way you can create an office with an awesome view for productivity, have a neat bunker for your media stuff and a gym for your VR activity apps/games!</p>
<p>Or what about your own VR maze?</p>

            This sounds amazing. I want to know if someone who is blind, using screen reading software could enjoy WMR. Is the audio 3-dimensional so that you can hear a difference between sounds ahead, behind, to the left, above, or below? Can you hear when objects
 are closer or farther away? Are there haptic gloves and shoes to simulate the feeling of interacting with the mixed reality environment?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even calendar entries are not reflecting under Outlook.com. It indicates&nbsp;entries are getting deleted&nbsp;from some device. We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;check from which device entries are getting deleted? You are using multiple devices, where you are managing your calendar. I
 suggest you to create a new entry in <span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://calendar.live.com/</span> through web and check if the entry is getting deleted or not. If the entry is not getting deleted from web then it will confirm that this issue is occurring from
 different device, where you are managing your live.com calendar. You need follow the steps from each device so that we can identify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Netflix not in Windows store</h2>
                    <p>I have tried the following methods and I still CANNOT see the Netflix app in the Windows App store. &nbsp;I also checked, my location is set for the US (which is where I live). &nbsp;Neither of the options below are working, I just bought a new dell laptop and I am
 trying to set it up but the netflix app is not in the store. &nbsp;All of my other apps that I use were found and installed without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the link in Method 2 it takes me to the home screen of the app store, no specific netflix app, nothing else. &nbsp;Just the home screen of the app store.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Since the app is missing from the store, I would recommend you to reset Store cache and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>

<br />
Press Windows + R keys</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Type "wsreset.exe" on run window and press enter.</span></p>
