<h2>            SQL Not a Valid Alias Name Error</h2>
                    <p>I have a query named: QryGrievanceTrackingForm it has the following SQL that I revised from a much longer SQL because I was getting an error: not a valid alias name.&nbsp; I revised the original SQL to correct table names from: [Grievance Tracking System] to:
 tblGrievanceTrackingSystem and from: Members to tblMembers.&nbsp; Before beginning to rename the 2 table in the original query, I&nbsp;got an:&nbsp;Inner Join error when I opened this query in design view.&nbsp;&nbsp;I THINK I corrected the Inner Join error.&nbsp; Now, I'm getting the
 error: not a valid alias name.&nbsp; After clicking OK my insertion goes&nbsp;to the beginning of:&nbsp;tblGrievanceTrackingSystem.*,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read so many different things about this error: use quotation marks;&nbsp;use brackets and;&nbsp;you cannot have a field name that's in table that's the same as the table name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using:&nbsp;tblGrievanceTrackingSystem.*, tblMembers.*, so I can get to query grid and attempt to correct the problems there and because I wanted to retain&nbsp;the time intervals I created.&nbsp; I read: "When you want to include all the fields from a data source,
 you can either list all the fields individually in the SELECT clause, or you can use the asterisk wildcard character (*)."&nbsp; Thanks for the help, Robert.</p>

<h2>            Teams Notification Management</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company recently acquired Microsoft Teams and I am having trouble finding all notification settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to restrict banner notifications to only the name of the Team Member as opposed to the person's name and the beginning of the message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Is there a way to automatically disable banner notifications when our status is "In a Meeting" as out status is linked to our Outlook Calendar? Or, is this a setting that must be managed when the meeting is created in Outlook? Ideally, we would like
 to not have to manually set out notifications to "Do Not Disturb" upon entering a meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Branch_J,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum. Regarding your description, <strong>it is not possible</strong>. We can only manage our own notification setting. You can refer to this article about
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-notifications-in-teams-1cc31834-5fe5-412b-8edb-43fecc78413d#ID0EAABAAA=Desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage notifications in Teams</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, about status, <strong>there is not</strong> any setting for automatically disable banner notifications when our status is "In a Meeting" as out status is linked to our Outlook Calendar or managed when the meeting is created in Outlook. We can only
 manually change the status in Teams. You can refer to this article about <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-status-in-teams-ce36ed14-6bc9-4775-a33e-6629ba4ff78e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change your status in Teams</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I understand your concern and it cannot meet your requirements. Therefore we recommend you that please share your idea via our
<strong>UserVoice service </strong><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a>. Because Microsoft can add some feature and the services based on customers' feedback in the
 future, and your good ideas will be very helpful for them to improve the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your time and cooperation will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi KathleenCook,</p>
<p>That is correct, you cannot download Silverlight into Windows Phone, it is part of the base OS and not an add-on like it is on the Windows PC desktop.</p>
<p>However, if you try to download a file like DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PDF and other acceptable document extensions for Windows Phone, you will have success.</p>
<p>You cannot currently install Windows PC programs onto a Windows Phone device. You'll need to install apps from the

<p>I hope this helps!<br />

            <p>What is it you're trying to "merge"? Are you certain that the different copies of the database have different data? Or are they just backups created when the conflict arose?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that <strong><em>EVERY MULTIUSER DATABASE</em></strong> should - I'd say MUST - be split into a shared "Backend" containing only the tables, and a "Frontend" containing the queries, forms, reports and code; each user should have their own private copy
 of the frontend, linked to the shared backend. This structure will go a very long way toward preventing this kind of problem.</p>

            thanks John, I will split the database tonight. I have only been studying/using Access for 2 months, this is my fault b/c I do not have the database on a sharepoint server &amp; users are currently accessing the DB in a drop box folder. Which leads me to your
 first question, yes, they are truly conflicted copies as 3 users had access to a form with 720 records where all 3 copies of the conflicted db have record changes differing from one another.
<div><br />
<div>I will have to go study how to pursue your advice of "each user should have their own private copy of the frontend".</div>

            <p>Just bear in mind that Access databases do not "play nice" over the Internet: unless you have a Web database, or are using a Sharepoint Server or SQL/Server instance as the backend (not just as a place to store the database!), Access will NOT be suitable.</p>

Your setup will inherently result in conflicts. As I understand you, you have the database as a single file in a DropBox.Com shared folder. This means that each user is downloading a copy of the database and making changes independent of other users. There
 is no way to control&nbsp;which&nbsp;changes to accept in such a scenario.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'm guessing here that none of the users have access to your local LAN to make the front end/back end setup work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rather than Dropbox, I would use something like LogMein.com or Teamviewer to allow users to login, open the front end and therefore share the back end. A better alternative is Citrix or Terminal Server,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or maybe Access is not the proper tool.</div>

            <p>ok... I didn't catch at first that you're using a database file in a dropbox folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is of course NOT a way of communicating data. It's no different than putting three copies of the database on CDs and mailing them to three people! The dropbox does not provide anything that would enable the three copies to be synchronized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that a remote-terminal approach (some of my clients use Citrix/Server), or a web-based system (not a desktop Access database) is necessary for what you're trying to do.</p>

            <p>It's possible to reintegrate the databases, but it can range from a moderate hassle to an absolute nightmare, depending on the structure of the database, the nature of the data, and the number of records involved. Sometimes it's easiest just to manually
 reenter the data. If you want to post some more details of your table structure and what's duplicated we may be able to help, if it's worth the hassle to you.</p>

                    <p>Hi, i'm currently experiencing issue while trying to boot my laptop in safe mode with networking feature.</p>
<p>I'm sure i followed the correct way by holding Shift and select Restart to bring up the Advance Startup function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 is currently at Build 15063.rs2_release.170317-1834.</p>
<p>Anyone has any idea what's going on?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If a local but genuine service centre was of no help, it is very difficult to address your issue remotely. As SIM2:</p>
<ol>
<li>did you use the same SIM all time?</li><li>is that an original Micro-SIM? Or was it cut?</li><li>which network operator do you use, in which country?</li></ol>

                    <p>Hello - I'm looking for a way to switch to the next/previous desktop&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span> involving the WIN key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there is a way -- with a system command, a DLL call, some CMD prompt command, etc., -- or is it possible to remap switch-desktop from {WIN-CTRL-Arrow} to something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use the WIN key or any of its combinations, because I have a full-screen VNC session which swallows that key (I know I can disable it in the VNC client settings, but I need it to be that way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks-</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Task View is a way of expanding desktop real estate without adding an extra monitor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>If you look in the lower left corner of the
<strong>Task bar</strong>, you will see the <strong>Start Menu</strong> icon. </span>
</li><li><span>Just to the right of this icon is
<strong>the Search icon</strong>. The icon to the right of Search is the <strong>
Task View</strong> icon.</span></li><li><span>Clicking on the
<strong>Task View</strong> icon reveals a prompt to <strong>add a desktop</strong>, to create a
<strong>new desktop</strong>, simply click on the <strong>Add a Desktop link</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Upon clicking the
<strong>Add a Desktop</strong> link, your view changes to reveal two desktops, plus a blank desktop with a plus sign on it.</span></li><li><span>The desktop shown on the left is the
<strong>original desktop</strong>. The <strong>middle desktop</strong> is the one that was just created. The
<strong>black desktop</strong> with the plus sign is really just an icon that you can click to create additional desktops. In other words, you aren't limited to only two desktops. Incidentally, it is also possible to create a new desktop by pressing
<strong>WINKEY + Ctrl + D.</strong></span></li><li><span>To view a desktop
<strong>full screen</strong>, just click on it. You can switch desktops at any time by clicking on the
<strong>Task View icon</strong> and then clicking on your desktop of choice. You can also click on the Task View icon and then click the black icon with the plus sign to create a new desktop.</span></li><li><span>You can use
<strong>Alt + Tab</strong> to switch between open windows. This holds true regardless of which desktop a window might be open on. Pressing
<strong>Alt + Tab</strong> gives you a consolidated view of all open windows across all desktops.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

<h3> j. melby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Issue - Nokia Lumia Icon</h2>
                    <p>On our Lumia Icon I downloaded the Upgrade Advisor App and ran it.&nbsp; It said the phone was ready for the upgrade .&nbsp; I clicked all the right boxes and hit next/continue until I got to the screen which gave me the green check mark and said go to settings and
 run phone update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to settings-&gt;phone update and ran it.&nbsp; It came back and said I had the latest version. (8.1 is on the phone now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried powering on/off, uninstalling and rerunning the Upgrade Advisor App, making sure it was just on Wifi, but nothing has seemed to get the phone update app to realize Windows 10 is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have some suggestions to get this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Sara</p>
<p>I&nbsp;looked at the link you suggested used clean boot as suggested then done the following&nbsp;uninstalled the driver for NVidia and installed the latest one from nvida still not working uninstalled office and reinstalled still will not work during these uninstals&nbsp;
 I did a defrag of c drive to move files around so that they would not be installed in the same place on the hdd but have also noticed that when you c properties and then tools clean up etc it takes along time before the window pops in at least 30 seconds or
 more this I have noticed only on the latest build of windows tech&nbsp;,by the way if I disable the nvida graphics card in device manager word works,also if I try to use a older nvida driver version 314.22 when I reboot after installation it wont run the drivers
 for this or my intel card .My system is a asus n56vm laptop with core i7 quad 16 gb ram and a intel hd4000 graphics card and NVidia gt630m card hope this helps you.</p>

<h2>            Encrypt&#47;Password Protect Entire File Folder</h2>
                    I have both work and personal Excel and Word files on computer hard drive as well as external hard drive that I transport between computers.&nbsp; I access some of these files daily and some are accessed less frequently as in two to three times per month.&nbsp;
 Rather than password protecting individual files (which would result in encryption as well - per my understanding) can I password protect/encrypt an entire folder that I want private?

                    I cannot get the cover on the Lumia 640, is this the correct cover, is the phone bigger than the cover?

            If it's a real MS cover with the flip over cover it is designed to replace the original back on the 640. Carefully snap the back of your phone and snap on the new cover. Usually easier start at a corner. There are probably instructions in the cover package.
 Of course save the original back in case you want to go back

    <title>Sharepoint&#47;OneDrive Group via Outlook storage allocation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint&#47;OneDrive Group via Outlook storage allocation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created a group via outlook assigned it some users. I then created a folder inside the group and added some file. I noticed this group shows up under one drive for business under groups section and the files are there. However the storage is NOT taken
 from the One Drive allocation. I also checked sharepoint and even though it currently show 32GB available it doesnt show whats using this or if this is being used by the group,</p>

<p>I then went into sharepoint but cannot see the site there? it should be shown when I search:</p>

<p>sites/staff&nbsp;</p>

<p>staff being the group created. However I can go to &lt;my sharepoint domain&gt;/sites/staff&nbsp;</p>
<p>this then opens up the onedrive view&nbsp;</p>

<p>My question are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) How can I see how much storage is allocated to these groups or sharepoint vs how much is used by the group folder/data</p>
<p>2) How can I see the collection under sharepoint</p>
<p>3) Is this the correct way of creating a collaboration folder</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The group's underlying site collection is hidden from the SPO admin center, but you can see the storage quota and usage via the SPO module for PowerShell or other APIs. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Get-SPOSite tenant.sharepoint.com/.../groupname| ft StorageUsageCurrent,StorageQuota</p>

<p>Hi Urfat,</p>
<p>The [tenant used storage] = [video site collections used storage] + [group site collections used storage] + [site collections in SPO admin site used storage].</p>
<p>But right now we are not able to see these “video site collections” and “group site collections” in the SPO admin site, so we don’t know how much storage has been consumed by these no-visible site collections.</p>
<p>The client side script attached is for getting all used storage for all these three type site collections mentioned above. You can run it and check SPOTenantStroageReport.csv to view the used storage for all site collections.</p>
<p>Here are steps for running the attached script:</p>
<p>1. Set up the SharePoint Online Management Shell Windows PowerShell environment by following
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161372</a>.
<br />
2. Save the attach file to <b>GetSPOTenantStroageReport.txt</b><br />
3. Change the file extension from <b>.txt</b> to <b>.ps1</b>. <br />
4. Start the SharePoint Online PowerShell as administrator and CD to the folder where the script is stored.<br />
5. Run the command “<b>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</b>” and input <b>y</b> for confirmation for allowing the computer run script
<br />
6. Run the script in the follow format <br />
<b>.\GetSPOTenantStroageReport.ps1 -searchCenter https://<i>&lt;contoso&gt;</i>.sharepoint.com/search -admin
<i>&lt;username&gt;</i> -password <i>&lt;password&gt;</i> -adminSiteUrl https://<i>&lt;contoso&gt;</i>-admin.sharepoint.com</b><br />
7. After the script completing, open the generated report <b>SPOTenantStroageReport.csv</b>, and check the sum of all site collections’ used storage.</p>
<p>Regarding “Is this the correct way of creating a collaboration folder”, group files is intended for the group users to share documents inside the group. For more advanced features in sharing files and team collaboration, we would recommend you use the SharePoint
 library and list.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Thank you for the script and replies.</p>
<p>I had one other question regarding the limit of 5k items.</p>
<p>Is this a hard limit? considering Sharepoint 2016 will be out soon (hoping within the next 6 months) - would it be ok to upload say 6k items? i will stay under 10k just curious as to how hard this limit is.</p>

<p>Hi Urfat,</p>
<p>I would like to explain that SharePoint Online uses the Large List Resource Throttling feature. By default, the list view threshold is configured at 5,000 items.</p>
<p>For more information on how to work with large number of items, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-large-lists-and-libraries-in-Office-365-b4038448-ec0e-49b7-b853-679d3d8fb784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage large lists and libraries in Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, we haven't received any official documentations so that we cannot provide the accurate information about SharePoint 2016.</p>
<p>About your last post, could you please send us more details?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I dont believe i need the script any more. I noticed that you can see the usage for the outlook groups under sharepoint storage now. Although it would be nice to see which groups/folders were hogging the storage.</p>
<p>In regards to 5000 items, I guess ill have to create several groups to ensure i stay under 5000 items.</p>
<p>lastly regarding sharepoint 2016, I appreciate the dates arent accurate, however can you confirm the 5000 item limit goes away with 2016.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>This was working last week. Think my PowerPoint may have updated on last boot.</p>
<p>Menus from ribbon (e.g. Insert table) and right click menus just do not appear.</p>
<p>Other Office 2016 application (Outlook, Word etc) work fine.</p>
<p>Tried rebooting. No change.</p>

<p><span>1. When did the issue happen? Did the issue happen before? What did you do before the issue occurred? Please confirm if the issue happened only after updating the PowerPoint 2016 application.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload some screenshots related to the symptoms of the issue you are experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the PowerPoint 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>

<div>Windows 7 doesn't have Office as part of it.&nbsp; Never did and never will.&nbsp; Office is a separate installation and you will need to go back to the original installation media (wherever that was obtained from) and reinstall the Office product

If you had a previous anti-malware product, that had its own firewall, did you uninstall it before installing MSE?<br />
