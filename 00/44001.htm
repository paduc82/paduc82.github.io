<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a file folder- Error message &#34;Could not find this item&#34;</h2>
                    I have an empty folder in one of my drives that I'm trying to delete every time, but every time I try to delete it an error message pops up saying "Could not find this item. This item is no longer located in D:\. Verify this items location and try again."
 Every time I click try again after the message pops up it keeps on happening. I know a while back I created the folder to store information for a downloaded file, but now that I deleted that file from the folder I want to be able to delete the whole folder
 so it doesn't show up in my drive or a utility as an empty folder. It's really annoying when you see an empty folder that you want to delete and you can't seem to delete it. I've tried manually deleting it with nothing in the folder, moving all my other files
 and then doing a clean sweep format of the drive, and using a utility to just get rid of the file, but nothing works. I already checked to make sure there are no protected system files that are hidden in the folder, and there ar

<p>Hi akwok2,</p>
<p>Formatting a drive should delete the folder completely.</p>
<p>a. What is the utility that you used to delete the folder? <br />
b. How did you format the drive?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to delete the folder in Safe Mode and check if you can delete the folder from there.</p>
<p>Refer the link below to boot the computer in Safe Mode:</p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Also as a workaround, you may rename the folder and try to delete it:</p>
<p>Right click on the folder-&gt; Click on “ Rename” and give any other name and delete the folder and check.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Warning</strong><br />
Formatting a volume or a drive will destroy any data on the partition. Be sure to back up any data you want to save before you begin.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Format the drive containing the particular folder that you need to delete.</p>
<p>Refer this link to do the same:</p>
<p><strong>Create and format a hard disk partition<br />

    <title>MP3 Will Not Connect to Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petependley  say:</h3>
<h2>            MP3 Will Not Connect to Computer</h2>
                    <p>I have three each Jensen MP3 players model SMP-2GBL.&nbsp; The three of them connected well with my computers until I installed Windows 10 at which time after installing Windows 10, none of the three Jensen SMP-2GBL would connect to either computer with Windows
 10.&nbsp; Sometime later I bought another different brand MP# which did not have enough volume, but it did connect to my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a whim one day, I tried connecting my one of Jensen MP# players using the USB cable that came with the new MP# player, and it connected; all three of the Jensen MP# players would connect using the new USB cable.&nbsp; I tried other USB cables that I had for
 other items that had the same connector as my Jensen MP# players---some connected and some did not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using the Jensen MP# players for a while in the bliss that they would connect on demand, one of the Jensen MP3 playersn would no longer connect with any of my cords; it may be that that MP# that does not connect was the one that did not show up as
 an external hard drive, but since they are identical in appearance, and I did not mark them to distinguish which isw which; I am not sure which is which except that I know one of the three will not connect and the other three connect, and I think there is
 some type conflict.&nbsp; I refuse to believe that the one that will not connect has become defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some type conflict?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp;One or more of the players showed up in my files as an external drive and some showed up simplay as an audio player, but that was immaterial to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One possible cause of this issue could be related to driver compatibility. As a first troubleshooting step, try to check if your drivers are up-to-date, specifically with USB ports and such. Feel free to check out

    <title>NTFS BSOD &#40;24&#41; Windows 7 32-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barry s. finkel  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTFS BSOD  &#40;24&#41; Windows 7 32-bit</h2>
                    For two weekends in a row around 23:00 on Friday evening my Windows 7 Professional 32-bit system has experienced a BSOD NTFS (24).&nbsp; I have two minidumps and two full dumps.&nbsp; In each case (and in all my previous NTFS 0x.24 BSODs), Arg1=001904FB; that supposedly
 points to a specific source file (0019) and line of code (04Fb).&nbsp; I would like to know EXACTLY what caused these two BSODs.<br />
<br />
I do not need to be told to run a "chkdsk c:" because that utility is run EVERY time I reboot, and I have seldom seen a problem reported.&nbsp; The only thing I see after a BSOD is unused index entries being cleaned, and I assume that this is normal if I/O was in
 progress during the crash.&nbsp; There is nothing in any EventLog except the record produced by the chkdsk utility.<br />
<br />
I have not seen anything on the web that would lead me to determine what happened and to tell me what to do do avoid this outage in the future.&nbsp; I am assuming that the cause(s) of these two recent BSODs is contained in the dumps I have saved.&nbsp; I do not know
 enough about Windiows internals to look at the dumps and determine what may have happened.&nbsp; I have run "!analyze -f -v"
<br />
in WinDbg.

            <p>At one time&nbsp; I was experiencing around three random BSODs per week.&nbsp; And Windows (without asking me) decided to add a "chkldsk c:" at reboot.&nbsp; On 05/09/2014 I replaced one faulty 1G memory stick, and the random BSODs went away.&nbsp; I was still experiencing
 many graphics driver timeouts (that nVIDIA could not correct - even with a new graphics card), so I bought and installed (03/11/2016)&nbsp; a different vendor's graphics card, and those BSODs vanished.&nbsp; My BSODs after that time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>05/21/2016 03:22&nbsp; BSOD&nbsp; NTFS (24)<br />
07/08/2016 23:16&nbsp; BSOD&nbsp; NTFS (24)<br />
07/22/2016 09:35&nbsp; BSOD&nbsp; BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER (FE)<br />
07/29/2016 10:58&nbsp; BSOD&nbsp; SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (7E)<br />
09/19/2016 22:18&nbsp; BSOD: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (7E)<br />
10/28/2016 22:42&nbsp; BSOD: NTFS (24)<br />
11/04/2016 23:22&nbsp; BSOD: NTFS (24)<br />
</p>
<p>I have saved all of the minidumps and full dumps; after a BSOD I immediately rename MEMORY.DMP to MEMORY.yymmdd.hhmm.DMP .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "chkdsk c:" takes about 10 minutes to run, and I have gotten used to it.&nbsp; I have not researched how to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I see a large number of EventLog NTFS EventID 55 entries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,234 from 05/06/2016 10:39 PM&nbsp; to&nbsp; 11/08/2016 03:00 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The file system structure on the disk is corrupt and unusable. Please run the chkdsk utility on the volume Win7-BOOT."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand these entries.&nbsp; There is nothing in the EventLog entry that says that the problem was corrected, and I do not see any errors on the reboot-generated "chkdsk c:".</p>

            <p>Errors like that (24) indicate some (usually minor) corruption in the NT File System (NTFS) and that can happen if the system has a power failure, power interruption, ungraceful shutdown, aborted restart, plug pulling, using the reset button, removing the
 battery (for laptops) or sometimes system crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happens sometimes the "dirty bit" will be set on a volume/drive to signal the Windows startup that something is wrong and if the dirty bit is set on a volume Windows will automatically run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) on the afflicted
 volume to try to fix the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually one pass is all that is needed but it can take a long time - several to many hours depending on the size of the volume, the speed of your system, the amount of data on the volume and what the chkdsk finds to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you learn now how to check the dirty bit on a volume so you know how to do it and know what it looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the command prompt window with Administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c75401d2-f4d1-49d2-8906-2f0e72a5a6b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c75401d2-f4d1-49d2-8906-2f0e72a5a6b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty<br />
<br />
You should check each of your volumes or each of your hard drives (C, D, E, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are any volumes dirty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a volume is dirty the only thing that can clear it is a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your chkdsk is only taking 10 minutes it sounds like it is not a chkdsk with error correction but just a plain chkdsk which reports results but does not actually fix anything.&nbsp; That would not be logged.&nbsp; If a chkdsk with error correction runs on startup
 those results would be in the Event Viewer logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a volume is dirty Windows will automatically try to fix it so you really don't really need to run the chkdsk on every reboot if you don't wan to waste that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it is just a plain "chkdsk&nbsp; c:" that will not fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't know or remember how your system was set up to run the chkdsk on every reboot?&nbsp; Seems like a waste of a good 10 minutes and just a "chkdsk&nbsp; c:" will only report and not actually fix anything but maybe you like it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it might take more than one pass to clear the dirty bit and if the drive is not healthy it may never clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; In those cases there are some workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not configure your system to generate crash dump files so you don't have to do all that renaming after a crash.&nbsp; Crash dumps will then automatically accumulate in the Minidump folder and you can upload the most recent ones analysis as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fbcb1ef-b165-483d-9ebb-b82565ed6a0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fbcb1ef-b165-483d-9ebb-b82565ed6a0d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Window will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".</p>

<p>
</p><p>This shows that the "chkdsk c:" did find and correct errors, so the "/r" flag must have been specified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the reboot after installing the patches released on Patch Tuesday.&nbsp; I have a similar report ("cleaning up 41 unused index ...") after the
 NTFS BSOD 11/04/2016 11:25PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a "fsutil dirty query c:" command, and the output was "Volume - c: is Dirty".</p>
<p>I need to run the same command immediately after the next reboot (and chkdsk c: /r".&nbsp; If I run that command now, then Windows will tell me that it cannot run "/r" now, and will ask me if I want to run it at the next reboot.&nbsp; I have no idea if the "chkdsk
 /r" at reboot fixed the "dirty" problem (and since that time my c-drive file system has become dirty again).&nbsp; But when windows runs the "chkdsk c: /r" at each reboot, it almost never finds a problem, except after a BSOD, when there are unused index entries
 to clean.&nbsp; Maybe I will have to boot into safe mode (which will run the "chkdsk c: /r" and then see if the c-drive is dirty.&nbsp; As for the report after the patch reboot - I do not remember seeing any index entries being cleaned, but I might have missed them,
 as I was also patching a Windows 8.12 laptop in another room and walking back-and-forth between rooms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where to check to see what Windows has scheduled to be run at the next reboot.&nbsp; Windows sometime in the past added the "chkdsk", and I almost never cancel it on reboot, as I want to ensure that my c-drive is not corrupt.&nbsp; If I knew where to
 look, I could verify that the "/r" parameter is set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About dump files - I have the system configured to generate a minidump AND a full dump on a BSOD.&nbsp; The full dump is always named MEMORY.DMP, so the first thing I do after a BSOD reboot is to open an administator CMD window and run a script that renames the
 MEMORY.DMP file to MEMORY.yymmdd.hhmm.DMP so that the next BSOD will not overwrite the last MEMORY.DMP file.</p>

            <p>If the drive is dirty Windows is going to try to fix it by running a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) when Windows starts.&nbsp; It could be that is why chkdsk runs on every reboot.&nbsp; Maybe it is not something you have configured somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the chkdsk is done check the dirty bit again to see if it is clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is clear and becomes dirty again something is marginal or you have had something like a power failure (the usual cause).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that can clear the dirty bit is chkdsk /r.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes no matter how may times you run chkdsk /r the dirty bit will not clear and that could be a sign of a drive getting ready to fail...&nbsp;&nbsp; or it might last a long time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external drive where the dirty bit will not clear (for many years) and have informed Windows not to check it on restart because it takes too long and I don't think it will ever clear the dirty bit but the drive still works and if it someday fails
 it won't bother me too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the dirty bit just will not clear and you want to live with it (keeping your fingers crossed) you can tell Windows not to check the dirty bit on a volume with the following command using the C drive as an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs&nbsp; /x&nbsp; c:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset/undo that action and set things back to normal/default issue this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs&nbsp; /d</p>

            <p>First - I experienced another NTFS BSOD Saturday morning, the third weekend in a row.&nbsp; I have three hard drives in my computer, and Friday night I start a weekly MSE full scan.&nbsp; I probably do not have to scan all of the disks,, as most I rarely change.&nbsp;
 I am now assuming that the MSE full scan is what is causing the NTFS BSOD.&nbsp; I have the minidump and full dump, but I will not post either until I have heard back from you on the analysis of the two dumps I have already submitted..&nbsp; I really want to know what
 is causing these BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the C-drive dirty bit - When I got back to my computer last night, I saw that the BSOD had occurred, and Windows was waiting for me to enter my password.&nbsp; I did a reboot instead of entering the password.&nbsp; During the reboot into safe mode, Windows
 did not do a "chkldsk c: /r", as it had done one at 01:28 after the BSOD occurred .&nbsp; I checked, and the C-drive was NOT dirty..&nbsp; So, if the drive was dirty, the "chkdsk c: /r" fixed the problem.&nbsp; The EventLog output of that run showed that it cleaned up 23
 unused index entries in each of two files (the identity of the two files is cryptic - "index $SII of file 0x9" and "$SDH of file 0x9"), and it cleaned up 23 unused security descriptors.&nbsp; No other problems were found.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then rebooted into regular mode, and
 the C-drive was NOT dirty.&nbsp; I checked a few minutes ago (10:43AM), and the drive was still clean.&nbsp; I will check the state of the C-drive throughout the time i am at my computer.&nbsp; When I next see the "dirty" bit on, I will try to determine what I might have
 been doing.&nbsp; And I will run a plain "chkdsk c:" to see what it finds.&nbsp; I know that running that command on a running system might produce incorrect output; it might say that there is an error when there really is none.&nbsp; But if that command runs cleanly, it
 might tell me more about what is happening with the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am content to let the system run "chkdsk c: /r" at each reboot, and I will check the "dirty" bit before I do any manual reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your analysis of the two minidumps.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Unable to save to mapped drive after Windows 10 version 1709 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 version 1709, I'm now unable to save any document (using Word/Excel 2010/2016) on a mapped network drive.&nbsp; I'm still able to save the file to the local drive, and then copy the file to the same mapped network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that I am getting is "Document not saved" if it is a new file.&nbsp; If it is an existing file that I have updated and am attempting to save back, I'm getting the error "There has been a network or file permission error. The network connection may be
 lost."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the latest Microsoft Office 2016 version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty certain that the issue is related to Windows 10 version 1709 because I have another machine that also runs Microsoft Office 2016 version 1709 but is not yet updated to Windows 10 version 1709 and I'm able to save any Office document on the same
 mapped network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this issue and know what is the fix (preferably, not the workaround that I previously mentioned)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not aware of a permanent solution for this issue yet. I had read a few blogs about the same issue and same errors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reverse the Falls Creator Update if this issue is a major problem to you.&nbsp; Another known workaround is to save the file locally and copy the file.</p>

<p>This is obviously a serious bug with the update. It needs fixing quickly from my point of view as I use virtual Windows machines to write to host drives - which I can no longer do with Excel or Word (doesn't seem to affect Access though).</p>
<p>Annoyed with myself for not taking a snapshot of virtual PC before upgrading!!!</p>
<p>Please get this issue escalated so that it is fixed.</p>
<p>If information is required from me about the problem - just ask.</p>

            Has anyone found a resolution to this issue? &nbsp; We have been getting reports from users of documents not saving in Office 2016 after upgrading to Windows 10, 1709 update. &nbsp;&nbsp; In some cases, the files save with 0 KB and are then corrupt.&nbsp; In other cases,
 if they try to save multiple times, it will succeed. &nbsp;

            I was unable to solve this problem and had to start from scratch and re-install Win 10 but I downloaded the 1709 version to make sure all went well. It was needless to say very painful.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
The option “Remember Each Folder’s View Settings” is not available in Windows 7. It is by design.</span><span><strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is not possible to set Windows Explorer to remember individual folder view settings for folders included in libraries. All libraries and its included folders share the same view.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
We can set a particular type of view for a type of folder example: details view for all folders which contain documents or thumbnail view for all folders which contain picture files</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
If you wish to have the feature reinstated in Windows 7, you may leave your feedback at the<strong><a href="http://mymfe.microsoft.com/Windows%207/Feedback.aspx?formID=195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows 7 Feedback</span></a></strong> site.</span></span></p>

    <title>Create new calendar in Windows 10 calendar app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mb_499  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create new calendar in Windows 10 calendar app</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to create a new calendar in the windows 10 calendar app. For example if I have a 'home' calendar and now want to create a 'work' calendar, how do I do this? Or is this only possible from the online version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, is it possible to share a single event from a given calendar? The only options I can find are to share the whole calendar.</p>

            I did have a look at that page already. However, that seems to explain how to load another calendar, e.g. outlook calendar, google calendar etc. What I'd like to be able to do is to create a new calendar within my existing outlook calendar. This can be
 done in the web version: click the drop-down button next to 'New' and then select calendar. Then you can create a new calendar with a given name and add events too it. However, I can't find an equivalent button in the windows 10 desktop version.<br />

    <title>Valid recovery key not working. Reboot loop with Automatic repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georger100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Valid recovery key not working. Reboot loop with Automatic repair failing.</h2>
                    <p>Hard to search for a problem I'm having. Been using bitlocker on several intel NUC's. One has a TPM chip, the other one doesn't. I use a pin on both systems using windows 10 pro. Been working for a year or so.</p>
<p>A few days ago after working on the TPM NUC PC at night, I noticed my external USB My Book 4tb drive would show the CD, but not the partition on the drive. I powered off. The next AM I got into a reboot loop. The bitlocker password (pin) was accepted, but
 I would go into automatically&nbsp;repair mode, and start over asking for the pin, then recovery code.</p>
<p>I was able to get to a command line by ignoring this drive when recovery mode started due to all my reboots. I was able to turn off bitlocker using manage-bde.</p>
<p>I came up and KB4056887 error 0x80246013&nbsp;and KB890830 error 0x80248007 were ready to retry. They seemed to go on just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to restart bitlocker, without the bitlocker test, and got in the loop again.&nbsp;I decided to restore from a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all fixes were on, I&nbsp;cleared the TPM, and then tried to restart bitlocker again. This time I was unable to get out of the bitlocker loop. But I was in test mode, my drive wasn't encrypted! My password was accepted, but with the reboots I got to the
 recovery key&nbsp;stage again. &nbsp;The key wasn't accepted. I tried both from the blue screen, and the command line. And yes, I'm&nbsp;using the recovery key with dashes, not my password. The ID is verified, at least to the 8 or so characters it's listed on the blue screen.
 Not&nbsp;sure how to&nbsp;see the ID from the the command line.</p>
<p>Anyway I had printed it off, and this was a&nbsp;5 minutes old key. It was correct.&nbsp;I think what's somehow happening is the recovery&nbsp;key process is broke on my PC. Can't&nbsp;imagine if others were having this&nbsp;the boards would be silent.
</p>
<p>So I restored, won't have any logs, and can't use bitlocker on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version 1709</p>
<p>OS&nbsp;Build 16299.192</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;tried the support virtual assistant. Not much help since once a key doesn't work, restore from backup is about all&nbsp;that can be done. But somethings broke somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The non-TPM PC is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t close Task Manager Window</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows Vista 32-bit Home Premium on an HP laptop.</p>
<p>Recently, I started having the following problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press <strong>Ctrl-Alt-Del</strong> , I get a pop-up window showing a list
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the current tasks that are running.&nbsp; This is OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times, a task will "hang" and need to be stopped/removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Now</em></strong>...I am no longer able to close/exit the Task Manager when I am done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a rectangular box, but no <strong>Close</strong> button or <strong>[X]</strong> in the Task Manager
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>box's upper-right corner.&nbsp; I have to do <strong>Restart</strong> to get rid of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            What about natively supporting Android apps through WSL&#39;s concept&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>The whole Windows Subsystem for Linux is a VERY nice feature; Google is still keeping up their chrome os project with the "you can run android apps" thing as main selling point, although third party applications like Nox and Bluestacks already let you do
 that on windows through emulation.</p>
<p>My point is, Android is built on Linux kernel, and WSL ties linux with windows; wouldn't it be a good, already working base to start working on a native support for android apps on windows?</p>
<p>Why hasn't this been done? It would even benefit devices like thesurface pro, other than making android apps testing on desktop more direct (the same way you can set visual studio to target wsl as linux support for testing purposes)</p>

<h3> muscovybitch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall the pre installed McAfee on my Acer computer&#33;</h2>
                    When I attempt to uninstall it by going into the control panel the McAfee window which opens allows me to choose the program I want to uninstall (McAfee, in two components-personal firewall and security centre) and goes to the "removal status" window,
 where above a status bar it says "removal completed", however beside the two components I selected earlier for uninstallation there is a little red x. When I click next all I get is a window saying not all of your McAfee was uninstalled correctly. I tried
 uninstalling it in safe mode only to get the exact same result. As it is the pre installed version, I cannot restore the system to a previous point either. Please help!!!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Althought sold illegally MSDN/TechNet product keys allow for more than one activation<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>========== About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys - Credit Andre Da Costa ==========</p>
<p><br />
"About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p><br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use."</p>

<span>Additional information:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's computer
 hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key, but
 should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of
 Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

I just bought my&nbsp;<span>ASUS TUF GAMING FX504GD yesterday and i've got several issues at the moment.<br />

My touchpad does not work what so ever, except while in BIOS.. Drivers either won't install or don't work.<br />
<br />
Also i'm pretty sure drivers for my graphics aren't working..<br />
<br />
I'm running Win 10 64-bit<br />

<p><span>Hi Stefan,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try these steps one by one to check if that makes any difference:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: If you have connected a mouse to the laptop, please disconnect the mouse and then check if the touchpad or trackpad works because it’s possible
 to configure Windows 10 automatically turn off the touchpad when a mouse is connected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2: You may run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter on the PC and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows key + letter I to open Settings, click on Update and Security, click on Troubleshoot.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions. If you get any prompt to apply fix it, click Apply and proceed further.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>You can try to update the Touchpad and graphics card driver to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Update drivers in Windows 10:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 3: You may also want to check the touchpad settings from the Mouse Properties window in the Control Panel to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 4: Suggest you to keep the PC up to date.</span></p>
<p><span>Update Windows 10:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027667/windows-10-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027667/windows-10-update</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.</span></p>
