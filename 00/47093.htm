<h2>            Using an USB Flash Drive to hold a System Image Backup</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, can I create a System Image Backup onto an USB Flash Drive?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can I then use the Flash Drive to recover everything on my System Disc?</p>

<p>Yes, you certainly can do that. But you can also do better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has deprecated System Image Builder, and recommends that we use third-party software to make image backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can store an image on a USB flash, you are better off with an external hard drive, which has much more space. That will allow you to backup every day, and to make a rotating history of backups. For example, you can instruct your image backup application
 to keep the last 10 backups or the last week of backups. You'll always have a recent backup to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring a backup is easy with a third-party application: The program will show you how to make a recovery environment on a USB flash drive. When you need to restore a backup, just boot your computer from the recovery flash drive and find the backup you
 want to restore on the external hard drive. The whole process will be over and done in minutes.</p>

<h2>            Juice Podcast Tool will not run in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have used Juice for many years to download and manage podcasts.&nbsp; It runs fine in Windows 7.&nbsp; I now have Windows 10 and have a problem.&nbsp; I will launch Juice, but then it loads iTunes.&nbsp; I think the issue is with the podcast protocols itpc and pcast.&nbsp; I can
 set the default program to launch these file extensions to be Juice, but cannot set Juice for these protocols.&nbsp; My only choice is to select iTunes or Find an App in the Windows Store.&nbsp; I do not want to use iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to solve this?&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

    <title>How to change user name in windows 7 professional&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.markovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change user name in windows 7 professional&#63;</h2>
                    I recently installed windows 7 professional and by accident I mistyped my computer and user name when it prompted me to type it in. When I had typed the wrong characters in and hit 'Next', it wouldn't let me go back to change it so I was stuck with an
 unwanted computer/user name. I managed to change the computer name to the desired word, but I still didn't know how to change my user name.<br />
<br />
I went into User Accounts and there was an option to change account name, so I did that.<br />
However, none of my directories changed name, and all the processes in task manager were still running under the same previous user name, which I didn't want it to be.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change the user name of an account so it affects all directories, files, folders, etc. without creating a new account in that name? Or if possible, copy all current account preferences and files to another account with that desired name?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.

            <span>You cannot change a user account by just changing the name. Just changing the name will make a cosmetic change only and not affect the underlying files/folders in the profile.<br />
<br />
1. From an account with administrative privileges, go to Control Panel&gt;User Accounts and create the new Standard user account named the way you want and at least one extra Administrator account. Call the latter "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like.<br />
2. Log into the new Standard user account once so the profile files/folders are created and then log into CompAdmin.<br />
3. Now go to Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced&gt;User Profiles&gt;Settings<br />
4. You will see where you can copy user accounts. Copy the old account to the new one from there. Use the Browse to select your new account (C:\Users\newaccount).<br />
5. Log into the new correctly named account and make sure all your stuff is there and that it works the way you want. When you are satisfied, you can log out and into CompAdmin and delete the old user account from Control Panel&gt;User Accounts.<br />
<br />
If you wish to log into your new, corrected account automatically, do this:<br />
<br />
</span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />
<span><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">General Recommendations for Setting Up User Accounts</span>
</strong><br />
</span><br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should
 be left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this by following the instructions written in the first part of this post.<br />

 or will it be deleted after X days? &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is deleted, how can I save it? &nbsp;(I normally read message via an ipad (which is imap by &nbsp;default. &nbsp; Most messages can be deleted after 3 days, but there are some I want to keep forever - what do I do?)</div>

            The setting <em>Remove from server after n days </em>only applies to POP3 accounts. Since POP3 only downloads messages from the account inbox, no other folder that may be stored on the server is affected.&nbsp;If you're accessing this account via IMAP from
 your iPad, why not use IMAP in Windows Live Mail as well? You'll then be able to see exactly the same contents of your folders everywhere.<br />
<br />
If you have a good reason for using POP3, it's always a good idea to keep the inbox slim. Move any message you want to keep locally to a user-created folder; this can be either under the account or in Storage folders.&nbsp;Folders under an account will be permanently
 deleted along with their contents if you remove the account; a folder under Storage folders will stay there until you remove it.

            I am actually trying to sort this out for my wife. &nbsp; She reads her email, almost exclusively, on her IPAD. &nbsp; She rarely gets on a laptop or desktop to read/manage email. &nbsp; As such, her INBOX gets really big after a few weeks and then she has a lengthy
 management process to sort it out and delete all of the old stuff.
<div><br />
<div>I am trying to find a way for her to read on the IPAD, and either delete from the server DIRECTLY from her IPAD or have the server automatically delete unwanted email after X days so that it stays manageable. &nbsp; OF course, there will be some messages that
 she wants to keep and never delete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How should we best manage this? &nbsp; Or is there just no way around periodic laptop/desktop logging on to clean out the server?</div>

<div>OK, that makes sense, sort of. I'm afraid that any solution is going to
require a bit of discipline on her part. <br /><br />If you did set up the account
in Windows Live mail with instructions to remove messages from the server after
a few days, she would have to be very careful to move any message she might want
to keep out of the inbox. There's no going back once a message has been removed
from the server. <br /></div>
<div>An alternative is for her to delete messages she's not interested in
keeping after reading them on her iPad. This will normally move them to a
<em>Deleted </em>folder, but it depends on the IMAP server what happens. Some
will empty the <em>Deleted</em> folder at regular intervals, while others don't
bother. <br /><br />A third possibility is to have the messages delivered by POP3 to
an account where size doesn't matter, like Outlook or Gmail, then remove them
simultaneously from the original server. It's easy enough then to deal with the
Outlook or Gmail inbox either automatically - using rules - or manually every so
often when the urge presents itself. </div></div></div>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You are typically banned within 4 hours after connecting a jtag box to xbox live.
</p>
<p>The reason is simple: they are used to create 'modded' lobbies for Live games, and play homebrew or pirated software.</p>
<p>Anything that breaches the Microsoft conditions of use is likely to result in penalties, and these will include temporary or permanent bans for more 'serious' offences.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>JTAG's have the ability to run unsigned code and should never be used online on Xbox live.</p>
<p>1. It is against Microsoft's Code of Conduct to modify your console as well as using it online.</p>
<p>2. It is illegal to use hacked/modified Microsoft coding as the Xbox Console Software is copyrighted and is owned my Microsoft.</p>
<p>3. It is also illegal to hack or modify the said software code.</p>
<p>As Microsoft is the Original copyright holder of the name Xbox 360 and the copyright owner of the Software it is illegal to run modified coding without the permission of Microsoft.</p>
<p>From what I understand the JTAG modification is based off original Developer kits given to game developers under permission from Microsoft to develop and test games made by the developer company under agreement from Microsoft.</p>
<p>A game developer(Not the Company) probably a sole individual working within the company has either sold a development kit Xbox 360 to outside sources or has leaked development coding to the general populace.</p>
<p>Basically a JTAG is a Modchip that is soldered into a retail released xbox hardware. The chip is flashed with modified Development kit Bios coding in which allows the user to run unsigned code on the retail console and allows them to do things that most
 of us are not allowed to do by under agreement to Microsoft when we signed up to play on Xbox Live.</p>

            <p>Go to start menu and select run. Type: devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will give you the device manager that will show what graphic card you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus you can use your PC model number to search on internet to find the spec for it and to confirm what you find in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation would be that you check how Windows 10 looks and function in a store or a friends who has it. Many of my clients have ran into huge problem with it. If you decided to go the Windows 10 route. Get Windows 10 Pro with downgrade rights to
 Windows 7.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for responding to my question.&nbsp; I know you are going to shake your head, but I do not know where in the device manager list to look for the graphics card information - - - there's not a line that says graphics and I am way out of my league guessing
 about any of this.&nbsp; Could you possibly be more specific on which item lists the graphics card?&nbsp;

<h2>            Problems with  Skype - 12.1815.210.0.</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded the new version of Skype - 12.1815.210.0. I am using Windows 10 for Home.</p>
<p>However, I am having 2 problems with it.</p>
<p>1. The audio and video are not synced. I hear the persons words before I see them speak. On their side it is fine - my audio and video are synced.</p>
<p>2. I cannot see the message that the person types me. They can see mine, but I cannot see their message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled Skype twice and then reinstalled it, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what I can do to fix this problem?</p>

            Hi Joseph,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />

<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate if you could help me with more information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In which location do you have the video folder?</span></li><li><span>How did you transfer the folder of videos from your phone to computer?</span></li><li><span>Is this issue specific to that folder?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can be caused if the folder is corrupted or not transferred correctly from the source file. As a workaround you can try copying the folder on to the desktop and check if
 you can make changes on it. Try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe mode</strong></a><strong> </strong>and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<p>Hello silvaluis128,</p>
<p>To have text prediction, you need to enable&nbsp;the Tablet pc options.<br />
<br />
To do that, go to Control Panel. Select&nbsp;Programs. In the&nbsp;left hand pane, select&nbsp;Turn windows features on or off. Scroll to&nbsp;Tablet PC Components and to enable them, make sure the box is checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi2.social.s-msft.com%2fForums%2fresources%2fimages%2ftrans.gif%3fcver%3d1864.1119%250d%250a" />Hello All,</div>
</div>
<p><span>I have two Lenovo s205 laptops both running Windows 7 Home Premium x64 and I have a Samsung DVD writer se-s084d (firmware is TS02).</span></p>
<p><span>In one of the laptops the blank DVD+R disks are not recognised (from Sony and Verbatim) but it does recognise CDs and can play DVDs too. The CD/DVD drivers seem to be all installed fine (using Control Panel,
 System, Device Manager). The other laptop works fine and can write to DVD+R and recognises the DVDs the first laptop cannot. Samsung say the device is DVD+R and Windows 7 compatible.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Does anyone have any suggestions on a possible fix? I have looked into the registry; and the upper and lowers filters do not exist at 4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I look forward to hearing from you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chris</span></span><span><span><br />

    <title>HDMI audio goes away - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDMI audio goes away</h2>
                    <p>I've read MANY threads here and tried the instructions, but they do not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(One in particular - going to the so-called "Troubleshooter" after opening Control Panel has me baffled. There is no "Troubleshooter" after opening CP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Anyway, I can get audio out the HDMI if I open the CP , then get to "Sound" (there are a few ways, sigh), then right-click the HDMI audio entry (mine says "Display Audio") and choosing "Test". The bells come out of the correct speakers and then subsequent
 audio - say from iTunes - comes out&nbsp;them as well. Sweet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) However, unplug the HDMI and reconnect it and the audio is gone.&nbsp; Back to step 1) to restore the audio.&nbsp; Not so sweet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?</p>

<p>That makes sense of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><em>You have to manually turn the settings for HDMI sound every time you plug it in.</em></span></span></p>
<p><strong>What happened to plug-and-play?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, note I reported I can restore the HDMI audio indirectly by simply "testing" it - I don't actually manually turn the settings to HDMI.&nbsp; So something is working behind the scenes watching for my "test" and automatically restoring HDMI audio.</p>

<h2>            Cheapest PAL copies of LE and EE&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I was just wondering if anyone knows any sites that are selling relatively cheap PAL copies of the limited and epic editions?</p>
<p>They're ludicrously expensive to buy in-store in Australia so I'd like to grab a copy online if I can.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If your external drive is appearing twice in the navigation pane of the File Explorer, you may try the steps below to remove them. Please note that the method involves changes in the registry editor. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly
 by using it. We suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a system restore point</a></strong> before proceeding further.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win+R</strong> to bring up the Run dialog box, type <strong>regedit</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following Path:<br />
<strong>32-bit: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\DelegateFolders</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>64-bit HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\DelegateFolders</strong></li><li>Right-click on <strong>{F5FB2C77-0E2F-4A16-A381-3E560C68BC83}</strong> and then click the
<strong>Delete</strong> button. When prompted with a confirmation dialog, click the Yes button to delete the key.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the key should remove extra USB drive entry from File Explorer in Windows 10. However, if you still notice the drive entry appearing twice, simply sign out from your account and sign back in. You may also need to restart Explorer. To do so, open
<strong>Task Manager</strong>, click <strong>More details</strong>, find the <strong>
General </strong>tab, under it locate <strong>File/Windows Explorer entry</strong>, right-click on the entry and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<br />
Should you have any other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>

<p>Hello Norbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to fix the error on my PC. Hope this helps in resolving your issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: My OS is <strong>Win 10 Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps performed to resolve the issue are as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check for KB3197954</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Uninstall this update as this is the one that seems to cause the error - Reason: Checking my CBS.log file (located in c:\windows\logs\CBS) showed that Package 7 of KB3197954 was not installed&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Copy the following file on to a notepad and save the file as "Repair.Bat"</p>
<p>
</p><p>net stop wuauserv<br />
cd %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution<br />
ren Download Download.old<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
net stop bits<br />
net start bits<br />
net stop cryptsvc<br />
cd %systemroot%\system32<br />
ren catroot2 catroot2old<br />
net start cryptsvc</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Run this Repair.Bat as Administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Check if the folders and the files have been renamed</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Copy "Catroot2" file folder from c:\windows\system32 from a working PC where the updates have been installed successfully (This folder was missing on my PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Upon completing all the above reboot the PC<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Post Restart, Check for updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. the updates will now download and install successfully&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. I recreated the error message by trying to update the pc by &nbsp;uninstalling KB3200970 and reinstalling the&nbsp;KB3197954.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no Microsoft VP and so do not ask me the logic or the reason why this failed with KB3197954.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to install KB3197954 gave a message that this is not a valid update for this version of Windows.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Scam&#58; received a call from an Indian guy claiming to be from Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I have just received a call from an Indian guy claiming to be from Microsoft.&nbsp; When I questioned him further, asking for a telephone number and web address to check them out, I was told that they could not give me this due to data protection. The call showed
 up on my phone as our of area, so I was suspicious immediately.&nbsp; The guy claimed that each time we went onto the internet/email it was downloading malicious spyware and it needed to be sorted.&nbsp; When I probed further, saying I did not believe him, he said he
 was calling from the UK.&nbsp; He also then changed his tune to say he was calling from the G Tech Support part of Microsoft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I assume this is a scam, but I am really concerned that some people may believe this story!&nbsp; I see you have posted questions on your website regarding this company and it does appear to be a scam, therefore, could you make people aware on your website that
 this is a scam, and place it in a highly visible place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Profiles&#47;gamertag&#47;link with Rockstar</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I contact you because i'm experiencing a problem between my local profiles, my gamertag and my account on rockstar social club.</p>
<p><br />
When i've installed my console i've created my profile in first, and my girlfriend one in second, and, for no reason, it seems that my girlfriend's one became the main account for the gamertag that i'll call "B". I usually play on the "A" profile.</p>
<p><br />
When i go on the Xbox website, i don't see the A profile but the B only, so no way to manage it.</p>
<p><br />
I've linked my Rockstar social club with my email adress for the xbox account and, once again, the B profile appears on the social club page... I've used the pre ordered code to redeem my cash on the game, and it was successfull. I can use it on my A profile,
 but, when i order some accessories on the "ifruit" app, i never receive my order in game, worst, i don't see my progress on my social club page in relation with the game...</p>

<p>Could you help me please ?</p>

<p>Sorry if my english is not perfect, but i'm french.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<h2>            My Windows Media Center won&#39;t download the latest TV programming guide</h2>
                    <p>Using Win 7 Home Prem, SP1 64bit. </p>
<p>Suddenly Windows Media Center won't download the latest TV programming guide.&nbsp; Everything was working fine then all of a sudden it stopped.&nbsp; WMC asks me if I want to download the latest Guide Listing.&nbsp; I click on the Download option then it says "Guide listings
 were successfully downloaded"&nbsp; . yet when I go into my Program Guide for all the different TV channels (all over the air, no cable or satellite) it states "No data available"&nbsp; In other words it offers to download, the guide listing, says that it does &nbsp;yet
 never actually does it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how or why this happened. I tried to download the Guide Listing manually by going into Tasks -&gt; Settings -&gt; TV etc and it does the same thing. It says "Guide Listings were successfully downloaded" but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how to fix?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. my TV tuner and all that works fine. My internet connection is perfect. Am really puzzled.
