    <title>Cannot delete skype contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot delete skype contacts</h2>
                    I have Skype contacts that I cannot delete. When I go to https://outlook.live.com for my MSN account I see contacts that I cannot delete. I see that the ones I cannot delete are all under Skype Contacts. I cannot link them or delete them. I have logged
 into <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_win10">
Skype for Windows 10</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_windesk">Skype for
</a>Mobile&nbsp;but those contacts do not appear. Has anyone ever had that issue? Does anyone have any troubleshooting ideas as to how I can delete the contacts? I am mostly concerned over 1 contact in particular because I do not recognize the name at all.

<h2>            Why has my typing turned red &#38; is underlined&#63;</h2>
                    I was trying to insert a French accent (without success) and my typing has turned red and is underlined.&nbsp; I've tried changing the colour to black, and the underline icon is not checked.&nbsp; I can't get rid of it.

<p>It sounds as though you have toggled on Track Changes during your attempts to type French accents. Go to the Review Tab: in the Changes Group click Accept and choose Accept All Changes. Then in the Tracking Group, click on Track Changes to toggle off the
 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that you probably meant to use Ctrl+', e to create&nbsp;<span>é but instead used</span>&nbsp;Ctrl + Shift + e which is the shortcut for toggling Track Changes.<br />

    <title>3-column Start tile groups vs. 4-column Start tile groups&#63; I&#39;d - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> battlepizza  say:</h3>
<h2>            3-column Start tile groups vs. 4-column Start tile groups&#63; I&#39;d say I want 4-columns&#33; &#58;D</h2>
                    <p>So I am a fan of those fancy picture tiles created by tile genie, and I found that Windows now has&nbsp;<strong>3 column tile groups</strong>&nbsp;instead of the traditional 4. I posted something as an question about how to change it to 4, but MS said go feedback
 in windows feedback instead. I am very concerned about this change. It may not seem big, but as an user of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>picture tiles</strong></span>, I really need those 4 column tile groups to make groups of tiles that
 form a good-looking picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, I really would like to see those 4-column tile groups come back, or at least an option to keep them. It makes the start menu look better and easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know probably people won't care, but comments are appreciated :)</p>
<p><br />
Also, why can't we <strong>arrange tiles freely</strong> as we can in Windows Phone?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Whether you like 2D girls or not, you will agree with me that this is just weird, 4-column tile groups are way better for this purpose, and I think they are easier to use when launching apps with it as well. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fww1.sinaimg.cn%2flarge%2fc7333552gw1esbyphwb7kj21kw11x7jj.jpg" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can stuff a lot more things without having it look too crowded, and it has a symmetricall appearance :P</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Freezing&#47;Hanging 3 minutes after starting on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having sporadic problems with Outlook 2016 freezing or hanging, for the last few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today,&nbsp;Outlook 2016 was consistently Freezing 3 minutes after starting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Each time it froze, it allowed me to restart it, which only took 20-30 seconds to restart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, it froze/hung at the 3 minute mark, seven times in a row.&nbsp; (i used a stop watch to time it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know what I should try to resolve this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I am wondering if you make a free application can you upload it the market place for free? Or do you have to pay for it either way?<br />

            chobo2, I moved your question to the MarketPlace forum because I felt it was more appropriate there.&nbsp; I do not know the "absolute"&nbsp;answer to your question but I'm guessing that someone from the MarketPlace team will answer your query (I hope).<br />
<br />
That said, click on this link (<a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://developer.windowsphone.com/</a>) to read the overview and&nbsp; developer distribution.&nbsp; I believe you will find your answer there.

To answer your question the process is the same regardless of the price of the application.&nbsp; Free and paid applications must go through the same certification process with the same cost structure.&nbsp; It makes sense given that regardless of whether or not an application
 is sold or given away (a) the author can still be making money off of it and (2) the same effort is consumed on certifying it.
<br />
<br />
For 99 USD registration you are able to submit up to 5 applications for certification.&nbsp; Note that if your application fails certification that counts towards one of your 5 attempts. For each application over the 5th application you must pay 99 USD to have it
 certified.&nbsp; If you choose to submit your application to additional markets then there is an additional 9.99 USD to get the application recertified for that market.&nbsp; This assums that you have a single install that will work for all of those marketplaces.&nbsp; IF
 you make a different version of your application for each marketplace (ex: one for English and another for 日本語) then those are two seperate certification attempts.
<br />
<br />
Each year you will need to renew your registration for the Marketplace.&nbsp; If you do not remove your registration then your applications would be removed from the Marketplace.

<h2>            Office 365 and iPhone Calendar Sync Issues</h2>
                    My office recently upgraded to Office 365 hosted exchange.&nbsp; My boss is having issues with a calendar syncing with his iPhone (he asked me to troubleshoot it).&nbsp; His normal Outlook 2013 personal calendar syncs fine, but there is a shared calendar that will
 not sync at all.&nbsp; The shared calendar shows up just fine on his desktop in Outlook 2013.&nbsp; It syncs on my iPhone no problem, but I can't get it to show up on his.&nbsp; I've set all his settings in his iphone exactly like mine, but I cannot get it to sync.

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the typo, it’s the shared calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see a shared calendar in iPhone, you need to use OWA for iPhone app. And before accessing the shared calendar in OWA for iPhone app, you need to add the shared calendar in OWA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add a shared calendar in OWA, please refer to:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sharing-your-calendar-in-Outlook-Web-App-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5#__toc375064923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sharing-your-calendar-in-Outlook-Web-App-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5#__toc375064923</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About OWA for iPhone, please refer to:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2013/07/16/owa-for-iphone-and-owa-for-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/2013/07/16/owa-for-iphone-and-owa-for-ipad/</a></p>

<h2>            Messages taking ages to send</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Skype for a number of years with no issues until recently my apple mac informed me that I had to upgrade to the latest version of Skype in order to carry on using it, having no choice I did so and as always seems to be the way when one has to
 update or upgrade...it created problems... my written/typed messages to contact now seem to take ages to send and be in a long state of "sending" as opposed to actually arriving. It used to be so simple now I seem unable to type messages to contact without
 it taking an age to go from "sending" to being sent. Why on earth would that be?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>To isolate the case, I am requesting for the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Skype version installed on your device.</li><li>The Mac OS version running on your computer.</li><li>Is the issue happening with a specific contact or for multiple contacts?</li><li>Is your status set to "Online/Active"?</li></ul>
<p>

            Ah hi there Jomel, wonderful to hear from you, I feared I would not hear back from someone, I am very fearful with regards to technological matters. So I was able to find out the answers to your questions! My Skype is 8.9.0.1 &nbsp; My Mac OSX 10.9.5 , my status
 does appear to be "on" with the green light seemingly showing that I am online or "active" as it says on Skype. This messaging problem seems to be happening with everyone... "sending" and then a little squiggly line next to it suggesting that the message is
 trying to arrive but isn't. It's very frustrating because I use Skype a lot for my work and it is disrupting the effectiveness of my work quite considerably. I do hope you can help me...?

            ah hello, delighted to report that this has not worked. Still the same problem. However perhaps I am not completely uninstalling Skype from the mac as that seems impossible, 1 hour spent watching youtube videos on how to do it, of course it wouldn't be
 straight forward. Is there any other, easier way this can be resolved? Or can you tell me how to uninstall Skype from Mac? Why do you have to update things....it was all working fine before, in my eyes all progress seems to do is complicate things and make
 them go wrong. Please help&nbsp;

<p>Uninstalling an application on a Mac&nbsp;can be done by&nbsp;opening&nbsp;the Finder window, click
<strong>Applications </strong>in the sidebar, control-click the&nbsp;Skype icon, and select
<strong>Move to Trash </strong>or drag the Skype icon to the trash. Once the Skype application&nbsp;has been&nbsp;moved to trash, please delete Skype from the trash immediately.</p>

    <title>Increase max length on formula in Word. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> welcome_oblivion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increase max length on formula in Word.</h2>
                    <p>I am needing to place a formula in a table in Word, however, the formula is longer then 255 characters and Word won't allow a formula longer that. The formula cannot be shortened to make it fit it is already as small as it can be nor is it an option to insert
 an excel spread sheet into the document because apart from interacting with the spread sheet being a nightmare it also runs to slowly and crashed Word. Is there a way to make it so Word can have longer formulas?</p>

<h2>            Can not update Office Pro Plus 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Office Professional Plus 2016 on updated Windows 10. I noticed the excel does not contain the IFS() function and I learned that I need to update my office. However in my "File/Account/Product Information" menu there is no visible "Update Now" button.
 Is there another way to update my Office?</p>

<h2>            Cannot edit document embedded in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a notebook saved on my Office 365 account.&nbsp; There are documents embedded in the notebook that my colleagues need to update.&nbsp; When they double-click the attachment, they are prompted to download the document.&nbsp; They can edit the document, but then they
 have to add the document back into the notebook.&nbsp; Is there a way for my colleagues to open the attachment, edit it, and save it without them having to download a local copy, update it, and then add it back into the notebook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it is a corporate asset and I cannot perform an automated repair. In addition, I did further testing and learned this issue does not happen when a notebook is hosted in a SharePoint 2013 team site library. This leads me to believe since Office
 365 is working on a cloud server, the ability to open and update an embedded document within a OneNote notebook is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 15.26.1 not remembering window size</h2>
                    I figured I would start a clean post of this problem. &nbsp;I had been ongoing for the entire outlook 15.xx versions.<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;With every update the window size issue has remained a problem. &nbsp;Basically
 if you "red x" out of outlook from a preset window size it will open back to that size sporadically. &nbsp;For no reason you will open it again and it will be default small screen. &nbsp;The&nbsp;only way to correct&nbsp;this is to resize the window, completely quit outlook,
 reopen and the window size will be remembered. &nbsp;This may stay remembered for a couple of times then it will default back to&nbsp;the small window size and you have to do it all again. &nbsp;This &nbsp;process defeats the purpose of having it open in the background to check
 mail constantly. &nbsp;At least Mac Mail can remember the window size. &nbsp;I was running El Capitan and this happened&nbsp;frequently and now an running Sierra and it is happening frequently again. &nbsp; I do have file vault activated and not sure if this is a bug that has
 not been discovered yet. &nbsp;Please help as this is very annoying.</span></span>

    <title>Insider Updates - Cannot run game anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poploco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider Updates - Cannot run game anymore</h2>
                    <p>It's the 3rd or so insider update that I have to roll back. &nbsp;Tonight insider preview update Build 15019.rs_prerelease.170121-1513 got installed on my machine... a good half hour of updates +.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, like the last 3 times, I cannot run my favorite game, Rift. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game also has a game loader for their games, which loads first then you pick the game you want to play and it loads that game specifically, in this case "Rift".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to start the .exe file by using the shortcut for the loader "Glyph". The little window spin circle appears next to my arrow as if it is going to load but nothing happen. I check the task manager, it's not showing anywhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to start the game with the rift.exe but nothing happens other than the spin circle appearing for a few seconds next to the arrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game. It has no effect. Other games can play just fine, but this update (for what ever the reason) does not like Trion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past all I've done is a roll back and everything works fine.... &nbsp;So I know the issue is the Windows Inside Preview update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help with suggestions on what might fix this, instead of doing a roll back to the previous windows update? &nbsp; It is starting to be quite annoying.</p>

            As this is a 3rd party program and Insiders/Preview is a beta build with new builds coming out often (1 or 2 weeks between builds) and makers of 3rd party software haven't had time to update drivers, suggest that you do a dual boot with the Public release
 where you can play the game, and use the insider for testing and reporting any issues using the forum/Feedback Hub.

            I'll probably just rollback for now I guess... and in the next week or so I will just reinstall Windows 10 since it seems to be the only way to opt out of the insider program... Don't feel like dual booting.

    <title>SharePoint Online share people picker does not locate B2B user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online share people picker does not locate B2B user</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered that when sharing a site with a B2B user who is an approved/accepted invitation user in Azure AD, the people picker does not locate the B2B user. However, if you type in their full email address only (not name), it does find the user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user is approved, the cache stores the value so I can share documents in the future (but not always). However should the B2B user not be initially invited to the SharePoint site and would like to share a document, they do not appear in the people
 picker. I have to type the full email address again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For our users, they may not know their email address so the people picker is very handy when typing in just their name. Our settings for sharing does allow external users, so it seems the issue surrounds the people picker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this issue or have a solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<ul>
<li>Facebook, Skype, LinkedIn, or Google contacts are synced to your Microsoft account</li><li>Contact first and last names between the services match</li></ul>
<p>I tested with a contact who only appears in LinkedIn and there was no "Links" option. Then I created a new contact manually with the same first and last name and saw the "Links" option appear in the menu bar. I was able to link the two contacts together
 and see both sets of information at once.</p>

<h2>            Purchased MS-Project 2019.  Install Problems setup.exe does not run</h2>
                    <p>All I want is the software to install.&nbsp; I've purchased Project 2016 in the past and the setup.exe does the install and all is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, now that I'm trying to install MS-Project 2019 the setup.exe does nothing.&nbsp; I've read the articles for setting up the "config.xml" file and a lot of it makes no sense or confuses me since all it talks about is Office 365 rarely does anything say
 Project 2019 Standard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are generally not volume license users for regular desktop software but this is a volume license since that is now the way it is distributed.&nbsp; MS articles talk about 3 different install types (why?) and that they are not compatible with each other in
 Office 365.&nbsp; I don't use 365 but we have Office 2016.&nbsp; I need to get this program installed yesterday.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If you did not buy Office 365 but Project 2019 Standard instead you probably need to install it the way you wrote above (with the config.xml).
<br />The Product ID for non volume license Project is "ProjectStd2019Retail"
<br />This tool is a little help:
<br /><a href="https://config.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://config.office.com/</a>
<br />You need to create the config file and download it.
<br />Afterwards you open command line (cmd) and drag &amp; drop setup.exe into cmd type "/download" and drag &amp; drop the config.xml file into cmd. Then press enter.
<br />Repeat those steps with /configure instead of /download to install.
<br />If you still have problems with the config file or the cmd part I can create you one tomorrow and give you a batch file (.bat) which you can execute to start the installation.

            What kind of Office 365 version is installed?
<br />
<br />Does it say Office needs to be uninstalled?
<br />If not see if your xml file contains the following line:
<br /> &lt;RemoveMSI All="True" /&gt;
<br />if yes, change it to  &lt;RemoveMSI All="False" /&gt;
<br />
<br />If it says Office needs to be uninstalled make sure you selected the same Update Channel for Project.
<br />The following article gives you more information about the update channel:

            Is this an MSI Installer version? Because I fear that those versions are not compatible anymore with the Click-to-Run technology which is used for Project 2019.
<br />
<br />In this article the supported scenarios for different Office and Project / Visio versions are described:

<br />The update channel specifies in which interval you get updates for Office. Here it is explained in detail what the different update channels mean:

<h2>            No Desktop and no Start Manager Build 14931</h2>
                    <p>Hello chiefs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I restarted my PC, for it asked me that made some updates and took a while setting the updates, I got stuck in the Login process.</p>
<p>I've hit CTRL+ALT+DEL chose for Task Manager and the display got black with nothing else but Task Manager window.<br />
I've rebooted in Safe Mode and things got back again, just in Safe Mode. When I turn back in Normal Boot -&gt; Blank Screen after inhibit the long waiting Login Process.<br />
</p>
<p>I can't System Recovery cause it was turned Off. I can't Reset PC cause I have a lot of Apps with configurations in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to recover my Desktop functionality?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Probably won't get any answers on build 14931 at this stage since most Insiders have not been able to download build 14931 at this time. Saying this you might have to wait a couple of days to get suggestions once insiders are able to install build 14931.

            This build crashed my computer and I could never get in again. The login screen never came up again. Tried safe mode but that did not help. Ended up having to rebuild my computer. None of the repair utilities worked or even going back to factory or even
 upgrade because this build was not recognized as a windows 10 build!!! I am through with the windows improvement program...enough is enough of bad builds

            <p>A lot of people have been complaining and some are right that there are some things that have not been fixed but here I am using 14931 and have had none of the problems.</p>
<p>They are not bad builds.&nbsp; There are a lot if drivers and things that are different because there are a lot of different computers.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot working here in the Insider Program.&nbsp; I have had to do some Clean installs.</p>
<p>I also have 3 computers that are not in the program and have had few problems.&nbsp; Most are my mistakes not Windows mistakes.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I am a Software Programmer and a QA Engineer and have seen more than enough computer issues.</p>
<p>It was quite unexpected that everything was working fine until this build was deployed to my machine. By the very next login after reboot, the login screen never came up again. Thusly I could not get back into my laptop. Safe mode was of no help. Makes me
 wonder if any QA gets done at all on these builds before sending to innocent users..</p>
<p>I have not been thrilled with changes made in Windows 10 at all.</p>

            <p>Found no solution yet.</p>
<p>Also, the <strong>Settings App</strong> is no longer available/working.</p>
<p>If I go to Task Manager -&gt; File -&gt; Run new task -&gt;Type:[<strong><em>ms-settings:windowsupdate</em></strong>] -&gt; hit Enter</p>
<p>I get an error of "The wait operation timed out."<br />
I ain't got no clue, I tried searching thru the processes for a stalled app or something, I also checked services for
<strong>RunOnce</strong>, no avail.<br />
What I believe is that The "<em>We're getting things ready</em>" process/app is to be fault, because after the update and "login" the Metro color has been changed twice in the same session, but the process of "<em>We're getting things done for you</em>" never
 appeared. You can see you settled Metro color if you hit <strong>CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong>, is the background color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still waiting for a solution.</p>

            <p>One of my notebooks installed ok, with the only problem of 2 thumbnails (Solitaire Collections) being blank. This was fixed after clicking on them</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, one of my PC's keeps on complaining that it cannot find if there is enough disk space for the install and aborts. This has happened three times so far. Did all the usual checks and tried troubleshooter, with no result. There is 180 GB of available
 disk space</p>

            <p>As in 09:14?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just use a Format property of</p>
<p>
</p><p>"mm\:yy"</p>
<p>
</p><p>either as a field format in the table, or (better) as the Format property of the form or report textbox in which you're displaying the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For&nbsp;<em>entering</em> the data, you'll need to use an actual date - and a date must be a full date, to the day, September 2014 isn't a date; it's 30 dates plus a whole bunch of times, accurate to the second. If it's important to be able to enter the date
 in that form, you'll either need some VBA code or switch from a Date field to Text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the Format of a field does not affect how the data is stored, just how it's displayed. A Date/Time field is actually stored as a Double number, a count of days and fractions of a day (times) since midnight, December 30, 1899. You can display this
 number using any of a vast array of different formats, but it's just a number underneath.</p>

            <p>Your question was vague, but John partially answered you. You can't do what you want without some trickery. As John said you HAVE to enter a valid date value to use a Date/Time field. You can DISPLAY that value using just month and year, but the stored value
 had to be a valid date,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to query a table for a data range by only entering the month and year. Then I would use an unbound form with 6 controls on it. One to select the Start Month, another the year, the next to select the End month and then the year&nbsp; and two hidden
 controls to translate that to valid dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would use comboboxes to select the months and years. Sote the Month number in the months combos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then set the hidden controls to :</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DateSerial([cboYear],[cboMonth],1)&nbsp; for Start date and </p>
<p>=DateSerial([cboYear],[cboMonth]+1,0) for End Date</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in your query set the criteria to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BETWEEN Forms!foormname,txtStart AND Forms!formname!txtEnd</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>Well, in my defense, I tried to answer the question&nbsp;<em>that you posted</em>. Unfortunately that was not the question to which you wanted an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that my friend Scott has come to the rescue as he so often does. Thanks, Scott.</p>

            <p>First, you should use syntax that conforms to the MS standard, including Access.&nbsp; Colon (:) is used to separate time parts - hours, minutes and seconds and apostrophe (') is not meaningful in a date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, most dates require a four digit year.&nbsp; Dec 12 means the 12th of December in the current year, which will not work at all for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;OTOH, Dec 2012 means the 1st of December in the year 2012, which will then work using&nbsp; &nbsp;Between&nbsp;StartDate AND Serial(Year(EndDate),
 Month(EndDate)+1,0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you really want to use text strings instead of real dates, then there are only a couple of choices, one is what Scott posted and another, though NOT recommended, &nbsp;is to use the strict data entry rule of entering
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; YY-MM&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; 12-09</p>
<p>including the "date" field&nbsp;in the tables you want to search.&nbsp; This way, you can search for dates in the 21st century using&nbsp; Between&nbsp;StartDate And EndDate</p>

{vaishnavtambade}.</a> For WhatsApp pics, try checking if there is an update available for the app. If there is no update available, I would suggest to take a look at the following thread related to a similar issue:
