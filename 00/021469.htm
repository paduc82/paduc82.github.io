<h2>            Syncing using Bluetooth</h2>
                    
<p>Running XP with Activsync 4.5 and WM5 and a Trendnet bluetooth adapter was able to sync my Treo 700WX using Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Got a Logitech Bluetooth desktop combo for Christmas and found it didn't like the Trendnet dongle and the Treo didn't like the Logitech one.</p>
<p>so it's either the Keyboard/mouse or the Treo but not both.</p>
<p>I have also found the comm ports available in Activsync don't match what is available on the Treo.</p>
<p>Has anyone used mulitpilr devices on one dongle?</p>

<p>Not sure if you can have multiple bluetooth connection with your dongle. The latest bletooth product should have that problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check your manufacturer website if you have the latest drivers instaaled for your dongle</p>

    <title>Calling via bluetooth connectivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhinavkartik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calling via bluetooth connectivity</h2>
                    6 months before, I use Android&nbsp; and win 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;,with It I use to connect my phone via Bluetooth of laptop&nbsp;and then I don't have to leave my laptop ..all calls , music, contacts &nbsp;all synced.. I can even call ...without picking up&nbsp;my phone...NOW I have lumia
 640xl( just because of Cortana)&nbsp;and win 10 , I cant find that feature anywhere....&nbsp;it was a awesome feature, and I'm&nbsp;a busy fellow ..most of the times don't have time to pick up&nbsp;calls, I want to, but can't, u see "WORK"&nbsp;...with that feature I can do things
 simultaneously....life "was" great..<br />
So that is my question&nbsp;...<strong>HOW TO&nbsp;CONNECT MY LUMIA WITH THE&nbsp;LAPTOP IN THE SAME MANNER</strong>....and if this is the wrong place to ask where should I put up this ??? and&nbsp;I WONT BE surprised if&nbsp;this feature is&nbsp;not available&nbsp;in MS mobiles , then I'll
 put it in the suggestion section&nbsp;,also where should I do that? ..coz really&nbsp;few days before I got an update by that "<strong>DEVICE HUB</strong>" changes to "<strong>GADGET</strong>" and nothing ever happens in it....<strong>SO PLEASE MICROSOFT DO SOMETHING
 CONSTRUCTIVE</strong>....make your stores feasible... coz they are sooooo bad. I've switched my platform a from
<strong>Android to M.S</strong>&nbsp; and so many other have, and honestly I feel strangled and stuck&nbsp;using lumia at times ..Please look into my suggestion, question, whatever.THX

AbhinavKartik</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Did you install the official Windows 10 Mobile update or register to the Windows Insider Program? While your phone is connected to the laptop, did you use a specific application that allows you to do
 hands free calls?&nbsp;BTW, you may send your&nbsp;feedback via the Windows&nbsp;Feedback app.&nbsp;For your Store concern, app/game availability will depend on its developer. We'd recommend contacting them directly for more information. We look forward to you reply. &nbsp;

            <p>You were able to do this on the laptop with your Android and Windows phone because of the Bluetooth stack hardware that is on the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the Bluetooth on the laptop off the shelf or did you add a USB Bluetooth connecting device? If so, what was the device?&nbsp;&nbsp; This would require the same Bluetooth laptop features provided by a hands free Bluetooth radio in a vehicle. This is not common
 or standard on most laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What Model was the laptop and operating system?</p>
<p>Is this the same laptop you are using now?&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the laptop been updated since then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the laptop is still all the same and nothing has changed with it:</p>
<p>Remove the laptop in gadgets.&nbsp; Unpair the laptop and phone.&nbsp;. &nbsp;Power cycle the phone and laptop.&nbsp; Open the BT page on the phone with BT turned on.&nbsp; On the laptop go to printers and devices and 'add a device' to pair the laptop and phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After connection You never have to do anything with the gadgets. </p>
<p>On the BT page on the phone, under the laptop it will say what BT features the phone and laptop are using, like music, voice, phone book .&nbsp; What features are shown on the phone BT connection on the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want to help you with this but I can not do it unless you answer all the questions. Answer all or I can't help any more.</p>

            <p>So, the problem is getting the drivers installed for windows 10 on your laptop.</p>
<p>I suggest you go to the dell page for your laptop. This page can automatically detect driver updates you need for Windows 10. Review the page and do what you think is best and what you feel comfortable with.</p>

                    <p>On Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10.&nbsp; Movie rentals from the Microsoft store show as pending download forever, never downloading.&nbsp; I have paid for three movie rentals so far with none of them downloading.&nbsp; The last one was 6-7 months ago.&nbsp; I was hoping the
 issue was resolved now that I've upgraded the OS from 8 to 10.&nbsp; Everything I've found online as for troubleshooting doesn't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when I click the Windows icon, then Movies &amp; TV, that window appears, then disappears after three seconds.&nbsp; This happens whether or not&nbsp;I click on that window before it disappears.</p>

            I have this exact same issue with a Surface Pro 3 Windows 10 if anybody has a fix for it. I bought some movies planning on downloading them and watching them offline on a flight but the movies still say pending and the Movies and TV app closes after a
 few seconds every time I try to open it. I can sometimes cancel the download (if the app does not close immediately) and stream the movies online but it will not allow me to download the movies. I have tried downloading them in SD and HD. &nbsp;

 simpler way to clear just the headings instead of having to do it one by one or clear all of the fomatting in which I would have to manually restore the other types of formatting (ie spacing font color)?

In your browser select options and go through the list.

            You apply themes more often ?<br />
If yes, then I suggest you to copy themes to phone memory and apply from the phone memory.

            If you don't have any files like music, files etc in phone memory and if you have very less phone memory like only 1MB!, then you need to restore your phone to factory default all or reinstall phone software using Nokia Suite.<br />
<br />
Applying more themes frequently from especially from Memory Card causes theme files to be copied to phone memory(hidden). Sometimes it happens that old themes won't be replaced by new applied themes and internal memory fills up, but when you apply themes which
 are in phone memory, that doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
Don't copy all themes to phone memory but copy only some which you need.<br />

    <title>Open a macro in excel on startup from the RunApp function in access. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy iles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open a macro in excel on startup from the RunApp function in access.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a MS Access database which uses the RunApp function in a macro to open an excel document.&nbsp; All good so far.&nbsp; The problem is that when the excel document&nbsp;opens I need it to&nbsp;auto run&nbsp;any one of a variety of macros&nbsp;dependant upon the control I've used
 in access to open it.&nbsp; In addition, if I open the excel document direct in the normal way (i.e. double clicking on the excel icon) I need none of the macros to run without having to hold down the shift key when opening.&nbsp; I was thinking adding the excel macro
 name to the end of the address line in the access RunApp&nbsp;line but can't seem&nbsp;to get&nbsp;it to work right.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>I Love This VBA for Multiple .xlsx Files Converted to .csv Files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I Love This VBA for Multiple .xlsx Files Converted to .csv Files Except...</h2>
                    Hi...My name is Robert, and I am a schoolteacher who is taking a dip in the Excel VBA pool. I consider myself to be very knowledgeable of using spreadsheet formulas, but I am definitely an amateur when it comes to coding. I am trying to control my frustration
 of not being able to find the correct code or being capable of modifying code to satisfy my needs. My goal is to find a macro that will automate the process of converting multiple .xlsx files(exactly 20 files) to .csv files with the CSV files having the same
 exact names as their corresponding XLSX files. Furthermore, I want new CSV files to overwrite existing CSV files without having to deal with the following annoying message: "A file named _____ already exists in this location. Do you want to replace it?". All
 of the XLSX files and CSV files are contained in the same folder. I provided you with the closest script I found on the Internet below this message. Although I modified it to allow for the selection of multiple files, the macro only returns one CSV file out
 of the 20 XLSX files that are located in the folder. I have a feeling the problem has something to do with the part of the script I typed in red. I tried changing .SelectedItems(1) to .SelectedItems(20), but the macro selects the 20th position of the file
 dialogue window rather than selecting all 20 Excel .xlsx files. Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>I have a simple form library that has different content types that are all forms. &nbsp;I have configure the submit of these infopath forms to go back to my SharePoint Form Library. &nbsp;However when I submit, it gives me this error.</p>

An error occurred while the form was being submitted.<br />
The form cannot be submitted to the following location: ------.xml<br />
The site may be offline, read-only, or otherwise unavailable.<br />
Access Denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first add the web site to your trusted sites list, browse to the web site, and select the option to login automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added the site to the trusted sites list and selected login automatically when I sign into SharePoint. &nbsp;Strange this is, if I submit is again it will work. &nbsp;It just always gives me this error the first time I submit. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. I can help you activate Office 2010.
</p>
<p>I would like to know some information. Can you tell me from where did you acquire the license for Office 2010 Standard?</p>
<p>If the product was purchased through Volume License then this issue occurs if the KMS key is corrupted.</p>
<p>You may perform the steps mentioned in the following link to activate Office 2010.</p>

    <title>Excel Spreadsheet problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frza45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Spreadsheet problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello! So I'm having a excel issue. It's suppose to automatically fill in data, but I am getting errors when I try to do the thing where you drag it down the rows you want to duplicate/populate. It seems like its changing the math I want done in the cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I want in the whole "payment" section:&nbsp;=PMT(B2/B4,B3*B4,-B1)</p>
<p>but when I drag it to apply it to more than 1 cell it advances the numbers(changes it from -B1 to B3):&nbsp;=PMT(B4/B6,B5*B6,-B3) (I guess it's changing all the cell ID's as well)- then it spits out a #VALUE! or #DIV/0! error. In the picture I provided I had
 to manually put in the "$933.40" payment for those first 3 rows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it should be this: =PMT(B2/B4,B3*B4,-B1) for that whole row but it's changing the formula when I drag it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2883f7c-811d-4982-8585-363cbbaea783?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2883f7c-811d-4982-8585-363cbbaea783?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi  frza45
<br />
<br />You just need to change the cell reference type in the original formula then drag down
<br />
<br />In any part of that formula where you don't want a cell reference to change, make this change for example if you don't want B3 to change as you drag down, change B3 to $B$3 and so on in your formula       
        </p>

<p>Ok, great! That worked! But now I need to calculate interest, total interest and balance off the data. I am new to excel so if you don't want to tell me maybe you could show me a tutorial that would be good for this? I'm confused, the interest rate and the
 balance should be going down. Basically, how do I get something like the total interest rate to add the previous and current interest rates so I get the running total? Then have it all display automatically when I drag the column?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

i have a nokia 7610 and it not working the way it has always worked.<br />
the problem is that most of the time the phone loses the service network some times three times in a day for about 2 to 3 hours,but sometimes when i open it it works for some time but less than an hour.<br />
I have tried changing the Sim card (service provider) but no change.<br />
does any one has any idea as to why it's doing this and what can be the solution ( where can i touch?)

            Your phones radio unit is not working correctly. Take it to a Nokia Dealer where they can test it and perhaps fix or replace it.

<h2>            Lumia 635 issues, date&#47;time, screen, rebooting</h2>
                    <p>So, I have the Lumia 635 and have had it for a few months now and today it rebooted itself. I didn't think anything of it because it does this sometimes, but this time, when it started up again, there were some issues. The date and time are wrong, the phone
 is set to airplane mode, and the screen won't respond. Also, when the screen times out and shuts off, the phone itself shuts off. If I let it stay off long nough, it will turn itself back on, but everything is still wrong. I'm not sure what to do. Is there
 a way to solve this problem by myself or should I take it somewhere? Or should I just wait it out? If anyone has any help to offer it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Switch the phone OFF and then remove SIM and SD Card ..</p>
<p>Now switch it ON .. Does it make any difference ?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it doesn't keep rebooting / freezing, try again after inserting one at a time to isolate what is causing the issue. If its the SIM, get it replaced. Make sure the new SIM is a ready Micro SIM and not one which is cropped from
 a standard SIM ..</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If its SD Card, back-up whatever possible data on PC and Format it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">See if this resolves the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If its still freezes after removing SIM / SD Card, try a&nbsp;<span>Soft Reset : P</span><span>ress and hold
</span><strong><span>Power + Volume(down)</span></strong><span>&nbsp;keys until the phone vibrates<span>&nbsp;(about 8-10 seconds).
</span><span>Phone will reboot .. Any difference now ?</span></span></p>
<p>Still no change, try fresh installing the OS using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

</p><p>I think that it is not syncing for you after being able to open OneNote successfully, and I would rather suggest you to sync again the notebooks in OneNote 2016 for mac - sync again as given in here -

    <title>Window phone 8 can only sync one way with Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serangoon north  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window phone 8 can only sync one way with Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a phone running window phone 8. &nbsp;I have installed Outlook connector and added my hotmail account to my Desktop outlook (not running exchange). When I follow the procedure to copy my outlook calendar to my Hotmail calendar, I notice that instead of
 copying the calendar to&nbsp;my Hotmail calendar called "w' Calendar" (which appear in my calendar list running under my desktop Outlook), it created another calendar called "Calendar - my&nbsp;Hotmail address".&nbsp;I believe as the result the calendar item does not show
 up&nbsp;on my phone which has&nbsp;"w' Calendar". The question I want to ask is how do I force the copying of my calendar to my "w' Calendar" in Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the current set up, I also notice that whenever I key in an appointment on my phone, It will show up in my &nbsp;"w' Calendar" in Outlook. But if I key in an appointment &nbsp;in my &nbsp;"w' Calendar" in Outlook it will not show up on my phone. Hence it appear to
 have only a one way sync. How do I get two way sync?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your entry</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your issue description it seems that the events created on your Windows Phone calendar doesn’t sync back to your Hotmail account on your Outlook on your computer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason the events created on your Windows phone takes a time to reach your Hotmail account calendar and same account in Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to suggest you to check your Hotmail.com account calendar to check if your Windows Phone Event are there listed, if this is the case make that is the same calendar on
 your Outlook account.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. After installing Outlook connector yet again, I now managed to syn both way my hotmail calender on my phone with the hotmail calender in Outlook. But the problem of no able to copy the Outlook calender to hotmail calender remain. Everytime
 to try to copy the outlook calender to the hotmail calender, a new calender will be created.<br />

            You are right that I have two hotmail accounts. But only one is added to my Outlook(desktop), I have both hotmail account set up on my phone but Calendar for the second account is turn off.&nbsp; I also have the suspicious that Outlook got confuse with the

            <p>If you are looking for a scenario where these two account calander's get merged, then that is not possible (I believe).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution would be to move your calendar from one account to another, and then decide to use only one calendar. That way, the dual account ambiguity is removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you could get one of the calendar apps and add the account which is currently not syncing with your phone.

            No, I am not trying to merge 2 Hotmail calendar. In fact I do not use any of the two Hotmail calendar. I just want to sync one of the Hotmail calendar to my Outlook(desktop) calendar so that entry on my desktop will show up in my phone. I can copy my existing
 appointment on my outlook(desktop) to my Hotmail calendar. But then new appointment on my outlook will not automatically copy to my Hotmail calendar. so I have to always compare and copy what is new to the Hotmail calendar.

            <p>Here is what you could try. Pick one of your email accounts that you use. Use that email and sign in to OUTLOOK.COM. You will see the CALENDAR for that account on this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a dummy entry.&nbsp; Then, force a sync on your phone as well as the OUTLOOK DESKTOP. Did it work? Do you see the dummy calendar entry in either or both the devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, try the same steps with the second email account you use. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whichever account syncs across the three platforms - browser, desktop and phone, is the one you use to add calendar entries.

            I am already able to sync the Hotmail calendar at outlook,.com&nbsp;with my phone calendar and the Hotmail calendar at Outlook (desktop). They are all the same calendar with the same calendar name hence syncing is not a problem. What I am trying to achieve
 is to sync the Outlook (desktop) calendar with the Hotmail calendar. I have both copy of the calendar showing side by side at Outlook (desktop)

            Thanks. I just done the overlaying of the two calendars. It show the appointments in Outlook(Desktop) and Hotmail as different color entries.&nbsp;I try entering a test appointment in &nbsp;Outlook(Desktop), and the entry show up with the color of the Outlook(Desktop)
 calendar, It do&nbsp;not show up as Hotmail calendar item and hence does not show up in my phone.

</p><p>I upgraded my 8.1 system to 10 Technical Preview. I installed the drivers for usb2dvie3, that is a usb device that permit to attach an another monitor to a notebook (I attached one normally via vga cable and the vga plug on my notebook and tried to attach

<li>Download the drivers for Startech graphics card USB2VGAE3 on your computer.</li><li><span><span>Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system(Windows 8.1), then tap or click OK.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Try installing the driver and check.</span></span></li></ol>

<h3> alain r_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Power point Master language to another language</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Working in an international company we are exchanging Power point Masters. However, the language used to create a Master (and a presentation) is often different than the people who will modify it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example:</div>
<div>1. a user in Poland create a new Master.</div>
<div>Based on this master user add animations and text.</div>
<div>let say that "title" (content) is "Titul" in Polish</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. this user sent his work to a colleague in UK.</div>
<div>Now the colleague is opening the ppt file and want to change the title animation... even if he has an EN version of Power Point, he only sees "Titul" while animation name is correctly translated automatically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>so is it possible to rename those "contents" (title, sub title, levels and so on) ?</div>
<div>How ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thank a lot,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>I'm not sure what you mean by "slave" version.&nbsp; I'm guessing that perhaps you misunderstand how masters work.</p>
<p>If you create a new presentation based on a master, the new presentation now contains the master.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you then change the master, it'll affect any NEW presentations created from the master, but any previous presentations will be unchanged ... they have their own copy of the original version of the master ... they don't refer to the new changed version.</p>

                    This pop-up is really annoying and I've tried every solution out there, but I still have it. Microsoft Security Essentials didn't catch it. Defender hasn't caught it. I've downloaded Trend Micro's AntiVirus+ and run a scan and it didn't find it. Every
 "solution" out there is unique and some are saying to modify the registry which can be lethal. This virus is fraudulently representing Microsoft but you don't care?

                    Hi,
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I'm experiencing problems, with my HTC Touch Diamond2 and ActiveSync 4.5 syncing. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling AS, deleting partnerships, soft resets, reboots for both devices, ran the troubleshooter about 5 times and went through the help section
 on my desktop. I currently sync with Exchange for work emails and my home desk top using outlook for contacts and calendar. I have read somewhere that Outlook on the desktop could be the problem, but unsure how to address it, if indeed that is the case.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
it seems, i have exactly the same problem - problems with my HTC Touch Diamond2 and ActiveSync 4.5 syncing. It started after 2009-08-22 (day of last successful sync). I've cleared the partnership, reinstalled WMDC, including reconnecting and rebooting, with
 and without advanced USB to PC Networking. Connection seems to be established, device cannot be setup for outlook sync. Since i need the contacts, tasks, calendar and so on to be synced for daily work, i am not really amused about it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone has any suggestion? Does it have something to do with one of the latest windows updates? I remember to have installed some in the last days.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Jack,<br />
<br />
Sorry, just to clarify that i have no issues with my work exchange server. It's when I connect my TD2 via USB/ActiveSync to the desk top that it shows as connected (and also charging) but NOT synching with my desktop. Interestingly enough, when I checked AS
 there are now about 15 mobile device identities. Last time I checked I only had 1 phone...<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Steve<br />
<br />
PS - Also I did not receive an alert to any of the responses to my post, when I clearly ticked the "alert me" box...</p>

            Regarding windows update... I've verified this against an older system image (acronis). I've restored an image of my system installation, i made two weeks ago. After the restore everything works without problems. IMHO it definitely looks like a problem
 with one of the latest windows updates (WMDC drivers, security, whatever,...).<br />

Delete the mobile devices that appear in Activesync and reboot the computer. Before connecting your device, delete any existing desktop&nbsp;partnership on it (Not the Exchange connection). Then go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; device ID and change the
 ID. Shutdown and restart your phone. Then re-connect to create a new partnership.<br />
<br />
Let us know how this works.<br />

            Hi Linley,<br />
<br />
I have a problem in that the phone will not allow me to change the ID of the phone. it looks like this was done by my provider T-mobile (UK) as the phone's ID is their name for the TD2 i.e. MDA_Compact V. Tried changing ID on old phone (Touch Dual WM5.0) and
 it allows you to change it.&nbsp;I&nbsp;continued with the shutdown etc and when I connected again, it has come up with the same error msgs. Still will "connect" but not sync.<br />
<br />
cheers,<br />

            Hi Linley,<br />
<br />
I've managed to change the ID on the phone, but to no avail. Also did a system restore, deleted all the partnerships, rebooted the phone - no success. I cannot understand why my old phone (HTC Touch Dual WM5.0 ) can sync and this won't.<br />
<br />
Any further thoughts?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Steve

    <title>Receiving emails twice on my Android tablet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Receiving emails twice on my Android tablet</h2>
                    <p>I recently received an email from Microsoft to my hotmail.com account saying that I needed to to take action to continue Syncing email on my mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It said I should download the Outlook app or 'click here' if I wanted to continue with my current email app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked here and was taken to a web screen at w2.outlook.com which said my preference had been set on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I receive email to a separate hotmail.co.uk address to both the hotmail.com account and the hotmail.co.uk account and deleting from either one deletes from the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want this to happen. I am receiving emails twice in my in box and the .com account seems to be linked to the .co.uk account even though they are not linked in the account settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see what is happening but I want to keep the accounts separate and if it has to be this way, I would have made it the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I return this to the way it was before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both accounts use Active Sync to update across devices, though I suppose I could change to imap for the .com account if this is an issue...</p>

<p>I think the original posts explain this but,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't use the Outlook app for email, have more than one hotmail account and both use ActiveSync on your mobile device (mine is an android tablet) you might get an email suggesting that you should either download the Outlook app or 'click here' to
 continue using an alternative app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose 'click here' and all's fine I assume no problem. If like me you start receiving emails for the account that didn't get the Sync email to the account that did; so seeing the emails twice in your In Box, ditto for diary reminders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have three options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the account you're seeing twice from your email app and let ActiveSync forward the emails to your second account (I didn't want to do that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the account that did get the email, add it again with ActiveSync and ignore the email, not sure what would happen if you did this, the email says your account won't sync properly (I didn't want to do that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the account that did get the email and add it again manually using IMAP instead of ActiveSync (I did this and don't have any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a fourth option, which is to switch to the Outlook app. I'm not sure what would happen if you did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be sure this is the problem, check that the accounts aren't linked as explained in the above responses, if yes unlink them if you don't want them linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also get someone to send you an email to the account that didn't get the Sync email from Microsoft. If you see it twice, delete one of them. If they both disappear from your In Box the I'm pretty sure this is your problem</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Is there a solution to this issue? The outlook inbox has the AdChoices bar on the right and it's very annoying. The whole point of choosing Outlook.com over other services is to avoid advertising. Is there a way to disable it?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

If you wish not to see the advertisement on your Hotmail page, you can click the <strong>
<span>Close ad </span></strong>on the lower right part of the advertisement banner. This will temporarily close the banner and will appear again the next time you sign in.<br />
<br />
Since you're a free user and want to eliminate the banner advertisements, I suggest that you subscribe to Windows Live Hotmail Plus. Signing up for Windows Live Hotmail Plus has the following advantages:<br />
<br />
- 10GB account size limit <br />
- Increase on the number of messages that you can send per day <br />
- No banner advertisements<br />
<br />
If you want to sign up for Windows Live Hotmail Plus, please click </span><span><a href="https://signup.msn.com/?mkt=en-ww&amp;prod=wlmailplus&amp;category=MSN_Hotmail_Plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>here</span></strong></a></span><span>.
