<h2>            Pages Disappear while Typing</h2>
                    <p>I had some very helpful comments on this subject from Jay Freedman in response to my earlier post.&nbsp; What was happening to my Word 2010 document was that pages into which I had typed text suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; Jay was helpful in getting me to where I can
 save documents to two locations.&nbsp; For some reason, when Word eliminated my pages, the saved copy also had the pages eliminated, so I was without a good backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In working in this document since, the same problem has recurred repeatedly.&nbsp; What happens is that the two columns of text which I have been typing suddenly appear as one column down the lefthand side of the page.&nbsp; I went to View to learn that this is the
 Draft version of the document instead of the Printed View.&nbsp; Why it occurs, I have no idea.&nbsp; But, when it occurs, the pages are already lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have notieced that this shift to a Draft view seems to be occurring when I am typing at the bottom of the first column of text, and when text then goes to the top of the second column (I don't know if this is really relevent or not).&nbsp; I have read the document
 into my Word 2000 software, and I have not experienced any of these problems there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious whether anyone else has run into this before.</p>

            If your document is spontaneously shifting from Print Layout to Draft view, then there is a mysterious problem, but could it be that you're inadvertently clicking on the Draft icon on the status bar? In any case, switching to Draft view doesn't actually
 delete any content, but content that is not In Line With Text (and that includes text in text boxes) is not displayed, and columns are shown as a single column. This is no different from Normal view in Word 2000, though Draft&nbsp; in Word 2010 is even less WYSIWYG
 in some ways. For example, pictures, even if they are In Line With Text, are not displayed, and Word doesn't even display a "placeholder" (empty rectangle)--just an empty space.

            <p>Madame --</p>
<p>Theoretically, the pages should not be deleted in Normal view, but I am only able to retrieve (in Normal view) the first three pages of text and graphs. I am wondering if my Word 2010 could be corrupted. I do the Windows Updates to Office as they occur,
 but it doesn't appear that anyone else is having this problem.</p>
<p>I looked at the document in Normal view in Word 2000, and as you noted only the frames show up; pictures without frames are not there. I noted that Figure 2 preceded Figure 1 - a common problem that I run into when moving graphs around on the page. But,
 they appear correct when viewed in the Print Document view. </p>
<p>When I used Word 2000 extensively for such documents, I recall that when I couldn't place a graph on a page with other graphs without problems, I beleive that it may very well have been you that told me to check their ordering in Normal view. By re-ordering
 the appearance of the graphs in Normal view, I usually solved my problem. I suppose that I could go back to the Word 2000 document and encapsulate the two pictures within frames (another advantage for using frames?) to see whether they are in the correct order.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that Word 2010 is less tolerant about the ordering of graphs than Word 2000? In other words, if Figures 3 and 4 are not in the proper order when viewed in the Draft view (I guess that I would have to convert them to frames first), could this
 possibly confuse Word 2010? I do remember printing documents in Word 2000 when the graphs were not in order (but only in the Normal view), but the documents printed without a problem.</p>
<p>To hit the Drafts tab in 2010, I would first have to open the View tab, and I only use this when adjusting page breaks. Hence, I don't think that a manual error is the cause.</p>
<p>Regardless, as always, I thank you for your quick response and helpful comments.</p>

            You do not have to select View to choose Draft view. The status bar (to the left of the Zoom slider) has buttons to change views.

    <title>Update 16273 not appearing on my insider preview partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike hitchcock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 16273 not appearing on my insider preview partition</h2>
                    <p>This build has successfully installed on my desktop pc but not on this laptop. I have tried the troubleshooter without success.</p>
<p>I checked my insider status and found it had changed without my permission. It now reads "Your orgasnisation manages Insider preview builds via a telemetry group policy setting".</p>
<p>This is crazy as this is my home pc and I do not work for any organisation.</p>
<p>This is a Windows Home version of Windows 10 so I do not have access to Group Policy.</p>
<p>Has my laptop been hacked? How do I fix it or can I download an ISO and do a new install?</p>

 an error message.&nbsp; If I save the attachments, they open OK.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Restful Sleep Meaning&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How meaningful is the Restful Sleep and Efficiency measurements of the Band 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see another thread about the Band 1 which questioned the heart rate results and amount of "Restful Sleep" reported. &nbsp;Has the Band 2 improved on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a technical definition of Light vs Restful? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not seem to directly correspond to N1, N2, N3 and REM stages but then they don't have a lot of sensors all over my body to figure everything out. &nbsp;A blog or white paper about the Microsoft Band 2 sleep measurements would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A German blogger did post an interestingcomparison of his Band 2 with two nights of scientifically measured sleep in&nbsp;http://kodierer.blogspot.com/2015/05/zzzzzz-microsoft-band-sleep-tracking-in.html&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note I have been using the Sleep App each night for the past week and the big picture seems roughly reasonable.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>So the power jack on my old HP laptop died, thankfully enough I had a chassis of the same age waiting for a hardrive so I just swapped over. However, in doing so it somehow converted me to windows to go? Now I am not able to use any of my video outputs for
 dual monitor uses. I reinstalled windows from scratch on the hardrive and still having the same issue, any thoughts?</p>

            Same age doesn't mean that they will &nbsp;behave the same, some info about both systems would help, also did it activate when you switched, most times when you install a hard drive from one system into another it will lose activation. as for&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">windows
 to go that is a feature in Enterprises and Education versions but is usually a function done thru the USB flash drive. more info = better answers&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>

            Maybe the BIOS settings were not set to match the previous device, such as UEFI BIOS mode, Secure boot, etc. I have seen Windows 10 misinterpret my install as Windows To Go before, but not entirely sure on the details, as it was quite long ago. It was
 looking at a FAT32 partition, I believe, and calling it Windows To Go.

            I switched from an HP Pavillion G7 with a quad core amd A8 and Radeon driver to a Pavilion dv7 Intel i5. The bios settings were all identical and it was on a sata 6gb/s hgst hard-drive. Drivers were all the base one's provided by HP then upgraded to Windows
 10 compatible ones from manufactures. The only thing that is really acting up is the Vid Card driver currently. I've swapped hard drives before but never had any issues with it switching to windows to go so confused on what I did differently to cause it.&nbsp;

<h2>            HOw to protect a word document but still allow track changes</h2>
                    <p>I need to allow a user to make changes on a word doc with tracking enabled but I want to protect the document from being copied and used by others. Can I insert a watermark behind a each page which can be locked and stay there if the contents are copied
 and pasted to another word document. I am trying to protect my IP but allow the content to be reviewed and changed with tracking.</p>
<p>thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once you give someone access to a document, you have effectively lost all control over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can put a watermark on the document, that will not stop someone copying and pasting the content into another document, which can be done in a way that the watermark does not appear in the document into which they paste.</p>

<h2>            Microphone does not work in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Recently I faced an issue with my microphone as it seems to have stopped working. So I went searching&nbsp;for a possible solution to it but after 2-3 days of struggling with it I have totally lost all hopes. I went through this video:-&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok67GZ--fhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix Microphone Not Working in Windows 10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok67GZ--fhY</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ok67GZ--fhY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ok67GZ--fhY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;and
 tried every possible method he guided but all of them resulted to&nbsp;nothing as my microphone was not detecting sounds after all that.</p>
<p>I updated,&nbsp;reinstalled and tried everything&nbsp;with the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Realtek High Definition Audio</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>handfree/headphone/desktop mic/inbuilt&nbsp;lappy mic</strong></span> but none of them seems to be detecting my sound and the drivers i checked for all of them says that the devices are working properly</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Only my microphone seems to have stoped working but the speakers are just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plez help me with this as I am facing a lot of difficulties&nbsp;lately due to this problem..</p>

<p>&nbsp;I m not very good at understanding these things&nbsp;but from what I understand are these screenshots sufficient enough to you about the details you were&nbsp;asking about.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong>&nbsp; Updating the drivers from <strong>Device Manager</strong> and checking for updates on

<p>the same thing is happening to me. </p>
<p>Antonio, have you checked whether the last build 16579.1000 did actually successfully install? In my case it does not and I have not been able to install it despite trying many different things that worked in the past. I run the update troubleshooter, manually
 deleted all update files and tried other techniques that were suggested. All without success.</p>

<h2>            Click Tracking in Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>I have some pages in SharePoint online that I would like to be able to measure user engagement. My go to approach for this would be to use Bitly but I'm wondering if there are any better alternatives that fit into the Microsoft tool set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm less concerned with URL shortening and more interested in the click through as my measure of content engagement.</p>

<p><span><span>Since OneNote 2013 is crashing while trying to open page template option, let us try repairing Office 2013 and check if this helps us in resolving the issue – as there may
 be some corruption in the installed OneNote templates. Sometimes a corrupt Office 2013 installation may have a bearing on the working of the application or certain functions.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the following and let us know the result.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>You may follow these steps to perform a complete repair of Office 2013.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press the <strong>Windows logo key</strong> <strong>+ X</strong> to see a list of commands and options. (Basically a quick way to get to
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> in Control Panel.)</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Programs and Features</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the Office 2013 or Office 365 program and then click on <strong>Change</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Online Repair</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Once competed restart your computer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Check now if your issue resolves and you are able to access the page templates options.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and let us know the result.

<p><span><span>Since the repair step did not work, in order to get a better understanding of the issue we would require the Event Viewer logs from your computer.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to get the Event Viewer logs follow these steps -&gt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, open OneNote 2013 and try accessing the Page Templates option, there inducing OneNote to crash. Close OneNote 2013 in case OneNote reopens after recovering from the
 crash. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the main Windows Start Screen click on the Search option in the top right corner of the screen and then search for
<strong>Event Viewer</strong><span> or just <strong>EventVwr</strong></span>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. Now below Event Viewer expand
<strong>Windows Logs</strong> and then below this click and select <strong>Application</strong>. On Application check if you are able to find an
<strong>Error</strong> highlighted in a red circle with a white exclamation mark. Make sure that it is an Application Error and talks about the OneNote error. If found, then please note down the detailed error (it should also include
<strong>Faulting Module</strong>). </span></p>

<h2>            Filter to show only duplicate entries</h2>
                    I have two files: Old and New. I need to remove any entry that Old contains from New. So I've exported both files to a tab delimited text file, and then merged the two text files so that now I many duplicate entries. My hopes was that I could come up with
 some formula show only the duplicate values, that way I could just delete them from there. Now how where can I go from the point I am at now?

Example old:</div>

<h2>            Insertion point goes backwards when pressing &#39;space&#39;</h2>
                    Okay so here is the deal, when I type out a document in Word or in an Outlook message, when pressing 'space' to type a new word, my insertion point goes backwards and ends up in between a word that was typed&nbsp;previously. For example, if I press 'space'
 during this sentence, the insertion point will randomly end up on 'previously'. Please help as this is a very unusual problem

                    I want to use the new Outlook365 but it doesn't sync calendarswith Outlook2003. &nbsp;Todo that I would have to upgrade to Outlook 2010 but won't do if it then costs a lot to upgrade to Outlook2013 when it is launched (I have other reasons for wanting to use
 Office 2013 when it arrives). &nbsp;So, does anyone have any idea what the cost will be to upgrade please? &nbsp;If not I guess I can just wait till 2013...

            there is no upgrade path - but there is a free offer for office 2010 purchases made after 10/19. Depending on the suite you buy, you'll either get 1 yr free of the office 2013/365 subscription or 3 months of the suite/hosted services version of 365.

            MS stopped rewarding loyal customers with release of 2010. They no longer offer a discounted upgrade.&nbsp; All purchases are full price.<br />
<br />
If you need to go through 2010, then just download a 2010 trial.&nbsp; Actually you should also download the 2013 trial. The new UI is rather "bright" white, some people have problems with it.
<br />
<br />
Actually, using a 2010 trial is a good idea for another reason. Rumor has it that ms will be announcing the final release date for 2013 some time soon (this month?) . When they do, they typically also announce a "technical upgrade' program to keep up sales
 of the current version. If you buy the current version after the program is announced, you can get a cheap (sometimes free) upgrade to the new version when it comes out. It's sort of a 2-for-1 offer.<br />
<br />
For example, this is the Win8 tech upgrade offer:<br />
<b><span>Win8 “Technical Upgrade” Offer - $15</span></b>
<p><span><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/256667/microsoft_details_windows_8_upgrade_program_for_consumers.html#tk.nl_wvx_h_crawl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/256667/microsoft_details_windows_8_upgrade_program_for_consumers.html#tk.nl_wvx_h_crawl</a>
</span></p>
<p>Microsoft said consumers in 131 markets who purchase a Windows 7 PC between June 2 and January 13, 2013 will be eligible for an upgrade to the new Windows 8 Pro software at a discounted price of $14.99.</p>
<p>There will be discounts and offers for Windows 7 customers who upgrade too. Microsoft said it will announce these offers in the coming months.</p>
<p><a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=An2Z47aepsp.BraDK69AsMH99XQA;_ylu=X3oDMTFqaWd2Ymg3BG1pdANBcnRpY2xlIEJvZHkEcG9zAzIEc2VjA01lZGlhQXJ0aWNsZUJvZHlBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTJuczNoY3NiBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDYTE4ZjRhZjEtNWIzNC0zYmU0LThlMzUtNGQ1YjFmMmFhMDk4BHBzdGNhdAN0ZWNoBHB0A3N0b3J5cGFnZQ--;_ylv=0/SIG=12gdd2m1u/EXP=1339958075/**http%3A/windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview</a></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
<br />
<div>
<b><span>2013 Technical Upgrade Offer</span></b>
<p>The advantage of holding off your purchase briefly is that rumor has it that MS will be announcing the final release date of 2013 in the next month or so. At that time they have "historically" also announced a "technical upgrade" program
 that gives new purchases of the current version (2010) a cheap or free upgrade to the new version.&nbsp; For example people who buy a Win7 PC now, will be able to buy Win8 for $15 when it comes out at the end of October.&nbsp; So if you wait to buy 2010, you effectively
 get a "2 for 1" deal.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Pricing for 2013 has been announced and it is substantially MORE expensive for “retail licenses” than the 2013 equivalent because they are really pushing people to go with the “rental” scheme, that will cost you
 more money in the long term.</p>

    <title>SQL Server Stored Procedure Apparently Timing Out In Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amy baggott  say:</h3>
<h2>            SQL Server Stored Procedure Apparently Timing Out In Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>I'm running an Access 2013 Front End with the Back End in SQL Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; I have a stored procedure in SQL in SQL Server that I run once a year to update exhibitors' priority points.&nbsp; I have a dialog box that passes parameter values to the procedure
 in SQL Server.&nbsp; This box also gives the option of opening a pass-through query that allows the user to preview the results without actually changing the underlying data.&nbsp; That query runs fine.&nbsp; The procedure runs fine if I execute it in SQL Server and hand-enter
 the parameters, but it takes about 15 minutes to run both because it is very complicated and because of the sheer volume of data involved.&nbsp; When I try to call it from Access, however, it runs for a while (about 10 minutes or so) and then throws "Run-time error
 '3146': OBDC-Call Failed."&nbsp; I think it's probably timing out because of how long the procedure takes to run.&nbsp; Here is the code that calls the procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim vbResponse2 As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbResponse2 = MsgBox( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Warning!" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Once you have run this update, you will not be able to undo it!" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Are you sure you wish to proceed with the update?", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbYesNo + vbExclamation + vbDefaultButton2, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Priority Points")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If vbResponse2 = vbNo Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call MsgBox( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Update aborted", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbOKOnly + vbInformation + vbDefaultButton1, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Priority Points")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo PROC_EXIT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set qdf = CurrentDb.QueryDefs("qptPointUpdate")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With qdf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .SQL = "EXECUTE UpdatePoints '" _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; Me.CurrentShow _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; "', '" &amp; Me.PreviousShow _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; "', " &amp; Me.Rate _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; ", " &amp; Me.SameCity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Execute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call MsgBox( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Update completed", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbOKOnly + vbInformation + vbDefaultButton1, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Priority Points")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Any ideas on what to do about the error?&nbsp; I've already run the update for this year, but I'd like to set it up so that I'm not the only one who knows how to run it.</p>

            The Access pass-through query has a timeout setting of typically 60 seconds which you can modify. I would question an SP that takes more than 60 seconds which seems a bit long. There might be some record locking issues in SQL Server but that's a question
 for the SQL Server forum.

<p><span>I am using Mail Merge Wizard Labels steps 1-3 are easy, after that for some reason when I go to merge the data from excel worksheet I can only get 1 address to show up on my Avery

</span>Basically I have 500 name, address, town, zip format to print and I can’t get them to show all up at once on the preview before printing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully you will understand my problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I m new with computers so when you explain please be in detail as possible</span></p>

<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />You need to change the default email app to Outlook.
<br />
<br />You can see here how to do it:

    <title>Microsoft Office for Mac 2019 Product Activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrymorey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office for Mac 2019 Product Activation</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a retail one time box of Microsoft Office for Mac 2019. I deinstalled Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, I followed the instructions, created my account at office.co/setup, downloaded and installed my software then went to launcher and clicked on
 the Microsoft Word icon. I received a screen that asked for my user name, hit next then get a spinning wheel and no password screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After multiple seasons with Microsoft support, I and the vendor I purchased the software, was told the MAC activation servers are down and it could be a few hours or a few days. It has been 4 days so far since I stated this journey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Yes.<br />
<br />
365 runs in a "virtual computer" that separates all of the program code from the local install of 2010.&nbsp; The only conflict is which version is defined as the default in Windows.&nbsp; It can only be one or the other (obviously).<br />
<br />
There is one other potential problem. Windows and the Office installer assume that you only have one need to have one version installed. When you have 2 versions installed locally you will get a "configuring" error every time you start an app in the alternate
 version.&nbsp; I don't know if that is still a problem if you install 365 in click to run along side a local install.&nbsp; If you do get the problem it is a simple fix.<br />

            Yes.. BUT!!!<br />
<br />
You can only have one Version of Outlook running at a time.&nbsp; As has been said.. Office 365 Home Premium is a Virtualized app.&nbsp; You can actually run other versions of Office like 2010 at the same time just not both version of Outlook.<br />
<br />
Though I am wondering if a small problem I am having on one machine is related.&nbsp; My Office 365 Home Premium keeps asking for activation.. it has about once a week.&nbsp; And then the install date for that machine is updated on my account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has not been a problem
 yet on my wife's machine who only has the new version installed where I for work reasons have been keeping 2010 installed too.<br />

<h2>            windows 10- block user from internet</h2>
                    On windows 10 how can I completely block a child user from accessing the internet (while still allowing them to use the computer)?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the Windows 8.1 steps in the following Microsoft Help article to block child user from accessing internet and check if it helps. The steps for Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
