<h2>            Outlook - Display email address instead of names</h2>
                    <p>I need my emails to display email addresses instead of names in the To, CC, From, BCC etc... areas. Instead of displaying "John, Sarah...", I want to see "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Mac Uni office 365 Outlook. I can't seem to find an answer on forums discussing this same issue. Is this rather simple configuration possible on Microsoft Outlook possible or not?</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            MFA will not ring to his business cell phone</h2>
                    <p>My user wants his MFA set up to ring to his business cell phone. I set it up to ring to his business cell phone but it will not ring. It acts like it is calling the cell phone but the phone never rings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have everything set up exactly the same as my account which works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MFA will text a code to his business cell phone</p>
<p>The MFA will ring to his office phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just will not ring to his business cell phone. I tested his phone by personally calling his business cell phone and it rings perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MFA will just not call his business phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why?&nbsp;</p>

            Ha!!!  Awesome... it was a long shot but glad it worked.  I would have hated for you to call the carrier.  Many times the carrier first tier support doesnt help and is reluctant to escalate.

    <title>&#34;Safe to remove usb mass storage device&#34; mark doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maverick6664  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Safe to remove usb mass storage device&#34; mark doesn&#39;t appear with an external hard disk drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a large external (3TB) usb hdd. &nbsp;It works fine with Win10, however when removing, even if I click on "eject mass drive" icon, "Safe to remove mass storage" mark doesn't appear. &nbsp;When I use smaller usb sticks such as 1GB, 8GB or even 32GB, they are
 successfully removed, only the hard drive cannot be removed. &nbsp;So I make it a rule to shut the computer down and remove the hard disk. &nbsp;Of course it's inconvenient. &nbsp; What's wrong? &nbsp;Does it happen with other versions of Windows? &nbsp;I'm using only Win10 now, so
 I don't know. &nbsp;Maybe some background process(es) are using the hard drive, I suspect. &nbsp;It happened with 10525, 10532, 10547 and 10565. (I bought it recently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Maverick,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you unplug a storage device or removable drive from your computer while it's transferring or saving information, you might risk losing some information. Windows provides
 a way to help you safely remove such devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Most USB devices can safely be unplugged and removed. When unplugging storage devices, such as USB flash drives or external hard drives, make sure that the computer
 has finished saving any information to the device before removing it. If the device has a small light that shows when it's use, wait a few seconds after the light has finished flashing before unplugging it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you see the Safely Remove Hardware icon Picture of the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the notification area, at the far right of the taskbar, you can use this as
 an indication that your devices have finished all operations in progress and are ready to be removed. If you don't see the Safely Remove Hardware icon, click the Show hidden icons button to display all icons in the notification area (The notification area,
 at the far right of the taskbar).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To safely remove a certain device, click the Safely Remove Hardware icon Picture of the Safely Remove Hardware icon, and then, in the list of devices, click the device
 that you want to remove. Windows will display a notification telling you it's safe to remove the device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If you open Device Manager (right click start choose Device&nbsp;Manager)&nbsp;and look and the properties of the drive under the USB section, does it start '...&nbsp;this hardware device because it has been prepared for "safe removal"...' ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I got this phenomenon with usb 32GB flash memory stick. &nbsp;However many times I hit "Eject usb stick" in the lower right taskbar icon, I got "The device is currently in use. &nbsp; Some application might be using this device. blah blah". &nbsp;However no windows in
 the desktop. &nbsp; What is running background? &nbsp; Even if I found it in the task manager, I should not have killed it. &nbsp; I have been waiting for 20 mins. &nbsp; I'll shut down and remove my stick!</p>

<h2>            Unable to sign into Yahoo Mail</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: +yahoo home page sign in</p>
<p>Recently&nbsp;Yahoo updated their yahoo mail and now when I go to my yahoo home page it shows me as not signed in. If I click sign in and enter user and password I get a popup from windows explorer saying login popup window is trying to close asking me yes or
 no. If I click&nbsp;no the popups close and I'm still on my original home page and not signed in .And if I click yes the login popup becomes a small version of the original home page and still shows not logged in. Basically when I'm signing in I only get signed
 into yahoo mail and the home page still shows me logged out. I've contacted yahoo several times and even sent them snapshots of each step but their saying it's my explorer settings. I have reset explorer to all defaults, cleared cookies, history and it's still
 the same.&nbsp; I don't have&nbsp;yahoo tool bar or anything yahoo installed I can find.&nbsp; I would note that when this started if I did a search in yahoo (thru bing )&nbsp;the search sites would come&nbsp;but looked like 2 search pages on top of each other like one was written
 over the other but when I did the same search thru msn.com Also (bing)&nbsp; it is perfectly fine. I need to know if this is from my setting or yahoo's. Need help.</p>

 If I click yes it closes and I'm back to the original page and if I click no the login popup becomes a smaller version of the original page,&nbsp;both still showing me signed out but I am signed into to yahoo mail. I contacted Yahoo several times and explained
 to them that when I log in It only shows me logged into yahoo mail and not the homepage which because of this I cannot customize. This issue started after yahoo's new email page update but they keep saying is on my end. I also tried opening a new yahoo account
 with new user and pass, but again it&nbsp;is showing the same thing. There was a windows update around the same time so I need to know if it's yahoo or not.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that search works fine with msn.com and bing .com, it means the issue might not be with Internet Explorer settings it has something to do with Yahoo. However, for confirmation you may check the issue in other browser and see if it brings
 any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated.</p>

            Id like to say I solved the issue, finally. Yahoo recommended clearing explorer history and caches or resetting explorer defaults and contacting the community. All which did not work in this case. But what most fail to check is windows&nbsp; prefetch file.
 I had issues in xp also with theses files and after deleting them Yahoo works perfect now. Please remind users with explorer issues they can delete these without worry and many times is gets over looked. thx for the forum.

<h2>            Your Microsoft account requires attention to get Insider build - Can&#39;t get this to go away&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just downloaded and installed build 10159 on my laptop. I'm using the Pro edition and am connected and logging into my domain account. This is a fresh install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Windows Update - Advanced Options I get the following message under the "Get Insider builds":&nbsp; Your Microsoft account requires attention to get Insider build".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a button labeled "Fix me". When I click that button I'm prompted with "You need to connect a Microsoft account to your device to get Insider build". I click "Sign in with a Microsoft account". I sign into my Hotmail Account (the account I used to
 register as an Insider). The "Fix Me" button now changes to "Refresh". Clicking it prompts me to sign in again and so on ... and so on ... and so on ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two-factor authentication&nbsp;enabled on my Microsoft Hotmail Account. Not sure if that matters.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing this issue? How do I get around it? It just started happening with this build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a bunch. </p>
<p>

<p>I was actually able to get this resolved by logging into the domain to set the option. I was using cached credentials before which I suspect is what was causing the error. I connected to my domain via VPN and then tried the "Fix Me" and that resolved the
 issue I was having.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t highlight text and replace by pasting text in clipboard</h2>
                    Word won't let me highlight a section of text and replace it with text in the clipboard. I have to paste the text next to the existing text, then highlight the old text and delete it. I have to think this is a bug because absolutely no other program I've
 ever used did this. How can I highlight text and replace it with text in the clipboard?

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I want to mentioned the notes on Mac saved in your OneDrive. Please sign in your account to your OneDrive to check whether your notes on there in case the notes lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then please try the step below to check the result:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Close notebooks one by one in your Notebook App. (Do not close your Notebook App directly.)</span></li><li><span>Close your Notebook App and clean the cache folder again from your library (~/library/Containers/com.microsoft.onenote.mac/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft User Data/OneNote/15.0/)</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open your Notebook App again and your related notebooks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the meantime, to narrow down the issue, please provide the information below:</span></p>
<p><span>Try adding a new notebook, copying all the sections from the affected notebook to the new notebook. Check if this problem can be resolved in the new notebook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, based on my knowledge OneNote for Mac can't import notes. You should download the OneNote Importer. For more information, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-notes-from-Evernote-into-OneNote-for-Mac-3c9d8daa-53a7-45da-9f5f-eb2dfd8777bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            All Group Calls are now "hostless". This means that anyone can disconnect any other participant from the call. There is nothing that can be done to change this feature, and there is no known way to determine who disconnects who. This is how it works now
 on Skype.

<h3> fredclaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i change the email address in Calendar</h2>
                    <p>As the technical director for my church I created an email address for the pastor specifically so he could share his calendar with the office manager.&nbsp; Trouble is, I created the calendar address with the pastor's name.&nbsp; The pastor is leaving in July, and
 we need to update that account.&nbsp; We need to keep the calendar alive, but we don't want the old pastor's name to stay attached.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to edit the account information so that the email address that we sign on with is no longer "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and make it something like "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"? Can we just edit the account or would we have to delete the account
 and start a new one? </p>

            <p>Hi Fred,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately as of now you cannot rename the email address and hence the calendar email address cannot be changed, however you may try creating an alias and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create an alias, follow the steps provided in the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Adding gridlines within MS PPT Table</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking at a PPT doc created by someone else, and they added gridlines to an entire column&nbsp;within a&nbsp;table such that when you go to Table &gt;&gt; Layout &gt;&gt; View Gridlines you can toggle these off and on.&nbsp; It doesn't appear to be the same as splitting the
 cell, because split cell line dividers don't toggle the same way that these lines do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I add these lines to my own table in a PPT?&nbsp; I don't fully understand what the lines are, but I would love to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!&nbsp; I added 2 pictures - one showing the&nbsp;gridlines toggled on and the other showing&nbsp;them toggled off.</p>

            Hopefully this is as simple as adding a line into your table. Click on the fields/boxes within your table that you want lines added to, go to table tools, design, and drop down the menu. There should be an option to colour the line of the box you want
 coloured.&nbsp;

<p>The white lines (gridlines) are borders set to NONE. These are the only ones that can be toggled on / off. You cannot toggle borders once they are set to a real line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have is split cells but the center border is set to no border.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer blocks pop-ups from allowed sites&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> indignant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer blocks pop-ups from allowed sites&#33;</h2>
                    Internet explorer continues to block pop-ups even after I add them to my allowed sites list in the pop-up blocker settings. What's the deal with this? Why have an allowed site list if it does absolutely nothing!!! I get the message "Internet Explorer blocked
 a pop-up" on the bottom of my screen and the two buttons "Allow Once" and "Options for this Site". The "Allow Once"&nbsp;button&nbsp;still works, but when I click it, it refreshes the page and I am sent to the top of the page and have to find where I was and click the
 link again, which is all very time consuming and annoying. "Options for this site" brings me to the Pop-Up settings page, but designating sites as allowed does not work, as stated earlier. Please help!!! Thank you.

<h2>            Problem sending email from Msn account on iPhone 6</h2>
                    Help required. &nbsp;I recently upgraded to an iPhone 6. &nbsp;I have an outlook email account which works fine but my msn account can only receive emails. &nbsp;I cannot send &nbsp;emails from my msn account. &nbsp;Outgoing server port for msn account is currently 587 (not sure
 what that means). &nbsp;Any suggestions as to solutions to this problem? &nbsp;

</p><p>No problems.&nbsp; I was just trying to make sure.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the iphone mail app you had to set it up with various bits of information like your user name and password, how you wanted to access the mail, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of two things is happening.&nbsp; Either you have 2 step authentication enabled (see below) in which case you should be getting some sort of error message when you try to send, or, you have the bits of information wrong (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you have "port 587" mentioned seems to indicate you have the correct bits (port 587 is correct) so I suspect it is the 2 step authentication</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting any error messages when you try to send?</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>Do you have 2 step&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;enabled?</div>
<div>I suspect what is happening is you are still using the overall account password and not the app generated password.&nbsp; You will still get mail until you log the device out (which is a good idea anyway) and then you will need to generate a password
 (on the pc in outlook.com) and "trust" the mobile device. After which it should not do that.</div>
<p>
</p><p>You should log on and go here<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/securityprivacy/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://account.live.com/securityprivacy/overview</strong></a><span>&nbsp;</span>to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><div>You can also install the outlook app so anytime you need a "passcode" you can approve it directly on the mobile device.</div>

<div><strong>If you’d like to manage your Outlook account using an email app, you’ll need to set up your POP3 or SMTP server and port settings
 in your email app. You’ll need the following info:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POP3 server: pop3.live.com (port 995)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMTP server: smtp.live.com (port 25)<br />
<br />
<br />
<div><em>Choose the Secure Sockets L</em><em>ayer (SSL) option for both POP3 and SMTP connections.</em><br />
<em>Choose the SMTP authentication for SMTP connections.<br />
Choose the outgoing server requires authentication option. (In most email apps, this option isn't checked by default.)</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User name: Enter your full email address.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: Enter your Microsoft account password.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you don’t want email messages to be permanently deleted from your inbox after
 you download them to your mail program, select the Leave a copy of messages on the server option.</span></strong></em><br />
<br />
<strong>Prevent losing email in Outlook.com when you've set up POP3</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com
 has a feature that prevents losing email messages if you accidentally set up POP3 to delete them after reading them on the server. Here’s how it works:</span></em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Outlook.com receives a POP3 instruction to delete email messages after reading from an email app, Outlook.com won't delete the messages. Instead, Outlook.com moves the email messages that were successfully downloaded by the email app
 into a POP folder and out of the inbox. The POP folder is available in the Folders list.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook.com keeps the email messages in the POP folder until you sign in to your Outlook.com account and verify whether Outlook.com should respect or ignore the POP3 delete command.<br />
<strong><br />
To verify your POP3 settings:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the upper-right of the Outlook.com window, click Options, and then click More options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Managing Your Account, click Pop and deleting downloaded messages, and then select one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Don’t let another program delete messages from&nbsp;Outlook.com. (If your other program is set to delete messages from the server, we’ll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won’t be deleted.)<br />
<br />
Do what my other program says—if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save.</strong></div>

<p>Hi arzoo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately self-repair discussion is not allowed in the forums. This is because it may harm the device and void any existing warranty. We would advise you to take the device to your
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">local Nokia Care Point</a> and let them have a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on,</p>

<h2>            Not all photos from Camera roll in Nokia 1020 sync to One Drive. Missing high res ones.</h2>
                    <p>In Settings &gt; Backup, i set up auto back up of settings and photos including the option to back up photos at best quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I later check One drive and,&nbsp; a) i cant see where my system and settings back up is, and b) not all my photos from my camera roll are there.</p>
<p>None of the higher res photos are there. Using microsoft's Files app on my phone i can see that my camera roll has 136 files at 1.35Gb. However on One drive there about 20 photos and only 42MB..!!?! Note that i have set the camera to save two photos, the
 5mp + 35mp option, not the raw DNG option which results in v big files (which are not supported for auto back up anyway !). With Files app i can see in Camera Roll there are two copies of each photo, one a around 1.2Mb and one at 9MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if i go to Photos&gt;camera Roll&gt;select all&gt;share&gt;One drive i still sont get all my photos there although in Camera roll you dont see the high res photos anyway..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i use Files app where its the only place i can all photos appear (both 5mp res and 35MP res) and select them all to share them i get the message I can only share up to 100files at a time..!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i search the web for answers but not much comes up.. I was hoping for a simple phone to computer wireless auto sync solution for my phone data,&nbsp; photos (and music from computer to phone!)&nbsp; the minute i walk into my house..No such things exists..I find out
 i have to make the round trip of uploading/backing up/syncing to One drive and from there back down to my computer. But even uploading to One Drive doesnt work to start with..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried another app called Camera Roll Sync which promises to sych high res photos but even this doesnt copy all the files..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyone can help on this?</p>
<p>Backing up up my data on my phone to my computer automatically when my phone is sitting in my house without me having to remember doing this using a cable would be great..</p>
<p>

            <p>You can only see the low res photos in the camera roll and that is what is backed up to OneDrive.</p>
<p>When you take lots of pictures, backing up or copying the highres pics is not the problem. I want to remove them to regain storage space on the phone. I connect the phone to the PC and cut/paste them to a phone highres folder on the PC.</p>
<p>FYI, if you delete a pic from the camers roll on the phone or delete or remove a low res pic using windows explorer it also deletes the highres pic.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Gary good to know that only low res photos appear on camera roll and that if u delete one the high res is also deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked again today and high res photos don't get copied in OneDrive auto back up. Anyone to verify that this is normal behaviour?
</p>
<p>If so neither wireless sync nor auto back up is available for my windows phone..</p>

            <p>I have never seen any high res pics backed up to my OneDrive.&nbsp; The low res pics are for viewing and sharing, not the high res.</p>
<p>High res pics stay on your phone until you move them to the PC. The phone can do little with them so why keep them there. Your PC is the only thing that can&nbsp;do anything with them.&nbsp; If you take lots of pics the amount of storage space they take up&nbsp;adds up
 fast so why back them up somewhere.</p>

<p>You&nbsp;will still&nbsp;leave the high res pics on the phone. When you do start deleting the pics you copied with the app you will be checking if you got them all.</p>

<p>Contact Limewire, it's most likely your Firewall stopping the procedure.</p>
<p>"The&nbsp; Gnutella network is a system of computers connected only through the internet. In order for LimeWire to connect to the Gnutella network, an internet connection must be present. LimeWire will not establish an internet connection for you. "</p>
<p>"LimeWire does not keep any record of files being shared on the Gnutella network, nor does it scan any files being uploaded for viruses. Therefore, if you attempt to download a virus-infected file using LimeWire, you will be vulnerable to any viruses contained
 in that file. Generally speaking, you should be very careful when downloading files with a .exe or .vbs suffix, since these files are more likely than most to be viruses. Scanning the files you download with some sort of virus-protection software is also a
 good idea. "</p>
<p>" LimeWire will work when a user is behind certain types of firewalls, but will not work behind certain other types. In general, if you can connect (you will see your connection status in the lower left hand corner of LimeWire) using LimeWire, you should
 be able to download and upload files. "</p>
<p>Careful using Limewire, you could open your whole computer up to the world and even download viruses and other nasties. Make sure you know what you're getting into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, what is your Microsoft Windows Update question?</p>

            First thing to do with a questionable email is to check the URL's to determine whether or not it's pointing to a legitimate destination.
<br />
<br />In this case, it's obvious that it's phishing email given the destination is "zipansion.com". However, even the link in the email "appears" to be legit, hover over it to see where it's actually pointing to since it may not be the same as what is being displayed. Another approach is to right-click on the link --&gt; copy URL --&gt; paste it into any text editor (i.e. NotePad) to see the actual destination URL.
<br />
<br />The above is equally true for an email that appears to be coming from a legit source (i.e. Paypal etc).

<div>Hi Charles,</div>
<div><br />
<div>In some instances, you may just need to end a couple of tasks from the Task Window to solve this kind of issue. But before that, let me ask you some questions to isolate your concern.</div>
<div><br />
<div>• Are you accessing your email through <strong>Outlook.com</strong> (<strong>webmail</strong>) or Office
<strong>Outlook app</strong>?</div>
<div>• <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What version of Office</a></strong> are you using?</div>
<div>• Is this issue specifically only happens with Outlook or are you also getting the same error when trying to open other Office application?</div>
<div>• Were there any changes on your PC prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the meantime, you may check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/error-when-opening-microsoft-office-apps-b84b6a63-4b8c-46ec-ae9a-ad91d6160d72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a></strong> to fix the error that you're
 getting when trying to open Outlook app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</div>

<h2>            Invisible Page Numbers in Word</h2>
                    Hello. &nbsp;I am using Word for Mac 2011, version 14.3.6. &nbsp;I used a Resume template and made a one page resume. &nbsp;I have no page number on it and when I upload it to various employer applications and career websites like Monster or Careerbuilder, there is a
 "page 2" printed in the right of the header. I do not have any settings to show page numbers anywhere in the template setup. I cannot figure out how to get rid of "page 2" showing up on my document when it's uploaded, there's nothing showing up in Word. &nbsp;Thanks
 in advance for any help.&nbsp;
                </div>

            I just downloaded your résumé. It takes just one page. But if I add a couple of Carriage Returns to force the appearance of a second page, the "2" does appear in the footer. So do this: add a couple of extra lines, go to page 2, delete the number, delete
 the extra lines.

            OK, I've looked at your document &amp; Daniel is on the right track :-) but the issue is a bit different than I understood from your description. I had the impression that it was only a single page, that "page 2" was showing in the Header on that page &amp; that
 it was displaying only in the submitted document [not in your local (original) copy]. Fortunately, your problem is due to a common cause which is easily corrected...<br />
<br />
The main <i>cause</i> is the big gap between the personal info &amp; the <b>Skills</b> heading. It's created by an empty paragraph apparently used for spacing purposes [never a good idea :-)]. That paragraph also has 20 pt
<i><b>Space Before</b></i> as well as 10 pt <b>Space After</b> attributes applied to it. The 1st page Header also has 24 pt Space After applied to it which further exaggerates the influence on the text flow. That is forcing the last 2 lines onto a 2nd page
 which -- as Daniel pointed out -- has a different Header definition which includes the page number field.<br />
<br />
The cure can be accomplished in either of several ways, but this is what I'd suggest:<br />
<ul>
<li>With the insertion point at the beginning of the word <b>Skills</b>, press the
<i>delete</i> (<i>backspace</i>) key to remove the empty paragraph. That will allow the 2 lines on the 2nd page to be drawn back onto the 1st page.</li><li>If you want more space separating Skills from the personal info, click in the Skills paragraph then go to Format&gt; Paragraph to increase the Space Before. Although you may be able to get away with a little more I'd suggest not using any more than 30 pt.
 -- As Daniel advised, spacing can be influenced by printing devices, installed fonts, etc., so it's best to not push the limits if the document is to display properly on another computer.</li></ul>
<br />
In order of increasing complexity, other options include;<br />
<ol>
<li>Go into the 1st page Header, then go to Format&gt; Paragraph &amp; reduce the Space After to 0,
<i>or</i></li><li>Click in the empty paragraph above Skills, then go into Format&gt; Paragraph to remove the Space Before/After. However, that won't be enough. You'll also have to click in the Phone paragraph to remove the 10 pt Space After applied to it,
<i>or</i></li><li>Go into the page 2 Header, use Command+A to select the content, then delete it. Note that this still will leave you with a 2 page document with just the same 2 paragraphs on the 2nd page -- it just removes the page numbering, or</li><li>Some combination of all the above in order to reduce the overall vertical spacing in the document.</li></ol>
The most likely reason that Option+F9 did not reveal the page number field is that your OS X System Preferences are set not use the "F" keys as standard function keys -- They are set to use specific OS X/Mac features, instead. If your keyboard has a
<i><b>fn</b></i> key you can use <b><i>fn</i>+Option+F9</b> to toggle the Field Codes.<br />
