<h2>            Skype For Business presences with Office 365&#47;On-prem</h2>
                    
<p>I found this article dating back from September 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/407036</p>
<p>I wondered if this is still valid. We're having the following behaviour:</p>
<p>Using Exchange Online / Sharepoint Online in Office 365 with E3 plan. Using on-prem infrastructure for Lync 2013 /SfB.</p>
<p>Using ADFS 3.0 Federation in combination with DirSync with Password Sync as failover.</p>

<p>Presences are available in Outlook and OWA. Presences are available in SharePoint online (modified by column, Site users web part, ...)</p>
<p>Some users gave feedback that presence was no longer available - we found this due to users who had a new client rolled out with windows 10 but the Office Sign-In Assistant was not installed.</p>
<p><br />
But on top in the Office 365 bar, right hand corner, next to the profile picture, everyone sees the presence greyed out.</p>
<p>Any feedback or advice is welcome.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>First, regarding the thread you mentioned, I haven‚Äôt received any further official update. For the problem you describe, right now, we do not have enough evidence whether they are related. To avoid misunderstanding, may
 I collect some information to analyze it?</p>
<p>1. First, I‚Äôd like to confirm the detailed environment: ‚Äú<em>Using Exchange Online / Sharepoint Online in Office 365 with E3 plan. Using on-prem infrastructure for Lync 2013 /SfB</em>‚Äù, for example:</p>
<p>Do you mean you have integrated on-premise Lync/SFB server with Office 365?</p>
<p>Do you use SFB online service?</p>
<p>Are Lync/SFB accounts hosted in on-premise Lync/SFB server or online?</p>
<p>Detailed information is appreciated.</p>
<p>2. So, the exact symptom is that: previously, it worked fine. When some users start to use Windows 10, the issue occurs. Right?</p>
<p>3. For the affected users: ‚ÄúSome users gave feedback that presence was no longer available‚Äù, I need to know the detailed symptom, for example,</p>
<p>a. Is presence available Outlook Web App now?</p>
<p>b. Is presence available in team site, document library, etc?</p>
<p>Please provide related screenshots. You can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum, and then click the insert image button to upload the screenshot.</p>
<p>4. Which browser are they using in Windows 10? There is a known issue that Skype for Business Online (formerly Lync Online) presence indicator does not work with Edge. For detailed information, please see:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083635</a></p>
<p>If you let affected users change to other browsers, does the issue occur?</p>
<p>5. To narrow down the issue, could you let affected users test the issue from other workable PCs? Can you always&nbsp;reproduce the issue?</p>
<p>With the detailed information, I will further check it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>I would need more details to assist you:</p>
<p>How does the email sent from Apple Mac appear on the webmail?</p>

            <p>Do you have all updates installed in outlook? There was a problem way back when Outlook 2010 was released but it was fixed very quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using an antivirus scanner in Outlook? It could be causing the problem - log into your account's web access and verify it is fine online.&nbsp; You can usually test this by starting outlook in safe mode and have your wife send you a message with an attachment.
 Download it and see if its ok in Safe mode. </p>

    <title>Bing.com Skype award good overseas&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skaizun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing.com Skype award good overseas&#63;</h2>
                    I can get a one-month Skype award from Bing.com,<br />
and would like to give it to my friend<br />
who is, currently, interning, overseas (Hungary),<br />
and, who uses Skype to communicate with her family.<br />
I presume that all I need to do is forward<br />
the award e-mail containing the requisite info to her,<br />
but, Bing.com's support staff wasn't sure if it would be good, there.<br />
Does anyone know how I can find out, one way or the other?<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
P.S. Apologies, if this isn't the right discussion group;<br />
it seemed to be the most apropos.

    <title>Ah, back to Windows 8 and it feels so good. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian m. walker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ah, back to Windows 8 and it feels so good.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yup, I've abandoned Windows 10 for now and I was rather surprised at how good it felt to have Windows 8 back again. &nbsp;I even have the keyboard lights working on my Merc Stealth again (a rather surprising bug). :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was one of those who was never particularly bothered about the change to the Start Menu, though so I actually liked 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get this out of the way straight off before the rabid start telling me I shouldn't have been using 10 on a daily use machine: I was. &nbsp;Big deal. &nbsp;It was my choice. &nbsp;I also think it gives far more valuable feedback to be used as we would be when it is
 finished. &nbsp;I knew the risks and I took them. &nbsp;End of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that's out of the way, as many others have voiced (including myself) the small bugs I expected and handled (such as how often I had to restart Explorer to remove notifications) but the biggest bugbear was the downgrade of OneDrive. &nbsp;I got tired of how
 much of my machine's resources it was constantly demanding. &nbsp;Back to 8 and despite having to download 300+ GB of data, it is an astonishing difference. &nbsp;My machine was barely impacted! &nbsp;With 10's OneDrive I would often find myself unable to even pull up a
 web-page without a wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also very much underwhelmed thus far. &nbsp;Given Microsoft's history, I'm really not believing that there is far more coming down the pipe for this iteration (and yes, I've been using Windows since Windows 95). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be given a semblance of our old Start Menu back but then not be able to add / edit / customize as we could before, what is the point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the hype for this next great leap, where is the wow factor? &nbsp;No flashy new UI, (Linux has had amazing GUIs for years haven't they?). &nbsp;No big new anything really. &nbsp;Just the frustration of the OneDrive change and a few minor tweaks such as seeing the
 apps in our taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall keep an eye on it (long time geek and IT person so can't help it) but I'll be holding off upgrading for as long as I can keep the old OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that's pretty much what I did.&nbsp; I installed 10 on a separate partition.&nbsp; Used it on and off for a&nbsp;couple weeks.&nbsp; I haven't booted&nbsp;10 for&nbsp;a couple months&nbsp;now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around Thanksgiving was the last time I played with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since deleted it and recovered the space on the drive.&nbsp; Wake me up when it becomes interesting.&nbsp; I'll install it in Hyper V next time.&nbsp; I'm back on 8.1 and loving it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I also this morning returned my favorite&nbsp;17 inch HP pavilion laptop to 8.1.&nbsp; I had no trouble with video playback on 10, but recording was slow.&nbsp; Well, for me 10 in general is much slower, and Internet Explorer was very static like on 10, on both my&nbsp;x64
 computers.&nbsp; I, like yourself enjoy having my keyboard lights back :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I DO miss the resizable app windows, and having the app screen appear over the desktop, rather than on a separate screen on 10, but not a major necessity for me.&nbsp; I still have 10 on
 my 15 inch HP pavilion laptop so I can keep up with updates and improvements, and hope to change my mind soon in the future, but without improved speed, smoothness and perfection, I like 8.1 much better for now, sad to say.&nbsp; 10 worked best for me on my old
 acer 32 bit computer with 32 bit version of 10 running on it.&nbsp;

            Pretty sad that 10 is worse than 8.1. I did try it at the beginning, when they started, but about 2 weeks of 10 reinstalled fresh Windows 8.1, because it is way buggy, and I know it is tech preview, but with April coming up in few months, that is quick,
 and 10 is still not moving very fast. I bet there is going to be a delay on release of RTM.

            The only thing that really frustrates me about Windows 10 right now, is that the browser pages load slow.&nbsp; The apps all run great, I like the setup and the improvements to the app page functions.&nbsp; I am just waiting for the browsers to speed up, then I
 am all set to make the switch for real :D

<p>Win 10 is not due to RTM in April. Win 10 is not due to release until late Summer or early Fall, so there's plenty of time for bug fixes.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Junk e-mail issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stpetefl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Junk e-mail issues</h2>
                    <p>Have been using Outlook since the beginning of time. Well . . . , a long time. Was on Office/Outlook 2010 for around 6 years. Then upgraded to Office 365 Home on Microsoft Exchange (Hotmail account) Windows 10 Home edition. In 2016 noticed that if I selected
 an e-mail in the junk e-mail folder and dragged it into the inbox (therefore leaving it marked as unread), within 15 seconds or so Outlook or Exchange would automatically place that mail back in the Junk e-mail folder. If I clicked on that e-mail while in
 the Junk e-mail folder and then clicked on another junk e-mail in the Junk e-mail folder, thereby making that first junk e-mail appear as being read while displayed in the preview panel, and then selected and dragged that e-mail to the Inbox folder the e-mail
 stays. Outlook never behaved that way in 2010, 2003, 2007 editions. If you dragged a junk e-mail over to your inbox it stayed there. [<strong>A NOTE: This is not about safe senders or blocked senders.
</strong><strong>There is another issue with that feature that I will get to shortly.]
</strong>So as time goes on (now it is 2017 late March or April) my system has and continues to undergo numerous Windows 10 and Office updates. This junk e-mail behavior disappears and Outlook is behaving as it always has (well, with regard to Junk e-mail behavior
 between folders). Now it is November 2017 another round of updates in both Windows and Office and this Junk e-mail issue comes back! Why is Outlook/Exchange/Office behaving this way? It is very frustrating to drag not-junk e-mail from the Junk e-mail folder
 to your inbox and be reading it (via the preview pane) and it suddenly disappears --&gt; back to Junk e-mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe Senders:</strong> Here is another issue. For some reason Outlook is now placing an e-mail (e-mail I get daily) from 'xxx<em>@cnet.</em><em>online.com'</em> into my Junk e-mail folder. Email from this domain never went to my Junk e-mail folder.
 So, while in Junk-email folder with that e-mail selected, I select Junk from the menu ribbon, and select 'Not Junk', a pop up window opens telling me that the e-mail will be moved to the Inbox and the checked checkbox for "Always trust email from
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'</em> is displayed. I select 'OK', pop up window closes and e-mail is moved. Next day, new e-mail from same sender is back in Junk e-mail, like I never selected the Not Junk option. I check Junk e-mail options and the Safe Senders list
 and the domain&nbsp;'<em>@cnet.online.com' </em>is listed. The domain is <strong>not </strong>
listed in the block senders list. What is the problem here? Junk e-mail Safe Senders is not working properly. And it is not restricted to the cnet domain. It has happened with other safe domains. Extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last note: I use Outlook/Office on multiple devices to be able to access my work or files or e-mail wherever I may be with whatever one of my devices I have with me (the sole reason for upgrading to Office 365): My devices; workstation (home), laptop
 (also Windows 10 Office 365), ipad IOS 11, and Android phone(Galaxy S8). The only device I use to set options or settings in Outlook 2016 is the workstation. The other devices are used to just read or reply to or delete e-mails when I am not on the workstation
 or traveling.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the update is not compatible with the settings of your Exchange. That being said, there are settings that need to be reconfigured to resolve this concern. However, Exchange Server settings are more complex than what is typically answered
 in <strong>Microsoft Community</strong>. We highly suggest that you post this concern in our
<strong>TechNet </strong>forum for better assistance. We have IT Pro audience that can provide you with the most appropriate solution and the best advice on how you can go about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you post your concern, we need to gather additional information so that we can provide you the correct link. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the version of the Exchange Server are you using?</li><li>Are you managing your Exchange through a Windows Server?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Reply to us with the information so that we can assist you better.</p>

<p>I think you missed an important point in the posting. The e-mail account is a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Hotmail </span>account, a free Microsoft/user account, which is hosted on Microsoft servers and therefore the Exchange server is a Microsoft asset. "<em>Formerly called
<strong>Hotmail</strong> (Windows Live <strong>Hotmail</strong>) is one of the most popular free online email services, provided by Microsoft... .</em>"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is a Microsoft server (Exchange) managed by Microsoft, I have no idea how Microsoft administers the server or what those settings for the server are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, on the other hand, have made no changes to settings in Outlook 2016 since it was installed as part of the Office 365 install. I am reporting anomalous behavior that occurs after a either a Windows 10 or Office 365 update occurs. And after a subsequent
 update of either one the behavior disappears only to reappear after yet another update. It comes, it goes, it comes back again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your response though and hope progress can be made in rectifying this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few possible reasons why your emails are not being filtered properly either on the app that you're using or due to the email server settings used on an app. To have this isolated, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>For added clarification, what email server type are you using on your <strong>
Outlook 2016</strong>?</li><li>Have you tried checking you login to your web mail if emails go to your junk folder?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can also <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Add-an-email-account-to-Outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">add your email</a></strong> on your

<strong>test</strong> with the same email settings, to ensure that the current email profile is not corrupted as an initial step to isolate the issue.</p>

<p>Ok . . ., we need to do a major reset here. I have stated previously that this is a Microsoft Hotmail account. The
<em>hotmail </em>account is used when setting up e-mail accounts for Outlook 2016 to work with. It is the only account used. Outlook 2016 is part of the Office 365 Home set of products. Microsoft therefore provides the server. When Outlook 2016 is starting
 up under Windows 10 the status indicator says that Outlook 2016 is connected to <strong>
Microsoft Exchange</strong>. The account service portal is https://outlook.live.com/owa/Hotmail.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Hotmail account is part of the free e-mail that Microsoft has made available, the e-mail server is a
<strong>Microsoft administered Exchange Server. </strong>I have no clue what version the Exchange server is at. That is a Microsoft e-mail team question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read the description above and the previous replies carefully. They already provide the information you are looking for. This is NOT a third party owned Microsoft Exchange server. This is Microsoft and the behavior changes when an Office 365/Windows
 10 update is released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Just to add clarity with it the previous post, the reason why we're verifying these is because you can use the same
<strong>Microsoft account</strong> the way you see it fit. You can have it configured as an
<strong>IMAP</strong>, <strong>POP3</strong>, or sign it on your <strong>Outlook 2016</strong> using your
<strong>Office 365</strong>. A <strong>Microsoft Exchange server</strong> is different from the servers we provide service with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>Microsoft server</strong> would be different from a <strong>Microsoft Exchange Server</strong> as at most cases,
<strong>Microsoft Exchange servers</strong> are used either for <strong>corporate</strong> or
<strong>commercial</strong> use as their domains can be customized for them to be recognized depending on their business. A
<strong>Microsoft server</strong> would be a dedicated server for <strong>Microsoft services</strong> such as
<strong>Outlook.com</strong>, <strong>OneDrive</strong>, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If what you're currently using is the free version of <strong>Outlook.com</strong> added on your
<strong>Outlook 2016</strong> desktop app, the emails server types that would be available is only
<strong>IMAP or POP3</strong>. The only condition that you'll have <strong>Exchange Server capabilities</strong> is, if what you're using is an
<strong>Outlook.com Premium</strong> or an <strong>Office 365 subscription</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To shed a little light as well on why we advise you to create another email profile named as test, is this is to ensure that your current email profile is not corrupted. This is also to isolate the problem if it's an email specific or program specific.</p>
<p>

            FWIW - Just went through the exercise of adding multiple pics to a doc and adding captions to all. The deleted several re-adding a caption after each deletion. All worked as expected. Added captions by both right-clicking on the image as well as via the References Ribbon tab. So the question becomes
<br />
<br />What do you mean exactly by ".................and now the caption function will not work"? Specifically what happens by way of any messages presented etc etc
<br />
<br />Also, what version of word are you using - go to File --&gt; Account

            You're using the same version I used to try and replicate the problem but everything works as expected
<br />
<br />Are you creating a new doc from scratch where this issue surfaces or opening a pre-existing doc?
<br />
<br />Also, just to make sure I'm understanding things - what you're doing is
<br />
<br />#1 - Adding pics along with captions
<br />#2 - Deleting one of the existing pics just added
<br />#3 - Inserting a new pic in the same location
<br />#4 - Right-clicking results in what you described - doesn't let you add a caption
<br />
<br />Does that the above summarize everything correctly?

            Since I can't replicate the problem, haven't run across it before and can't find anything definitive on this - only guessing as to what may resolve the problem
<br />
<br />#1 - You might want to check to see what if anything is selected as an "AutoCaption" as per
<br />
<br />Adding captions with AutoCaption
<br /><a href="https://www.officetooltips.com/word_2016/tips/adding_captions_with_autocaption.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.officetooltips.com/word_2016/tips/a...</a>
<br />
<br />#2 - To a lesser extent - check for any formatting that may be getting applied
<br />
<br />Add, format, or delete captions in Word
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-format-or-delete-captions-in-Word-82FA82A4-F0F3-438F-A422-34BB5CEF9C81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-fo...</a>
<br />
<br />#3 - Failing the above - do a repair of your Office install to see if brings everything back to normal

<p>Hello Karl</p>
<p>I think I have&nbsp;solved my problem.&nbsp; I will try to explain it for&nbsp;future reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a picture in a document. I actually have many pictures in the document. I have successfully&nbsp;added captions to all those pictures. I deleted a picture and then added a picture. When I tried&nbsp;to add a caption, by the usual method, the caption box opened
 but in the field where we normally type some text to define the picture, the field was blank and it would not let me type anything in that space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a new file, blank page, inserted a picture, added a caption and it all worked fine. So, It was not a Word problem, just that first document problem.</p>
<p>I have learned about fields and field codes. I believe that I had inadvertently deleted the field codes from the caption function in that document. By learning about field codes and inserting a field code, I believe I have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and effort to solve my problem. You are indeed an MVP.</p>

            Dear Walid,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />In order to get an image to the signature it is enough to copy/paste the image to the signature box <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/messageContent/signature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/mess...</a> I just have checked this and changed my image and it works. More about signatures you will find here <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-and-add-an-email-signature-in-outlook-com-776d9006-abdf-444e-b5b7-a61821dff034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot paste it, then it might be a browser issue. Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>

<br />Insert option for pictures and images is reserved for Office 365 subscribers only. This comes to other portions as well, for example encrypted messages.
<br />
<br />If you would like to leave a feedback to developers, you can do it here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a> If there will be enough votes, maybe developers will make changes and enable this option for all users.

<p>I had no trouble copying an image open in Paint (Ctrl-A C) and pasting (Ctrl-V) into the signature panel at Outlook.com using an ordinary (i.e. not Premium) Outlook account. Where are you trying to copy from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not improbable that there are regional or other differences between accounts so that this doesn't work for some users. However, it should also be possible to insert an image that is already stored online somewhere. If you have your own website, for
 example, you can use an image from there in your signature. In Microsoft browsers, you would right-click on the image on the webpage and select
<em>Copy</em>, then paste into the signature compose panel at Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have your own website, you could use this one to store your image for you. Just make sure it's the right size for your signature before using the&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62eef89e-b0f5-4b23-9dc2-2b2b0ea498d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62eef89e-b0f5-4b23-9dc2-2b2b0ea498d6?upload=true" /></a>
 button to insert the image into your reply here. After you've submitted your reply, you can copy the image from it and paste it into the signature compose panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're concerned about leaving the image here in public view, just click on the three dots&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54f75e5b-9717-492b-ac7d-555f1b8a76c2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54f75e5b-9717-492b-ac7d-555f1b8a76c2?upload=true" /></a>below
 your reply and select <em>Edit</em>, then <em>Delete</em>. This will remove the reply from public view, but the image will still be stored on Microsoft's servers for you to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases, Outlook transmits the image with the mail message, meaning that it will still be visible to the recipient even though he has no Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an image for you to practice with:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I pick a value, I'd&nbsp;like the cell to the right to allow me to select from another drop down list of subproduct values that are related to the product that I pick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I pick Product A in one cell from&nbsp;the drop down list , then the next cell to the right would allow me to pick&nbsp;from a drop down list, one of several choices RELATED to Product A. (i.e. sub product A1, subproduct A2, subproduct A3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if I pick Product B in one cell from the drop down&nbsp;list, then the next cell to the right would allow me to pick from a drop down list, one of several
</p>
<p>choices RELATED to Product B (i.e. subproduct B1, subproduct B2, subproduct B3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, when I select a product, I have a vlookup command in the next cell that only shows me&nbsp;ONE related&nbsp;subproduct value&nbsp;to that product.&nbsp; So right now when I select Product A from the drop down, the next cell to the right uses a vlookup command to
 only show ONE related subproduct A&nbsp;whereas I want to have the choices to choose from one of several related subproducts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for any assistance!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 the text continues after without inserting extra blank pages. Currently I have the graphs in the right place, but if I add in lines on the previous page, the text doesn't shift down after the graph/picture text box, but adds in a new page before, with the
 resulting large gap, before the graphs on the next page, then continuation of the narrative on the the page after that. I am usifn Word 2007.

            <p>That's the way Word works, and has always worked. All graphics are "anchored" to some specific paragraph of text, and must always be on the same page as that paragraph. If editing of the text that precedes the anchor paragraph causes the paragraph and graphic
 not to fit on the current page, both are forced to the next page. The text from the following paragraphs
<em>cannot</em> flow backwards to fill the empty space, any more than they could do so if the graphic wasn't present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often this is expressed as "Word is not a page layout program". What that means is that Word treats its text, and everything embedded in the text, as a stream; it makes pages as necessary to contain that stream by constantly recalculating the layout. Pieces
 of the stream can't flow backwards. In contrast, a page layout program such as Publisher considers the pages as fixed containers, and "pours" the content into them. Some objects such as graphics may be fixed to the pages, and the text flows around them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is that Word can't do what you propose. The only alternative is to completely finish editing the text and then -- and only then -- position the graphics where you want them. In the meantime, ignore the layout.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Web retaining text formatting</h2>
                    When I enter text in my OneNote page it is retaining some text and highlight formatting from somewhere. I am using the OneNote web version and have the default font set to Calibri 11 but when I enter a new line I get Calibri 14 and it is highlighted by
 default. How can I clear this retained text format?

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my tests on OneNote Online, you may use the following steps to clear the format:</p>
<p>1. Select the text;</p>
<p>2. Click the Home tab &gt; click the Clear Formatting button or the Normal style.</p>

<p>Oh - sorry. I didn't see your reply. I will test it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried it and noticed I am stuck in Heading 1. I am not able to shift to Normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK - tried again and highlighted the full text area and was able to get to Normal by default. If I type a new line I still get some legacy point size and highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this screenshot you can see I am in Normal. I hit return and type Test (near the bottom of the screen shot and the point size shifted from 11 to 14 and the text is highlighted even though the line I started on was 11 and no highlight.<br />

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback. The new text you entered has a difference style from the other texts, this may be because the cell itself has another style. I'd suggest that you may select the whole cell and make all the background of the cell highlighted,
 then click the "Clear Formatting" button or select Normal style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if there is any update and let us further assist you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that doesn't clear it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure the style was set to Normal and then I used the clear tool on the text. It removed existing highlighting and bullets. I added back the highlighting and bullets I wanted. When I enter a new line I once again get a higher point size and highlighting
 (different from the line above). There is some format configuration that is stuck somewhere that is not visible that is getting applied with a new line.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I download anything from the store&#63;</h2>
                    I've been having this issue a couple days now on my Lumia 925 and it's getting really annoying as nothing would download, when I press "install" it says "pending" and eventually never loads! I have a very strong Wi-fi network and everything else is working
 perfectly apart from the store, does anyone else experience this lately? &amp; how can it be fixed?? I have tried on my mum's Lumia 820 &amp; the same issue came up must be from Microsoft. Any tips are welcome &amp; thanks! :)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the reasons why the right-to-left feature is disabled is because there is no input language in Windows and the the keyboard layout for the right-to-left language is not enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for you to be able to use the feature, please see Windows' requirements for working with text in right-to-left languages. Just click on this

</span></span></p>
<p><span>Entegy is correct, however, one workaround would be to change the title of the secondary number(s) from ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù to one of the other options such as
 ‚ÄúHome‚Äù or ‚ÄúWork‚Äù as those two will show up in addition to their primary number.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also create a secondary contact for that person, which will allow you to have both numbers listed as "Mobile" and then link the two.</span></p>
<p><span>Please let me know if this works out. Thanks for posting.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely, </span>

                    I have created a bunch of Building Blocks in the 5 Custom Galleries. I have those shortcuts on my Ribbon. I have them grouped into specific "categories" (my own organization differentiating the Building Blocks). I have a lot more Building Blocks I want
 to create.

                    <p>I can't find the ability to change the "Quick Click category" in Outlook 2016. &nbsp;I was previously able to create categories and then set one of them to be the "Quick click" category that was set by just left clicking in the category column of the mail view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quick click in 2016 was defaulted to one of the default categories (for me it was "Red Category"). &nbsp;I was able to get the behavior I wanted by simply editing that category and changing the name, however I shouldn't have to do that. &nbsp;I can't find the
 option to change the quick click category...It used to be in Right click context menu...where did it go??</p>

<p>It seems to be an IMAP problem, see here: https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-categories-flags-and-imap-accounts/</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The IMAP protocol doesn't support the Category and Flag properties on messages and assigned categories and flags are not synced back to the IMAP server. If you need to use categories, you need to use a POP3 account instead or move the messages to a local
 pst file. In place of flags (and their reminders), drag the message to Tasks (or Calendar) and set the reminder.</p>
<p>If using IMAP is a requirement, you can either move the mail to separate folders to separate it or use Automatic Formatting (Conditional formatting in Outlook 2010) to highlight messages meeting specific conditions. If you need reminders, drag the message
 to the Tasks folder and create a task with a reminder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just created a folder in my Outlook Data File - outside of the IMAP(Gmail) folder, and I can now use Quick Click Categories, it just means that I have to organise my incoming emails into their respective folders, not a great deal of effort, it's a shame
 IMAP doesn't support QCC's though, in this day and age...</p>

<h2>            Office 365 through College now has licensing problems.</h2>
                    I got Office 365 through my university years ago. I've never had a problem. All of a sudden I get this message: "there was a problem checking this device's license status. Please sign in with the Office 365 account this device was activated with." I tried
 to log into my old student account to see if there was a way of fixing it, but as I thought since I graduated and I'm no longer a student they shut down the email my Office 365 was linked to. I need Office 365 for work and I don't want to lose it. Is there
 anything that can be done to keep my office programs or do I just have to buy it?

            Hi Jessica, yes this happens all the time . . .
<br />
<br />The Office that your college provided will only last for your time at the college and some time after that, then it sill expire once you no longer connect to their server . .. 
<br />
<br />Backup your data to your own personal account if required
<br />
<br />You will need to uninstall that version completely form your system
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of a previous Office Installation:
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Then, you will need to sign up for your own personal subscription to Office 365 or purchase the Office 2016 full package

            So, what is going to happen? It hasn't limited my access to Office 365, yet. How much time do I have before it's gone? Also, since the programs are already installed on my laptop, surely I don't have to buy the entire Office 365 bundle, so how do&nbsp;I purchase
 just the license?

            Hi Jessica, if your files are on a jump drive - you will be fine . . .
<br />
<br />Just a thought, while jump drives are really handy, they can corrupt in a second, please always have a second copy of those files - just a bit of advice . . .
<br />
<br />You have to uninstall that version because it is associated with the University Office 365 account and if you retain that version, you will get activation issues
<br />
<br />The best option is to start again with your own personal copy . . .

            It depends when it was disabled - you'll typically have up to 30 days and several warnings before you are shut out.  It's possible that error message is just temporary - so give it a few days or until it drops you to read-only mode before you do anything. 
<br />
<br />You need to buy a license - you can get a key card in a retail store and redeem or signup online. For subscriptions: If you use a different email account to create the account, sign into office software with it and it will configure the software to match the license - no need to uninstall office.

<p>Ok. So I have a Microsoft&nbsp;account that is different from the old student account, so all I have to do is buy a new license online under the Microsoft account and it will automatically convert without any activation issues? Just want to make sure I understand
 completely. Would&nbsp;you mind outlining some steps? Or sending any links that could help?</p>

            After you buy it (you can wait until it says not activated and is in read-only mode), go to file, account in any office application (it's office account in outlook) - if you have an up-to-date version of office, click the Change license button. if you don't, click the Activate button and sign in with the Microsoft account address.

<p>This is a screen shot of the auto indent problem that I'm having. You will notice this line is indented because I started it with a hyphen.&nbsp; I want to still have the hyphen but with no indent, to turn off the auto indent. In Word I think it wold be something
 in Auto Correct but I can't find that option in this OneNote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't upload a screen shot, it says it has too many characters but below is something very similar to a screen shot.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we have checked the screenshot you're referring to. Please save the file to .PNG format and then click the picture icon when you upload the photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that when you put a hyphen in OneNote it is being prompted to a bullet form paragraph? As I have recreated the issue, that is what I have found out. The workaround I can recommend is to type a word first before hyphen to avoid auto indent
 using OneNote.</p>
<p>

    <title>Draft folder&#47;file download tracking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Draft folder&#47;file download tracking</h2>
                    Is there a way I can track a user on what attachments are uploaded and downloaded through drafts folder. For example, if an user saves some confidential files from his official (at work) desktop and later opens the official mailbox in his personal laptop
 at his home and downloads the saved files. Can this activity be tracked?

<p>
It gets stuck at "Checking your credentials" and seems to just keep cycling through it forever. How can it work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nicole,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume that you are using Microsoft Teams client. For further help, please check if you can see a status code (In the bottom left corner of the window). Generally, different status code has different troubleshooting action, you can check as below capture
 or this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Why-am-I-having-trouble-signing-in-to-Microsoft-Teams-a02f683b-61a3-4008-9447-ee60c5593b0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6610c30c-56c0-4a95-80c9-76f3b75d339b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6610c30c-56c0-4a95-80c9-76f3b75d339b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please try to sign in Microsoft Teams web version ( <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://teams.microsoft.com/</a> ) to deal with your activities as a workaround. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">If you also cannot sign in web version, please contact your admin to check if he/she turns on the Microsoft Teams in
<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Admin center</a>: (Settings &gt; Services &amp; add-ins &gt; Microsoft Teams &gt; Turn Microsoft Teams on or off for all users of the type)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can try to clear the Windows credential in the <strong>Credentials Manager</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit Microsoft Teams app</li><li>Open the Credentials Manager (Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager)</li><li>Select Windows Credentials</li><li>Under Generic Credentials, delete Microsoft teams related credentials (you will see them called msteams_adalsso/‚Ä¶ )
</li><li>Restart Microsoft Teams</li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the issue persists after tried above, please provide us information as below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Screenshot of ‚ÄúChecking your credentials‚Äù.</li><li>Have you enable <strong>modern authentication</strong> for your Office 365 account? You can contact your office 365 admin if you are not familiar with it.</li><li>May I know how many people have same issue in your organization?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>
