<h2>            Cannot Run Word As A Scheduled Task On Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word mail merge that I've been running for years as a Scheduled Task using Word 2003.&nbsp; With the upgrade to the Office 365 Word, however, I can still run it manually, but get this error when doing it from the scheduled task:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</strong><strong>{****3-2804545603-1466107430) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified
 using the Component Services administrative tool.</strong></p>
<p>I've set Permissions on the CLSID and APPID in the registry as noted in an online posting, and have tried to set permissions in Component Services, but neither of the IDs appears there, nor do the friendly names attached to those IDs in
 the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone has an idea!</p>

<p>Hi Art,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is about permission. You can post this TechNet to get help more efficiently:&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?category=windowsserver&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet
 | Windows server</a>. There is a dedicated category of Windows server and the exports there have more experience about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, can try run the task by clicking Run in the Task Scheduler see if the same error happens. Also, you can run the scripts in Command Prompt see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other forum members who have any suggestions, welcome to share your ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<h2>            office365 home - server busy try later-3 days now &#123;Solved&#125;</h2>
                    You can read below all the grief I had - I again removed program with MS Fixit (removes all traces in registry), re-loaded Office365 and had same problem - sorry server busy try again later. Made sure anti-virus was off (Windows Defender-comes with Win
 8). No joy. For some reason looked at installed programs and noticed one I never intentionally installed "browserguard".&nbsp; That was culprit as when removed Office 365 registered fine. Lesson in story I guess is do not give up - and I made it more complicated
 than necessary but it works. So if any help to others that is good.<br />
<br />
My saga-----<br />
<br />
I loaded office 365 on mac no problem as accessed account and activated. With PC running W8 refuses to activate and keep getting message "server busy try again later" Have already used fixit 2x to uninstall, removed cookies all recommended but still same problem.
 Says to activate before Oct 13th. If not fixed will cancel. (trial version for 5)<br />
Several views but no one seems to have experienced - solved<br />
<br />
I checked event log and see this error<br />
<br />
Office Subscription licensing exception: Error Code: 0x803D0010; CorrelationId: {DF706E44-3D6C-49E3-90C4-009E1EEC93CB}<br />
<br />
But Google did not yield a MS knowledge answer - I am stuck.<br />
<br />
As a followup - tried removing all windows updates starting KB276, as recommended by person that stated temporary fix. No Joy.<br />
<br />
I suspect, as had Office 2013 previously installed, corrupted lost activation key and did not have it, officee365 could still be looking at older registry key???<br />
<br />
So once again uninstalled using Fixit this time, reinstalled and still same message, Server busy try later.&nbsp; Getting headache and bit upset and no help from MS.<br />
<br />
Hope someone has solved this???<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having this same error on a machine but do not have the browserguard application installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 2013 install does not activation, we then re-open Word with "Run As Admin" and it activates fine. 1-2 weeks later Office tried to contact office 365 activation servers and then the application reverts back to unlicensed. We then have to do the
 same thing and re-activate by opening word as Administrator and it runs for another week or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the full event ID from the machine. The error can be seen every couple of days. After a few days it just gives up and the software shows unlicensed.</p>

    <title>determine loaded programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesdeckert  say:</h3>
<h2>            determine loaded programs</h2>
                    <p>Using VBA I'm trying to loop through and determine the programs which are currently loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for this is that I'm attempting to wait until a loaded program ends before I do something.</p>
<p>I found two different ways of checking for a specific loaded program.</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>Private Sub Command0_Click()<br />
Dim strTemp As String<br />
strTemp = "excel.application"<br />
If IsAppRunning(strTemp) Then<br />
MsgBox "pgm loaded"<br />
Else<br />
MsgBox "NOT loaded"<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>' Generalized Function to Check if an Instance of Application is running in the machine<br />
Function IsAppRunning(ByVal sAppName) As Boolean<br />
Dim oApp As Object<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
Set oApp = GetObject(, sAppName)<br />
If Not oApp Is Nothing Then<br />
Set oApp = Nothing<br />
IsAppRunning = True<br />
End If<br />
End Function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works when I look for MS programs, but the program which I want to look for is not found, so I'm thinking that I'm not naming it correctly. Thus the desire to loop through and determine which programs are loaded and I'll be able to use this method of
 determining if the program is loaded. Or if the Task Manager (or other pgm), displays the names of the loaded programs, then I wouldn't need to programmatically determine all loaded programs.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Private Sub Command0_Click()<br />
Dim strTemp As String<br />
strTemp = "msaccess.exe"<br />
If pgmLoaded(strTemp) Then<br />
MsgBox "pgm loaded"<br />
Else<br />
MsgBox "NOT loaded"<br />
End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>Function pgmLoaded(ByVal strApp) As Boolean<br />
Dim objWMIcimv2 As Object<br />
Dim objList As Object<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Set objWMIcimv2 = GetObject("winmgmts:" _<br />
&amp; "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\.\root\cimv2") 'Connect to CIMV2 Namespace<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Set objList = objWMIcimv2.ExecQuery _<br />
("select * from win32_process where name='" &amp; strApp &amp; "'") 'Find the process to terminate<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If objList.Count = 0 Then 'If 0 then process isn't running<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pgmLoaded = False<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pgmLoaded = True<br />
End If<br />
Set objWMIcimv2 = Nothing<br />
Set objList = Nothing</p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This method works for the program which I'm looking for, but it must be checking the processes in memory and not the programs. Unfortunately, the program I'm looking for leaves processes in memory after it closes, therefore making this method unworkable
 for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1 seems to be the method I want, but I can't figure out how to assign strTemp&nbsp;with the correct value for the program I'm looking for (National Instruments DIAdem)</p>

            <p>With option 2. if you search for the program's exe, this isn't reliable?&nbsp; If the exe remains after closing it, then this implies it is still running (even if it isn't visible on the screen).</p>

            When looking in the Task Manager, the program is gone, but in the process tab, the exe is still there and does not go away within a reasonable period of time. Currently on my computer there are 7 copies of the process running. It's not my program, and
 I don't know why it does this, I'm just trying to get around it.

            <p>I don't believe you will be able to.&nbsp; At one point MS Access could hang in this manner in the&nbsp;process list and if that was the cause then even the GetObject would return True (because it is technically still running - just not visible to the user)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have multiple instances of the same process (a new one each time you open/close the app) then the app is not closing properly, there is a flaw in it.&nbsp; You'd need (just throwing out ideas) some way to xref the process with the applications running
 to actually know if it was hung or actually in use?!</p>

<p>
</p><p>So to access my account, I am told I need to provide my phone number...there no other option.&nbsp; Maybe I don't have a mobile phone...it is presumptuous to think every account holder has a mobile phone.&nbsp; (Would it be too honest to suggest the real reason for
 suspending my email address is because you want my phone numbers...?)</p>

<h2>            Office 365 E3 - EOP - Exchange OnPrem Mailflow</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have the following situation:</p>
<p>All Users have Office 365 E3 Licences and the AD is synced to Office 365. &nbsp;The Mailbox Feature ist not used we just want to use the flexible Licensing feature and also EOP. Thats the Reasion we have an Exchange Server On Premise.</p>
<p>But now i have a Problem with the Mailflow...&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Users with there UPN / Primary Email Adresse are synced to Office 365. The MX Record point to Office 365 so every mail will go into an Exchange Online Mailbox because Exchange find the users Mailbox there a so there ist no possibility to create a Split
 SMTP scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can i handle to forward the Mail to my On Prem Exchange Server?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>skykitchen</p>

<p>Hi skykitchen,</p>
<p>Generally, we can set up connectors to route emails from cloud to on-premises Exchange&nbsp;as described below.</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2e93fd60-a5ef-4e64-8e62-2b862b2d1033%28v=exchg.150%29#Part2configmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up connectors to route mail between Office 365 and your own email servers</a><br />

<p>I understand you have set up directory sync and sync the users to Office 365. Meanwhile, I would like know some more details to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>1. The version of your Exchange server.<br />
2. Did you deploy Hybrid?<br />
3. Do you mean you have assigned the Exchange Online 2 licenses to the users so the users have online mailboxes in the cloud?<br />
4. Does the users also have mailboxes in the on-premises server?<br />
5. Could you let us know you requirement about your mail flow with your on-premises Exchange and Office 365?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. I think you have just answered my question =)</p>
<p>1.) Exchange 2016</p>
<p>2.) No Hybird is not necessary</p>
<p>3.) I think this is the point - i have just to deactivate Exchange Online Plan that an Email wont be send to this Mailbox</p>
<p>4.) They Should have Mailboxes only onPrem </p>
<p>5.) Mailflow requirement ist just using EOP. </p>
<p>I am right that i have just to deactivate the Exchange Online Plan that the email will be send to the onPremise Server?
</p>
<p>Connectors are working fine</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi skykitchen,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. I understand your mailboxes are all located on-premises and you want to protect your mail flow by EOP service. In this situation, it is suggested that you use the<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/exchange/microsoft-exchange-online-protection-email-filter-and-anti-spam-protection-email-security-email-spam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 EOP standalong licenses </a>for the on-premises mailboxes. Although, the EOP service is included in the E3 licenses, it is only used to protect the cloud mailboxes. You can refer to the following article for more instructions:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj723153%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj723153%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx</a>.&nbsp;Meanwhile, standalone&nbsp;EOP service&nbsp;is different from the packed EOP that belongs to Office 365 Business/Enterprise plans. I recommend you contact our specialized EOP support to get
 efficient support. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj723132(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Bug in Excel 365&#58; Not maintaining Date formats correctly once set.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone:</p>
<p>A quick check of the forums suggests this exact bug hasnt been posted...apologies if it has</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so I am using Excel 365 </p>
<p>Platform: Macbook Air. .</p>
<p>Country: UK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this bug affects both 'edit in broswer' and opening it on my computer..</p>
<p>This behaviour occurs in both Chrome &amp; Safari</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new worksheet - created in office 365, nothing added to the sheet except some ordinary text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No functions or other cross-referencs, macros etc. Very,very simple at this stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create a table using the 'Format as table' function.</p>
<p>One of those fields in my table will contain a date, so I type it in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bug : The country of the format changes&nbsp;</p>
<p>How it occurs:</p>
<p>I reset the date format using the right click - format ;- English (UK) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am forced to do this due to the default date being assumed to be american (which really ought to be fixed as well, guys) ....The date now appears in the right format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER, when I examine the formatting of the cell , I discover it is now set to Armenian ! ....or azerbyjani - or other countries ...but not the country I set it to, which was English (UK) ...</p>
<p>This seems to be because these countries share &nbsp;same layout &nbsp;as whatever I select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing this ? is there a workaround ?</p>
<p>This is a spreadsheet for business use, so I can't unfortunately have the date formatting remain as is.</p>

<p>Hi Hasan-Exchanger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if you are an admin? If so, you can check the retention policy in <a href="https://protection.office.com/#/retention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Security&amp;Compliance center</a> or using PowerShell. You can click the link and sign in with the admin account to view the retention policy. Besides, you can try the
<em>Get-RetentionPolicy</em> cmdlet to retrieve the settings for retention policies. You can refer the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-retention/get-retentionpolicy?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>&nbsp;for more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Please feel free to tell me if you still have any questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Hasan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you create a retention policy via Security &amp; compliance center, and choose the Office 365 groups as the location to use it, the retention policy then can be used<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"> in the group’s mailbox, site, and documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">You can check Carlos's reply to use powershell command. You also can use the steps below to check from a group site:</span></p>
<p>To check what and how many retention polies can be used in the Office 365 group, you can go to the group site, go to any one of the document libraries, library settings &gt; apply label to items in this list or library &gt; click the drop down arrow to see them.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65bd538f-2310-4fd5-890b-1ff23070f3e7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65bd538f-2310-4fd5-890b-1ff23070f3e7?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>In this way, you can check what retention policy can be used in this group. </p>

<p>Hi Carlos,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have nothing in retention of Compliance. But user saying that emails from group got deleted older than 60 days. That is why i was wondering if there is any attributes on Office365 group itself to check if it has any policy applied.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Setting the margins in booklet print format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting the margins in booklet print format</h2>
                    I am attempting to print a book I am writing and when I use the page set up I get everything like I want except I'm getting a 1 7/8 margin at top and bottom and no setting seems to change this. I'm using a lexmark x5270 printer and all settings on it seem
 to be ok. The upper and lower margins are my only problem and even when set them to 0 I get the same results.&nbsp; Settings I have used are Page set up--Margin top .5,&nbsp; &nbsp;Bottom .5,&nbsp; &nbsp;Left .7,&nbsp; &nbsp;Right .5,&nbsp; &nbsp;Gutter 0,&nbsp; &nbsp;Gutter position Left&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Portriat with
 mirrow images. Any suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using microsoft Word 2003.

            <p>If you were actually using the "Book fold" setting to print a booklet, then you would not be able to select portrait orientation (only landscape, with two portrait pages per sheet), and you would have Inside and Outside margins rather than Right and Left
 (this is true in any case when you have "Mirror margins" enabled, and in both cases the gutter position cannot be set, as it alternates).</p>
<p>I must therefore conclude that you are not using the "Book fold" setting. So what are you doing?</p>

                    When we set up our system our computers came with one drive personal. We did not realize there was a different app with 365 for once drive business. Have of our agency has stuff saved to one drive on their PC and half use one drive for business which came
 with our office 365 suite. We want to be able to share and collaborate, but cannot. I cannot get the computers that are already using one drive to recognize the one drive for business. Can you help?

It is ambiguous and unclear to me that the whole Microsoft Imagine Premium is allowed to use in commercial usage or not. If commercial research is not allowed, what about commercial business?</p>

<h3> shellfish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2003 database replication&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Access MVP's,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've inherited an MS-Access 2003 database that uses replication and not linking. I'm not familiar with&nbsp;replication and I've read somewhere that Ms-Access Replication is not one of Access's strong points. But I don't know enough about it to judge.
</p>
<p>My question is, based on your experience would you&nbsp;recommend that I&nbsp;rebuild the database&nbsp;use linking in the place of the replication or should I leave it alone and read up on replication, if so, can you point me in the direction of good documentation about
 MS-Access 2003 replication?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running Windows 7 with Access 2010 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards &amp; God Bless.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time and the help!</p>

            <p>SQL Server has replication features. They are different from Access but might be a possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access 2010 SharePoint lists are another alternative because of offline capabilities but I'm not sure they work the same way in A2013 and above. I would have to re-read some of Albert Kallal's replies.</p>

<p>Hi Chopwel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know whether “Microsoft Accounts Team” is a group name of your organization? If so, you want to send emails from “Microsoft Accounts Team”, you can contact your admin to change Group Delegation of “Microsoft Accounts Team” by assigning you the permission
 of “Send on Behalf”, so recipients will see sender is you not “Microsoft Accounts Team”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, you may check your account both on Outlook PC client and <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>, can you change the From address when you send an email? Please help to provide the screenshot of your Office 365 left hand pane, we’d like to offer our further help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

<h2>            Youtube videos occasionally go green</h2>

 8.1. I'm tired of constantly having to restart my laptop all the time, can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with your Windows 8.1 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some corrupt drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Do you get any error code or error message?</li><li>Do you face the same issue using any other website?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>Many websites use add-ons such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, or QuickTime to play video or audio files. Instead of using add-ons Internet Explorer streams media content using HTML5 and Adobe Flash on compatible
 sites</p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable hardware acceleration and use software rendering instead of hardware rendering to view the webpage, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and <strong>type inetcpl.cpl </strong>
and press enter.</li><li>Click the Advanced tab, and then browse to the <strong>Accelerated graphics section.</strong></li><li>Click to select the <strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering check box.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Apply, and then click OK. </strong></li><li>Close all open Internet Explorer windows, and then <strong>restart Internet Explorer.
</strong></li><li>View the webpage in Internet Explorer. </li></ol>
<p>To re-enable hardware acceleration, follow the steps listed above and uncheck the Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

            Bluetooth active sync uses comm ports and what I have is the comm port that the computer gives me to use is comm 10 or 11 so when I try to add the port to my smartphone (Pantech Dou&nbsp; C810) the phone tells me that the port cant be created and so I cant
 get the comm ports confiqured between the phone and Pooter.

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default browser is controlled by your operating system and not SharePoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the link below to change the default browser in Windows 10:</p>

<h2>            MIcrosoft Project Online Collaborating with Project Team Members Question</h2>
                    <p>Hello -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up a project with Microsoft Project Online, I have published the Project to PWA and am able to collaborate with another Project Manager on this project without issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, i have assigned a resource a task on the Project and given him PWA access to my project as a Team Member, and even tried giving him Admin access to PWA and both did not give him the access he needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He receives the email that he has access however he clicks on the link goes to the PWA site, clicks on the Project Details or Projects and he can not pull up the Project Plan I published.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might this be about licensing? Should I be able to give someone on the project (resource) or even a stakeholder access to the PWA internally in my organization and they be able to view the project based on the permissions i give them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, I have been going over and over this all day and not able to figure out how to get this set up so I can collaborate with team members on my project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Becky&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Becky,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting the thread on our forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What permission mode are you using, SharePoint Permission Mode or Project Permission Mode? From your description, it seems that you are using SharePoint Permission
 Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About “However, i have assigned a resource a task on the Project and given him PWA access to my project as a Team Member, and even tried giving him Admin access
 to PWA and both did not give him the access he needs.” and “He receives the email that he has access however he clicks on the link goes to the PWA site, clicks on the Project Details or Projects and he can not pull up the Project Plan I published.&nbsp;</span>“,
 could you upload some related screenshots for our reference? </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Excel doesn&#39;t open up spreadsheet exception code C0000374</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7 Enterprise with Office 2013 on Dell Latitude laptop: Excel hangs up when trying to open spreadsheets and give us an exception code C0000374. &nbsp;We end up having to reboot the PC and log back onto the PC again. &nbsp;This happens sporadically so
 I don't if a repair is needed or reinstall of Office 2013 or if some add-ons need to be disabled. &nbsp;Please advise.</p>

    <title>Why I can&#39;t join HomeGroup in Windows 10 Preview Build 10240&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pwforever  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why I can&#39;t join HomeGroup in Windows 10 Preview Build 10240&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried everything that I know to correct this issue! But the fact of the matter is I can't fix this without having an idstore.sst file that supports the HomeGroup features and services it cannot be restored to it's proper configurations. So can someone
 tell me how to turn-on HomeGroup without having the idstore.sst file in C:\Windows\Service Profiles\Local Service\AppData\Roaming\Peer Networking folder???? Will Win. 10 not have the idstore file in it or what do I do to correct this??? It is the idstore.sst
 file that when deleted and re-starting of the system that enables it to renew the idstore.sst file and re-stores connectivity and enabling to the p2p.svc, PRNP.svc, and the Peer Networking Grouping.svc that allows Home Group to run properly. At this point
 I cannot enable these services without the idstore.sst file. <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">All Solutions and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
</span></strong>Also this issue started after Preview Build 10130, because I was connected to the HomeGroup before then!!!!

            <p>It seems that nobody reads nothing but the title on these posts or haven't tried to understand that I have tried the simple procedures of troubleshooting!! When you run the Home Group join link and it fails, one of the options at this point is to use the
 troubleshooter and if you have read the whole post you would know that I have tried the procedure and more. I'm not knocking you for trying! I appreciate your efforts, but as you can see by the info I gave I'm way beyond that. what I really need is for someone
 to tell me how to either <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">correct</span> not having the idstore.sst file in my system or why it's not there. Also how to re-enable the p2psvc,PRNP.svc,and Peer Networking Grouping svc without the idstore file, in order
 to fix Home Group!!! The idstore belongs in the : "C:\Windows\Service Profiles\Local Services\AppData\Roaming\Peer Networking" folder. Once deleted! and system restarted: I can enable these services: p2psvc,PRNP.svc,and Peer Networking Grouping svc.
<p>It is the key to repairing HomeGroup and enabling those services!!!!! <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has no business going RTM with this item still broken. looking at the feedbacks and reporting the issue I have see one fix to this in the last several updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; it would be embarrassing to say the least to get multiple support calls on something
 that should of been fix prior to public release.&nbsp; You guys do know most homes have a home network with multiple computers/devices connected.&nbsp; People use homegroup for the ease of not having to go through a domain.&nbsp; I have two computers with Windows 10 Build
 10240 on them , and neither one will create nor connect to a homegroup.&nbsp; Same missing file in peer networking.

            Windows 10 still hasn't been released, so need to apologize at all I expect to see a few problems. This particular one though is going to be bad for your average consumer though who will expect this feature to work. Hopefully there will be a downloaded
 patch that will come when you run the install.

<h2>            Unable to Connect PC to Web with my E63</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to use my E63 to connect my PC to the web. It is a brand new phone with software as supplied. I start the Nokia PC Internet Access application and connect the E63 to the PC with a USB data cable and select the "Connect PC to web" option. On my
 PC the message "preparing your Nokia E63" is displayed, followed by "Currently there is no network available. Check your network availability....", and that is where it stays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the phone itself I can access the web using my provider's GPRS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I make a network available? I've read the user guide and think I've done everything - but I am a novice!</p>

            Is the phone set to the "general mode"? When you use "offline" it's not working. Check the modem settings in the network connections from the control panel on the PC. The dial in has to be something like *99#.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions. The phone is in 'general' mode, and the modem settings on the PC are set to phone number = *99#.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since posting my initial query I have installed the full PC Suite, and using that I can access the web on PC using the phone. However I would like to use the phone on a number of PCs abd don't want to install 250MB if PC Suite on all of them and am hoping
 to just install the 'Connect PC to web' on each machine.</p>

            In that case, you don't need PCSuite. Add a new modem in control panel-&gt; telephone and modem options. There is bluetooth support as well.

            If you are trying to use your phone as a modem, you must have either PC Suite or the phone as a modem on every PC that you want to connect to the internet. I hope you have a great data plan with your cell provider if you are doing this. Most people use
 their PC as the internet connection and the phone either connected via USB cable or via wi-fi to their wireless network.

<p>hello mate, i had the very same problem, assuming your friend has the e63 on '3' network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>only way around this i found was to install the full nokia ovi suite and use this rather than the connect pc to internet peice of **bleep**</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once installed, connect phone to computer via usb lead, and select pc suite mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once the phone is connected, go to the 'tools' tab on the ovi suite and select 'connect to internet'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this will take you to a connection wizard, just choose automatic, then select your network provider (in my case 3) from the list and then your done!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>happy mobile surfing :)</p>
