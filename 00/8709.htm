<h2>            Text and Line Numbers don&#39;t align</h2>
                    I have a legal document with line numbering.&nbsp; The line spacing for the text of the document is set to exactly match that of the line numbering.&nbsp; There is no problem on the first page; the text and line numbers align perfectly.&nbsp; But the trouble starts on
 page 2.&nbsp; Instead of aligning with the line numbers the first line starts a little less lthan halfway between line 1 and line 2 and the rest of the text does the same thing, each line about halfway betwseen the corresponding line numbers.&nbsp; All subsequent pages
 have the same problem.&nbsp; I had this problem about a year or two ago.&nbsp; Got a quick (and simple) answer and never ran into the problem again.&nbsp; Until now.&nbsp; But unfortunately I can't remember the answer!&nbsp; Can anybody help me?&nbsp; (I promise to add it to my personal
 Word compendium or guide!)

            <p>The template/document you are using has line numbering in a text box anchored to the header, so it is consistent for all pages. If your paragraph style has some Spacing Before or uses Multiple or Exactly line spacing, then there may be inconsistencies (Multiple
 line spacing adds the extra space below the line, Exactly above it, and Spacing Before is suppressed at the top of every page but the first). Or, if you have "Different first page" enabled, then it may be that the text box anchored to the primary Header is
 in a slightly different location from the one anchored to the First Page Header.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you instead&nbsp; use Word's built-in line numbering feature (accessed from the Layout tab of Page Setup).</p>

            <p>I do understand the exigencies of court requirements, and I understand that that's why legal types keep using the old Pleading Wizard and Pleading Template. I think Different First Page might at least help solve the problem you're seeing (by allowing you
 to move the text box).</p>
<p>As for my comments about Exactly line spacing, the issue is not that it adds space arbitrarily but that the space that
<strong>is</strong> added is above the line. You can see this very easily with a simple demonstration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create several paragraphs of single-spaced text (I use a large block of lorem ipsum text for this purpose).
</li><li>Select (or click in) one of the paragraphs and press Ctrl+2 to double-space it. This is "Multiple" spacing, and if you select the paragraph, you'll see that the selection block extends below the paragraph.
</li><li>In another paragraph, right-click and choose Paragraph and set the line spacing to Exactly 24 points (my preference also for "double" spacing). When you select this paragraph, you'll see that the extra spacing is above the paragraph.</li></ol>
<p>There's a (poorly worded) Compatibility Option&nbsp;that you can use to change #3: "Don't center 'exact line height' lines." This is misleading because such paragraphs aren't centered to begin with--that is, the extra space is
<strong>not</strong> evenly divided above and below the line--but if you enable the option, the space swaps to below the paragraph.</p>
<p>Since you're using Exactly line spacing, just be aware that, while&nbsp;Word suppresses&nbsp;Spacing Before at the top of a page, it does
<strong>not</strong> suppress&nbsp;the extra space created by Exactly line spacing, so you may want to enable the Compatibilty Option.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of this is going to guarantee that text aligns with the line numbers if you're introducing tables, single-spaced text, etc.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth issue with WP8 and UConnect</h2>
                    My Lumia 920 will not reliably connect to the UConnect bluetooth of my 2011 Jeep Wrangler. My iPhones and my Lumia 900 had no issues.
<div>Sometime it connects just fine. Most of the time I have to go into my Bluetooth Settings and click on the UConnect profile to get it to connect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea if this is a hardware issue (replace my phone) or OS (wait for update)?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            I thought this is a feature :) It will connect after 1-2minutes.. <br />
<br />
When connected to Uconnect, I cannot use speech-commands for the lumia as the microphone is linked the radio and the radio-mic is off. I want to use speech command to the lumia while in the car.. the best would be to press a button on my radio and use windows-commands..<br />

            <p>I had an initial issue with my 2010 Ford with built-in Microsoft SYNC. I suspect there is a software bug in the Windows 8 code base for the Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Best advice I can give is be patient and await the software update - pretty sure this is a PRIORITY for Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what worked for me on my Ford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Connect Bluetooth per manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Turn off car</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Start car</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Enjoy Bluetooth after a restart - works this way on my Ford anyways... Many others are complaining about worse issues. Will go try my G37 Infiniti to see what happens and report back later.</p>

            Same issues with the Lumina 920 and Uconnect on my Rubicon 2012.&nbsp; Sometimes it connects and sometimes it doesn't.&nbsp; Have to manually go into the settings to hit connect again for it to actively sync.&nbsp; I guess we wait for sw update????

honestly, yes, i will switch back to the 920 again :) <br />
the HTC is not a bad phone, you can use it better with one hand because it is smaller and not so shiny, glossy, slick. Also it is lighter (weight).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But on the other side, its the same price and the nokia offers more extras: the included navigation (ok, you can buy something similiar for 5USD), the better camera (yes, the HTC has indeed a worse camera, definitely ), the wireless charging (the HTC-USB-connection
 is .. so 2005) and the bigger display and bigger device feels just like more value.
<br />
<br />
You have 30 days to switch your device (35$ per switch). So you can switch to the HTC for 35USD and if you don't like it that much (like I do), switch back for another 35USD.<br />

            Thanks Philipp.&nbsp; I think I'm going to keep the Lumia for now and forget about the 8X.&nbsp; I have until Jan 5 to return ($35 restocking fee) so if the Samsung Ativ S finally comes out before then I may look at that but if not I'll keep my Nokia and just be
 happy!

            IN Control Panel go to Programs and Features. Look through the list of installed programs for your Office 365 bundle. right click on it and select repair.  
<br />
<br />Note: if you see more than one Office installation, you should uninstall one of them, then do an Office REPAIR of the remaining one.

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<h2>            E71 410.21.010 Problems&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having some problems with my new FW that I would like to share - and if you have some fixes, or the same issues, please let me hear about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Before, I have been using the nokia internet services support plug ins&nbsp;(2 of them - web services internet&nbsp;support package and nokia internet&nbsp;services support package)&nbsp;version 1.07. I updated from the previous version 1's because i read to do this on nokia's
 conversation application installation instructions. i noticed that going back to the version 1 is best since it allows me to now be able to send a voice message when i was never able to do this before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. my Jbaktaskman is always crashing now with the new FW.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>does anyone else have the same expriences or have found a solution to this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i really wish that there would be one FW that would just make everything else work great. NASA is letting go of some engineers. Nokia, pay whatever you need to to get a flawless FW package out there. Otherwise, i go to apple.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you just finished upgrading your firmware.&nbsp; I cannot comment on the 2 plugins, but have a suggestion as far as what to do once you upgraded your firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion the best thing to do before <strong>AND</strong> after upgrading the firmware is to do a 3 Finger reset to clear out the phone so it truely is at a default state (no this won't downgrade your firmware).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then once that is done you can restore your backups <strong>WITHOUT</strong> device settings as doing that typically messes things up again and causes more headaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have v400 and jbtaskman is behaving just fine for me.</p>

<p>and what is the three finger test please? i have completed everything now, but this sounds like something I need to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have found the problem with JBTM. I set the time settings in ms very low so there was no difference in a short or long press. but, whenever i add an application to the launch menu, it crashes. i have added all i need to add now, so i should not experience
 any more crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after i installed the new fw, i *#7370#'d it, and then installed my apps. I have noticed before that when i reinstall the settings, that it does in fact make things worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please let me know about the 3 finger test. thank you very much for your words.</p>

<p>Doing this <strong>WILL WIPE YOUR PHONE CLEAN!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you have a current backup of everything, don't bother backing up device settings as those always cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off your phone, hold all the following buttons down while pressing the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 (number button), * (U key next to 3),&nbsp; and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for that. I just want to make sure about something, and that is do i hold down the three buttons before turning off the phone (and keeping then pressed while I turn on the phone and it reboots)? Thank you again for your help.</p>

<p>I have tried your 3 button move on a derelict E71-1 that I bricked when I took the USB cable out in the middle of a reinstall. Now it works! I am very happy about that. Thank you very much for your advice. Have a great day.</p>

<p>Hi there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a E71-2 and just 'upgraded' to 410.21.010 firmware.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Bluetooth connection in my car (BMW3 series) continuously resets.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prior revision of firmware did not have this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea as to how I can get
 the new revision of firmware to work OR how I can revert to an older revision?</p>

<p>It's amazing to see how such problems can come up if there were no changes to this function. I seem to remember reading somewhere that they did some work on the WiFi and wireless connections. So, they may have done some work on it. They may have changed
 or upgraded the BT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you done all the resets, save formatting your phone again? I would try clearning everything off the phone with the 3 button reset, install the FW 410.* again, again do the 3 button reset and then try the BT in your car before you do any other installations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>another simple thing could be about the password between the two BT sets. Did you initialize the one in your car, or it does not need that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck, let us know what the problem is.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Cannot activate school account</h2>
                    <p>Hi There!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop, and downloaded the Office 365 free trial. Once that was almost up, I found out that as a university student I could get Office 365 using my student email. I went through the whole process of registering, and I now have the account.
 Here is my problem: My free trial expired and now whenever I open any Office application like Word or Powerpoint, it gives me a notice asking if I want to buy, enter a product key, or sign in. I obviously do not want to buy it and I do not have a product key
 that I am aware of. So I've been trying to sign in and it keeps on giving me an error. Please help as I need this for my schoolwork and it will really mess everything up if I cannot access it.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi HeatherBHS,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To narrow down the issue, could you provide and confirm the following?</span></span></p>
<span><span>1. Where and how do you sign up for the free Office 365 Education plan? Do you make your student email as the work and school account?</span></span><span><span><br />
2. For troubleshooting, we need to collect some information from your side. You can provide it with us via
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list</span></a>.</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Generally, a free Office 365 plan will last 30 days. After 30 days, you need to buy it for you to continue using Office applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<div>Possible explanations... but no "solution". It's possible that what you are </div>
<div>seeing in the morning is due to an "overloaded" server ... everyone checking</div>
<div>their mail at the beginning of the day... just a guess mind you...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regarding the delay opening/loading Word... If you copy the email attachment</div>
<div>off to your Desktop (for example) without opening Word, and then </div>
<div>double-click the Desktop copy of the attachment, does it still take ~20 </div>
<div>seconds to open and load the document? If this happens independently of </div>
<div>email, then it is an artifact of the software/hardware combo you have.</div>

            There are 1000's of online stores that sell music all over the world. You can find them by searching for them.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you will be able to find a store that lets you purchase english language music in kuwait.<br />
<br />
Try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=music+downloads&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> to get you started.<br />

            I thought so.<br />
<br />
Commercial music isn't free. You have to pay for it if you want it.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are lots of sites where you can <b>ILLEGALLY</b> obtain commercial music but thats for you to find.<br />
<br />
This site isn't here to aid people in theft.<br />
<br />
So if you want to steal music then go ahead, just don't expect any help in doing so.

            Use the link I posted previously on this thread to find music stores. The prices will be on those websites.<br />
<br />
If you are new to downloading music then you can search google for help.<br />
<br />
Once you have your music if you have any problems transferring it to the phone then feel free to ask for help.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the SharePoint libraries on the user’s computer are not syncing, it is an expected behavior that there is no SharePoint symbol on the synced folders. The previous sync client and the new
 sync client are two different sync clients. The factor that her computer is up to date does not indicate she is using the new sync client. She has to manually set it up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to the article below to install the client and let me know whether it works.</span></p>

<p>Snooze problem happened on my N82 after the update to 31.0.016. Works fine on previous version of firmware. When the alarm starts to make a sound and I press snooze the alarm doesn't come on after 5 minutes. However, Later if I turn the phone on the snooze
 alarm immediately starts.<br />
I tried to set alarm in next 5 minutes than turn off phone. After 5 minutes alarm come on, then I press snooze and after next 5 minutes alarm come on again and works fine. Please solve this snooze problem soon as you can. What about change log for&nbsp;31.0.016

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the latest FW release the N95 8GB is also affect by the snooze bug. After you press snooze, it really snoozes - until you switch on the phone and so kindly remind it that it still is in snooze mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to&nbsp;HOPE that Nokia will fix it! I want to make sure that Nokia knows about the bug, confirms it as a bug and confirms&nbsp;that it will be fixed in the upcoming FW release!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure Nokia knows and report your problem via&nbsp;Email under "Contact us".</p>
<p>Greetings.&nbsp;</p>

            I also discoverd that my alarm this morning and few days before did not start anyway. I was deleted old alarm and created new one, but it's after few days it's happend again. Of course all two times the phone was off. There are a big problem with alarm
 and snooze function. Is anybody knows about next releases of new firmware?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a very similar problem with the latest (i.e 31.0.019) firmware.</p>
<p>I'm not using a snooze feature but have two separate alarms set 10 minutes one after another.</p>
<p>And like in a snooze case the second one never goes on if keep the phone switched off.</p>
<p>Another issue I noticed is that a date set in the phone may jump several day ahead when switching it off and on.</p>
<p>So I guess the workaround for both issues is just to the phone always on until they are fixed someday</p>
<p>in some of forthcoming firmware updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I installed the new firmware v35 on my N82 and tested the alarm function overnight. I set the alarm before midnight and switched the phone off. Snoozed the alarm two times the next morning and then immediately switched on the phone. Finally everything
 seems to be working as it should.

                    <p>I've loaded up Winamp, and it won't play a song. I then opened the Groove Music player that came with windows 10, it showed every single one of my albums, but said it was unable to play them (yet they are all .mp3 or .wav, etc; common file types that have
 ALWAYS worked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running out of ideas and patience, and I'm about to just go to Linux and be done with Windows. Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Also, it plays the windows sounds just fine (like when I connect a USB device, I hear the ding it makes. It is strictly only my audio and video files that it will not play sound on, yet nothing seems to be the issue other than "unable to play file

            No, you won't lose any data files as you uninstall Office 2010. After the uninstallation, you may have to repair the Office 365 installation though.

<h2>            OneDriveDF Mac Preview - Gets stuck &#34;Processing Files&#34; when activating OneDrive for Business sync client</h2>
                    
<p>I downloadad the new&nbsp;OneDriveDF Mac Preview sync client and installed it on an El Capitan environment. I followed the instructions included in the documentation in order to activate it. The consumer client activates fine, but when I activate the business
 client from within the preferences section of the consumer client, and the new OneDrive for Business destination folder is created, the new business sync client behaves in one of the following ways (I have attempted to install and remove several times):</p>
<p>1. If I select a new empty destination folder, it indicates that the client is up to date, and right-clicking on the cloud icon in order to reach preferences doesn't work, as the drop down menu doesn't appear. It only says that it's up to date and is greyed
 out. The destination folder, however, is not syncing, as it is not downloading the folders already created in Office 365 Onedrive Business (online).</p>
<p>2. Then, after step 1 above, if I cut and paste the old OneDrive for Business folders which were contained in my old mac OneDrive Business destination folder (which, contrary to the consumer version, cannot be selected when choosing the destination folder
 as the business client insists on creating a new folder, which in turn doesn't make any sense), then the sync client drop down menu appears, and indicates that it is "Processing files", but it doesn't seem to be uploading or downloading anything. It just gets
 stuck in that message. Then, if I open Preferences and try to choose folders, that menu is grayed out.</p>
<p>3. I then proceed to force quit the sync client through the activity monitor, as for some reason if I tried to right click on the cloud icon and quit, it gets stuck and won't quit. I try creating the account again from the consumer client, and this time
 it lets me choose the new destination folder created in step 1, which as explained above now contains my copied old mac Onedrive Business folders, with a message that the folders contained therein will merge with the Office 365 OneDrive Business content. This
 time, I can access the preferences menu and choose which folders from Office 365 OneDrive Business will sync, but again the status is "Processing files" and it appears not to be syncing.</p>
<p>I'm at my wit's end. Any advice to get the sync client to communicate between my newly created mac OneDrive Business folder and the Office 365 OneDrive Business content?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi JLD,</p>
<p>Based on the description, I understand that you changed OneDrive for Business destination folder with the old synced folders/files copied to the new one and now the sync process stuck at "processing files".</p>
<p>To narrow down this issue, I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. To identify if this is related to your account, if possible, could you try to add a new Office 365 account and see if the sync works? Or, you may try your account in another Mac computer and see the outcome.<br />
2. Have you followed the "OneDrive for Business Mac Configuration Guide" to uninstall OneDrive for Business preview and OneDrive? You may refer to the thread below to uninstall them if you haven't:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/418761
<br />
3. Please share a screenshot about the whole OneDrive for Business drop down menu indicating "Processing files".
<br />
Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for your prompt response. I removed all instances of OneDrive as suggested in the link you provided and installed OneDriveDF again as instructed in the instructions.</p>
<p>I created the OneDrive consumer account, and the consumer sync client almost instantly began to download the files and folders from the OneDrive online account to the new destination folder created in ~/OneDrive.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to click preferences and added my Office 365 account as a business account. The sync client icon appeared and, then clicked, indicated that the account was synced and was grayed out, but no files or folders were being synced
 into the new destination folder created in ˜/OneDrive - (Busines name). I proceeded to restart the computer, and the sync client icon appeared with the wave icon indicating that it was syncing. After clicking on it, the menu with preferences appeared with
 a message that it was "Processing Files". However, the new destination folder is blank, with no files or folders appearing to be downloading from the Office 365 Small Premium Business Account. I clicked on Preferences and it gives you the option of syncing
 all folders or select folders. I observed that all folders was selected, returned to the new destination folder, and it still remains blank with no folders or files being downloaded. I am attaching a screenshot for your review.</p>
<p>I do not have another mac or another business account at the moment, so I cannot replicate this on another machine or with another account. All comments are welcome, thank you for your time and attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Hi JLD,</p>
<p>I have consulted our senior engineer about this issue, currently we need to narrow down whether this is a client or account issue:<br />
1. I have sent you a test Office 365 account in private message. Please go to private message via the link below and try to add it to your local computer, let us know if the same issue occurs.<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations
<br />
2. Some users report that this issue may occur if there are OneNote Notebooks residing in their OneDrive for Business library, please confirm whether your OneDrive for Business library have such files or some special files which maybe not supported. If yes,
 make a backup of them and delete them, see if it works.</p>
<p>If this issue is related to the client side, we can try completely uninstall the OneDriveDF client:<br />
1. Unlink OneDrive by click OneDrive icon, choose 'Preferences', then 'About', click 'Unlink'.<br />
2. Remove the app by following these steps:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Open the Applications folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Drag the blue OneDrive cloud to the trash.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Enter your MAC credentials.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Click OK.<br />
3. Remove the additional OneDrive files.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Press Apple(COMMAND) +shift+G in finder, or use Terminal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Go to /Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Containers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Find the 2 folders - com.microsoft.onedrive-mac and com.microsoft.onedrivedf-mac.findersyncDF.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Drag them to the trash.<br />
&nbsp;4. Remove the locally stored Onedrive folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you installed with the defaults, there will be the Onedrive folder under your name. Drag it to the trash.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>Hi. Again, thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I tried adding your test account as suggested, and it worked perfectly. All files synced and were added immediately.</p>
<p>I had some OneNote information in my Office 365 OneDrive for Business folders (online), as well as the OneDrive consumer account online, and deleted them. I closed the OneDrive Business sync client via force quit and restarted it. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>I unlinked the OneDrive Business account through the preferences menu in the OneDrive Business sync client, then added it again through the OneDrive consumer client, created the destination folder. No syncing.</p>
<p>I deleted OneDriveDF, including all related files and folders in the various folders listed in your document instructing how to completely uninstall (and I mean EVERYTHING). I entered the suggested commands through the terminal in order to enable
 linking of business account, then reinstalled OneDriveDF, created consumer account, which began syncing immediately. I then clicked on OneDrive consumer sync icon, clicked on preferences, then added my Office365 business account. As has happened before, when
 clicking the OneDrive Business sync icon, the message&nbsp;"OneDrive Is Up To Date" appears, grayed out, without the menu that includes preferences (see attached photo). No files are being synced to the newly created OneDrive - (business name) folder.</p>
<p>So, after repeating all of these processes numerous times, one of two things always ends up happening. Either (1) the message&nbsp;"OneDrive Is Up To Date" appears, grayed out, without the menu that includes preferences, and nothing is synced, or
 (2) the menu appears with preferences and option to select folders to be synced, but nothing gets synced. Also, I can never close the OneDrive business sync client normally, and must always force quite through activity monitor.</p>
<p>Any additional suggestions? Again, I appreciate all your help. If you don't have any, I'll just wait until you release a final version which resolves my issues.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-JLD</p>

<p>Hi Chee and other MSFT Support participants. Were you able to retrieve the logs? I followed your instructions a while back regarding sending a "Report a Problem" message from the OneDriveDF Mac sync client preview, but have not taken any other steps. Do
 you need anything further from me to held you retrieve the logs, or any other information?</p>
<p>Also, if you could let me know whether this problem is isolated, or if others are also having it. Just want to have an idea of whether it's a common issue or not.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>-JLD</p>

<h2>            Activesync Guest Partnership</h2>
                    
<p>I am developing code to work on PocketPC2003 devices for an internal application. Whenever I dock the device into it's cradle, ActiveSync always popups with the "New Partnership" dialog, how can I default this so
 that it will always do a "Guest partnership" and not popup the "New Partnership" dialog? Thanks</p>

<p>As we prepare for the public release of Windows 10, the Preview Pre Release product keys will no longer activate Windows 10 anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Enterprise editions starting with build 10240 - you'll need to activate with your organization's activation keys (KMS or MAK).

            I never did solve it. I just wiped the box, installed 8.1 pro, then did the win 10 pro upgrade. Once all that was done, I set it for insider updates. Its a test box. Once everything was back on , I made a image of the drive and saved it to a second hard
 drive

    <title>Office 365 Group Calendar Appointment Reminder Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adminshaun russell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Group Calendar Appointment Reminder Issue</h2>
                    
<p>After creating an Office 365 Group, so that all members can have recurring appointments appear on their personal calendars, we have noticed that the reminder value of the group appointment is not correct.</p>
<p>Setting the reminder to 1 week in the group calendar item sets the reminder value to 0.7 days in the member calendar. Setting the reminder to 2 weeks in the group calendar item sets the reminder to 1.4 days in the members calendar.</p>
<p>This is irrespective of how the meeting is created either using Outlook 2016 or OWA</p>

<p>Can anyone offer advice</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>hi s russell,</p>
<p>i have done some tests from my side but cannot reproduce the same issue. as a result, i’d like to collect the following information for investigation:</p>
<p>1. does the issue occur to all group members who accepted the event invitation from the group calendar?<br />
2. how did the affected users check the event details, via outlook 2016 or owa? or does the issue occur when checking the event details via both outlook 2016 and owa?<br />
3. two screenshots of the symptom(one with the event details in the group calendar, the other with the event details in the personal calendar). to upload a picture, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click the <strong>
insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/503473b9-49e4-45d9-8a3b-9cd2c43c9447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/503473b9-49e4-45d9-8a3b-9cd2c43c9447" /></a></p>
<p><br />
4. do some tests with your own calendars other than the group calendars and see if the feature works fine for your personal calendars.<br />
5. if you create a new test group and do some tests, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
aaron</p>

<p>hi aaron,</p>
<p>thank you for getting back to me so quickly. the testing i have performed is as follows:</p>
<p>open office 2016 &gt; open the group and select calendar<br />
create an appointment with the following criteria: <span>
<br />
</span>reminder set to 1 week, recurrence set as 3 years and 3 occurrences:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4dd4ff1-e974-4e23-8ad3-a85843ff254f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4dd4ff1-e974-4e23-8ad3-a85843ff254f" /></a></p>
<p>the appointment in my calendar shows as:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07f97562-9f93-4d46-a398-b8ef4643542b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07f97562-9f93-4d46-a398-b8ef4643542b" /></a></p>
<p>the same appointment in owa shows as follows:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f624101-7f44-47ae-beae-8edb69deffb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f624101-7f44-47ae-beae-8edb69deffb8" /></a></p>
<p>as you can see the reminders are very different</p>
<p>we need a reminder for 2 months and a recurrence of 3 years for operational requirements for this set of appointments. however this functionality is not available in owa when creating appointments as the drop down lists a maximum of 2 weeks and a yearly
 recurrence. as a further test an appointment was created in owa in the group calendar and in outlook 2016 it&nbsp;does reflect the options that were set for that appointment:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fc2f4a4-721b-492e-85b9-d086a80ec6b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fc2f4a4-721b-492e-85b9-d086a80ec6b9" /></a></p>
<p>any advise or info would be highly appreciated</p>
<p>regards</p>

<p>Hi Shaun,</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the detailed information.<br />
I have also done some tests from my side but cannot reproduce the issue.<br />
As a result, I'd like to collect the following information for investigation:<br />
1. Does the issue occur to all group members who accepted the event invitation from the group calendar?<br />
2. Do some tests for normal meeting requests(using personal calendar) to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Regarding “ this functionality is not available in OWA when creating appointments as the drop down lists a maximum of 2 weeks and a yearly recurrence.”,<br />
could you submit feedback via&nbsp; <span>

<p>hi peter,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>does the issue occur to all group members who accepted the event invitation from the group calendar?
<ol>
<li>yes the issue occurs for all members </li></ol>
</li><li>do some tests for normal meeting requests (using personal calendar) to see if the issue persists.
<ol>
<li>the issue persists selecting the standard 2 week reminder generates a 1.4 day reminder in all members calendar appointment
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>the second test was as follows:</p>
<p>open office 2016 &gt; open the group and select calendar<br />
create an appointment with the following criteria:<br />
recurrence set as 3 years with 3 occurrences<br />
reminder set as 8 weeks<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58a5d1aa-3ff4-4b28-bec6-3da81fbafa8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58a5d1aa-3ff4-4b28-bec6-3da81fbafa8c" /></a></p>
<p>looking at the appointment in my calendar i see this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0422a09a-45e3-4098-8495-f4d46b6b53ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0422a09a-45e3-4098-8495-f4d46b6b53ce" /></a></p>
<p>the view from another members calendar who is using outlook 2013 is this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b740583f-4e71-441e-a93c-b675d4a1484b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b740583f-4e71-441e-a93c-b675d4a1484b" /></a></p>
<p>the view of the appointment in the shared calendar is this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce6c1783-025e-491d-9645-54d2d582712e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce6c1783-025e-491d-9645-54d2d582712e" /></a></p>
<p>and a view from my mobile device is this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81dce4aa-b445-4a49-9536-101d2807509c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81dce4aa-b445-4a49-9536-101d2807509c" /></a></p>
<p>in all cases the reminder is wrong as you can see. it appears that when creating the calendar appointment in outlook 2016&nbsp;the reminder is 10% of what it should be. for example setting a reminder for 8 weeks in outlook creates a reminder of 5.6 days when
 in reality it should be 56 days &amp; creating a reminder in the shared calendar in outlook 2016 for 2 weeks generates a reminder of 1.4 days when it should be 14 days...</p>
<p>why is the appointment converting the reminder to days and not preserving the selection of "weeks" and also why is it 10% of what it should be?</p>
<p>creating the calendar items directly in the group calendar from owa using the drop down reminders is fine that works however the reminder options are not granular enough for us to use this option</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>
<p>regards</p>

<h2>            Calculating time in decimals &#40;with half-hour calculation&#41;</h2>
                    Here is the first line in my worksheet:
<table>
</table>
<div><br />
9/19/2012<span> </span>2:00 PM<span>
</span>6:00 PM<span> </span>=(INT((C2-B2)*24))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I use even hours the answer comes up correctly (4 in the above line), but when I need to use half hours:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>9/21/2012</td>
<td>12:15 PM</td>
<td>5:45 PM</td>
<td><span>=(INT((C4-B4)*24))&nbsp;</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
the decimal only show 5. &nbsp;I need it to say 5.5. &nbsp;Am I using the wrong formula and if so what is the correct formula. &nbsp;Thanks for any help I can get.</div>
                </div>

            <p>OssieMac, for my formula, I used date and time in both cells - same date in both.&nbsp; So that's effectively just the time.</p>
<p>I agree with other possibilities you propose and potential for needing to format the cell to get the desired number of decimal places displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be that the reason he originally had INT() function is that the formula was adapted from one similar to yours that is getting rid of the date portion of the 1st date.</p>

<p>I am not sure if the example data represents a date and time in the one cell B2 and B4 or if a time only and the date is in a separate cell in column A.</p>
<p>If time only then answer by JLLatham. However, you might need to format the cell with the formula to a number with one decimal place.</p>
<p>If cell B4 is a combined date and time then the following.</p>
<p>=(C4-(B4-INT(B4)))*24</p>
<p>Again you might need to format the&nbsp;cell with the formula to a number with one decimal place.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
<div>B4-INT(B4) is MOD(B4,1), but if the OP wants to cut to half an hour, maybe</div>
<div>=INT((C4-B4)*48)/2</div>
<div>assuming that both time values contain the day (otherwise write MOD(B4,1) instead of B4).</div>
<div><br />
