<h2>            word carry over to another field</h2>
                    I've created a custom ticket page. I'd like to insert the name of the artist once you have it show up all 10 times per page. using word 2007. I used legacy and fields. I can go to the individual spots on the page and &nbsp;REF and choose artist and that the
 pops up with that kind of defeats the purpose.&nbsp;

    <title>Am I supposed to hold the phone against my ear&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefanmonov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Am I supposed to hold the phone against my ear&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I make a normal phone call and put the phone against my ear, the screen goes black and stops reacting to touches. This is good because it prevents my ear randomly tapping stuff on the screen.<br />
<br />
However, this does not happen in Skype calls - no matter whether the "Audio" option (in the call screen) is enabled or disabled. I've noticed that when "Audio" is off, this doesn't actually mean "no sound at all" - it means "hear the other person at a volume
 suitable for holding the phone at your ear". How am I supposed to use "Audio off" when my ear taps random stuff on the screen though? The reason I want "Audio" off is because I'm more used to holding the phone at my ear, and also to save battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that when I tried it, I initially had both the Video &amp; Audio options on, and only then turned them off and tried again (within the same call). This may have something to do with it.</p>

<p><span>Good Day! </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for that information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be advised that if you are using unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages, or could stop working completely.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning July 1, 2017, Skype users on some platforms will no longer be able to sign in to Skype or can’t use the application anymore.</span></p>

Hi Kai,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do the workaround:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on the message you wish to associate with an appointment/event.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Holding down the left mouse button, drag the message to Calendar (icon) in the lower left-hand corner of the email client. &nbsp;Once you have the mouse hovered over Calendar (icon), release the left mouse button.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; This will open up the Appointment window. &nbsp;You can now customize the date, time, and location of the event. &nbsp;When finished, click Save &amp; Close in the upper left-hand corner of the window.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: Any attachments from the email message will not transfer over to the appointment. You will need to re-attach them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The appointment will now appear on your calendar during the date and time which you specified.<br />
<br />
Thanks,
</p><p />

                    <br />
<b>Hi , <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me please I accidentally put in an old password a few times last week to access my hotmail and forgot I had changed it so&nbsp; now I am being asked for a code and the email address in the box above is not mine ? I do not understand as Microsoft
 has all my details , I looked at my Microsoft account details online and all the details are clearly there to see ? ...including my correct email address etc&nbsp; ?<br />
<br />
And for over two weeks now I cannot get into my files as the "insert/attach " button will not allow me , a box keeps coming up saying
<br />
" We`re still setting up , please try later " I have noticed the same problem on a lot of people`s blogs.....why this is ?<br />
<br />
I realise that there has been some problems recently as I have read a lot of blogs on this and your answers to them and I can appreciate that things break down occasionally which can cause absolute mayhem for large companies.<br />
<br />
Apparently I was given seven days which ends tomorrow to enter a code which I cannot remember to an email address that is not mine so you can appreciate that I am stuck now ! I have not got another alternate email address for you to send the code to but I gather
 you can send me another code via my mobile ?...is this correct ?<br />
<br />
I can understand that things go wrong sometimes but could you please sort this out for me ? I phoned one of the support team in reading in the u.k and she very kindly told me to post my issues here ...I do not even know if I will access to my mail tomorrow
 ? if I cannot is there a freefone number I can call because it cost me a fortune to phone Microsoft a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
Kind.regards.<br />
<br />
Angela.&nbsp; </b><br />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bernd is correct, OneNote for Windows 10 does not offer the option to save a local notebook. If you wish to save a local notebook, then you're welcome to use OneNote 2016. However, we still suggest saving your notebook to the cloud.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, you still can use the notebook locally without internet connection (it will keep a cache), then sync it to OneDrive/OneDrive for Business when you are connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it is in the cloud, you can access it anywhere using OneNote Online as well, which might be useful in some situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will also prevent data loss if something happens to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>
        </p>

<h2>            MS Planner - Daily Tasks And Reporting</h2>
                    <p>We are going to start using MS Planner on an optional basis to track our daily tasks so we can then report to our reporting chain on the general things we did that month. &nbsp;I'm looking for a way to say "Show me everything I completed this month" or maybe
 "Show everything I worked on this month" and show somebody. &nbsp;It would be great to be able to export these things to Excel just for a container. &nbsp;Or maybe some other way that MS Planner has that I'm not seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, we are looking for this to be a task tracker, with end of month reporting capabilities. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

</p><p>That seems to be bizarre. Skype will not charge you for any call that will not connect. But since this is not your case, I suggest you contact our live chat support. I will send you a private message with the steps on how to get in to connect with a live
 chat representative.</p>

    <title>Best option for an anonymous suggestion box&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Best option for an anonymous suggestion box&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Anybody have a good idea on how to implement an anonymous suggestion box within Yammer? This is preferred, but anything our users can get to would be nice. Looking for something a user can click on and submit a question or comment
 anonymously and then have it directed to the appropriate person(s) for answering or overview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is a great idea. Unfortunately this is not yet available in Yammer.&nbsp;Yammer is a young service newly acquired by Microsoft and Thus, I highly encourage you to add your voice to the cause by submitting your feedback at

<p>Hi sytheman_asurion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the office 365 Rooms ( Room mailbox), first I want to share with you that as far as I know, there is no such option called “ allow whoever books first gets accepted while the next booked users should be denied in this case” related to Office 365 Room
 Mailboxes.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the office 365 room mailboxes have three different options for book requests like 1. “ Allow repeating meetings” 2. “ Allow scheduling only during working hours” 3. “ Always decline if the end date is beyond the limits”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For your reference </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13f426d0-77e5-4f35-a707-2be3c5733800?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13f426d0-77e5-4f35-a707-2be3c5733800?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if you want the second user’s booking request got declined, as an admin you can try to
<strong>uncheck the option “ Allow repeating meetings”</strong> in the Exchange Admin Center &gt; Recipients &gt; Recourse &gt; Rooms &gt; booking options and then save your changes there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By the way, for this option it only takes effect when the users have time conflicts when booking rooms. For example the user A booked room1 at 3/20 10:30 am~ 11:00 am at first, and then if the user B booked the same room at 3/20 10:00am~ 12:30pm, in
 this case, the user B’s booking request will be declined as his booking time is conflict with A’s booking time, thanks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So please double check your two users booking time on your own side, thanks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For more information, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create and manage room mailboxes</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another hand, may I know where your two users booked the same room in the outlook calendar<span>，</span><span>
</span>Outlook Client or Outlook Web App ( <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>)<span>？</span><span> </span>If they are using Outlook Client, you can suggest them to use the Outlook Web App to create other test booking meetings and then see if it can make any difference, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the suggestions above don’t work, I’d like to collect some more information for the further investigation:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Please take a screenshot about the room booking options to me
<span>（</span><span> </span>EAC<span>）</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>May I know if both users received the email that indicated their booking request was accepted?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If so, please take some screenshots about both users booking details ( like the room, start and end time etc.) to me, thanks.</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>May I know if your admin set up any delegates for this room ( room mailbox)?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If they approved the second booking request wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

    <title>Autopopulate from Drop Down list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r. m. h.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autopopulate from Drop Down list</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to autofill the cells after having typed the first letter?</p>
<p>and I explain myself a bit so everyone gets the context...</p>
<p>Part of my job (I'm a chef) is to have all the recipes on "spec sheets" indicating ingredients, weights, prices, etc.</p>
<p>Every new menu means hours and hours of office work connecting price lists with recipe books, inventory, etc, (been doing it "manually"/cell by cell for years/recently learnt about the &nbsp;"vlookup" HUGE HELP!/THAAANKS MS!!)</p>
<p>Now the problem is that the ingredients list can be EXTREMELY large sometimes and that some of my chefs has their "own language" or just can't spell the word correctly so every time they skip even if its just one single letter, the whole cost ends up pretty
 f... up as excel won't recognise the ingredient and therefore won't connect with the price cell</p>
<p>So, what I would need is... excel to recognise an ingredient from a list (price list/different book) after having typed the first letter (this way I would solve both problems: the chefs would see the word on the list and just would need to click on it (and
 wouldn't use their own, sometimes pretty creative, names); and wouldn't have to scroll all the way through our extensive ingredients list (talking about drop down list here obv.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that even possible?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi R.M.H,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/apply-data-validation-to-cells-b149da65-5cfd-4b93-a64a-c08f46e463e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the column has already included a value, Excel will use autofill feature to suggest user the value when they type the first word. For example, If there’s “Allen” in the column, the next time when a user type “A”, the Excel will show
 Allen to help user to autofill.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the vlookup feature can work with the data validation feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<p>There is no chance that the MyPhone application would interfer with the speaker phone operation.&nbsp; If a soft reset did not bring back the speaker phone operation, I would hard reset the device to see if the speaker phone works.</p>

<p>The virus could affect the local synced files but I'm not sure whether these changes in local will sync to cloud. If not, then you can sync from cloud to get the original copy of files.</p>
<p>If the changes (got encrypted) sync to cloud and you want to restore all date together, you can open a service request in O365 admin portal, they will help to restore all you data to a previous point.</p>

                    <p>I do have a annoying issue with outlook under windows 10. I have a few duplicate birthdays in my birthday calendar. They are not caused by duplicate or linked contacts in my contacts database, as I do not have any linked ones. I do use linkedin, but I have
 not linked anything to my outlook databases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to delete the contacts and than delete the birthday calender alltogether and have it reinstalled; no succes. Outlook however does not allow me to delete birthday entries in the calender directly, so what to do to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>Hi GuusStoelinga,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Duplicate event will appear in Outlook calendar if the account is set up in multiple devices and access it in different applications. To further isolate your concern, we’d like to
 know the following: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is the domain of your email account? </span></li><li><span>Do you have other devices that your account is set up on it? If yes, which devices are they and how do you access your account on it?</span></li><li><span>If you are using a mail app to access your account, which application, build, and version is it?
</span></li><li><span>Having asked the second question, how is your account configured in the application? Is it set up as an IMAP, POP3 or via Exchange server?
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Genevieve Cri</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just listing the answers to your questions;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do not have duplicate entries with all contact persons that I have added a birthdate to, just a few....</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am in the live domain</span></p>
<p><span>It is a very old account that has been converted a few times. I am not 100% sure that the double entries do not exist already for a long time....but have no way to delete them.</span></p>
<p><span>I am using the account on a windows 10 device, via outlook, and on a iPhone using an outlook app. ( it has been used via the apple mail application in the past though...) I also use web mail from now and than.</span></p>
<p><span>The mail app on my apple ihone is outlook version 2.97.0</span></p>
<p><span>The account is a Microsoft exchange type.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>Duplicate excel files on onedrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonfoster2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate excel files on onedrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my partner recently bought a new laptop. She needs to access excel and word documents that I use on my PC. Everything is saved to onedrive. When we log in to the computer using my PC login it brings up everything as it looks on my PC so she has tried
 opening and working on the excel spreadsheets that are saved on the one drive there. However, when I look at the same documents from the PC there is always a duplicate copy, even when she has just opened it and not made any changes. Can anyone offer advice
 on how we can both work on these documents from different computers without getting duplicates? Sorry we are not very tech savvy!</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Simon</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duplicate files may occur if these are being downloaded from OneDrive. This happens if your OneDrive account is linked to your PC or you’ve selected to open the file in any of your Office desktop app version, like in Word or Excel. As a recommendation, you
 may access OneDrive via a <strong>browser </strong>and open the file via online. By doing this, you’ll be able to work on the same file from different computers. Then, the changes that you’ve made will automatically be synced. You may also
<strong>share the files</strong> so you can work together in OneDrive. Please see this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/work-together-on-office-documents-in-onedrive-ea3807bc-2b73-406f-a8c9-a493de18258b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">article</a></strong> for additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case that you’ll have other questions related to OneDrive, I’d suggest that you reach out to our OneDrive experts through the
<span>
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/work-together-on-office-documents-in-onedrive-ea3807bc-2b73-406f-a8c9-a493de18258b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">in-app support</a></strong></span>. All OneDrive concerns will be assisted from there.</p>

    <title>Problem with shared documents email in one Sharepoint site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rseiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with shared documents email in one Sharepoint site</h2>
                    <p>I noticed today that sharing a file works fine in all of the sites that I've tried it except for one. That one contains several different document libraries, but any document I've tried sharing results in the recipient getting a blank email instead of the
 normal "Here's the document shared with you" verbiage in the email with a link to the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a good reason for this, if it's not a bug. Is there a particular document library setting related to this? It's not that sharing is blocked/disabled, it's that the emails sent are broken, as viewed in OWA, Outlook, whatever. And I should emphasize
 again that any document shared the same exact way ("Invite people," specify email address, uncheck require login) in other sites of ours work fine.</p>

            <p>Hi Rseiler,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further analysis, we need confirm the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if the issue occurs whatever you share documents to external users and internal user, as we need to confirm if the only recipient has the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Confirm if the issue occurs when you share library to check if the issue only occurs when you share documents.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. The screenshot of the blank email. </span></p>

<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rseiler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to confirm if you can share to the user who has the issue from the normal site.

<p>I suggest you try adding a new library to check if the issue still occurs.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, please follow the steps below to check if you can share the library.</p>
<p>1. Open your SharePoint&gt;Select the library which you want to share. (If you use new experience, you need to return to Classic experience which is in left bottom.)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It's a blank email. There is no screenshot possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't make sense: "I need to confirm if you can share to the user which has the issue from the normal site" because the internal user being targeted for sharing doesn't matter (it's everyone I've tried), and there is no sharing problem with any other
 site (the "normal" site) for any users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, can you just theorize what the problem might be in a general sense given what we know? &nbsp;This can't be a new issue, though I haven't found anything on it.&nbsp; I'm just looking for ideas. There's no need to try other things that we never do, like sharing
 entire libraries or testing against all users (I've tested against several--which user is irrelevant; what's important is that the problem only occurs for internal and not external users).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            E90 Email Synchronisation Problems and Others</h2>
                    I have the following problems with my E90.<br />
<br />
1. Does not sync emails with PC at office - Can sync all other functions such as contacts , calendar , tasks etc.<br />
This was possible on my 9300.<br />
2. Log is not as comprehensive as 9300.<br />
3. Cannot move emails from one folder to another on E90.<br />
4. Emails disappear from E90 once emails have been downloaded to office PC and removed from exchange server and E90 reconnects to exchange server.<br />
5. The telephone interface is not as good as 9300 - this is extremely disappointing as one would expect that the E90 would have been an improvement over the 9300.

(1), (3) and (4) Yes, the E90 no longer syncs with your desktop. Although I understand that this can be bothersome to others, it did not bother me because I had always configured my communicators using IMAP. And this is my recommendation to you should you choose
 to remain with the E90--it is the way that "modern" remote users now access mail.<br />
<br />
Mail synchronization had always appeared to me to be anachronistic. It was designed for the days when connectivity to your pocket was more or less slow, intermittent or expensive. Now with unlimited data plans, and 3G connectivity, and worldwide coverage, I
 think it makes more sense to access mail directly from your server, and only keep your mail headers in your pocket. The need for synchronization goes away. Even better, your mail (with your current read status) can be accessed anytime, anywhere from any platform.
 I can, for example, be reading mail in a restaurant on my E90... then check my mail using our corporate OWA from a kiosk... then check my mail using Outlook on my notebook from the hotel--and through the entire experience, the "read" status is always up-to-date,
 if I had moved a mail to a folder using one device, it's moved everywhere, etc.<br />
<br />
(2) I don't know what you mean by "as comprehensive." Exactly what data are you missing that used to be in your old phone?<br />
<br />
(5) Again, could you qualify? I think the telephone interface is just as good (if not better) than the 9500's. My one peeve is the proximity of the D-pad to the "123" buttons. Sometimes when dialing, I accidentally hit the d-pad and it causes me to really mangle
 the telephone number--but as soon as I realized what was happening, I stopped myself from doing it and voila, perfect phone.

            I agree with 1, 2, 3 and 5. E90 is behind previous communicators on many issues, you will discover this as you use it.<br />
<br />
For problem 4, as daichii said, this is how the E-mail servers work.
