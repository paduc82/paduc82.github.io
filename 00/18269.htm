<h2>            Nokia 5800 XM - Gallery hangs when trying to open any file</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I searched all over the internet to see if any other&nbsp; 5800 owner has similar issue but i guess not.&nbsp; When I try to open any image (which is on phone memory) with&nbsp; memory card inserted the gallery hangs, Even trying to open an image or movie clip stored in
 memory card behaves same. I can open the same files using file manager under application.</p>
<p>I noticed this issue the next day after i purchased my handset and went to nokia customer care and they replaced the MM card( well it took almost month for them) now this is the replaced card. It worked for some hours i was able to view images using gallery
 and now all of a sudden it has stopped responding. Has this got to do with any application which is installed on memory card?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to try to format my MM card and try putting single pic on phone and then on memory card and try. Any one please has any other suggestion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many song videos on my MMC. i have uninstalled all the applications whihc were there on my memory card like marle maze and some others which i had installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once i connect to OVI PC Suite i am unable to select remove storage device as it always shows in use so i always used to switch mode to mass storage from PC suite and then remove storage device and disconnect it. Is this correct method?</p>
<p>My laptop os is vista</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Kiran</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 4 hours of research i just found that if i have more than 2 video clips (of about 40 MB)&nbsp; this issue is occuring. Once i delete the 3rd clip eeverything works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known bug? Any one with solutions please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the option for me is either be happy viewing photos or videos.. there is no option to have both.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have discovered the same problem. Whenever you access to the Gallery and then try to go out, it's horribly slow. Moreover, if you try using the Realplayer starting it from the applications menu, since it reads in the gallery, there's no way to close it
 after watching a video...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A workaround is avoiding to use the gallery at all, for the videos going through the "video central" and for the images using the file browser, for the music using directly the player...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is anyway a bad bug, as the control on when the gallery is called is an imagination work I don't want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like this mobile, but I want a bug-fix asap!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably is the same issue. I will try to do the same, first making backup of the card, then formatting, then reinstalling everything. Let's hope...</p>

<p>I already formatted my memory card twice using phone. But no luck. But oh yeah One thing what has changed is now i can have 3 video clips ( of about 40 MB) and the phone now cant handle the 4 th one. Looks like its got a mind of its own.</p>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. I have stopped using my gallery and i have downloaded Photo flow whcih is available free for 5800 to view pictures. It has a cool interface better than the gallery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope Nokia resolves this issue, And i also hope Nokia gets better customer care ppl who would actually give solution than always ask to rest the phone.</p>

<p>Actually after the formatting, I tried to put back all my videos from the backup, and the result was no result... Furthermore, they were in a folder which was not the right one, and so I could not use the Video Central... Currently I'm trying from scratch.
 I deleted everything from my card and now I copied again the music and now a film through the OVI... But I don't expect big changes... I think the bug is really behind the Gallery handling...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please tell me from where I can download Photo Flow?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll post if the results of the ongoing operations will be better... Unfortunately we cannot go back to the previous firmware as there I had big issues with the GPS... But now, even with more effort, it seems a bit better...</p>

<p>Update. I downloaded two films (500Mb). After the first one, it seemed to be still ok, but after the second, the gallery hangs, and then all the applications have serious problems to access to the files. I think the bug is in the preview. If we could disable
 the preview for images and videos, maybe it would work. Before I had 4 films so large, and the behaviour was similar...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway I downloaded the Photo Flow and it works fine for the pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe we have to open a new thread for verifying if it is possible to disable the preview mode for images and video, waiting for an update of the firmware that is URGENTLY needed...</p>

<p>well, i got the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1). remove the memory card from ur cell.</p>
<p>2). On the cell without memory card.(you will see no trouble wid Gallery now.)</p>
<p>3). Now OFF ur cell and put the memory card in the cell.</p>
<p>4). Now Format the memory card by phone memory card menu.</p>
<p>5). Restart your Cell, copy the contents to memory card, whatever the size of contents are.....</p>
<p>6). And finally, go to Gallery and enjoy the features of Boombastic 5800..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.... :)</p>

<p>Omaji,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad that you got the problem fixed. i will have to try out. I&nbsp; did actually format the memory card but i did not follow the exact steps you mentioned below. I always inserted the memory card when the phone was one i guess. Anyway i will give it a try and
 let you know .</p>

<p>I tried the procedure but it didn't work for me... Maybe the problem is that I put back data from a backup, but honestly this would be strange...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, my solution for the moment is just using the file browser and avoid the Gallery. In this way I have all the functions ok and the phone works fine... Sometimes is a limit, and some shortcuts you have to avoid (like the small icon XpressMusic), but
 better than trying strange ways to go out from the Gallery...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if it works not using a backup...</p>

<p>A CPU can not have Windows 7, nor <strong>any</strong> any operating system on it.<br />
"CPU" stands for "Central Processing Unit." In modern personal<br />
computers, the CPU is a relatively small electronic chip, an<br />
integrated circuit. It sits on the motherboard, inside the computer's<br />
case. It is not the case itself, nor is it the total computer, which<br />
includes the case and everything within it. <br />
I'm not sure how the incorrect practice began of calling the whole<br />
computer the "CPU," but here's my guess: when you buy a computer, you<br />
normally get the case and what's in it, along with a monitor,<br />
keyboard, mouse, and perhaps a printer. All of these peripherals<br />
connect to the case. Because everything connects to the case, the case<br />
is "central" to everything else and the term "Central Processing Unit"<br />
is sometimes misunderstood and misapplied to it. </p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Are you able to set up Skype Number as a receiver for your Vumber number? Please try to make a direct call to your Skype Number to check if it is working properly. Let me know if you encounter any issues calling your Skype Number so I can further help
 you. </span></p>

<p>I tried setting this up before and it worked, but now i have it set up, and it doesn't. If i make a direct call to my skype number my skype number will ring and then when i answer it..the skype number will hang up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if i make a outbound call it will work!</p>

</p><p>If I try to use my&nbsp; skype number as a forward number to my vumber&nbsp; it will ring and then hang up when i answer it from skype</p>

            Have you tried temporarily disabling your Caller ID in Skype? Creating situations in which you might forward a call to yourself, from yourself could create a problem when the source and destination numbers essentially become the same. This may not be what
 is occurring, but it is easy to test out.

<h2>            Alert notification configuration in O365</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>I have been struggling to create the alert notification in O365 i.e if anyone modified/create mail flow rule or create/modified the send/receive connector should alert to global admins. I do not find proper parameters/criteria to create alert policy in&nbsp;https://protection.office.com/managealerts.
 do you any idea how to implement the same.</p>

<p>Hi Forumsolve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand it would be more convenient if we could set up an alert like this. However, currently we can only audit the inbox rules activities of users. In this scenario, since there're different
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
admin roles</a> in Office 365, it's recommended to specify the permissions of each admin so that limited admins have the permission to change mail flow in your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you'd like to have this alert, we suggest you feedback in <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 UserVoice</a> website to share your ideas and expectations. Many features implement in this way. We highly appreciate for your understanding.</p>

<p>I tried that already. There is no where that says cancel subscription. I even tried deleting Pay Pal then clicking on cancel subscription when a window pops up, but all that does is take me back to my account where I started from. It just refuses and even
 blocks me from cancelling anything. I have seen this before with all kinds of online subscription's and it is just ridiculous what these companies will do just to keep</p>
<p>receiving your money.</p>
<p>An honest company would just list a easy cancelation option that worked. Thanks for trying, I guess I will just have to cancel my Pay pal account.</p>

</p><p>I am an admin and manage multiple executives.&nbsp; Each exec is on various distribution lists for IT alerts.&nbsp; I am trying to filter these emails with a rule so that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any emails received by this group (Ex: Joe smith on behalf of "IT alert managers"; or Tammy King on behalf "IT alert managers", or So-and-so on behalf of "IT Alert Managers) with "Priority 5" in the subject line, gets automatically moved out of the inbox,
 and into another folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a rule as follows, but still continue to receive the low "Priority 5" emails in my executive's inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Apply this rule after the message arrives</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>from "IT alert managers"</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp; and with "Priority 5" in the subject</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp; and with "Priority 5" in the message header</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>move it to the "IT alerts- Priority 5" folder</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>except if only sent to me</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>stop processing more rules</strong></em></p>

<p>Hello RogAdmin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you created Outlook client rules to move all subjects or message headers that contain Priority 5 to a specific mailbox folder. But, you still receive some emails with Priority 5 in your mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please navigate to File &gt; Info &gt; Rules and Alerts &gt; Manage Rules &amp; Alerts and make sure that this particular Outlook client rule is listed in the top one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. Does any other user encounter the same problem?</p>
<p>2. A screenshot of the Outlook client rule.</p>
<p>3. The detailed version of the Outlook client.</p>
<p>4. Do you use Outlook client or Outlook Web App to check the emails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

</p><p>I think the problem lies in the fact that the "IT alert Managers" email address is sent on behalf of a very large group of people (which would be common in a large organization.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re your questions specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1. Does any other user encounter the same problem?&nbsp; </p>
<p>A1:&nbsp; I expect they do, as IT help desk identified this as a frequent problem for which they have no recommended solution.</p>
<p>Q2. A screenshot of the Outlook client rule.</p>
<p>A2:&nbsp; Not possible</p>
<p>Q3. The detailed version of the Outlook client.</p>
<p>A3:&nbsp; Our company uses O365 for business.&nbsp; Outlook is 2016.&nbsp; System is Win 10</p>
<p>Q4. Do you use Outlook client or Outlook Web App to check the emails?</p>
<p>A4:&nbsp; I only use OWA if I have the proverbial gun to my head.&nbsp; Outlook client 99.9% of the time is what is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping my IT contact is incorrect in his comments - Do you have anything else I can try?</p>

<p>Hi RogAdmin, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you set the rule in OWA, and actually, there is limit for filtering emails. If you want to filter emails with “Priority 5” anywhere in the message. You can set your conditions as with "Priority 5"&nbsp;or body instead of with "Priority
 5" in the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you set as above, please check again if the emails still go to your inbox. If they still get into your inbox or you just want to filter the emails with "Priority 5" in the subject, which also does not work, please try to create a different test inbox
 rule (change IT Alert Managers to a regular sender) to check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hello Iry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please advise what the limit is for filtering emails.&nbsp; What you propose above for filtering Priority 5 emails anywhere in the message doesn't make sense to me, as messages will be incorrectly filter to the subfolder if someone forwards&nbsp;my boss&nbsp;the
 original email requesting a status update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that OWA is too limited compared to what the desktop install used to be able to do - I just need to know how limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once more, what I am trying to do is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Move any Priority 5 emails received from a group called IT alert managers, to a subfolder I have created and titled "IT alerts - Priority 5".&nbsp; There are many senders in this group.&nbsp; There are also instances where a CIO may forward their receipt of a Priority
 5 notification to my boss and ask:&nbsp; What's happening with this?&nbsp; I need to be sure those emails hit my boss' inbox, and not get filtered into the subfolder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can recommend a specific set of rule instructions on how to do this, as outlined below, I would appreciate it.&nbsp; If&nbsp;OWA can't filter emails in this way then so be it.&nbsp; I just need to know either way, and share the information within our group.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Apply this rule after the message arrives</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>from "IT alert managers"</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp; and with "Priority 5" in the subject</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp; and with "Priority 5" in the message header</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>move it to the "IT alerts- Priority 5" folder</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>except if only sent to me</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>stop processing more rules</strong></em></p>
<p>

<p>Hi RogAdmin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry that I may not explain it clear. The limit I mentioned means that you can only filter the emails with Priority 5 in Subject, body or message header in OWA (also in Outlook client). I also understand the
IT alert managers is a group, so generally, after you set the rule in OWA, the emails with Priority 5 in Subject, body or message header from anyone in the IT alert managers group will get filtered into the subfolder ("IT alerts-
 Priority 5" folder as you set). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I found you set the exception that if the email only sent to you. After you set this condition, the emails whose recipient is only you will bypass your rule and directly go into your inbox. I recommend you to remove the exception.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any concern about above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hello Iry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only concern I have with the instructions above, is that even after applying your further recommendations, the rule doesn't work.&nbsp; Priority 5 emails continue to remain in my boss' inbox, even after I applied the changes above, and re-ran the rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have any other suggestions, it looks like Outlook doesn't have the capability to perform this type of filter.</p>

</p><p>So, I understand the the rule is setting in your boss' mailbox and it doesn't work? Since you mentioned you are an admin, please run following commands with admin's credential to get the inbox rule of your boss' mailbox:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<h3> mnhamm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using VBA to Select the Multi Level List Style in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; an using Office 2010 .&nbsp; I have an Access database that I generate information&nbsp;, and subsequently want to transfer the information into a Word document using VBA.&nbsp; I have most of the pieces in place, but I am having trouble&nbsp;trying to &nbsp;automate setting
 the Multi Level Style for the document.&nbsp; To be clear, when I am in the Word Document I can use the Paragraph Multi Level List to select a Multi Level List from the List Library.&nbsp; What I have been searching for and can not find is how to create the code in
 my Access VBA that will select&nbsp;a particular existing Multi Level List&nbsp;Style.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make this select as part of the document creation and formatting that I do in the Access VBA.&nbsp; It seems that there should be a way to access what the current Multi&nbsp;Level
 List Style is and set&nbsp;it to the desired Style from the Library.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;example, there is no numbering set for Heading 1 - 9 when a document opens.&nbsp; What I would like to do in VBA is set the Heading numbering to the style in the&nbsp;Library List to the style that
 looks like this:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>1.1</p>
<p>1.1.1</p>
<p>1.1.1.1</p>
<p>(no indents)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can someone please guide me to the magic incantation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Quote</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should create a template in Word that contains the required multi-level list formats linked to the Heading Styles in the template and then have your code create the document from that template and apply the&nbsp;appropriate Heading Style where required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unquote</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, the reason that I suggested it is that it is more robust, more direct and simpler.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're looking for the <strong>Today</strong> button in Outlook.com. Please be informed though that since this button comes with the Hotmail interface, now that the interface has been upgraded to Outlook.com, I apologize but this feature
 is no longer available in the Outlook.com interface. </p>

<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

            <p>Generally, a scan produces an image file, a picture, of text. Just as you cannot open the hood and change the oil on a picture of a car, you cannot edit the text in a picture of text. To have editable text, it has to be run through an OCR (Optical Character
 Recognition) program. Adobe Acrobat can do this (the full program, not the reader). So can Office OneNote.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know whether Word 2016 has this native capability. It can open and edit a pdf file that has a text component.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that a document converted from pdf (or any other file format) is likely to contain many formatting anomalies that makes editing difficult. In addition, although much better than in the past, OCR is far from perfect. You will need to proofread very carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From within Word, try opening a pdf file. What happens?</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to W10  changed Qosmio X505 Q870 to a Samsung Ativ, according to the Start Page, and lost the micorphones on both.</h2>
                    Maybe there is a message here. Received the&nbsp;GO to upgrade two of&nbsp;our computers and started with the Qosmio.&nbsp; It took awhile and so I began the upgrade on the Samsung.&nbsp; The Ativ finished far ahead of the Qosmio, and all seemed to go as foretold. My surprise
 when the Qosmio restarted and the identical Start Page, with the exact same&nbsp;"Samsung Ativ" graphic&nbsp;in the lower right corner greeted me. Real life did not allow a great amount of time to search through both to see what else may be amiss, except that when Cortana
 reared its head and asked what it could do for me, I could not tell her/him...on either computer.&nbsp; Went searching later in both control panels and both appear to tell me that they are enabled and operating, even though they are not. When I typed the problem,
 bing opened and directed me to several items on W8, 8.1 and 7....?&nbsp; No microphones in any application on either computer. Any Ideas? Still have other computers to upgrade, or should

<p>Part 2: &nbsp;Interesting...the short cut to Control Panel failed three times. while taking the 'long way' (start, control panel, etc.,) works on the Samsung Ativ (Going W, R gets a message "Windows cannot find "Troubleshooting". Make sure you typed the word

    <title>Cannot delete files or format SD card that was used in Lumia 640 XL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don_yvr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete files or format SD card that was used in Lumia 640 XL running Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have used a Samsung 128GB micro SD card in my Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM phone running Windows for Phone 8.1.&nbsp; I have many pictures, video, apps, documents, and offline maps&nbsp;stored on the SD card.&nbsp; I have bought a new phone (Lumia 650) and I wanted to reset
 (hard reset) the 640 XL and give it to my wife to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the hard reset and&nbsp;re-configured the 640 XL.&nbsp; Then I went and tried to delete the files on the SD card to let it start fresh for my wife.&nbsp; However, I could not delete any pictures, video, or files on the SD card.&nbsp; I used Storage Sense to do the delete
 and I also tried with Windows Files by Microsoft to no avail.&nbsp; Every time after I did the delete and removed the folders it would look like the delete succeeded; but after a short moment, the folders, files and pictures re-appeared on the SD card!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to re-format the SD card with the Lumia 640 XL itself but the files just won't go away and kept coming back.&nbsp; I took out the SD card and tried to format it in my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I did the complete format (not the Quick Format) and the formatting
 'appeared' to be working - the progress bar was moving.&nbsp; After an hour of formatting (mind you it's a 128GB SD card) and&nbsp;when the progress bar reached the end, Windows 7 gave me a pop-up message saying "Windows cannot complete the format."&nbsp; I checked with
 Windows Explorer and the pictures, videos, files, and folders&nbsp;are still on the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went online to search for answers in various forums and found that a lot of people have the same issue of not being able to delete files or re-format SD cards previously used in Lumia phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried various solutions/suggestions but nothing seems to
 work. &nbsp;The only place that does not talk about this issue is the Microsoft forum as if MS is playing deaf or turning a blind eye to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the Lumia 640 XL for 8 months already.&nbsp; It's too late to return it.&nbsp; But I have 30-day money back guarantee on the new Lumia 650 that I bought at the Microsoft Store couple weeks ago.&nbsp; Makes me wonder if I should return it and switch to iPhone or Android
 now.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; That seems to be the popular answer in other forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, how can a SD card be broken all of a sudden when it is mounted inside a phone that's never been dropped?</p>

<h3> rendtgorter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect calendar to Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p>We have a team site and a public site on SharePoint 2013 with calendars on both. On the team site I can use the Connect to Outlook button to load the calendar in Outlook 2013. If I open the calendar on the public site, signed in, there are only list management
 functions in the ribbon, but no connect to outlook. ??? Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Rendt,</p>
<p>From your description, if you use SharePoint 2013 server or SharePoint 2013 on premise, as our forum mainly focuses on Office 365 online services, I would suggest you post in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=sharepoint%2Csharepointde&amp;forum=sharepointsearch%2Csharepointcustomizationprevious%2Csharepointsearchlegacy%2Csharepointitpropreview%2Csharepointadmin%2Csharepointdevelopmentprevious%2Csharepointadminlegacy%2Csharepointdevelopment%2CCloudSSA%2Csharepointcustomizationlegacy%2CSP2016%2Csharepointgenerallegacy%2Csharepointgeneralprevious%2Cwflmgr%2Csharepointdevelopmentlegacy%2Csharepointdevpreview%2Csharepointcustomization%2Csharepointsearchprevious%2Csharepointadminprevious%2Csharepointgeneral%2Csharepointsearch&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=Cannot+connect+calendar+to+Outlook+in+public+site+of+SharePoint+2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet SharePoint Forum</a> which is a specific support channel for SharePoint server and on premise related issues.</p>
<p>If you use SharePoint Online in Office 365, you could try to use a different browser or system to open the site and check if the "connect to Outlook" button appears.</p>

<p>Hi Rendt,<br />
<br />
This could happen because some features are not available in the "public site". To reproduce this scenario, could you provide the following information?<br />
1. By saying "public site", do you mean publishing site or other sites? <br />
2. what's the detailed steps you create your "public site"? Have you used templates?<br />
3. Your system version and bits.<br />
4. Your IE browser version and bits.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jared</p>

<h2>            I need help getting rid of a computer RAT</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows staff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Recently I downloaded a folder, and my avast said it was clean, even McAfee said it was virus free. But that was not true. I scanned the file on virustotal and it said it had a behaveslike.downloader, or something like that. What I've seen it do is install
 a program called Wajam, (I have not yet seen anything harmful of this, though), and SushiLeads, the worst rat I've ever gotten. What it does is whenever I click something, it's going to bring me to a malware, scam advertisement. It also has made my computer
 not able to open files that aren't on my desktop. I know the file location, but whenever I try to delete Wajam or SushiLeads it says "this file is in use", and "you need administrator permissions to delete this file". I am typing this on my family desktop,
 please help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>

    <title>Offce 365 Outlook Spam Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickjohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offce 365 Outlook Spam Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have discovered what I believe to be a bug in Office 365 Outlook. When I have Office 365 Outlook open on my desktop, then I am inundated with spam on the two IMAP email addresses that I have. The same emails are hitting both Inboxes. However, when I close
 out of Office 365 Outlook and instead use my ISP email client, then the spam drops off significantly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me this proves without a shadow of a doubt that there is some bug in Office 365 Outlook that allows spam to replicate itself to any IMAP Inbox that is open for emails. Like I said, if I use my ISP email client, the spam stops almost completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>The spam sent to both Inboxes is stuff like "Compare Internet Providers", "Winner-Alert", "Summer Savings Gift Card", "Gift Card Survey" and others. It always is from a different email address, but the emails From section (instead of a person) is "Compare
 Internet Providers" with the actual email showing as being from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for example. Then, it comes back later as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. This pattern repeats over and over again. The front end "CompareInternetProviders"
 is repeated except with a different @ following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing that I can see in my contacts that match any of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if I do not have Outlook 365 open, then it stops.</p>

            <p>HI Rick ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 does not have the ability to generate spam. Whatever mail comes to your email account, Outlook will just download it or sync with the server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you may create a new Outlook profile and check if new profile works fine. Configure just one email account and check the performance of outlook.

</p>
<p>The steps to setup an Email account as well are provided in the same article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know after trying the above step.</p>

<p>Tax&nbsp;relevant bills kept in Hotmail are now miss-labeled as news letters in Outlook. &nbsp;When attempting to open them, I am told to throw them out. &nbsp;I need the information in them. &nbsp;Where can I get it. &nbsp;Can I&nbsp;relabel&nbsp;them or recover and save them someway? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community! I understand you are having issues viewing the incorrectly labeled emails on your account. Let me help you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you give us the exact details on how exactly were you prompted to throw them out? If there are any error messages, it would be great. The emails should remain in your mailbox unless you delete them permanently, place them in Junk folder or schedule a
 clean up. Emails in the Junk folder are&nbsp;to be deleted after 10 days while emails in the Deleted folder are deleted after 5 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for relabeling the emails, please try these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark the checkbox of the emails that you want to relabel.</li><li>Click the Categories button in the command bar on top of the page. </li><li><strong>Unmark</strong> or <strong>remove the</strong> <strong>shade</strong> on&nbsp;the
<strong>Newsletter</strong> option then mark <strong>Bills</strong>. Or, click&nbsp;<strong>New category</strong> if you wish to use a different one&nbsp;for the emails and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>To view the categorized emails, follow these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your Inbox or any folder you wish to view. </li><li>On top of the message list, click the <strong>dropdown button</strong> next to
<strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Select the filter from the options.</li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps. If you have clarifications, feel free to post back for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>The <strong>Size</strong> device on the <strong>Layout</strong> tab continues to be a bit buggy. My recommendation is to use the conventional
<strong>File&gt; Page Setup</strong> method to specify &amp;/or confirm paper size. You should find that standard Letter is the default indicated in that dialog despite the fact that the tool on the Ribbon indicates Borderless. [The Page Setup dialog also can be accessed
 from <strong>Format&gt; Document - Page Setup</strong>.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ease your mind though :-) it isn't a problem to print a typical document using the Borderless option... what
<em>is</em> a problem is not using the Borderless option when attempting to print documents whose content exceeds the margins [such as a full color Background in a PDF or content that extends to the edge of the paper (full bleed)].</p>

    <title>I have not been able to update since 14971 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whitewolf 6.0  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have not been able to update since 14971</h2>
                    I have not been able to update since 14971, with the message:<br />
"There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later.&nbsp;<br />
If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:<br />
• Windows 10 Insider Preview 15063 (rs2_release) - Error 0x80070005"<br />
<br />
Of course Error 0x80070005, has nothing to do with the problem, it is a canned response, and most of the answers given reference Windows 7.&nbsp;I have reported this many, many times, on the Insider Hub, as well as researched it in Win 10, Win 10 Insider, and just
 Windows forums. &nbsp;Most have come back with the same answers, none of which have resolved the problem.<br />
<br />
This Feedback Hub is definitely not designed to help the end user, only the designers, but this is one quirk, (which includes several others) that has obviously not been fixed in the many updates since the last working update I have received, 14971.1000, back
 in December of 2016.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't know how the Creator's Update will be delivered, but if it is to be as an update like the past insider updates<br />
I guess I will never see it. It would be nice if THIS Feedback Hub went two ways, so those that are building it could<br />
give me the answers that no one else has, and I am so far behind now, it is unlikely I will ever be able to fully update<br />
to the latest releases.

            As it is Beta software that has had many updates/upgrades which may have become corrupted along the way and may need a "clean" install, I know people don't want to do it because of the large amount of stuff that has been installed.
