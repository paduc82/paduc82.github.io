<h2>            How to Move the Tiles &#40;Apps&#41; away from the &#34;Start Screen&#34; in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; May everyone of us enjoy A Happy and Merry New Year of Two-Thousand-Sixteen (2016)!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a Question related to the Metro Tiles (Apps) that appear in my Software Installation of the "Microsoft Windows 10 Home Non-N 64-Bit" Operating System.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; They are the following Forty (40) Tiles (Apps): {"3D Builder", "Alarms &amp; Clock", "App1", "ASUS Welcome", "Calculator", "Calendar", "Camera", "Candy Crush Saga", "Contact Support", "Films &amp; TV", "Food &amp; Drink", "Get Office", "Get Skype", "Get Started", "Groove
 Music", "Health &amp; Fitness", "HP AiO Printer Remote", "Mail", "Maps", "Microsoft Edge", "Microsoft Solitaire Collection", "Money", "News", "OneNote", "People", "Phone Companion", "Photos", "Reader", "Reading List App", "Scan", "Search", "Settings", "Sport",
 "Store", "Travel", "Twitter", "Voice Recorder", "Weather", "Windows Feedback", "Xbox"}.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirty-Eight (38) of the Tiles (Apps) have come with the Operating System, while One (1) Tile (App), namely "App1", has been baked at Home in one of the "Microsoft Windows Visual Studio" Flavors. The Fortieth (40th) Tile (App), namely "ASUS Welcome", has
 come with the Software Drivers of the "ASUS" Laptop.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; What I am planning to do is to reinstall this Operating System once, sometimes, in the near future, and I am trying to do it right and to understand whatever I am doing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have recently jumped a great leap in understanding the Small Fact that the "Start Menu" is nowadays no longer as it used to be Twenty (20) Years Ago, in the year of 1995, in the "Microsoft Windows 95" Operating System Edition. Now it is called as the
 "Start Screen" and it appears to be a bright and shiny, brand new world. And black.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; What I want is to have even these Forty (40) Metro Tiles (Apps) installed on a different Partition as the one that holds the Operating System. Until I reach this bright goal, what I want to do is to at least move their Shortcuts away from the "Start Screen",
 somewhere, in a location, such as the one pointed out by the "C:\Moved" Folder Path.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever I have been trying so far has been to attempt to move all of the File Folders and all of the Files away from the "C:\Users\varad\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Application Shortcuts" File Folder, but they have still remained inside the "Start
 Screen", even after this operation. Also, that File Folder keeps Fifty (50) File Folders and not as expected, Forty (40) File Folders, for the Forty (40) Tiles (Apps) that are present inside the "Start Screen".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another attempt has been to move all of the File Folders and all of the Files outside of the "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" File Folder. That File Folder also contains One-Hundred-Thirty-Six (136) File Folders and not as expected, Forty (40) File Folders,
 for the Forty (40) Tiles (Apps) that are present inside the "Start Screen". Most of the File Folders and Files that are present inside that File Folder are used by the Operating System and I had to stop and to revert back the whole process of moving File Folders
 and Files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Does anyone have any idea how to move the shortcuts toward these Metro Tiles (Apps) somewhere, outside of the "Start Screen", without uninstalling any of them?</p>
<p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then update your video/display drivers - and then reset Aero as needed.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (the preferred method is manually using the above methods<br />
to help ensure the latest drivers from the System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Missing HDMI sound after Windows 10 Fall Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> north8425  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing HDMI sound after Windows 10 Fall Update</h2>
                    <p>Following the big Windows 10 update last month I suddenly had no sound when my laptop is connected to TV via HDMI.&nbsp; I look under "playback" for sound and the HDMI audio that was previously there is gone.&nbsp; Now I only have the default Realtek Audio.&nbsp; And yes,
 I did check both "Show Disabled Devices" and "Show Disconnected Devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back the update to the previous build and the problem was resolved - HDMI audio is again there and working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now since then there were more updates and now HDMI audio is again missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If I have a subscription to Office 365, does that include phone support for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for the additional details. In this case, we recommend that you uninstall the driver and install the latest driver manually from the manufacturer's website. This can help us identify if there is a compatibility issue with the update and the driver
 that you are currently using. Since the Fall Creators update is fairly new, some drivers may not work properly and the manufacturers must also release an update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, kindly advise us so we can provide additional assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response. </p>

<p>Hello CurrentCoder24! Jameser here is correct, each profile needs it's own Microsoft account email and password. Since they will be child accounts you will still need to link your current profile and Microsoft account email to them though! You'll be able

            <p>Yes, maybe,&nbsp;however . . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer has a hard disk that uses solid-state drive (SSD) technology, you might not see an option to speed up your computer with ReadyBoost when you plug in a USB flash drive or flash memory card. You may instead receive the message, "Readyboost
 is not enabled on this computer because the system disk is fast enough that ReadyBoost is unlikely to provide any additional benefit." This is because some SSD drives are so fast they're unlikely to benefit from ReadyBoost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So don't waste your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate does not show wallpaper after update from Vista Business</h2>
                    I made the update of Vista Business to Windows 7 Ultimate and cannot make a desktop background work. I can select only Solid Colors, but not Pictures or Slide Shows. I googled for similar problems and it seems people offer various solutions, including
 putting 0 into some Active Desktop-related registry attributes under HKLM or HKCU Software / Microsoft / Windows / CurrentVersion / Policies ... And also checking/unchecking some boxes under Easy Access control panel, but nothing seemed helped. So I am a bit
 lost and it is quite depressing always to look at the black desktop background, knowing that tones of nice graphic pictures are awaiting to be shown there :(<br />
Can someone suggest what can be done in this case? Again - only solid colors of desktop can be changed at this point...

            I finally figured it out myself... I am not sure which of two actions helped, but here is what I did:<br />
<br />
1. I made a default setwallpaper command under various of graphics file extensions pointing to Windows Photo Viewer CLSID (before they were pointing to another CLSID, which I believe was Office Fax Viewer - &nbsp;{ff609cc7-d34d-4049-a1aa-2293517ffcc6}). Here is
 how I did it:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - In RegEdit I searched for "wallpaper" and under HKCR\SystemFileAssociations it found several extensions (.bmp, .jpg, etc.) where I swapped the value of a key "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SystemFileAssociations\.bmp\Shell\setdesktopwallpaper\Command\DelegateExecute"
 from {ff609cc7-d34d-4049-a1aa-2293517ffcc6} to {FFE2A43C-56B9-4bf5-9A79-CC6D4285608A}<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Then&nbsp;it found similar keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - their values were already set to&nbsp;&nbsp;{FFE2A43C-56B9-4bf5-9A79-CC6D4285608A}, but it won't hurt to double-check<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Then I removed the register key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop\Wallpaper". This key had empty value - so I assumed there is no much use and then shortly after I did that I got my wallpaper from selected theme.<br />

            If the computer was activated there is no longer a need for a key.<br />
When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.

<p><span>Hi Galdrak,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may receive this message if Dsetup.dll is missing or corrupt in the downloaded file. I would
 suggest you to re-download the setup file for Borderland and try to install it. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Incase you are unable to install after redownload and getting the same error, you may have to contact
 the&nbsp;gaming software&nbsp;manufacturer to check if you can download the setup<span>&nbsp;</span>file from a different location and if it works fine. Also you may check with them if they have any fix for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Einar,<br />
<br />
You can still reset your Windows 10 local account password but keep in mind that once you reset your password it will remove all of your data, programs and settings which will free space on your PC and also you'll no longer be receiving a low disk space error.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;If Windows 7 doesn't recognize it and automatically load the driver for it, the flash drive has likely become defective.&nbsp; It does happen after a lot of use (or misuse).&nbsp; I'd try plugging it into another computer and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; These things
 have gotten pretty cheap lately, so replacing it with a new one shouldn't be much of a problem except for any lost data.&nbsp; You can buy 16 GB ones now for $10 or less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h3> nervehammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wheels of Hazard pin</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a heck of a time trying to get this pin. I have had the game since release and have yet to be able to get this pin even once. I know... it's pathetic.</p>
<p>For the life of me I just can't seem to ever run three people down in a round. It seems to me that I either can't find anyone to hit or when I do think I've run them over I somehow missed or it just didn't kill them. Does anyone have any tips here?</p>
<p>Also, I am assuming you have to be the driver of the vehicle for this and not a passenger/gunner.</p>
<p>Thanks and peace out...</p>
<p>Hammer</p>

<p>I only have this pin a few times myself. The other night I realized it was the only pin I only had 1 time, so I decided to get it some more times. Go on Harvest day and get in the CAV, drive around running people over between the flags. I also drove around
 on the two big hills next to flag B and D, usually found a few snipers up there to squish.</p>
<p>I got it both rounds, so I think this is your best bet.</p>
<p>Or if you are a Rush guy I have gotten quite a few roadkills on this same map on the second set of crates, attacking. There is a big empty field between where the defenders spawn and the crates, drive through there with a CAV you can almost always get a
 few.</p>

<p>I agree with Lost Kauz and A Foam Football. My advice: on Arica Harbor Rush offense, get a Humvee and drive counterclockwise around the first set of M-COMS. Make sure it is counterclockwise, or you will probably find a stationary AT missile coming towards
 you. Approach from the right of the main road, and be vigilant about tanks. You can do this multiple times per match, and if you do it enough, eventually you will run over enough opponenets.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the advice. Was playing and Harvest Day came up in the rotation jumped in a tank and switched to third person view. Got two roadkills easy as that. Then I decided to drive over some mines. Spawned at base, grabbed a truck and ran over
 three more!</p>
<p>I think the real key here is to switch to third person view. Makes a HUGE difference.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone for the advice.</p>

<div>3. When I brought my new WiFi it even didn't work...Then I thought which software has created this problem. Then I think of a software named TCP Optimizer which optimizes Internet to Get high speed ..When I reset it to its Windows default state it started
 working but only for 5 mins then I have to repair it again...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think it is due to ARP cache .When I give command " <b>arp -d * </b>&nbsp;" in cmd &nbsp;, my internet again starts working but only for 5 minutes. Can you tell me how to disable ARP cache. Please help me....</div>

<div>I have tried all your methods but nothing happened..</div>
<div>As I told you I think it is due to ARP cache..</div>
<div>Can you please tell me how to disable this or is there any software that can automatically flush it after every 2 to 5 minutes...If not can you make it for me..</div>
<div>&nbsp;I think it is due to ARP cache because when I give <b>arp -d * </b>my internet again starts working....</div>
<div>Thank you...</div>

<div>The previous instructions were sound, funny they didn't work for you. Look at your network adapter properties. Make sure you have the following items listed: Client for Microsoft Networks, File Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, Internet Protocol
 (TCP/IP). If you have others un-check the selection boxes to those items. Next, select the TCP/IP line and click the properties button. Setup the connection to use "Obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP) and "Obtain DNS server address automatically". This
 way your wifi switch/router will define what IP address the PC receives because it sounds like you manually configured the properties. Which is causing you to receive the "IP address conflict" message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Question: is your wifi switch/router configured to distribute IP addresses (meaning it's acting as a DHCP server)? If not, my solution will not work for you.</div>
