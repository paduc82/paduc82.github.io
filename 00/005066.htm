<h2>            Echo&#47;Noise during calls.</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my Lumia 950 DS, when people are calling me they hear some kind of echo or noise. Ive tried to make speaker sound to 7 or even less it doesnt help. I have also removed my protection case from phone - no profit. One thing which helped
 me - factory reset, but after some time, with installing some "updates" that problem appeared again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem aswell?</p>

<p>This makes the phone quite useless.</p>

    <title>CD&#47;DVD rom Detection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heartsy  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD rom Detection</h2>
                    <p>I just installed the Windows 10 preview build 10162 yesterday. I had no problems with the initial setup, however when I went to install the drivers for the video card and sound card, a prompt would come up saying that I don't have said hardware attached.
 It did however work as though it all installed, I mean both monitors kicked on and the&nbsp;Nvidia software is there, and after changing the speaker settings to speakers instead of headphones I had sound as well. I only mention all this because of the order of
 things happening, it may be relevant. I still noticed a pci device not properly installed in the device manager, so I popped my soundcard disk back in and was going to have it search there for drivers, thinking maybe something didn't fully install right. And
 before I could get that far I had the blue screen of death, crash, sent error report and rebooted. Now upon rebooting I have lost the ability to see the rom drive. In an effort to fix that this morning, I unplugged said rom drive and tried to start my computer.
 My plan was to boot system up without it, and then reboot system with it, let system think Oh you got a new device here, let me install that for you... However that plan didn't work, instead I found a weird glitch. My computer would get stuck on the Bios screen
 with the motherboard logo. Couldn't go past there until I plugged said drive back in. I thought hum that's odd, so for **** I completely unplugged it, from IDE and power, initially I just unplugged its power. Tried the boot up and got error saying the drive,
 ie my main drive had crashed, was possibly corrupted.. blah blah blah. So, I hit the main shut off switch again, plugged the rom drive completely back in, and now all boots up fine, yet the drive still is not being detected!!! I did notice a registry fix on
 one of the threads here, so I'm going to try that next. But I thought I should bring the other stuff to the attention of others.. I mean why couldn't windows load.. hell couldn't even get through the bios booting without a rom drive connection. I mean that's
 really odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick update, I wasn't exactly sure what they meant in the other thread about editing the registry. And the Registry entry looked fine, so I've chosen not to mess with it at this time. I'm going to settle on trying to use an external rom drive via USB port
 and see if that will work for now. However, after further thinking on the matter is it possible that windows has something screwy going on with the IDE stuff and it's thinking my rom is part of my hard drive and that's why I couldn't boot without power to
 it. And had a fatal error when it was completely disconnected? Because I should note that both my hard drive and the rom drive are IDE. Hard drive is master rom is the slave.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I am getting one error at the time of sending the fax.</p>

<p>I am getting this error in the below line.</p>
<p>JobId = FaxDoc.ConnectedSubmit(FaxServer)</p>
<p>Is this because of not capturing the Fax server details?&nbsp; If yes, is there any option to get the fax server details?</p>

To install the next build after 9926 be sure to install all Windows Updates</a></p>
<p>Like I read an article saying that a build has arrived after 9926. So I have installed all the updates and kept my install build setting to fast.</p>
<p>But how can I check or come to know that my pc has started download for new build.</p>

</p><p>There is no newer build released to the public.&nbsp; 9926 is the newest.&nbsp; Since updates are done automatically when a new build is released you will get it.&nbsp; If you want to get is sooner go into settings&gt;updates&gt;advanced&gt; and chose the "fast" branch</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error message that you received might be an issue with the email server. For us to identify the issue properly, let us perform some troubleshooting steps. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Optimize your browser, clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that this is not a browser issue.
</p>
<p>2. After that, you may access your email using a different web browser. &nbsp;<br />
3. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. You may also go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, add-ins etc. feature.<br />
<br />
Once done, please check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>

<p>The current version is one of the worst rewrites I have ever experienced. The current version is absolutely crap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this post.</p>
<p>The "new upgraded version" of Skype was a monumental screw-up, I couldn't see who was online, who my list of contacts were without clicking on an unnamed icon, and I couldn't even answer incoming calls.

            Note to all:&nbsp; per MS support rep, Skype Classic will cease to work on Sept. 1st, 2018. I had been using classic since the "new" version is so feature-poor and ill-designed. However, I tried to update to the 8.x version, but with that new version, Skype
 is unable to ring when someone calls my skype phone number. Ridiculous, I know. Support had me downgrade to classic again, hoping that by Sept 1st there will be a fix for the inability to receive skype phone # calls. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but not
 hopeful, and I don't know what I'll do if on Sept 1st I can't get skype calls inbound...I rely on that (and I&nbsp;pay for it!)

            I completely agree with the fact that the new version of Skype is crap. I cannot find a point where it is at least not worse than the classical version. It&nbsp; looks like it was made by the saboteurs who hate Microsoft and dream to destroy the company from
 inside. Otherwise I cannot explain&nbsp; how one can release such a crap in 2018. They have almost done since the link to the classic version has again disappeared from the Download page.

<h2>            Revise Date Format Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>I receive a spreadsheet every month with around 400 rows. Each row has a cell in it that has a date. The date is in the format of month/year which looks like X/XXXX or XX/XXXX.&nbsp;I would like to change each cell that has a date in it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Month/Day/Year or XX/XX/XXXX.
 The months that are 1 digit I would like a leading zero.</p>

    <title>Embedded Excel Links Very Slow To Update in PPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wphall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded Excel Links Very Slow To Update in PPT</h2>
                    <p>I have had this problem for a very long time, but am now at the point where Embedding office data has become almost useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>- Embedded linked charts from Excel into PPT is painfully slow to update since going from Office 2003 to 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup:</p>
<p>- Office is totally updated with the latest versions of office 2013</p>
<p>- Computer is an i7 with 8GB of ram on a high end SSD running Windows 7 (with all updates)</p>
<p>- System is very very clean with very minimal overhead and nothing but office is running</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenarios:</p>
<p>- The fastest solution is this: If the Excel chart source is in XLS format into a PPT format... All within Office 2013. Significant different if the source XLS file is open- Much "faster"</p>
<p>- Slowest scenario: XLSX to PPTX with XLSX file closed (its basically unusable... I'll leave for lunch and its still updating when I get back)</p>
<p>- ~50 standard charts are updating</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test case, running the same files on the same system (different drive, but same specs) office 2003 updates the data in 15 seconds, Office 2013 takes about ~4 minutes... everything is exactly the same... same file, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips, tricks, or thoughts or is this just the new norm with the new office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Again-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the clean boot and its slightly faster, not a ton, just a little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also went onto a different computer with the same files, but using office 2003... WAY faster, I mean like seconds vs minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just might be a modern office thing since switching over to XML. By no means is this a show stopper, its just annoying knowing its so much faster on old versions.</p>
<p>

            Older versions of Office are definitely faster. When I'm writing, I still use Word 2000 because I don't need much formatting, just quick response. It delivers!

            Sounds like you need to allow the website in PopUp Blocker. Go to internet Options, click on the Privacy tab, then click on settings next to Pop-Up Blocker. Once there, type in the following www.yahoo.com* and press enter or add. Close IE and then relaunch
 and try again.

            Do you have two email accounts in your profile? If your work account is not hosted in office 365 but you have an office 365 account in the profile and are using it‚Äôs calendar, meetings will be sent from the office 365 address. 
<br />
<br />If your work account is hosted on office 365, your admin needs to properly configure the from addresses.

            This may need to be reviewed within the Office 365 Admin center - specifically what your primary and secondary SMTPs are listed as, in addition to autodiscover settings in the local Outlook profile.<br /><br />Do you have admin access to portal.office.com?

            Hello my name is Yohandi
<br />
<br />It is a pleasure to have your participation in the Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />If you have an Office 365 account for companies with a vanity domain and you have access to the administration center what you should do is the following.
<br />
<br />1- Enter the Office 365 portal with your administrator user (http: portal.office.com)
<br />2- Go to the administration center&gt; active users.
<br />3- In active users look for your user&gt; click on it.
<br />4- In the new window that opens&gt; Username / Email Aliases&gt; Edit.
<br />5- Establish your company's email address as the main one.
<br />
<br />If you do not have access to the Office 365 Administration center, contact the office manager of your company or organization.
<br />
<br />By setting your email address as the main one you can send emails and create calendar events with this email address.
<br />
<br />I wish you an excellent day! ;)
<br />
<br />I hope it works for you       
        </p>

<p>Hi Alan Occhiuti,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the post. For my understanding, you cannot find your work email address in the From list and it‚Äôs only available to use the initial .onmicrosoft.com email address. For better understanding, I‚Äôd like to confirm some information in order to provide
 better workarounds.<br />
</p>
<p>1. What‚Äôs your Office 365 subscription plan?<br />
2. Does your account have alias or proxy email address?<br />
3. Do you configure two Office 365 accounts in your Outlook?<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is only one account in your Outlook client. You can follow the steps below to verify if the account use the .onmicrosoft.com address as the primary address (<strong>SMTP</strong>).<br />
</p>
<p>1. You can open <strong>Address Book</strong> and type your display name of your account in search bar. Then double click your account and navigate to
<strong>Email Addresses</strong> to check if you have both primary address (<strong>SMTP</strong>) and proxy address (<strong>smtp</strong>).<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa7f02a5-da10-4233-bd29-965cb73f7ee7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa7f02a5-da10-4233-bd29-965cb73f7ee7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If your <strong>SMTP </strong>use the address with .onmicrosoft.com, please contact your admin to change your
<strong>SMTP </strong>address to your work email address. Here is the reference link
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123794(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123794(v=exchg.160).aspx</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And if you have configured two accounts in Outlook. Please try the following steps to change your default email account.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Open Outlook client and navigate to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Account Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Account Settings</strong>.<br />
2. In the account list, select your work account and <strong>Set as Default</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please tell me the details about your account configuration and make screenshots of it, then send to me via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marvin<br />

    <title>Chaotic device password dialogue on WM6.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterjuuls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chaotic device password dialogue on WM6.5</h2>
                    My default Exchange 2007 SP1 ActiveSync policy requires device passwords and it works fine on WM6.1 devices.<br />
Last week I connected my first HTC Touch Pro2 WM6.5 mobile to Exchange and the ActiveSync policy was enforced onto the device. The result was a chaotic password dialogue when I restarted the device, and it seems to repeat itself each time I restart the mobile.
 A prompt for simcard pincode, mixed with several device password pop-up prompts and a set-up-your-first-device-password wizard. When I finally get passed all these prompts, the device works okay. But the next time I switch the device on, this chaotic dialogue
 starts all over. (I've entered only passwords, that meet the password requirements in the ActiveSync policy)&nbsp; If I wipe the device and remove the requirement for a device password in the Active Sync policy, the problem disappears. If I wipe the device without
 setting up a connection to Exchange, the problems disappears<br />
<br />
How can I enforce a device password via ActiveSync policies and avoid this annoying password dialogue?<br />
Is this a device issue? Or a server issue? Would Exchange 2007 SP2 do any good?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Best regards<br />
Peter. <br />

            Eric, thanks for your posting.<br />
<br />
Devices in my setup connect "over-the-air only", ie. all devices dial up via a GPRS/3G modem-connection to the ISP. Other device connection options, like WiFi or cable or infra-red, are disabled or blocked by the ActiveSync security policy. So, the only permitted
 communications on devices are the modem-connection to the ISP and a Bluetooth connection to a head set. The setup is strict, to protect devices from any kind of security threats, but the setup works fine with WM6.1 and WM5.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you confirm, that SP2 is irrelevant in this matter.<br />
<br />
The ActiveSync policy requires a simple password, 8 characters long (to permit users an 8-digit pincode). I tried setting up another policy, that requires a complex password, and it had no impact on the symptoms. What helps is disabling the password requirement
 completely.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Peter
