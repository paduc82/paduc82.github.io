    <title>Permission Problems after Windows 10 Upgrade from Windows 7 Home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Permission Problems after Windows 10 Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;successfully upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 10 from Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I did witness some error messages flashing up during the upgrade, but the upgrade continued and completed without apparent incident and without action on my part.&nbsp; It is generally running
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with several other posts on the forum, I&nbsp;have lost a lot of administrator access rights. The upgrade asked me to use my Microsoft Account in the setup process, which I did.&nbsp; This Microsoft Account was NOT set up to access&nbsp;my&nbsp;PC with Windows 7 and I had
 no issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 I cannot start iTunes, Windows Defender and several other applications without doing a
<strong>Run As Administrator </strong>step, even though permissions are set with full admin access for the Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Several of the new apps just flash&nbsp;up and then do nothing, most likely because permissions are not correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot activate hyperlinks in e-mails, nor can I attach documents or photos in emails using either the Microsoft mail app or&nbsp;as logged on natively using a&nbsp;Microsoft Edge web page.&nbsp; I use AOL email, not Outlook.&nbsp; The email program just hangs and I must
 end it in Task Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike others in the forum, I DO have read/write access to my&nbsp;system folders and files.&nbsp; I have never used OneDrive and perhaps this is why?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC / SCANNOW&nbsp;without issues.&nbsp; I used to run McAfee and it was live as I installed the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, I&nbsp;uninstalled it and activated Windows Defender.&nbsp; Windows Defender, with a FULL&nbsp;scan, identified an OBFUSCATE file in JAVA,
 which I removed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is a Microsoft fix for these permissions issues short of the nuclear "start all over" option.&nbsp; Clearly many people are experiencing some flavor of this issue in the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update on 08/11/15:&nbsp; After a 7 hour callback wait for Microsoft Customer Support, I spoke with a representative who basically answered none of my questions.&nbsp; There were plenty of diversionary tactics, like "go to&nbsp;Apple for iTunes, go to Canon for your printer
 not functioning, we don't support that, etc."&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't get the point that there&nbsp;are no problems with iTunes in Windows 10, just that I cannot open it normally, and must "Run as Administrator" even though I'm already with full&nbsp;Administrator privileges.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The same thing happens trying to open Windows Defender, so it's not specific to Apple or other manufacturers, rather it's a Windows bug.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've learned&nbsp;that my only hope is to wait for Microsoft to deliver some&nbsp;kind of fix to these permission problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, Microsoft Edge has a severe problem in that it won't launch&nbsp;anything that requires a dialog window, such as a File Explorer window to save a download, or a File Explorer window to browse for photo or document attachments.&nbsp; It won't properly&nbsp;send&nbsp;requested
 pages to the printer either.&nbsp; I've proved that the printer works properly by printing a Windows Printer Test Page from the Device Settings dialog boxes.&nbsp; I HAVE found a workaround to this mess for now and that is to log on to Internet Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as with
 the other programs, it won't launch unless I right click and "Run as&nbsp;Administrator" but once there I can&nbsp;do attachments, hyperlinks and printouts to my hearts content.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a mess this Windows 10 Upgrade has been!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for giving me an option to try.&nbsp; Unfortunately it did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; Here is what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) When I performed the action on the entry with Administrators to grant full access, there were several errors flashing up saying "Failed to enumerate objects in the container.&nbsp; Access denied."&nbsp; for C:\Users, C:\Program Data, C:\Program Files, C:\Program
 Files(x86) etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; This may have prevented me from gaining access I need.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you work around that?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When I go to the security tab&nbsp;for C:\Program Files folder, for example, the Administrators has Special Permissions checked.&nbsp; When I go to Advanced properties, the Administrators has Full control listed, so I don't know what else to do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume the Microsoft Account that I use to sign on is using Administrators as the appropriate security user, since it supposedly has administrator privileges.&nbsp; Or, is it using the Authenticated Users user privileges?&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, they both are listed with
 Full Control.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am still assuming something behind the scenes went bad when I allowed the Microsoft Account to be the primary account when upgrading from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>After several missed attempts at callback (after level 1 typed my phone number incorrectly), the Level 2 technician spent hours and hours over two days trying&nbsp;Tweaking.com - Windows Repair v3.5.1 software,&nbsp; which didn't solve anything, followed by re-downloading
 the entire Windows 10 update and running it&nbsp;to completion, AGAIN without&nbsp;solving a single one of these&nbsp;issues.&nbsp; I have now asked for another technician with more skill in this area.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I truly wonder what it takes for Microsoft to admit it has a program bug(s)&nbsp;enough to open a problem record with their development group.&nbsp; I understand that you have to try all the obvious things first, but they've been tried and nothing to date has fixed
 a single one of these permissions issues.&nbsp; Not the least bit encouraging.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro and Type Cover 2 Keyboard - Touchpad issues&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro and Type Cover 2 Keyboard - Touchpad issues&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a first generation Surface Pro here with the Type Cover 2 keyboard (from a Surface Pro 2? I don't know I got given it!) The keyboard and backlight works fine but what often doesn't work is the mouse/touchpad. Sometimes it's fine but often the cursor
 will randomly move across the screen and flicker a bit and then work normally when using the Surface with this keyboard (regardless if using the touchpad or a Bluetooth mouse).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the Pro before the Type Cover 2 and it was working fine with the original Type Cover (1?) it came with and I started having these issues with the Type Cover 2 attached, I did hear that there some firmware updates to patch this that could only be applied
 if you basically installed Windows with the keyboard you want to use attached, so I reinstalled Windows 8.1 (official ISO of Pro with Update x64) with the Type Cover 2 attached and downloaded all the Updates (including new firmware) from Windows Update and
 I am still having some issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous owner said the keyboard worked fine for him with the same Pro I am now using!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked on the internet and found a lot of people saying that often the keyboard buttons or the backlight doesn't work with this updated firmware but for me it's the mouse being weird and I've not come across that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the keyboard listed properly in Device Manager. Is there any driver software I can download and install myself?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this video is helpful: http://youtu.be/PFfroIrn0Qc&nbsp;I was literally tapping the touchpad when the mouse started moving all over the screen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all, much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p />

JasonBrown2K13</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.&nbsp; Sorry to hear you are having trouble with the Type Cover 2 on your Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, all Covers are compatible across all devices.&nbsp; (There are minor exceptions&nbsp;- Surface RT can not make use of the extra battery in the Power Cover, and not all features work if you put a V1or V2 Cover on Surface Pro 3)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention using an official ISO for reinstalling Windows.&nbsp; To confirm, this is the factory image that is available
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a>?&nbsp; Was your image created from a different source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not experiencing this when using the Type Cover 1, or with no Cover attached but using a USB/Bluetooth mouse?&nbsp; Is touch or pen use also affected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is interesting that this happens intermittently.&nbsp; Does this happen more if Surface is plugged in, in particular locations, near particular equipment or lamps, with specific accessories also attached, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can attempt to update, or uninstall(do not delete)&nbsp;the driver from Device Manager.&nbsp; Follow this by restarting Surface.&nbsp; This has addressed some Cover issues before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply! I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it was working with the Type Cover 1 and yes it works with no keyboard attached and a Bluetooth mouse (Sculpt Comfort Mouse) but even now and then even with the mouse connected the cursor can go a bit crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Touch and pen work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happens quite randomly on and off battery and in a variety of locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the January 2015 firmware update failed when I reinstalled Windows. I reinstalled Windows again and installed only the firmware update and again it failed. Now going to reinstall Windows again and try the 60 or so updates and then the firmware
 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidelines on how to install the January firmware would be great. This is what is stopping my keyboard from working correctly I think!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an image of 8.1 Pro w/Update x64 from Microsoft DreamSpark. Is the official factory recovery media for Windows 8 or 8.1?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the details.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend getting the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface image</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-refresh-or-reset-surface-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
resetting with it</a>&nbsp;and installing all updates.&nbsp; It is possible that you will have to update from 8.0 to 8.1&nbsp;as part of&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; This will help us narrow down what is happening.</p>

            <p>Hi John, just to give you an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the recovery image from the Microsoft site which installed 8 Pro. I installed a load of updates and some firmware (July 2014) - none of this made any difference to the touchpad issues I am having. Tried to upgrade to 8.1 via the Store and it
 failed because for some reason I only had 9GB free space and I was unable to remove the 10GB recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this machine working quickly so I am installing from my 8.1 Pro USB (retail) again and going to try that. Fingers crossed. I am taking this machine away with me on a school trip hence why I need it to work - I am taking a Bluetooth mouse with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will let you know if the firmware installs successfully this time around or not.</p>

            <p>Hello Jason</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you used the USB recovery media, were you given the option to remove all files and completely clean the drive?&nbsp; This would be the option you want, to get the maximum space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may get less than desired results from a retail version of Windows 8.1 with Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Hi John, sorry for the late reply (I have been away lately).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse is still acting a little temperamental even after I managed to manually install the drivers so I am getting my black Type Cover 1 back today hopefully. It's a shame because I like the blue keyboard but it seems like a lot of effort to get a keyboard
 working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time though! Much appreciated!</p>

<h2>            No Internet Connection After Windows 7 Reinstall Using Recovery Disc&#63;</h2>
                    After reinstalling Windows 7 using the Windows 7 SP1&nbsp;factory recovery disc the laptop will not connect to the internet via both ethernet or wireless.&nbsp; In device manager there are esclamation marks next to Ethernet Controller etc&nbsp;and a red cross on the
 internet connection icon etc?. There is no problem with the router as other laptops connect.

    <title>Xbox account password and email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slumchum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox account password and email address</h2>
                    
<p>ok long story short because this website is terrible and i've already typed and posted the entire this twice and each time it came up with the stupid "oops you found a glitch" page when i tried to post it and apparently copy and paste wont work on this site
 either.</p>
<p>I dont know my email address password, I cant recover it in any shape or form as when i made it i was young and didn't want to give out any personal details so i lied and dont know enough of the email addresses details to even get past the automated "you
 failed to recover your account, please give more correct details"</p>
<p>is there anyway to change the email address linked to my account without needing to put in the password or is there any of the xbox live community employees that can do so for me? it wasn't a problem until a few days ago when they started a new security
 prompt when you try to log into live you have to put in the email address password (probably just a one off thing but as i cant even put it in correctly once it doesnt matter)which i cannot do so currently i am paying for live that i'm not allowed to use.</p>
<p>any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>David</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>unfortunately there is no way to change the email connected to your xbox live account without the password.</p>
<p>So the only option you have is the reset the password to be able to do the switch.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The best (and only) thing to do is to try and contact Microsoft Support since this is a Microsoft Account issue.</p>
<p>Since you already tried recovering the account I advise to follow the steps that should be mentioned in the response email like stated here </p>
<p>"</p>
<p>If you're still not able to reset your password after you've completed the online account recovery form, try the following:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Check your spam or junk folder to see if any of the account recovery emails are there.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;If you received an email indicating that the information you provided was not sufficient, follow the instructions in the email to resubmit to form. Be sure to use the tips above to help you complete the form.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>which can be found on the support page: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../forgot-microsoft-account-password</a> </p>

                    why the system show RAM: 4GB (2.96GB useble)?&nbsp; I installed a 64 bit win 7. I'm using a HP laptop and win 7 RC 7100 version.<br />
I'm sure its a 64 bit version and it works well before. But today, when I checked the "system" option, I found that it said RAM: 4GB (2.96GB usable)<br />
<br />
That's very weird!

            Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update to recognize all 4 GBs of RAM in Windows 7. Also, if you are using integrated graphics, some of your memory might be allocated for video ram.

<h2>            WHITE SCREEN</h2>
                    <p>once again Microsoft and Xbox have failed to solve the white screen problem you would think that the amount of complaints they have had about the white screen you would think they would get the problem solved but this is week two that I have tried to play but to no avail the same crap comes up instead of the usual adverts I can only assume that they don't want any body to play the games going to give to the end of the week and if its not fixed by Monday I will take it of my computer so pull the finger out and bloody fix it</p>

    <title>Need Help With Video On External Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saberman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help With Video On External Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Surface Pro 2</p>
<p>Surface Pro 2&nbsp;Docking Station</p>
<p>KVM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a SartTech.com Mini DisplayP ...to VGA Video Adapter to connect the Surface Pro 2 Docking Station to my KVM which is connected to an ASUS monitor with a top resolution of 1920x1200.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1920x1200 is not available as a resolution in the drop down list.&nbsp; The closest choices are:<br />
2048x1152</p>
<p>1920x1080</p>
<p>I set it to 1920x1080 but Windows tells me that is not the optimal resolution for my viewing experience.&nbsp; At that resolution I have to set the scaling to 100% Vertical and 80% horizontal to line up the entire screen image with the edges of the monitor.&nbsp;
 If I try 2048 x 1152 large areas of the screen image are outside the viewport.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the Surface to support 1920 x 1200 on my external monitor?</p>
<p>

            Hi saberman,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting us regarding the resolution of your external monitor. I would like to help you.<br />
When you use other monitors, do you still have the same issue or can you adjust the resolution on other monitors?<br />
<br />
Please let us know.<br />
<br />
Best Regards

            I only have one external monitor connected throug a KVM switch.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;four other computers that are occassionally connected to the KVM -- two laptops via a shared docking station and two desktops.&nbsp; All four of these report the correct resolution for
 the monitor -- 1920x1200.

            Hi saberman,<br />
<br />
Try connecting your Surface directly to the monitor to see if it works, so that we can pinpoint the issue.<br />
Also, in regards to the monitor resolutions, are you extending the display to the second monitor, or are you duplicating?<br />
Let us know what you find.

            Hi saberman,<br />
<br />
In order to directly connect the Surface with an external monitor, you would need an adaptor.<br />
We can only guarantee that Microsoft adapters will work - although most 3rd party cables should work.<br />
Also, can you get the same resolution on the same monitor using other devices?

            <p>I received my Microsoft dvi to vga convertor.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the dvi end does not fit the dvi port on the Surface Pro 2 docking station nor the dvi port on the Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I ordered based on the invormation available in the Microsoft online store:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

</span></td>
<td><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">$52.79
</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For $52.79 I expected that it would at least plug in even if it didn't work.&nbsp; But it doesn't even plug in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have said before that, with the Surface devices, Microsoft did not shot themselves in the foot but they aimed hirer and shot themselves in both knees.&nbsp; It now appears that they aimed a little higher than that and
<span>
neutered </span>themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I would give the Surface Pro 2 two out of five&nbsp;stars and only becuase I can use VitualBox to run Windows 7 systems under it.&nbsp; As a standalone machine it lacks basic functionality.&nbsp; The metro version of IE does not support Siverlight and thus
 cannot be used with major web sites.&nbsp; It does not play standard movie videos (MPEG-2) without paying Microsft an additional fee and then that only works in desktop mode -- not on the Metro side which means it doesn't work in RT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have to assume that Microsoft's business plan doe not extend to retail users&nbsp;(as the missing video functionality indicates that) and does not extend to corporate users as the lack of a video cable indicates that the use of an external monitor
 is not really supported.</p>

            Thank you for the advice.&nbsp; Microsoft tech support and sales have helped to fix the problem. I found out that I had purchased the wrong product.&nbsp; I should have purchased Windows 8 Porpac, instead of Windows 8 PRO.

These files will run in Window Movie Maker.<br />

These files ill also run on another computer running XP in WMP.

Hello,<br />
<br />
I suggest you to install the codec for the Windows media player 11 by going to the link
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=06FCAAB7-DCC9-466B-B0C4-04DB144BB601&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
You can download these codec’s and if that does not help, you may search online using your favorite search engine to find a third party codec package.<br />
<br />
<strong>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER</strong>: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of

I go to download your noted version of WMP Codecs and I get the message "This version of Windows Media Player Codecs can be installed only on Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003."<br />
<br />
When I try to continue the install it then says "This Program is blocked due to compatibility issues."<br />

<p>Hi Pat,<br />
<br />
Download the <strong>Hot fix</strong> from the link “FIX: Windows Media Player 11 cannot play WMV files that contain multiple video streams”&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947403</a>
<br />
<br />
After you apply this hotfix, Windows Media Player detects the number of streams in the video file. If the video file contains more than one stream, Windows Media Player uses the Windows Media Format SDK instead of Media Foundation to play the video file.</p>
<p>Multi-bitrate (MBR) videos are videos that contain multiple video streams in the Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) file container. In the ASF header, the multiple streams are differentiated by using a mutual exclusion list. Therefore, only one video stream
 is played at a time. This configuration enables Windows Media Player to choose the best video stream to play based on the bitrate of the connection between a client and a server.<br />

            Diana,<br />
<br />
I think you are on the right path here because the symptoms desribed seem roughly what I am experiencing, but I am unable to install the specified download.&nbsp; I can download it to my computer ok, but when I go to do the install, I get a dialog box titled "Windows
 Update Standalone Installer" and it says "Searching for updates."&nbsp; After a few seconds of searching, it says "Seach has been completed."&nbsp; Then another dialog box (same title) opens up that says "That update does not apply to your system."&nbsp; I am running the
 32 bit version of Vista, and that version is what I downloaded.&nbsp; (I tried the 64 bit version too, just for fun, but I got the same result.)<br />
<br />
Any more hints?<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />
<br />
Pat<br />

            Dear Diana D,<br />
<br />
Your hotfix definitely does <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> apply to Vista. How about getting real and admitting what everyone on the Internet, including Al Gore, knows: there is no fix for playing .asf audio or video files in Windows Media
 Player in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Vista</span>. PERIOD.

This .asf issue has been frustrating, especially since MS invented the extension.&nbsp; Is it true that this is a Vista issue for all of us?

    <title>Erroneous DLL file called during cold start boot &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markkellogg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erroneous DLL file called during cold start boot &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer is calling a printer related WIndows 10 DLL file during cold start boot.&nbsp; The file is part of the Windows 10 OS, and is this file name:&nbsp; CMSCC~1.DLL.&nbsp; This file is related to my wireless printer, but reinstalling the printer software does not
 resolve the issue.&nbsp; The issue remains after doing that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the file causes a different message "File not found" and the wireless connectivity of the printer stops working when that is done.&nbsp; Putting the file back into the location results in a different "invalid W32 file" message.&nbsp; Is there a way to resolve
 this start up error message so that boot up returns to a smooth boot without this error message?&nbsp; I have talked with the printer support technical support people and they said this is a problem with Windows 10 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>

<br />Are you seeing "[filename] is not a valid Win32 application" errors?

<p>This is a problem that has been around for around 2 or 3 months, and certainly prior to the Fall Creators update.&nbsp; And yes, I am seeing [filename] is not a valid Win32 application error.&nbsp; Removing the file from the current location results in "filename not
 found" as though the OS is looking for the file during boot.&nbsp; Removing the file also kills the wireless communications with the printer.&nbsp; Put the file back into the location, and I get the not valid error message again.&nbsp; Reinstall of the printer software does
 not fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows version is Version 1709, OS Build 16299.64.</p>

            "[filename] is not a valid Win32 application" errors usually suggest an ongoing infection of some kind. That being said...
<br />
<br />Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />
<br />4a. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application (i.e., not Windows Defender) might be installed?
<br />
<br />4b. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. Did you choose to install the Fall Creators Update manually or was it offered AND INSTALLED via Windows Update?
<br />

            1. When does your current Webroot subscription expire?
<br />
<br />2. In File Explorer [WinKey+E], navigate to &amp; right-click on: 
<br />
<br />. • C:\Program Files\Webroot  &lt;=this folder

<br />3. Did Best Buy's Geek Squad sell you &amp; install the Webroot application?
<br />
<br />4. When &amp; why was MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware (MBAM) installed? Is it MBAM Premium v3.x (free-trial), MBAM Premium v2.x, or MBAM Free? Has MBAM ever detected &amp; quarantined anything since it's been installed?
<br />
<br />5. When did you purchase &lt;cringe&gt; FixMeStick?
<br />
<br />6. Do you have backups of all the changes FixMeStick has ever made to the computer?
<br />
<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />Chances are (99.99%) your ASUS computer came with a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.
<br /> 
<br />Fact: Norton and McAfee applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.
<br />
<br />Fact: Best Buy's Geek Squad are even more notorious for not fully-removing such free-trialware before they install Webroot applications.
<br />
<br />Fact: Over the years we've learned that sometimes it's too late for the Norton and/or McAfee removal tools to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times.

<p>1.&nbsp; 342 days from today (11/26/2017)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Wednesday, ‎August ‎17, ‎2016, ‏‎5:39:59 PM</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No they did not install it.&nbsp; I purchased 2 year software from Best Buy and installed it myself.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; MWB was installed to add additional focus on better security than that provided by Webroot.&nbsp; MWB Premium version is 3.3.1.&nbsp; Yes, it has detected some suspcious websites and stopped navigation at that point.&nbsp; I believe (trusting my memory on this) that
 it has found malware and quarantined it, however I always delete the quarantine contents when that has happened for any security programs that I am running.&nbsp; I do not keep that on this computer.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I purchased FixMeStick several years ago (5 years???) and have used it usually one time per week.&nbsp; I don't know if FMS created any backups prior to running.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I have a lot of backups from a purchased backup software tool (Acronis).&nbsp; I don't know of any backups from FixMeStick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading your latest reply this morning, I searched the computer using file explorer and found files for both McAfee and Norton.&nbsp; For McAfee it was "livesafe", and for Norton, it was just an installer which is apparently on the computer somewhere.&nbsp;
 I will try the removal tools from both companies later today, but I have company here this morning, so it may be late tonight before I can do that.&nbsp; It is worth a try, IF that is what is causing the erroneous DLL call.&nbsp; I may get to reinstall webroot if that
 is affected by the removal tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your help.&nbsp; I will reply when all that gets done with the removal tools and let you know what happens.</p>

            ACTIONS (after your company has departed):
<br />
<br />1. Download (but do not Run) the Norton Remove and Reinstall tool, saving it to your desktop for convenience =&gt; <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v60392881_EndUserProfile_en_us?src=nrnr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/curren...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Download (but do not Run) the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop for convenience =&gt; <a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcp...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall the Webroot application (temporarily) &amp; reboot.
<br />
<br />4. Make CERTAIN that Windows Defender &amp; Windows Firewall are both enabled &amp; working properly. [Should happen automatically but I want you to double-check.]
<br />
<br />5. Run the Norton utility (#1 above), selecting the REMOVE option then restart the computer. [There shouldn't be a REMOVE AND REINSTALL option - but if there is one, DON'T use it!]
<br />
<br />6. Right-click on the file you saved in #2 above and select RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR to run the utility - then restart the computer again. [Ignore the log.]
<br />
<br />6. For good measure, reset Windows Update [1] using the script (BAT file) in this tutorial =&gt; <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset-windows-update-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset...</a>
<br />
<br />7. Reboot once more and test computer &amp; (wireless) printer functionality. Please do not reinstall the Webroot application just yet.
<br />
<br />8. Reply to this post with a status report. If one or more recent MBAM Scan (not Application) logs are available, please post same in your reply, too. Thank you.
<br />
<br />GOOD LUCK!

<p>Well, I followed your instructions.&nbsp; Net result, no change in the DLL file call error during restart.&nbsp; It still shows up during powered restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I ran the Norton tool (first two times actually), it bombed out and reported the error to Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third time I ran it, it completed successfully.&nbsp; I then restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran the McAfee tool as admin, and that worked okay.&nbsp; I ran it once as an individual, and the next time as administrator.&nbsp; Successful completion both times.&nbsp; I then restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset of the update went okay. with no problems reported.&nbsp; Test of the printer wireless function worked fine when it printed the test page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did uninstall webroot and MWB prior to starting this process.&nbsp; Also, my VPN was turned off prior to starting.&nbsp; Defender is working and the defender firewall is working.&nbsp; Since MWB is no longer on the computer, it is not possible to send you the log files
 since they no longer exist due to uninstall of MWB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So....the dll file call is still there.&nbsp; Your thoughts?&nbsp; Should I reinstall Webroot at this time?&nbsp; I can live with the DLL error.....if I have to.</p>

            I'd reinstall the printer before I'd reinstall Webroot. And I'd see if the behavior persisted when the printer was connected directly to the computer-in-question (vs. wirelessly on your LAN). In fact, you might try that first as it would rule out many possible troublemakers (e.g., your router/modem),

<h3> gxdata  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there an app that I can use to read .MSG attachments&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Mail on an Asus Transformer Windows 10&nbsp;Home machine, 32-bit. It comes with Microsoft Office Home and Student 2013, 32-bit - which doesn't have Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received an email with an attachment. .msg - which is the standard, default file format which Outlook 2013 saves to disk (or uses when an email is sent as an attachment).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ask Mail to open this, it believes it is an .eml file attachment, and sends me to look at the Windows Store for an appropriate app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this being a nonsense lack of integration between Windows versions and Office versions, [<strong>EDIT]
</strong>I&nbsp;did find a solution. to that initial problem </p>
<p>I chose to install Crafty EML Viewer, and it does show the .MSG file OK so I guess that's the only solution I can expect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this&nbsp;small free app <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">isn't a PreviewHandler for Windows Explorer / File Explorer
</span>in the Windows shell, so I can't Preview files saved to disk in any way that I can discover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving attached emails is a common practice (not just mine), so it's important to be able to browse with File Explorer (Windows 8/10) or Windows Explorer as it used to be known, and preview these .msg / .eml file (it seems they're the same format).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is tangential to the Mail / Outlook Mail "topic", but maybe someone can direct me to an answer? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 items on wifi and they work fine. The Xbox One S has had this issue since i first bought it. Is this a corrupted system?</p>

            Are you the Administrator of the machine?<br />
<br />
Do you have permissions to the "userappdata"&nbsp;folder? <br />
<br />
Lets make sure you have permissions to that folder. In order to do the following steps you MUST be the Administrator of the machine.<br />
<br />
Since the&nbsp;"Appdata" folder is a hidden folder, you have to set it to show. Below are the instructions for showing hidden folders:<br />
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. </td>
<td>
<p>Open Folder Options by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button, clicking <b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>Appearance and Personalization</b>, and then clicking
<b>Folder Options</b>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. </td>
<td>
<p>Click the <b>View</b> tab.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. </td>
<td>
<p>Under <b>Advanced settings</b>, click
<b>Show hidden files and folders</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Now lets make sure you have the correct permissions to the folder<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Changing Folder Permissions</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Right Click on the Folder you wish to restrict properties on </li><li>Select “Properties” </li><li>In the Properties window go to the Security tab and click on Edit. </li><li>If the&nbsp;your user account is not on the list of users or groups that have permissions defined, you should click on Add. Now you need to type the user name or the group of users for which you want to change the permissions.
</li><li>After adding&nbsp;your account, Click Check Names and then click OK. </li><li>In the Security window, select the user/group you just added and then click in the first check box under&nbsp;Allow which is “Full Control” and then click OK.</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Blue Screens and more. &#91;Please help, urgent&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screens and more. &#91;Please help, urgent&#93;</h2>
                    <p>I'm only 15 and I'm fairly stupid so please try to keep answers straightforward and simple. Complexity will just confuse and frustrate me, sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had the same bluescreen since my dad built my PC (it's a gaming pc, and the parts for it were over $800 altogether). The error code is "Kernel Security Check Failure". Recently, on Discord, I had asked someone I know for help with my crashes
 and such. And so they "helped".. by helping me (i believe) redownloading windows 10 to replace my windows 10..? Anyway, that kind of screwed it up because I got 2 different types of crashes later on AND an error. I didn't get a picture of one of the crashes
 but it had said "Thread stuck in device driver". The below two pictures display one of the two new crashes I mentioned and the other picture is one of the error (I had gotten it upon logging in) which me and the person on Discord fixed.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcdn.discordapp.com%2fattachments%2f356140281881427970%2f364302533000167424%2f20171001_230414.jpg" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know what exactly to post or how to use this site properly (I think this may be the first question I've asked), so if you need any information about this like my components or whatever just tell me (but you may need to explain how to get it because
 I have no clue how to do almost anything on my PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading this and I hope you can help me out. This is getting in the way of everything and is just a major piss off. I've also had another error on Call of Duty World at War II (the free beta version on Steam) which prevented me from playing.
 It was something about the GPU device being suspended..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my PC runs Realm of The Mad God (browser game) really slowly thus rendering it basically unplayable because of the major amount of lag. My computer still lags on some games like Unturned and if I open a menu on Garry's Mod or CS:GO it lags. It lags on
 browser games and it lags rarely on Roblox but usually lags more on it when there's like a bunch of particles or fireflies. Anyway..</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix to these problems would be much appreciated and I will be forever grateful. Have a good day/night.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be caused by several factors. Device driver issues are probably the most common, but this can have diverse causes including bad sectors or other disk write issues, and problems with some corrupted system file. To help us identify the cause of this
 error, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say re-downloading Windows 10, did you mean to say you reset your computer and reinstalled Windows 10?</li><li>Can you provide us the exact error message you got?</li><li>Could upload the images again? You may check this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">thread</a></strong>

</p><p>As initial troubleshooting steps, we suggest that you use the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker</a></strong>
 tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the System File Checker tool did not find any errors or did not resolved the issue, we recommend starting your computer in a clean boot state.
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">A clean boot</a></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur

            Also,&nbsp;it&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>No we had to download windows 7 onto this from a disc because we built this PC. I got Windows 10 off the microsoft website and I just used a windows installer to redownload (I think it redownloaded it, anyway).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have. It was the same as picture one except it had said Stop Code: KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE</p>

            I don't know how to minidump or whatever you're talking about, as I mentioned I'm pretty stupid so you'll need to be kind of thorough and explain it, or at least put it more simply (sorry).

<p>OK, can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First copy the minidump files to a folder on the Desktop this way: <br />
<br />
First, create a folder on the Desktop and call it Minidumps <br />
<br />
Then open the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and do the following: <br />
<br />
Home &gt; Select all &gt; Home &gt; Copy to &gt; Choose location &gt; Minidumps &gt; Copy <br />
<br />
Then right-click the Minidumps folder &gt; Send to &gt; Compressed (zipped) folder <br />
<br />
Then upload the newly created compressed (zipped) folder to OneDrive or similar site and then provide a link here.
<br />
<br />
If you are using OneDrive make sure the minidump files are in a "public folder" "shared with everyone":
<br />
<br />
Right-click the zipped minidump files &gt; Share &gt; with "Allow editing" "checked" click "get a link" then click "Copy"
<br />
<br />
Then paste the link here. </p>

<p>The minidump files did not show a third party driver as the cause of the crash however the errors may be related to the graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to uninstall and reinstall the AMD&nbsp;graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest to consider updating the motherboard BIOS as the motherboard may need the latest BIOS update to be fully compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your Dad built the computer ash him to consider doing the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rarely a failed BIOS update can result in hardware failure so back up critical files before updating the BIOS.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand your concern, however I suggest you to perform a clean boot and reinstall the DirectX again. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You
 need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>( I have no problem with run games and graphical softwares but its not normal )</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>Nishol Chetty,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Make sure system restore is turned on, follow the steps below:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To turn System Restore on:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Open System by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking System.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the left pane, click
<strong>System Protection.</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To turn on System Protection for a hard disk, select the check box next to the disk, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure the services related to system restore are started and set to automatic, to do this, follow the steps below:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Volume shadow copy, Multimedia Class Scheduler, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), DCOM Server Process Launcher, Plug and Play.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please follow the instructions below and set all of the above services to Automatic.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the start button, and in the search box type in: Services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press 'Enter' to open Services window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Find related services list above, and check the <strong>Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>The system file checker (SFC) utility allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find
 any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a SFC scan on the windows vista computer. To run a SFC scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area
 and then click on run as administrator. </span></p>
<p><span>b. at the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>USB&#47;RS232 Bridge gives Blue Screen. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB&#47;RS232 Bridge gives Blue Screen.</h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;USB/RS232 Bridge gives BSOD.</p>
<p>I have a RS232/USB bridge with PROLIFIC drivers that worked fine in XP SP3. It now gives me the blue screen of death after about 3-5 minutes when run as admin. If I run in regular user mode then it locks my software up after nor more than 5 minutes. I then
 purchased a new bridge that uses FTDI drivers but it still locks up. No more BSOD either as admin or user but locks the program up. This is the text from Windows.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My best guess is that neither is Windows 7 compatible even if they claim they are. Often makers<br />
will release a product/program intending to fix any issues upon customer complaint. Check with<br />
the maker of the newer one for updates.&nbsp;Remove both sets of drivers and then try the new one<br />
(after checking for updates with makers for new drivers). Isn't the older Prolific model a 1.1<br />
device anyway? Be sure to reboot after removing the drivers before trying new ones.</p>
<p>Here are several methods to remove drivers.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />

<br />
Make sure all the drivers for those have been removed.<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;a real computer shop to get a product that will work out of the box.</p>
<p>This one has Windows 7 drivers available at the site for download.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Canon MP980 multifunction printer works but scanner is not on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorge calado  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon MP980 multifunction printer works but scanner is not on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Canon MP980 multifunction driver for W10</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the installation of W10 on my Surface Pro3 my multifunction printer (Canon MP980) needed to reinstall the drivers. As Canon does not support W10 for this high-end printer (!!!), I reinstalled the driver for W 8.1.</p>
<p>Printer works fine, but the scanner does not work at all! The only message displayed says scanner is not connected (?), but printer works fine, so wireless connection is working correctly.
</p>
<p>Can someone help?</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>

<p><span>You might be facing the above issue due to the incompatible printer drivers installed on the computer. Presence of incompatible device drivers will result in irregular performance of the device

right-click</strong> on the device driver setup file on your PC and click on <strong>
Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the
<strong>compatibility </strong>tab, check the box <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>, select Windows&nbsp;10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done,
<strong>restart</strong> the computer for the effective changes to take place.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can also follow the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard and type <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the top most search result and follow from
<strong>step 2</strong> from the article </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Make older
 programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong></a><span> (Also applies to Windows 10).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Finally I had to uninstall the printer and reinstall it completely (drivers and software).</p>
<p>It is now working properly, even if Canon keeps saing that it is not compatible with Windows10.</p>
<p>The drivers are marked for Windows 8.1, but all functions are now working good.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>
